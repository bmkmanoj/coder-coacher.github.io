hiding back there
same urban I thought I would maybe
provide a little context for this talk
many of you know that starting last year
I began to teach a freshman level
seminar and this seminar I had to
concoct the name for this and it's
called president's leadership seminar
and I am happy that 27 students from my
class this year are actually in the
audience and a good number of students
from the same course last year are also
in the audience in this course we talked
about essentially two things we talked
about leadership and we talked about
technology and we talked about the
interactions between technology and
society and I invite a number of
speakers from outside the university to
come and give a talk and last year Tim
urban or speaker tonight was an invited
speaker to my class and I became an
experience person about Tim and his
ability to articulate his thoughts to an
audience and I decided based on that
experience to do things differently this
year so last year when he came to my
class I realized that half of my
students already knew him because he is
a celebrity in particular among younger
people and I was not aware of that and
then at the end of his lecture students
were so excited about what they had
heard that they all wanted to take a
group photo with him and then for many
weeks after his lecture I was getting
compliments for having invited the
speaker so this year I reached out to
Tim knowing that he's a busy person
asking asking him whether he would be
willing to repeat the same lecture and
he graciously agreed and this time being
a wiser man I decided that it is unwise
to limit the audience to only the
twenty-seven students that I have in
class but I decided to open it up to the
larger university community and in
particular
to the students so that is the context
so Tim Urban was going to be here to
give a lecture to my class but we've
decided to open it up the title of his
talk is Mars super intelligent
artificial intelligence and other not
normal things about the future so
essentially what it means I have given
him free rein in speaking about whatever
he feels like speaking about I'd like to
say a few words about Tim Tim is an
unbelievably successful blogger today
but I'll come back to it in a second
he graduated from Harvard in 2004 with a
degree in government he founded a
company that is now doing extremely well
the company is on autopilot and as a
result he doesn't spend most of his time
doesn't go to the company most of his
time goes to what he's really passionate
about and that's his blog the company is
a company that focuses on tutoring for
standard tests in particular SAT and a
CT it's a company that uses advanced
technology it uses pedagogy and it uses
neuroscience in order to enhance the
effectiveness of their of their teaching
the company is headquartered in Santa
Monica California they have a branch in
New York City they have an online
operation in 42 different countries the
company is thriving and as a result Tim
is able to divert his attention from the
company to something that he is really
passionate about
that's his blog and many of you might be
familiar with his blog it's called wait
what why how many of you have heard
about wait but impressive so wait why
receives about 1 million unique visitors
per month wait what why has become a
vehicle for Tim to express his views
about a whole host of topics on a
variety of issues that he considers
interesting they range from presidential
elections to
how the internal combustion engine works
- sending 1 million men to Mars two
driverless automobiles and two advances
in machine learning and artificial
intelligence
I am personally amazed with his ability
to understand extremely difficult issues
and to articulate them in very simple
ways and not necessarily succinct I know
that the younger generation has very
limited attention span but that doesn't
seem to apply to the way Tim writes his
blogs are long and detailed and yet
people love them he posts a blog and
within minutes you see hundreds of
people responding to what he's written
this is incredible he was invited to
give a TED talk some of you may have
seen his TED talk which was on yet a
different topic it was on
procrastination and his talk was given
in February and between February and
today he's received 8.5 million views on
his TED talk the most highly viewed TED
talk in 2016 he gets invited to places
like uber Facebook Google his articles
have been republished in places like the
Washington Post and the like so it is a
true pleasure to introduce to you Tim
bourbon I encourage you to fasten your
seat belts because he's put together a
very exciting and I think very
informative talk for you Tim could you
please come from hiding
I realized while he was started that
that I was if I'm standing here
everyone's gonna look at this even where
my expression is while he's like saying
compliments it was a nightmare so I like
got out quickly it would've been like a
terrible situation to be standing here
for so but thank you that was very nice
I'm honored to be back tech universities
are the best because everyone here is
like exactly as nerdy as I am and just
like it's like yeah you guys are just on
my page in a really fun way and dr. Farr
Vardhan said he gave me free rein and so
and he said that you know the topic was
Mars AI and other not normal things
about the future but then I started I
was like I'll do a little intro about
some of the stuff I do you know I'll put
in some some slides of a couple funny
things and a couple just things and
outside of the main topics I'm gonna get
into just to kind of introduce me and
what I do and then I kind of got out of
control with that part of it and so we
renamed it Mars AI and other not normal
things about everything I got to control
when I made the slide deck sorry dr.
Farr Vardhan this isn't your phone so
you guys are gonna have to live with
that now because this got out of control
and I kept being like you know I feel
like the Stevens students are gonna want
this also so we'll say so I'm just gonna
I'm gonna talk a little before I can get
into the the main stuff of just about um
about kind of you know some of the
different kinds of things that I write
on weibo I so it's just you know it's
all different kinds of of topics a lot
of tech and science topics but also just
a lot of things about the craziness of
humans we're all kind of insane
craziness of humanity and society like
when you have to go and meet someone and
and you're not sure whether that do a
handshake or a hug and then one of you
does one thing the other does the other
thing and it's a nightmare for everybody
it's like one of the worst parts of my
life or like when you're you're like
having fun with someone you're about to
leave and you had a good time you're
saying this was great let's do this
again sometime and then you kind of
realize you're walking the same
direction
nightmare I've written a lot about
relationships I think it's fascinating
white so a lot of people kind of get
into like bad marriages bad
relationships bad marriages and I like
to write about like this is part of the
insanity of being a human why we all
make such weird decisions when it comes
to who we end up with and and and to me
that's fascinating it's like part of
again you know why are we so smart and
also kind of kind of so not smart a lot
at a time and it to me it comes down to
the fact that we're we're our transition
species kind of like we kind of are if
you think about it like our six million
years ago you know we were great apes we
were living in trees we were animals you
know instant gratification you know we
just do what is easy and pleasurable in
the current moment we worry about our
survival and reproduction just basic
animal things and then we develop this
like prefrontal cortex that that isn't
in a whole different kind of level of
development that no other animal has and
we can like visualize the future and we
can be rational and so now we kind of
have this amazing magical ability to be
conscious and be rational but we're also
still it's like it's like this higher
being woke up inside of our head and
said oh I'm an animal because it's
weird it's just stuck in an animal and
it has to deal with all of the different
animal you know insecurities and needs
and tribal tendencies so I think it's
very interesting to write about that
kind of thing and and sometimes I think
you know part of what we need is just
awareness so I do something like this
like this is every week of a 90 year
life on one page
to make you feel anxious or something
and some people feel very inspired
looking at this it can be a lot of
things but that's every single week
that's it one of those things is this
week right now for you and so I think
visual tools can be helpful to help kind
of get us a little bit out of our
craziness I also sometimes write about
history I wrote about Iraq I tried to
you know get into why Iraq is such a
mess I tried to get into American
presidents including the the notorious
mustache era we actually from 1869 to
1913 we had 44 years of only mustaches
except for McKinley so this is not what
dr. Favre Arden had in mind when he
invited me here and here we are the
mustache era of the United States no but
I want to get into more this is me where
I got out of control we haven't even
started that part yet
I got it control when I realized that
you guys are like number Z all right and
so am i and we can like just I can do a
lot of like fun visual number Z graphics
that I don't feel like any of my friends
want to see and I'm gonna show all of
you instead so let's start with the
total wealth in the world right so if I
read estimates that if you just if you
if you take all of the wealth the
accumulated wealth both liquid and non
liquid in the world of humanity you end
up with two hundred and forty one
trillion so I stacked it in
hundred-dollar bills and it goes almost
a moon it's legit it's so that's $100
that's $100 bills stacked almost to the
moon but you know then I thought about
what if it's in gold so first of all
this is the amount of gold we've
actually mined
okay so 20 you know 20 meters cube it's
legit but if you take 241 trillion
dollars in gold we have a 63 meter cube
okay doesn't seem that crazy right and
if you divide that by 7.3 billion people
each person gets this much so that's the
average you mean well that's about
$4,000 worth in gold so then I use this
to look at income inequality like so the
the 10% the top 10% is not 86% of that
241 trillion so it kind of looks like
that and that's kind of like a visual
way to like understand what that's like
in fact the top 1% has about 50% so
about half of that is just that with the
richest guy on that left thing has has a
half of the total cube you look at this
also in jelly beans again this is a I've
been unsuccessful in showing people this
and so that's why you guys now have to
so just say we made every every 85
people in the world
we made a jelly bean for the 85 richest
people and then the next 85 richest
people on the next all the way down to
the bottom and we put it in the the the
poorer half of the jelly beans are in
this one and the richer Haffer and this
one well the reason I did it that way is
because the
just single jellybean in there equals
all the wealth of that one it's crazy
but the rich is 85 people in the world
equal the wealth of the three and a half
billion poorest people in the world so
yeah kind of sucks but that's a
situation and and then I get into kind
of you know more serious things like
well the two hundred forty one trillion
like how much pizza would that be and it
would actually cover at the New York
Domino's rate which is $19 for a large
pizza that would cover Indonesia air so
yeah here we are now moving on we'll get
to sour patch kids where one night I
decided I didn't have a post and I
needed to put something up so I decided
to go get some sour patch kids and I
made this I stacked it on my counter and
I couldn't even find the normal ones
okay what all these stores they didn't
have normal ones they had these like
these like neon tropical ones and and it
was like it was depressing I have like
an existential crisis looking at all of
them at the same time like about
humanity cuz like it was so clearly made
in like a vat these things they were so
low quality anyway so I stacked these
that's two layers of 50 okay and I used
this oh there's a hundred sour patch
kids but I wanted to illustrate huge
numbers in a way that you could kind of
remember so I use sour patch kids so
this is what a thousand of them would
look like on a table this would be a
million of them okay this would be a
billion of them in Fenway Park this is
what a trillion so this helps me now
when I think of a trillion I think of
that I'm like okay right a trillion is
like that's a huge number or trillion
like that's taller than most of the
skyscrapers and it's a three-dimensional
cube a quadrillion of them that's the
Burj Burj Kalifa and Dubai and the
Empire State Building we get to a
quintillion of them you would have
airplanes flying by you to see it right
there it's like well there's like that
thing there
and then you get to a sextillion of them
okay and now we're you know on top of
Switzerland switch listen the down
there septillion of them recovering
India so an octillion gets gets crazy
it's the size of the earth basically of
course at this point this would not be
like a clean cube it would have become
it might have something fusion might
have ignited on the inside it would
you'd have a suit of a full thing over
there and then finally we get to a non
alien and I never thought I would have a
reason to talk about a non alien but now
I did so there's the moon and the earth
and and so while I was doing cubes I
decided to well how much if I took a
cube and I put all the water in the
world in it how keep me with that cube
beat and this is where I ended up so it
would like be like that it would like be
on top of the US and you know it's big
but it's not crazy but that's all the
oceans of everything now the fresh water
would be that smaller cube and then look
at the little drinkable water on
Tennessee it's all mini because most of
the fresh water is in Antarctica and
Greenland in ice once you get down to
the rest of it most of that is in the
air or in the ground the amount that's
in rivers which you see over there on
North Carolina is tiny and rivers and
lakes and a tiny little thing so that's
the amount of drinkable water we have no
real point to this I just kind of think
it's cool let's get back to people so
7.3 billion humans right but there's
been estimates and this is one of those
hazy estimates different people say
different things but 108 or so billion
people have lived of course it's like
well when was the beginning of the human
race it's up for debate but that's a
ballpark a lot of people have come to
and so it's kind of crazy I think we
feel like human races been going on
forever one in 15 humans that have ever
lived is currently alive it's kind of a
lot in my opinion that seems like a lot
to me maybe some other people feel like
it I think it seems like a small amount
but it seems like a lot to me and so I
wanted to look at that number 7.3
billion in the same kind of way so I I
made rice a big thing of rice that's
about the size of a cube of rice you
have to have to have 7.3 billion green
so that's if every person had a grain of
rice you could fit them all in there and
then
I started looking at the distribution of
course we're not usually distributed
right so half more than half of the
people currently alive live in the red
zones okay and everyone else splits the
rest but if you wanted to live like we
do in Manhattan
okay the density of meant when you're in
Manhattan it doesn't feel crazy dense I
mean it is but like you're walking
around the street sometimes you're the
only one on the street like the Central
Park but if we all lived like that we
could fit everyone in New Zealand
whole human race in New Zealand so then
I got out of control okay and I said
okay well what if we were all standing
like this well then you could fit the
whole US and here in in a three and a
half mile square you could fit the whole
US that you could just kind of walk
around in five hours and then the whole
world you could fit in a 16 miles 17
miles square that you could actually
just walk around in one full day and
that would fit in the Gambia and the end
of it so the very end I always think the
Gambia is such a silly country like what
why are you the way you are and
in the very tip of it you could put a
square and fit all of us everyone and we
wouldn't be pleasant for anybody but you
could or you could also fit all of us in
New York City you could all of China
India and Japan and Queens
all of Africa South America and Oceania
in Brooklyn you could fit the whole US
and Canada and Mexico and all of Central
America in Manhattan so then I didn't
stop there and I said what if that this
is all two dimensions why are we
stopping here why don't we stack people
so when you do that we end up here at a
cubic building that's you know about a
cubic kilometer and again there's the
two buildings and there we all are we're
all in there having a bad time now you
can go one step further how can we go
one step further we've already made in
three dimensional well actually most of
us is empty space because we're atoms
and most of atoms are empty space right
just in fact here's a little tidbit that
exact cube one kilometer cubed okay
that's the size of a hydrogen atom the
nucleus is a sugar cube in the middle
that's tiny right the nucleus is nothing
so what have you condensed all humans
down to actually what we are the actual
physical matter that is making up the
human race could fit in an M&amp;amp;M so just
so you know we'd all be in there if I
had my way now
let's move from there and let's talk
about family so we have one of us right
but where do you come from
you come from some huge thing like this
okay now we think about this and I
always think it's crazy you know if you
go back you know two parents and four
great you know grandparents and eight
great grimmer you keep going up you very
quickly get to let's say you know this
would be about the Year 1800 and you go
out to the year 1800 there's a hundred
and twenty-eight people hanging out
doing their thing on earth that are all
your great great great great great
grandparents now some of them might they
don't know each other they don't know
that they're even if they do know each
other they have no idea they have
anything to do with each other in
someone else's family tree one of them
might have bought bread from the other
every Sunday they have no idea that
they're all on the top of your family
tree
okay now what if we go back to 1650 this
gets very weird okay you very quickly
have almost over 4,000 people in 1650
all of whom who are one 4,096 of you
that's just a weird weird concept to me
and if you keep going you have a problem
okay if you're gonna logarithmic scale
and you keep going back well you hit a
hundred billion that's not what you
can't do that
the world population going back in time
goes down so what's going on and the
answer is that people have sex with
their cousin a lot it's it turns out
hate to tell you but eighty percent of
all human births have become from second
cousins or closer so nibble on that one
for a while this is called this is
called pedigree collapse and so this is
what your family tree actually would
look like if you went back it would get
bigger and bigger bigger and then around
1200 the Year 1200 that's when it says
it's next and then that's when you'd
probably be it's as biggest tonight you
know sociologists scientists stay and
then from there it would kind of
collapse inwards meaning I bet you if
you went back to the your you know 1200
almost everyone in this room is probably
related somehow
in fact most if you're if you're of
someone that's of a similar kind of
ethnicity of you you're probably within
10th or 15th cousins
and the farthest two people on earth are
about 50th cousins that's the least
related you can be to someone is your
their 50th cousin so if you go the other
direction you're the patriarch or the
matriarch of this grand family tree okay
we go ahead to 2150 and there's one
hundred and hundreds of people out there
that your thing and this all makes us
feel really important but what you don't
think about is I the other way around
how about this one person here this girl
T Lea
she thinks she's important and you're
incredibly unimportant up there
you're not the grand patriarch of
anything you're one of her 128
irrelevant people up there and by the
way the person sitting next to you might
also be there's a very good chance and
in fact there's almost definite that
someone else in this room is on 128
person seventh row with you of someone
else in 2150 so this is what you came
for tonight this information now let's
go back in a different way okay so
here's you okay this is your dad
this is your great-great-grandfather if
you're a white Christian person and this
is your great to xx grandfather this is
probably was doing this isn't the 1300s
right let's keep going back because I
always think about this I mean if you
just it's not that many generation
before things get super weird so we go
back 500 generations we're at this guy
okay living his life we go back some
more 14,000 generations and we have
someone called y-chromosomal Adam this
is the estimate for the most recent
person that is the father of every
single that he's the common male
ancestor of every single human on earth
mitochondrial Eve is the most recent
common female ancestor of all of us and
they believe she's even more recent so
this is what we're doing fathers here so
this is mitochondrial Adam now he this
is actually far enough back that he's
probably not even quite a human yet he's
probably an unpleasant man I don't think
you would want to spend time with him
but he was like in that you know phase
were they're kind of close to being a
human cuz you know we've split from
chimps 6 million years ago the tribes
split and one side became humans one
side became chimps so 6 million years to
338 you know we're talking that's 5% of
the way back so we're he's probably
pretty close to human but not quite if
you go about halfway there you get this
guy okay so he's somewhere in the middle
like an Australopithecus also probably
an unpleasant person and you can go back
farther this is this is legit what your
great to the five hundred fifty thousand
grandfather looked like that was him
living his life six million years ago
okay if you keep going back you get to
this guy you were in a tree or a tree
rodent then you get to this guy now by
the way if there's a if there's a
Stevens Tech four whales out there and
they're doing this exact presentation
the whole presentations been different
so far until this slide they're also on
this slide because whatever their line
is all the whale fathers they get here
too okay
because the
at the Rhoden the early mammal rodent is
a common ancestor of all of all mammals
including whales dolphins ever etc okay
then we go back and we're now this guy
not this is again this is your ancestor
here and then we're this guy who's again
he's in the shed because he's it's not
good to be that this is talked about
transition species it's not good to be
the ones that had to deal with the first
ones out of water that couldn't have
been fun you go back and you're just a
full fish and then this guy and then
this dude that's your ancestor and then
this bored guy and then the complex cell
the first complex cell now this guy
invented sex so you have to give him
some credit but this was the first you
know these early cells with a nucleus
single-celled organisms but it was a
huge potential maybe you know a great
filter style leap to go from simple
cells to complex cells and then finally
you get to this guy simple cell bored
living his life and eventually you get
to the first yeah he has no parents he's
the first life he's just born and then
that's the situation so he's alone but
he we all have to thank him so now we
get here the beginning end of life now
we get to where I was gonna start this
presentation after I already decided to
extend it which is the Big Bang so we go
back even further this is I couldn't you
know I I can't explain the Big Bang that
well I'm sure some of you could but like
the Big Bang is not an easy things you
start actually trying to explain it it
gets very very hazy very quickly about
this singularity situation and it just
kind of opened and time begins and none
of that
so I depicted it instead for you and
what I want to do is I just brought us
back here through time I want to now
reverse and go all the way up back to
the present and we're gonna do it with a
series of timelines and this is all of
our purpose this is now to get you to
appreciate how anomalous both the three
things are the human race the last ten
thousand years of the human race within
that and the last 200 years of the human
race within the last ten
thousand so it's an anomaly in an
anomaly in an anomaly is what we
currently live in and we'll discuss why
so here's the universe scale right
that's the beginning of the Milky Way on
this scale these are all you know
accurate proportions on the timeline
okay the present should be I don't know
why it's over it should be over there at
the end okay so this is the beginning of
the Sun okay so the sun's we started the
Sun started in about the seventh inning
here from the beginning all right you
know some some incredibly hot cloud of
gas in the middle of the Milky Way from
some other group of supernova explosions
you know finally condensed into a
disking we have the Sun and then the
earth which looks like it's just oh the
earth came right after the Sun but that
little gap in time is the same distance
between the t-rex and us so still took a
while for the earth to get here after
the Sun was around then life starts so
it took about a billion years but then
we get to life okay
so life has been around for a while I
mean that's the Big Bang and life is
pretty big on that scale so now let's
just take the life part and extend it
out okay so we have three point six or
so billion years ago I mean 3.8 depends
on the estimate so you have the first
simple cells first complex cells
that's 1.6 billion years now this is one
of the reasons that you know I don't
know if you guys know what the great
filter is but it's just theory that some
people think we talked about the Fermi
paradox why we don't see aliens some
people think we may be alone in the
universe and other people think that's
crazy we couldn't be alone but there's
good arguments on both sides honestly at
this point I've heard so many good
argument I don't know what I think if
we're alone in the universe truly which
again it sounds crazy eric drexler of
you're heard of him
founder of nanotechnology really smart
people have been are convinced that we
are alone not just the only intelligent
life perhaps the only life at all but if
we're the only intelligent life there a
lot of people think there must be a
great filter there's some step to get
from nothingness to us
that is incredible freak incident to
happen so a freak that it's only
happened once and one great candidate
for the great filter is the jump from
simple cells to complex cells because
it's they scientists aren't exactly sure
how that could have happened it's just
so incredible did that happen now on the
other hand going from complex cells to
multi cell
life is not a candidate for the great
filter why because it's happened like 70
times on earth alone in our history this
has happened many many many times so
they know that that's not an unlikely
thing to happen once you do have complex
cells ok let me get to animals ok 600
million years ago so that's a lot of
green dark green before we even get to
animals that's just boring time to be on
earth
there's just bacteria in the ocean
essentially for that whole time okay you
wouldn't even noticed life here if you
were here but now we have this Cambrian
explosion we have all these animals
let's extend that and look at that okay
so the first animals we have the first
fish first land plants insects crashed
the party and ruin everything we have
the first reptiles then the reign of the
dinosaurs you got to give them some
credit a hundred and sixty-five million
years is an insane run given the we've
been around 4 point 1 million years
it's just they had a good time there and
then you have mammals started a little
bit after but it wasn't until the
dinosaurs were extinct advise droid that
pride that mammals were able to actually
flourish and become the boss around here
because they were always second-class
citizens when the dinosaurs were around
now that human divergence from apes I've
talked about that 6 million years when
one of these one of these animal species
started to change in a way that would
changed everything for everyone on earth
that was not till this tiny little
sliver so that's the very recent history
let's extend that little sliver all the
way out ok so now we have the last 6
million years we have a Stone Age
this is human history and that's a
hundred thousand years some people
that's a really distant distant ancient
human history is just in there let's
extend that out ok so now we have the
last ice age glacial period ends and
here we have the agricultural area the
Agricultural Revolution and that's when
for the first time humans congregated
into cities they congregated in big
groups and all this culture flourished
and all this knowledge happened because
we could compare notes we had this
collective intelligence one groups
person learned something and he can
explain it to all the other people in
the civilization and so very quickly
humans progressed this was a huge leap
for Humanity and but opening that up in
the last 10,000 years
you have the oldest evidence of writing
so this is when written hits
begins everything we know is the
absolute most ancient ancient history
started here okay at this pink part so
you have the Bronze Age here and then
you have ancient Egypt which is again
really long reign almost 3,000 years
that's an incredible run that they had
this is ad talking like incredibly
recent history now the Roman Empire
which was nothing compared to the
ancient Egyptians the Middle Ages and
here we have the history of European
imperialism this is when all that
started this none of that so everyone
was just living and doing their own
thing in their own place until this
little part when suddenly that change
this is so new the concept of nations
withdrawn borders around them and you
know colonialism and imperialism and all
of that that is incredibly new all the
nations we know that are so famous
they're all they all started at the
nations that we know in this tiny little
era we might be in the nation era we
might look back in time and say oh yeah
that's when humans lived in these
nations with borders this might be a
phase where we don't know it just feels
so normal to us but that's the theme of
the night I don't you to think about is
the concept of what it feels so normal
to us so much of it is a crazy anomaly
and we just are inside of it so we can't
see it okay now what is that black part
that's where the Industrial Revolution
happened this is the Industrial Age that
little tiny black part which is our part
itself of this little tiny purple part
is where so much incredible stuff has
happened and that is the third anomaly
that's an anomaly within this this thing
which is an anomaly which within human
history which is an anomaly within all
life history and you can just look at
human history here and appreciate that
blue is ad there so that this is what
we're talking about here now the
Industrial Revolution within there we
have the last 200 years which is a
period I'm about to focus on so I want
to think about last 200 years 1816 to
2016 that's the red okay and I just did
all of that so that you guys could just
kind of get in the zone with me of
appreciating how incredibly small a
period of time that red is so even
within the tiny tiny human history which
is incredibly small the red is 1/500 of
human history it's too
out of a thousand century so this is a
thousand centuries and that's the last
2.2 percent let's just look at the
difference between the pink and then a
little red the pink you have you want to
go somewhere you walk you run you maybe
take a boat sailboat
and that's about it maybe a horse takes
you somewhere in the red cars planes we
can go to this Space Station we can go
to the moon
that's not normal that all of that
happened in the red how about population
we lived in the pink under a billion
people the entire pink all of human
history under a billion people for most
of it well under in the red we've
crossed the one two three four five six
and seven billion person marks crazy
okay
in the pink we're barely using any
energy as a species the entire time the
whole fossil fuels era which is what it
is it's an era that we're in the middle
of all happened in the red all the
changes are making to the atmosphere
that all happened in the red we have a
communication we you could you could
send a letter that's about it maybe and
then books were a huge revolutionary
thing that happened like just before the
red that books are is incredibly new but
in the red suddenly we have the internet
we have mobile phones we have Skype we
have TV we have radio it's just it's
dramatic and it you have to do a lot of
hard thinking about this very obvious
when you think about it fact in order to
just have it kind of sink in that this
is a crazy time to have been born crazy
time to have been born but you know in
our normal lives we are programmed as
tribal creatures to grow up and say this
is normal this is my parents and my
grandparents we're all living in this
world this is life because that's what
it was we are it we evolved in a world
where that was the case would they're
like you lived was probably the life
that ten generations back and ten
generations ahead will also live
essentially the same thing maybe some
new farming techniques you know you guys
discover basically nothing will change
that's what who we are and now we live
in this world where our parents one
generation can't even understand our
technology grandparents forget about it
you're not gonna be able to understand
your kids technology you're just it's
just gonna be really hard you might be
able to a little bit but you won't be
that good at it and to you
I never forget about it that's how
quickly things are changing you can't
even live in the world if someone took
you in a time machine 30 years ahead
you're not it's not gonna work
so that makes me think about the future
okay if we're here and we've been moving
up pretty quickly it's been going up
pretty quickly in human progress and it
feels like this is normal
there's a lot of reason to believe that
we really could be on one of these
things that we could be very close an
extreme change now you've heard a lot
about this and talked of Ray Kurzweil
style you know theories about the
singularity and some people you know
mock that but if you think about
logically it's kind of the only thing
that makes sense
now our intuition because of this tribal
nature tribal is linear okay the
progress of the last 10 generations was
probably gonna be about the same as the
progress of the next chance ten
generations but as the species gets more
and more advanced you have something
called the law of accelerating returns a
more advanced species can make progress
quicker than the less advanced species
other so they probably probably made a
lot more progress for example in the
19th century than we did in the 15th
century overall but if you get to this
point it starts accelerating and our
predictions get very wrong very quickly
so if we're here and someone said okay
well we're you know when people think
about what's what's the world gonna be
like in 2100 you know eighty-four years
ahead we you think 84 years back to the
you know eight 1930s or so and you think
well okay well what's happening you're
our intuition is to kind of apply what
we've done since then and apply it and
add it to the future which would be this
kind of trajectory based on the past a
savvy er person might say well actually
if you look at the last like 20 30 years
cell phones the internet you know all
you know there's just been so much
dramatic change that Large Hadron
Collider all this stuff you might say
okay well let's base our trajectory on
the slope that's happening now okay both
of those are pretty wrong all right
those are gonna underestimate the future
what you have to do is think
exponentially which we're very bad at
we're born to think linearly you have to
think about this which is why the
correct prediction is gonna be far far
more Ray Kurzweil believes that it's so
extreme he thinks that a thousand times
the progress of the 20th century will be
made in the 21st century a thousand
because he thinks that one twentieth
century happens in the
fifteen years then seven years then
three years and it just kind of goes
like that and exponentially you very
quickly are doing a 20th century of
progress more than once a year then more
than once a month and you very quickly
get to a thousand dimes now that's
obviously he's on very one side of the
spectrum with his predictions but it's
not that crazy when you think about how
exponential growth works so one of the
things I do in writing is I try to
figure out what is gonna make it this
shape this crazy shape what what are the
signs that this is happening and I've
seen a lot of them one of them is
virtual reality not sure why that's the
picture but I'm sure some of you haven't
had a chance to try VR or augmented
reality which is kind of when you see
your world but there's a layer in front
of it giving you more information or
something in between called mixed
reality which is not just a layer in
front of your world if I if I'm an
augmented reality and I see you and then
I see information about each of you next
to your little face but then I put my
hand in front of this and I still see
the information here because it's it's a
layer on top of what I see mixed reality
there could be a ball underneath this
table that I see in my goggles it's not
really there and if I go over here
though I don't see it anymore I thought
you look under the table it's actually
positioned in real space and and and my
brain will believe in every way that
it's real in real space that's what kind
of company like magic leap is working on
so so many things are happening here
right now
just to orient you for a second we have
kind of a world where we have there's
mobile VR which is when you slide your
phone in to the Samsung gear VR things
like that and we have PC VR which is
what like the vibe and the oculus when
you're tethered and a much heavier
headset you're tethered to a computer
and those are the two things one's kind
of the high-end one and one's kind of
the cheaper one that can get to lots of
people quickly Facebook is engineering a
third that's gonna be I believe the real
solution which is a standalone meaning
it's has kind of almost the power of a
PC computer and but it's you're not
tethered to anything and instead of with
the PC you have is you have base
stations mounted on the wall so you have
your headset and you can walk around
because the things are seeing you so the
cameras are looking at you and
registering where your headset is that's
called outside in
Facebook is working on with something
called inside out where the thing itself
can register radar the room and can
actually you can walk around a house and
it knows it can quickly render where all
the walls are so that's really really
intense technology and you need battery
technology to get better and you need
heat dispersion technology to get better
and you need processing power but
everyone I've talked to you at Facebook
believes that that's gonna become a
thing where we'll all pull and be on the
subway instead of pulling out your white
iPhone headphones you'll pull out your
little thing that'll just slap on your
buds go in and everyone is just in VR
with nothing no cords maybe in five
years maybe in ten years so really
incredible and then you start thinking
of all the things that can happen in the
world you have training you have
entertainment being revolutionized you
have communication it'll invade the
world transportation people won't need
to travel as much you can you can work
anywhere you can work with anyone you
can spend much more time with your
family and friends who don't live near
you
the Revolutionists is that it can help
with empathy it has already been kind of
a very simple version done where you can
go to a Syrian refugee camp and just
being there in VR just suddenly you just
want to give money you just want to help
because your empathy because you know
you remember that everyone's a human you
can have a classroom of third graders
lower middle class students in Missouri
who never would have left the country go
on field trip with a classroom of
Chinese students and they can go to the
moon together and they can speak to each
other and they say speaking their
language and it comes out and the other
ones language I mean really really cool
and what does that do for xenophobia I
mean it just keeps going the more you
think about VR you're like oh my god
it's gonna change this and this and this
so that's gonna be a huge thing it's
gonna kind of give us superpowers but
then you think okay well so we're sweet
I can go anywhere I can go back in time
I can just be I can be standing on the
field during the World Cup live soccer
going around around makes them in VR and
I have superpowers right I can go to the
moon I can go anywhere I can go to
Jupiter but I'm still you take off the
mask and I'm still a dying animal bummer
and we get to the next question well
what's happening there there's all kinds
of things going on with life extension
incredible things going on you have
technologies like CRISPR and other kinds
of genetic technology you have
nanotechnology that's going to allow us
to do amazing things with health
and Mark Zuckerberg is one of many very
powerful very forward-thinking
entrepreneurs who's one of his goals is
to cure every major disease by the end
of the century and that's such a big
deal because first of all right now you
know if you think about if you think
about going you know you went back if
you 200 300 years ago you hear about oh
my god
yeah just like their daughter would die
of dysentery and then they would you
know and and they would just like you
know you know again they would lose
child and childbirth and and people
would just their young wife would would
would die this and it sounds so horrible
first of all a lot of the world is
currently living like that second of all
the future will look at us living like
that be like yeah someone these two just
died in 85 of cancer of heart disease of
stroke of Alzheimer's it's gonna seem
barbaric it's gonna seem like a horrible
time we're in it again so we don't it's
hard to see the time you're in I believe
this is all gonna really change and
partially because of these technologies
but partially because of this this is
the big thing okay this is like the
thing that affects the other things and
it's a thing in itself so AI is is such
a wild card because we'll get to all the
things that and how it works in a second
but just everything I just said
with our technology it's like what
everything I was talking about was in
the context of what we are gonna be
trying to do anyway just humans and then
you have to have an asterisk and say
also AI might do like a thousand times
more than that in any of these areas so
let's just go through briefly what the
deal is with where AI is now where it
might be going it's like one thing thing
about is cars planes you know all this
and eventually even virtual reality in a
way it replaces our bodies it's it's
super power for our bodies right you can
be in a car you have a super-powered
human runner all right and and you're a
superhero basically and same with planes
you're a bird now you're the fastest
bird in the world we can we can do that
physically the computer has been the
equivalent for our brains right so you
have you had the you know the very early
computers this was an extension of the
human brain and
the human body it gets can get more and
more intense eventually the eventual you
know one-day thing could be some kind of
teletransporting right you know and you
can you know and we can replace our
bodies with potential robot bodies and
we can you know you know not be attached
to this dying animal anymore that's kind
of the promised land for your body
what's the promised land for our brain
it's it's this it's this intense concept
of super intelligence so I want to just
make a quick distinction some of you
definitely know this and some of you
don't - let's just go through the
caliber of AI because any conversation
about AI has to be in this context so
you have first you have something called
artificial narrow intelligence okay
so narrow intelligence means it's
extremely good at its one thing right
you have Pandora is great at it's one
thing when you go on Amazon it says
people who bought this also bought this
that's an AI doing way more that it's a
super-powered human at that one thing
when you buy airline tickets that price
is set by an AI the gate you fly into
when you land a set by an AI your phone
is packed within Google Maps
okay Google search you can go on and on
the military uses AI your car uses AI
it's it's the stock market stock trading
is used as yeah but it's all narrow
intelligence it's all specialized at one
thing okay that you've probably heard
alphago the goal the the the google
deepmind go player the beat the the go
champion that's an extremely complex
game narrow it's really good at that
don't ask a dating advice it's not going
to be helpful and so you know the
founder of the the guy who coined the
term AI John McCarthy he says no one
calls it AI once it works and that's why
we don't think we live in a world of AI
but we do you guys more savvy you might
but most people don't realize we live in
a world run by AI but it's narrow now
remember I talked about so the concept
of narrow but superhuman okay so picture
like a long pillar okay it's really good
but it's narrow general intelligence is
what humans have we don't have super
intelligence in anything like like all
this AI does but what we do have as
Brett
okay we don't have the depth we have the
breaths we can be can reason we can
learn from experience we have social
skills we have wisdom we have creativity
and go on and on we have this incredible
breadth of intelligence we're smart in a
way that no computer has ever been
computers have narrow intelligence
they're not smart across the board like
a human so the concept of getting to
general intelligence in a computer is
mind-blowing when you start to absorb
what it actually means it means that we
for the first time you have a computer
that's genuinely smart who here is
watching West world yeah that's scary
right it's a little freaky and and you
know of course there's a lot of movies
about this but but most of them make
some mistakes and how they portray this
and we're gonna talk a little bit about
that so first question is how do we get
from A and I to AG I artificial general
intelligence okay with the net the last
step being super intelligence which
we'll get to so it's a challenge and
it's a challenge for non-intuitive
reasons a lot of what we think is easy
is actually what's hard to make in an AI
and a lot of what we think as hard as
what's actually easy and the reason is
things that we think are hard is that
we're not Naturals at them like
engineering and calculus ok those things
are hard for us because we just kind of
invented them as a species we just
discovered them we're just trying to
wrap our heads around them it's easy to
program a computer at what we do by
thinking really hard because computer is
better at thinking than we are what's
not easy is are things that are easy for
us because we've been programmed by 3.8
billion years of evolution to be good at
it like walking this is really complex
physics I'm falling every step and it's
easy if I want to reach up to that
microphone I can do so like this and
it's no problem
that's my that's a X Y Z
three-dimensional space that my hand is
moving in the perfect dimension the
perfect direction with multiple joints
all moving at the same same time it's
it's a novel of physics then I'm doing
this marvel of engineering that I'm
doing this and that kind of thing is
incredibly difficult in AI vision okay
you see you can see me it's no problem
you know what I am you can
you can render what that is but if AI
just sees two-dimensional pixels a big
collage of them not easy so you have to
think about that so for example you know
you want to take an AI and say I want
you to beat the world chess master in
chess and they eyes like yeah okay I
look at the chess board pretty can
brute-force that maybe I got it no
problem you say okay next I want you to
read these words he's like it's
like you want me to read the word why
did you put a line through them why do
these work these work right it doesn't
make sense
it does because chess is actually easier
if you had to design a program to be
good at chess you'd have an easier time
than understanding the essence of a be a
little girl drawers of B and an old man
in his old cursive drawers of B and then
there's a bunch of different typefaces
for B and you can go on and on and on we
can just look at them all so yeah that's
a B yeah you know that's so complex what
our brain is doing to figure that out
there's so much nuance there that is
really really hard for a computer to
understand yeah they're so you how can
you can't there's not any you have to
get it to genuinely you know understand
what a B is that's not easy it's
anything with language you know we can
we can Google Translate is doing a very
you know a very brute-force thing it's
taking some X and it's replacing it with
why that's not understanding language
getting a computer to truly understand
languages and is a gigantic feet okay
how about you could say okay AI and now
I want you to memorize every single
Street in the world and I want you be
able to give me directions to many one
place to any other place taking into
account traffic accidents construction
all of that and yet I was like yeah I
got it not a problem like okay also is
this a dog or a cat he's a Jesus
I have granted that's kind of hard for a
human to but the idea is you try making
a computer that understand that like
dogs are weird-looking so many of them
and they look totally different just by
the way I don't understand how like dog
the fact that like any dog can mate with
any dog like and it's just so crazy to
me like there look so differently how is
that it anyway so trying to get an AI to
understand what a dog is or what uh you
know versus a cat versus it that again
that's taking a lot of very nuanced
human understanding very complex
software that we have a facial
recognition of animal recognition of
recognition of other life-forms
not to mention human facial recognition
which were like unbelievable genius is
that all of us are idiot savants at it
but we just we're all used to everything
everyone can do that so it feels normal
to be incredibly good at facial
recognition human facial recognition
here's one more example I talked about
pixels right so the a the the the thing
on the left all right
AI and you see the same thing a computer
just that you see two-dimensional
collage of you know white grain black
lift up the black and this and you get
and and the human says that okay I get
it there's some cylinders and you have
some slats and you got some corners
there I get it you know you can see what
this is trying to represent in the real
world that's a lot of your brains doing
magic right there the AI looks that and
sees the same thing a two-dimensional
collage of gray and white and black so
it's this kind of thing to appreciate
the challenge now how do we how do we
get there well there's hardware and
there's software the hardware
improvements you look at Moore's law a
lot of people think it'll continue maybe
because of quantum computing maybe
because of other other breakthroughs if
it continues it's only about ten years
before the computer that can fit in your
pocket for a thousand dollars we'll be
able to do what a human brain does and
it's only another couple decades after
that before the computer that can fit in
your pocket can do what the entire human
race brains can do combined okay so
that's really intense so the hardware is
getting there right now can do about a
thousandth of that the thousand-dollar
computer
ten years ago was about a millionth 20
years ago it was about a billion so it
goes up like that Moore's law and so
that's about where we're headed there
the software is harder how do you make
it smart how do you build general
intelligence no one knows but we're
trying a bunch of different things so
one thing we're trying we I'm not doing
anything
one thing smart people are trying is
they're trying to basically plagiarize
the brain they say well we have a
general intelligence computer right here
we have a prototype let's try to let's
try to reverse engineer and figure out
how it's done let's build a neural net
the same way that the brain is something
where you have a neural pathway that is
strengthened when an answer is correct
or weakened when an answer is wrong and
eventually it gets smarter maybe if we
get really good we can actually break
the brain into a huge number of almost
two-dimensional slices and scan them all
and then put them all together and
render them back into the computer and
actually that's called whole brain
emulation incredible technology that
we're not anywhere close to doing we're
trying to do a flatworm right now it
says three hundred neurons our brain has
ten billion but these are the kind of
things that can move exponentially
another way they say is let's not
plagiarize the brain let's plagiarize
the thing that made the brain evolution
evolution made this let's copy it so
what they say is let's start with a
bunch of different programs and this is
called a genetic algorithm and they
basically have them do a task and the
ones that happen to be great at it they
survive the other ones get discontinued
the ones haven't agreat they combine
their code and just keep doing that and
eventually what happens is they find
these really creative bizarre solutions
that work that we never would have this
and we never would have thought about
that but think about evolution does you
are a pile of mistakes that's all you
are
every single thing you're knows is some
mutation at some point your your I is a
is a very fortunate mutation every
single part of a human is at some point
of mutation in history that's what they
try to do they try to let the thing make
mistakes see what happens but maybe the
most intense way for this to happen is
what's called recursive self-improvement
bootstrapping its own development you
basically build a computer that is it's
it's narrow intelligence its specialty
is making itself smarter it can do you
can research AI and it can code it can
change its own architecture okay so
that's where you know what we call
recursive self-improvement now when that
starts to happen we don't know which of
these is going to work but most people
think this is going
to happen okay well it's gonna surprise
us because here's what we're going to
see remember I'm talking that one of the
themes of the night is we're inside of
something so we don't see what we're
inside we don't see that we're in the
fossil fuels era we don't see that we're
in a crazy anomaly we don't see that
we're living in a tragic time where
everyone you know dies and in it in
there 50 60 70 80 9 that's a horrible
fact we also don't see what in the
intelligence spectrum for what it is so
will an AI will be getting smarter and
smart and will have general intelligence
that's starting to grow they can do kind
of what an ant can do and a bird and the
chimp and will look down I'll say that's
so cute hey I can do monkey tricks it'll
be this thing will be watching YouTube
videos and laughing okay here's actually
what the intelligence spectrum looks
like the difference between that I'm
Stein and a dumb human is almost nothing
in the actual spectrum almost the same
exact brains we're talking the tiniest
difference that we see because we're
inside of it so it feels huge to us
meanwhile when you get from an ant or a
bird to a chimp that those are dramatic
leaps and you are racing up towards us
but we won't see it even when the hits
dumb human we're gonna say oh it can do
what a 5 year old can do 5 year olds are
done we're gonna say you can do what a 5
year old can do look at that like
there's an AI like playing with the kids
in class and learning with them right it
can be a week later and it's smarter
than Einstein and it's gonna be really
surprising it's gonna race past us now
at this point we hit some we hit general
intelligence right me to think about
what happens then does it stop there
does it just hang out with us in our
level no because there's a lot of things
it has advantages over us first of all
if your brain got bigger first of all
we're limited by the size of our skulls
but part of the reason it's the same
that size is that the electricity in the
brain moves it at such a pace that if
the brain were to much bigger than it is
it wouldn't be able to communicate from
one side together quick enough to be one
functioning unit so it wouldn't work a
computer brain whose electricity moves
at the speed of light could be the size
of a dwarf planet before you have that
exact same problem okay so that's one
thing secondly it's editable its
upgradable okay it doesn't forget things
it doesn't get tired it doesn't get old
it doesn't it
didn't go to sleep at night he goes out
you can go on and on with all the
advantages it has over us we talked
about the Agricultural Revolution and
how that gave us this magical ability
that other animals didn't have instead
of just learning stuff in our trials we
could learn stuff all together
collective intelligence we saw writted
the AI has a much more intense version
of that one computer learned something
it can instantly sync perfectly with
every other AI in the planet so for all
these reasons we believe that this arrow
might go very very quickly this is when
things get intense let's talk about this
so we've got this oh so fun I love these
things okay so this is my intelligent
staircase okay so we got your aunt your
chicken and your ape and your your human
here right now just as an analogy here
so just say you have an AI that has
gotten up to up to here and and it can
get it can get itself just a little
smarter than Einstein Einstein's a
pretty sick computer scientist if that's
what he dedicated his career to here but
I'm real good at that right so now it
makes itself smarter than Einstein now
it's the smartest thing that's ever
lived it makes itself
way smarter and before you know it it's
up to full steps above us now same
distance that we are to this chimp okay
just think about how big a deal two
steps is chimps are damn smart their
brains look a lot like ours on a table
okay their DNA is like 99% the same as
ours and yet if we're in a battle with
them put them in a cage on what you're
gonna do now you're in a cage and I have
a Taser and a gun I can poison your food
and you have no power and I'm God to you
because of these two steps two steps we
can play complete God to this creature
we own that creature we can do whatever
we want we could extinct them if we
really wanted to okay that's two steps
now think about not it gets even crazier
because not only is it power it's also
understanding not only can this
beautiful room rain right not only can a
chimp not build it if a chip were here
and you try to explain we made this you
can't even get that through if you
showed it a skyscraper or a plane in the
sky and you say that's not a bird we
made that you can't even get that
thought cross because it just doesn't
have the cognitive capacity to
understand that kind of thing so we're
talking two steps above us if you look
at a similar
analogy here not only can we not build
what it can build we won't even get that
bill bit built it even if it tries to
explain it to us that's a really crazy
pretty intense concept now how good a
computer programmer is this guy what
does he do he just starts jumping up the
steps and before you know it he's there
maybe an hour later and this whole last
slides down there
what the hell we have word for you know
100 no we call 85 IQ we call stupid 135
IQ we call smart we don't have a word
for 500,000 IQ it doesn't mean anything
we have no concept of what this will be
like this is what we call artificial
superintelligence and it's it's again
it's just completely beyond our grasp to
be if you try to imagine what its gonna
be like it's like a monkey trying to
understand what that airplane up there
is made of and what it does just not
gonna happen it's not possible so all we
can do is say well let's hope this turns
out well so first question when is this
gonna happen okay they surveyed a bunch
of a AI experts some of these are not
all optimist some of these were are more
skeptical than the average person and
the median prediction the question was
when is it more likely than not that we
have AI on this general intelligence and
super intelligence on this planet when
did I hit that 50% mark what you'd bet
more on it than against it and that came
out to 2040 in 2060 when a lot of us are
gonna be alive
yeah pretty intense and the next
question is we have god here's coming
soon right whether you're religious or
not there's God gonna be here and then
we ask is it going to be a nice God or
is it gonna be a mean God pretty
important question and a lot of people
think it might be a nice God in which
case you end up in this situation this
is Ray Kurzweil this is Peter Diamandis
this is the guys at Google this is a lot
of people that feel very very excited
this is this is Zuckerberg they say look
we're gonna figure how to make this safe
and it's gonna be amazing and then if
you think about it just a smallest bit
of intelligence above us and hard
problems become easy a bigger difference
intelligence above us all problems
become
immediately easy as much as you try to
have a monkey trying to open a padlock
they can try to open a padlock for a
hundred years it's not gonna happen we
could look at it for six seconds and
open it as instructions written there
same idea here right and so talk about
things like disease and climate change
and poverty and all of our big problems
no problem anymore right and a lot of
people have a lot of reason to think
this could there's a little good
arguments why this can be done safely
and there's some thought going into
safety but not as much as it's going
into into development now the people who
are nervous are not usually the
developers they're the Philosopher's
they're some of the people behind the
scenes and they're worried that we're a
bunch of kids playing with a bomb
so Elon is one of these people Stephen
Hawking one of these people Nick Bostrom
there's a lot of people out there
writing about why they don't see a good
reason to believe that we're not gonna
botch this because I think about
software the first versions are pretty
buggy right what happens if this is
buggy and now you have god is buggy it's
unfortunate and you know just say you
know they have this this one horror
example they said you know is just how
people think it's gonna be evil it's
gonna have an ego it's gonna want to
take over like the Terminator it's not
how it's gonna happen it's gonna have
anything prime or fising the AI right
that's applying human value something
it's not human it's still gonna be a
computer which is part of what's scary
you know you think anything that gets
smart as smart as we are is gonna be
empathetic right it's gonna understand
good and bad right well why we
understand good and bad because it would
have volution airily advantageous for us
to understand good and bad the tribes
that had morals that had empathy that
had altruism they survived they
cooperated that's who we are were the
descendants of those people okay empathy
is a very nuanced human emotion valuing
human life is a very specific value okay
it's a very very just just it's if you
try to say to an AI even if we could try
to get it to say okay you know do what's
good you figure it out it's gonna say
well there's one species that's killing
a lot of a lot of other species let's
get rid of them so no no no no don't do
that good do like good itch for them but
do great for us for humans okay do
for humans what does that mean well ask
15 people on this planet right now what
what is good for humans
look at the political debates going on
in this country let alone
Isis thinks it knows what's good right
how who decides how to program this God
into what it thinks maybe you can just
program it to again try to figure it out
on its own well then you know or you say
make all humans smile and then it
paralyzes all of our face into permanent
smile say no not that not like that
so this more you think about it the more
troubling it gets I don't you know
there's not you start to think why would
this turn out well and then other people
think that it just will we will figure
it out like we've always figured out how
to make technology turn out well for us
so I don't know but which that brings me
to why Elon wants to go to Mars which is
the last thing I wanted to talk about
and and so here's you have to think
about okay so I had a chance I think
anyone who's been on way but why you
know might have read some of my Elon
Musk series when I had a chance to work
with him and his team to basically talk
about what he's doing and why and I dug
into Tesla for a while and you know I
look what living in the fossil fuels era
right and I looked at why technology
doesn't just move forward on its own you
know you have the early 1800s
you have the locomotive Pistons actually
have a thing here this guy so you have
Pistons here right and then here you
have the car today why are those look so
similar 200 years apart when the Wright
brothers plane and the Saturn 5 that
went to the moon are only 60 years apart
why are these 200 years apart and it
looks so similar you get technology
doesn't move forward and so on and
sometimes it takes entrepreneurship to
actually move things forward or it takes
a fight for survival right and so when
you think about SpaceX you think about
the history of space well how much
progress did we make in the 60s when we
had survival on the line a ton right
because you had our budget dedicated to
it right you had
the NASA budget was four-and-a-half
percent of the total budget was
dedicated to space travel in the 60s
when we had a reason and we had a really
important reason soon as that survival
reason ended we ended up here okay and
what Allah wants to do when he first
wanted to do a SpaceX they just inspired
people to bring it from 1/2 a percent to
a percent of the national budget he said
that you know maybe we should spend less
on on trying to get to Mars as we do on
healthcare but maybe we spend more than
we do on cosmetics and that was kind of
the idea and you know we spent a lot of
time since then just going to low-earth
orbit you know which is within 2,000
miles of the earth most of it's a couple
hundred miles above the earth and you
know there's some writer that said
watching the astronauts go to the Space
Station's is about as thrilling as
watching Columbus sailed to Ibiza
because you know we saw something much
cooler and so he luck to this and he
looks at what we're doing with AI first
he looks at the ago he looks at the
history of mass extinction events on
earth okay
there's been a lot and there's gonna be
more but even if that's 50 you know even
if it happens to it's gonna be 50
million years away that's long what
scares Elon is not this is not an
asteroid what scares you on is us is AI
is things were doing with genetic
weapons things were doing with
nanotechnology really scary stuff
nuclear weapons and he says why don't we
try to back up the hard drive here
instead of having all of our eggs in one
basket why don't we try to divide humans
into two planets and have a
self-sustaining civilization on both of
them and if we had that then we would
have much better chance of surviving
into the far future think of if you want
to get rid of humans the last thing you
want is for them to be on two planets
okay now it's gonna be much harder to
get rid of a species if they're on two
planets so that's his thinking and the
way he wants to do it is this he needs
to get at least a million people in the
intersection of sets of people who both
want to go to Mars and who can afford to
go to Mars and in order to do that it's
all about the blue circle okay believes
that people will want to go once it's
safe once you can come back once it
kind of an adventure you'll get at least
a million people you need to get the
blue circle down from where it is now
which is about 10 billion per seat
that's what George W Bush asked had
Congress ask NASA what it would cost he
said 50 billion for five astronauts he
wants to get it to 500,000 per seat at
20,000 fold decrease now about 20 of
that 20,000 is going to come from simply
making rockets in 2016
instead of 1960 most of our current
record rocket technology is basically
from that boon of funding back in the
60s so right there you can make things
more efficient you can get it down to
about about 20 fold lower when it is how
about the extra thousandfold how do you
do that well you do that by making
Rockets reusable if you think about
airline industry imagine if you fly from
LA to New York they fly a past New York
over the Hudson in over the ocean you
parachute out everyone parachutes down
into the ocean the airplane goes down
and crashes into the ocean and blows up
and then everyone swims to the shore and
you get there and they make him do
airplane for the next flight it would
cost a couple million dollars for a
coach ticket and no one here would ever
have been on a flight right and who
would fly billionaires and governments
the exact people who currently are in
space billionaires and governments
because we can't reuse rocket so Elon is
thought that if we can fix this one
problem we can revolutionize the cost of
space travel and bring what he thinks is
the number needed to build a
self-sustaining civilization on Mars
meaning if that ships from Earth stopped
for some reason there's a world war
something terrible happens on earth that
the Mars population can continue to grow
and thrive until it's its own seven
billion person population and for him
that's a million people so what they're
trying to do is get really so good at
landing Rockets that they can do it
basically every single time without
having any problem in that the rocket
doesn't end up damaged and so they tried
a bunch of times and they failed a bunch
of times and then right around a year
ago this rocket went up to space and
successfully delivered into orbit a
payload and then came back down and
landed which is really awesome that
thing is the cost that cost
same as a jumbo jet to make and that
falls in the ocean what happened to your
laptop falls in the ocean that's a
delicate electric device it doesn't the
refurbishment cost more than making the
rocket so this is huge so the point of
thinking about SpaceX at the end of all
this and not earlier on is that the
reason for space hex isn't because it's
cool isn't because you know Rockets are
awesome that's one of the reasons it's
an adventure to try to go to Mars but
it's the fact that life on Earth is
precarious given that we are in this
exponential increase that we're in the
middle of it that we're being really
potentially very reckless and it's hard
to see it when we're in it but that's a
you know we might be kids playing with a
bomb so that's what Elon wants to do and
they believe that they can send the
first ships there in 2024 with people in
them and I want to show you the size of
the ship because it's extremely
extremely rad it's a size of a
skyscraper that's a house at the bottom
that thing at the top is the spaceship
that alone is 16 stories and can fit 300
people so they want to send that thing
with 300 people to Mars eventually after
15 or 20 years sending over a thousand
of them every two years every time earth
laughs Mars and they're next to each
other and you're gonna be sending
hundreds of thousands of people back and
forth this is reality
AI is reality this crazy VR future is
reality so that's all I try to do with
my blog and with talks like this is just
get you guys like in full aware mode and
not in kind of like this is normal
everything is normal mode button like
this is not normal this is incredible
time to be alive for better and for
worse and makes it very exciting time to
be a tech university so I'm happy you're
all here and I encourage you to go into
any of these things because they're all
dramatically changing the world for all
seven billion people and thanks for
having me
I hope you agree that I was right when I
said fasten your seatbelts I can't
imagine how we can think about all of
these issues from one end of the
spectrum of humanity to the other end
articulate them in such simple terms and
speak so fast I I really I said I got
out of control with the slide deck
that's all I can explain I had I was
like this is a disaster and I don't care
exactly I'm excited to show them all
these things so there was a lot to say I
don't know it was phenomenal thank you
very much
why don't we open the floor for a Q&amp;amp;A
session for a few minutes what makes you
think that human progress is
exponentially sustainable I don't know
that it is I really don't know that it
is I I think there's just as good an
argument that it's not and that it seems
it's it seems like there's a few
contradictory contradicting things going
on in the human head when you think
about this because one of them says
we've always been able to you know maybe
we haven't be able to fully sustain but
we kind of have you know only the deft
revolution was a boon in progress and in
potential and we went from 1 billion to
7 billion because of it
and and so you think we've always you
know it's it's you know we've always
survived our technology before we've
always survived our growth before it'll
probably end up being fine the doomsday
people are being naive on the other hand
the other part of our brain says I know
what I know and I know that all humans
die for example I know that humans don't
go to we don't have the two planets that
we live on my kid is not going to
college on Mars we say there's no such
thing as a computer that has great
social skills that can cure climate
change these things that is also sounds
crazy and it sounds naive to believe
that so one of them is wrong right and
and so I think that that our intuition
is that you know the either this stuff
won't happen or it'll happen to be fine
and and and it'll happen to the point
where it kills us just seems so science
fictiony it seems so false because
experience tells us that's not what
happens and yet this could be the time
when our experience is wrong it could be
on the other hand I think I also have
heard so many good arguments about why
this is gonna be okay a lot of people
think that we will become the AI that we
will integrate the developments in
computers into our own brains and we
could be living in an amazing utopia I
mean the truth is our current world with
our technology we seem like a magical
utopia to someone in the caveman or even
someone in the 1300s or even someone in
the 1700s right who didn't have power
yet no electricity so there's no reason
to believe that this wouldn't continue
would an even faster rate and we would
get to a world in 50 years that we
literally cannot we cannot conceive of
it right now 50 years in our lifetimes
we could be in a world that we cannot
conceive of so I don't know if we can
sustain it but I do believe that
craziness is happening in the next 50
years like when is exponential growth
than anything really been sustained well
look we were half a billion people 200
years ago now we're at 7 billion look at
the population curve and life expectancy
is a lot higher now around the world
even in the poorest parts of the world
than it was then but I'm single so far
so far we've done an okay job and we
could all fit New Zealand as I showed
you so we can keep going but but you
know then you think okay well we're
gonna run out of resources well there's
a lot of people learning how to grow
meat and you know we're gonna run out of
this and that well we're gonna have
better ways to distribute clean water
you know I just I just don't know it's
you're right I mean it's like our needs
get more and the power gets more in the
power of our weapons gets more in the
power of mistakes and the impact of
mistakes gets higher stakes so yeah when
that happens our technology has to go be
ahead of it somehow and you know and our
empathy has to kind of guide us through
it
so okay that's a good there's a
difference if the AI has a reason that
it wants humans to be gone
we're probably toast right we're
probably in trouble because the AI will
be it's like it's like us having a
reason to get rid of that anthill it's
not gonna be a bad hard for us so kind
of they can kind of go under on them so
if it's if there's some very intelligent
thing that wants to kill us or there's
some extremely intelligent bad force of
humans that has a biological weapon and
they want to do something you know they
that could be in trouble on both planets
Oh many many many of the doomsday
scenarios Armus bad mistakes that you
know like the ai ai crashed the stock
market in 2010 it's called the flash
crash when a I was making high frequency
stock trades
there's bothering more of those made by
AI in the world today than by humans and
and I was doing it reacted to something
by doing something else it was supposed
to it was just doing what it was
supposed to do we hadn't thought about
one circumstance crashed the whole
market trillion dollars of value was
lost so that kind of thing that's what
narrow AI can do when this thing gets
much more powerful it's you know again
I'm talking about the power of it you
build a house on top of an anthill you
don't hate the ants you just happen to
build a house they're in your way so the
idea is we're in the way and and so if
that's the case something could happen
terrible tragedy on earth or on Mars and
the other planet could learn from it or
it there's natural things like an
asteroid asteroids are real there will
be another one that hits the earth
that's the serious thing and and if that
happens we're asteroid proof now as a
species at least so that's what it comes
down to it the mistake and and if
there's a by the way if there's a bad
actor there's an Isis that gets a hold
of a way to kill all humans or something
it's a lot harder to do it if we're not
all in one if you if I'm if I'm in that
situation I'm not happy that I have to
deal with killing everyone on both
planets so when it comes to like
individuals you know trying to do
whatever they can for their own safety
if if the humanity is moving in this
direction and and it wants to build this
technology there's no there's no
stopping it even if governments try to
stop it right
treacherous woman's gonna be built and
then you have to you have to just look
at if we're talking about the kind of
existential catastrophe that AI could
create it doesn't matter what you're
doing or your kids you're you you're not
getting out of this no one is right so
but so if that happens you know we're
all toast and so the way to think about
it is what can an individual do to try
to help that output and one thing I
think is to put either your your brain
through your career or your money
through funding into AI safety
development a safety efforts right now
there's about a thousand times more
money going into AI development then
going into AI safety in the world you
know because it's not a sexy great
investment ai safety it's not gonna make
you it's not gonna bring you glory it's
not gonna you're not gonna you know it's
a quiet hero thing to do well you know
developing AI is where the excitement
and the money is so more people do need
more people both putting resources and
their brains into this problem it is
most people think it's solvable if we
can get it right and again you know what
kind of might only have one shot once
the first the very first AI gets that
level is not much we can do to take it
back anymore then the monkeys can say oh
yeah you you humans are not pleasant for
the rest of us we're just gonna take
that back now you can't do that now
we're here and we're in charge so that's
what that best thing I can tell you
sorry yeah so I've read a little bit
about this and I've heard the same
things because literally you get down to
the size of atoms and and you can't go
further unless you can do quantum
computing which I've read a little bit
about and it sounds like an unbelievably
powerful extension where you can now
Moore's law can extend to a far greater
said that that's what I've read I don't
know enough about it to know whether
that's plausible whether it's gonna
happen soon but I
so think that humans who want to figure
out how to increase hardware power will
find a way you know we're pretty we're
pretty good at that kind of thing I
believe just in my gut well I can say I
don't have any idea about whether AI
would turn out well or badly I have and
I have a feeling in my gut that it will
happen and things like that we will
figure that part out
when the human species wants to make
tech progress it usually does just a few
days ago I had a meeting with a group of
faculty at Stephens and one of our
faculty members is addressing this very
issue and he's focusing on optical
computing and he already has a prototype
of a device that runs 1,000 times faster
than the fastest CPU that you can buy in
the market so the technology is there
it's a matter of developing it
perfecting it and integrating it into
the next generation of machines but
optical computing and quantum computing
our are not that far away um so you
talked a little bit about like the kind
of biological barriers and like the
physical barriers and why we would want
to go to Mars do you think it would be a
better idea to more invest in like
integrating AI into the human itself and
then focusing on more of a development
and trying to create something like a
matryoshka brain or something along
those lines that would sustain more of
like a digital realm I mean I think we
should do both I guess
Milan point with Mars is always like you
know people love to say this is not
where you're saying but people love to
say you know why'd go to Mars me all
these problems on earth and this point
with that is 1% of the budget 99% can
still go to everything else like we're
spending more than 1% on things like
cosmetics so like it seems reasonable
that we should for life insurance which
is a way he sees the Mars plan it's
worth 1% so I would say they're not
mutually exclusive let's do Mars and
then let's also absolutely think about
this kind of thing to your question
about safety it could be that you know
the answer isn't to make sure that the
AI is safe but it's actually making sure
that it's constantly integrated with you
and that human empathy which is in human
brains is the thing that becomes super
intelligent so so I think we should do
both I think that that the promised land
with a I'd in my opinion is not this AI
that's in charge of everything where
again look at politics we can't agree on
what we even want so you know most
people won't be happy with whatever the
AI wants to do at with its all-powerful
potential so I think that the best
situation is that we all become super
intelligent enough that kind of conquer
mortality first of all conquer hunger
conquer things like that and that that
you know we can try to picture some
world where it's all about human
relationships it's all about exploration
and and and under you know the frontiers
of science it's all about art and I'm
like the better music than you can ever
imagine now like that us you know we
could focus on just the true joys of
this universe that can that they are
think of that prefrontal cortex
character can it can enjoy if we can
just get ourselves out of this
transition species situation which I
think AI can maybe do
and a lot of late it seems like humans
are not a good thing for nature yeah
well so no I totally so there's a few
thought maybe the first bigger thought
is yeah like should we even be valuing
humans in this big picture a lot of
people think that we're kind of like the
chain that goes to the AI chain link the
word like the link before the next link
and we've done our part and and you know
the some people think that the universe
is teeming not with biological Intel
super intelligent life but with
artificial super intelligent life and
that all of it is like the way AI comes
about it's like birthed from this like
gross biological like growth that
happens on the planet and that like a
planet basically grows biology which is
like a womb and then eventually it
spawns the real thing ai which goes into
the universe and has philosophical
debates with other AI and talks about
its own you know womb that it's from and
how it killed all the people there and
so but but and just another point here
is it gets to consciousness when you
think about this is a whole can of worms
but you know is an AI who gets super
smart conscious or does it appear it's
gonna seem conscious it's gonna talk to
us it's gonna cry it's gonna laugh it's
gonna be emotional it's gonna be all
these things but is it all as there is
there any mind's eye in there or is it
just a is it just doing what it's
supposed you know what it's supposed to
be doing is there any consciousness
inside yeah and that's in critically
important because if there's no
consciousness you could do an experiment
with a trillion you know AI simulations
and then turn them off no big deal it's
just conscious you just created the
biggest genocide in history some other
people think if it's conscious you know
we think that look if you're gonna
choose between killing a chicken in a
human you'd always kill the chicken why
because the chickens less sentient less
intelligent we think that being a more
intelligent makes us more our life more
valuable more important and I think
that's kind of fair we have more
capacity for suffering and for joy so an
AI that's if it's conscious and is
genuinely smarter than us if you want to
be super full up philosophical about and
take a step back you say yeah it's more
important than us it's more important
that it survives and is happy then that
we are so that's kind of a big question
then you know you're talking about also
we're just being bad
for the earth or bad for other animals
you know so there's all these debates
about that kind of right and wrong I
think most people developing it aren't
hey think you guys are thinking how can
we make this good for us because we know
we were built to self preserve and I
think we're probably going to keep
trying to do that but there's the best
thing I've heard for the how do you
program right and wrong in something
where we can't even decide and we're
very we're in the dark ages still people
gonna look back in this time for many
reasons and say we were primitive we're
primitive people still and I think that
what I've heard is you know people want
to program the AI with basically the
core coding do what we would do if we
were better figure out who we are and
where we're going and where we will be
one day when we're better and do that
it's kind of sad but it's also kind of
kind of potentially the best way I
wanted to thank you on behalf of the
entire Stephens community you gave a
wonderful talk thank you so much I never
I have it I have a little souvenir for
Tim if you don't mind I ask you to
please open it up yes thank you all very
much the students in my class please
congregate here
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
