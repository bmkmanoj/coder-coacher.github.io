about the future of the human condition
there's a big question it's I spent some
part of my life figuring out how to make
machines automate stuff that's pretty
obvious that we can automate many of the
things that we humans have been proud of
doing for a long time and the question
is then so what's the what's the future
of the human condition in that kind of
situation so more particularly you know
I see technology is about taking sort of
human goals and making them be able to
be automatically executed by machines
and the human goals that we've had in
the past have been like you know move
this object from here to there use a
forklift truck to do it rather than our
own hands now the things that we can do
automatically are more intellectual
kinds of things there are things that
have traditionally been the professions
work so to speak these are things that
we are going to be able to do by machine
and the question and so sort of the flow
is the machine is able to execute things
but something or someone has to define
what should its goals be what is it
trying to execute and people sort of
talk about well you know what's the
future of the intelligent machines and
you know are them intelligent machines
ninety you know take over and decide
what to do for themselves and things
like this
the people think one has to realize is
that while sort of figuring out given a
goal how to execute it it's something
that can meaningful be automated the
actual inventing of the goal it's not
something that in some sense has a a
path to automation that is you know when
we say what what makes how do we figure
out goals for ourselves how do we you
know how our goals defined they tend to
be defined for a given human by their
own personal history of their cultural
environment the history of our
civilization things like that the holes
are something that is sort of a uniquely
human kind of thing it's something that
almost doesn't make any sense we ask you
know what's the goal of our machine well
yeah we might have given it a goal when
we built the machine actually the thing
that makes this more kind of poignant
for me as I spend a lot of time
studying basic science about computation
and I realized something from that
that's a longer story that basically the
the question would be if we think about
sort of intelligence and things that
might have goals things that might have
purposes what kinds of things can have
intelligence or purpose or something of
that kind right now we know one great
example of things with intelligence and
purpose and that's us and our brains and
our our own human intelligence and so on
question is what what else is like that
and the answer which I had sort of at
first assumed was that well there are
these systems in nature and they do what
they do but sort of human intelligence
is is far beyond anything that sort of
just exists naturally in the world it's
something that's the results of all of
this elaborate process of evolution and
you know all this kind of thing it's a
it's a thing that we can sort of that
really stands apart from the rest of
what exists in the universe what I what
I realized as a result of a whole bunch
of science that I did was that that
isn't the case but that even when we
look at well a funny version of this my
children always give me a hard time for
this particular quote is you know one
says the weather has a mind of its own
well you know that's a sort of an
animistic type statement and it seems
like it has no place in kind of modern
scientific thinking but actually that
statement is not as silly as it at first
seems that's what what to me what what
that's representing is if we think about
a brain what does a brain doing the
brain is taking certain input it's
computing things it's causing certain
actions to happen it's effective at
generating certain output we can think
about all sorts of systems as
effectively doing computations whether
it's a brain whether it's you know a
cloud responding to a different thermal
environment that it finds itself in
these kinds of things and then we can
ask ourselves you know are our brains
doing vastly more sophisticated
computation than happens in these fluids
in the app
or whatever else and I ever first
assumed that the answer that was yes you
know we're we're carefully evolved we're
doing much more sophisticated stuff than
any of the systems in nature but
actually turns out that's not the case
it turns out that there's this sort of
very broad equivalence between the kinds
of computations that different kinds of
systems do and so that that realization
so it makes the the question of human
condition a little bit more poignant
because we're we might say well look
we've you know that's one thing we've
got this we've got we're special we've
got all this intelligence and all this
all these things which which nothing
else can have but that's not true
you know there are all these different
systems in nature that are pretty much
equivalent in terms of their sort of
computational or for that matter
intellectual kinds of capabilities but
then the question that you know what
makes us different from all these things
well what makes us different is the
particulars of our history and our which
gives us our kind of notions of purpose
and goals and so on so this is sort of a
long way of saying when we have the the
Box on the desk that you know thinks as
well as any brain does it the the thing
it doesn't have intrinsically is the
kind of the goals and purposes that we
have because those are really defined by
our particular sauer particular biology
our particular psychology our particular
kind of cultural history and so on so
you know I think that the the thing we
have to think about as we as we sort of
think about sort of the future of these
things is there's goals that's what
humans contribute that's what our
civilization contributes there's
execution of those goals that's what we
can increasingly automate we've been
automating it for thousands of years we
will succeed in having very good
automation of those goals and you know I
spent some significant part of my life
building technology to essentially go
from a human concept of a goal to
something that actually gets done in the
world there are many questions that come
from it so an example of one that I'm
thinking about a lot right now
it's okay we've got these great AIS and
they're able to execute goals but so how
we tell them what to do so one answer to
that is well just talk to them I think
so
you talk to what mouth or Siri or
whatever you know it's we are
understanding the natural language their
human utterances and we're doing
something based on those utterances and
it works pretty well when you're sort of
making a when you're holding up your
phone and you're asking one question
it's a pretty successful way to
communicate to use natural language when
you want to say something longer and
more complicated it doesn't work very
well I just have this experience I've
been interested in teaching programming
to the world and to kids and so on so I
was just writing this book and I was
writing exercises something like very
bizarre thing for me to do done
exercises myself I think in any textbook
but anyway I was writing exercises and
these exercises are typically will
inform you know write a piece of code to
do X ok and at the beginning of the book
when they've done the you know the
exercise are really simple it's pretty
easy to write the English to say I write
a piece of code to make a list of
numbers from 1 to 10 or something by the
end of the book it was getting bizarrely
frustrating because I was thinking this
is the exercise want to write I know
what the code is supposed to be now how
on earth am I going to write a piece of
English text that represents that code
and what I increasingly realized as some
of this text was starting to sound like
you know the language that you would
find in a patent or something like this
you know some very ornate precise you
know kind of stylized English and so the
realization from that is oh the thing
I've spent a lot of part of my life
doing which is building computer
languages it's actually not such a bad
idea
because in a computer language you you
do get to represent you know kinds of
more sophisticated concepts in a clean
way which can be progressively built up
and way that isn't possible in natural
language so one of the things that I'm
interested in there is kind of this
question of ok so how do we how we
communicate goals de-ice how do we talk
to the AI so to speak and that's and my
my basic conclusion is that it's sort of
a mixture human natural language is good
up to a point and human natural language
has evolved to describe what we actually
typically encounter in the world
things that exist from nature things
that we have chosen to build in the
world these are things which in natural
languages have evolved to describe but
there's there's a lot that well there's
a lot that actually exists out there in
the world which in the natural language
has not doesn't have descriptions yet
even though our eye systems might
effectively find those descriptions we
don't have ways to say those ourselves
but also we have a when it comes to
describing more sophisticated things the
kinds of things that people actually
sort of build big programs to do that's
we just you know we we don't have a good
way to describe those things in human
natural language but we can build
languages that that do describe that so
one of the things I've doing that many
different things that have tested in so
an example of a question that um I've
been and curious about recently but I'm
going to get back to there the main the
main thread in a second but one question
I've been interested in is what does the
world looked like when most people can
write code so we have a transition maybe
five years ago or something when you
know from a time when only the scribes
so to speak in a small set of the
population could were literate and put
right you know natural language today a
small fraction of the population can
write code most of the code they can
write is really for computers only it's
not code where any human is expected you
know you don't you don't understand
things by reading code if you know but
there will come a time when when as a
result of things I've tried to do
particularly where the code is high
enough level that it is a sort of
minimal description of what you're
trying to do and it's something where
for example when you have a contract you
write contracts you know they're written
in English you try and write Maine
English as precise as possible you know
there will be a time when most contracts
are written in code where there's a
precise representation that you know it
might be for a cases where it's a
computer says can I use this API to do
this well that's some service level
agreement that's going on there
so isn't a human contract
to human it's something that's written
in piece of code that is understandable
to humans but also executable by the
machines so that you don't you know this
question of whether you know does this
can I do this according to this contract
it's an automatic question and that's
something well you know that's a one
tiny example of how the world starts to
change when sort of most people can
write and read code and I think the
interesting sort of language point is
today we have computer languages which
for the most part are intended for
computers only they're not really
intended for humans to read and
understand they're intended for to tell
computers in detail what to do
and we have natural language which is
intended for human to human
communication and I've been trying to
build this knowledge based language
where it's intended for communication
between humans and machines in a way
where humans can read it and machines
can understand it too and where we're
kind of incorporating a lot of this sort
of existing knowledge of the world into
the language in the same way that in
human natural language we are constantly
sort of incorporating knowledge of the
world into the language because it helps
us in communicating things but so you
know what one branch that I'm really
interested in right now is this question
of what if the world looked like when
most people can read and write code
another you know coming back to the sort
of main question of kind of okay so
what's the future of the humans in the
world where well once we can describe
what we want to do things can get done
kind of automatically so to speak you
know what do the humans do and um there
are you know I've been I've been kind of
interested in one of my hobby projects
is trying to understand the evolution of
human purposes over time so today you
know we've got all kinds of purposes we
we like you know we sit and have a big
discussion about purposes which
presumably has some purpose we you know
we do all the different things that we
do in the world if you look back you
know a thousand years people's purposes
were really different I mean it's like
how do i you know have my food how do I
prevent you know how do I keep myself
you know safe all these
of things which in the you know modern
Western world for the most part you know
those purposes have kind of you know you
don't spend a lot fraction of your life
thinking about those purposes so you
sort of evolved to different kinds of
purposes and the from the point of view
of a thousand years ago some of the
purposes people have today some of the
things people do today will seem utterly
bizarre like like one that that I'm was
I think of what kind of treadmill every
day right now imagine from a thousand
years ago say well somebody's going to
spend you know an hour walking on a
treadmill like what a crazy thing to do
why would one never do that well I think
then you know as we look sort of to them
one of the things that amuses me in
today's world is the fraction of people
who play video games that take them back
to the Middle Ages so to speak so we're
kind of you know we think about so the
question is you know what happens in the
future what do people do in the future
particularly what do people do in a time
when a lot of lot of purposes that we
have today are generated by scarcity of
one kind or another we have you know
there are scarce resources in the world
you know people want to get more of
something so on there is guess time in
our lives and so on you know eventually
those forms of scarcity will disappear I
think the most dramatic discontinuity
will surely be when we achieve effective
human immortality which whether it's
achieved by biology or digitally is not
clear interesting question but that is
something which i think is pretty
inevitably will be achieved and an awful
lot of current human purposes have to do
with well I'm only going to live a
certain time so I'd better get a bunch
of things done so the question that I am
curious about is what does it look like
at a time when when so things can be
executed automatically if you have a if
you have a purpose in the exterior
automatically you don't have the kinds
of drivers for purpose that we have
today what what does it look like and
two people end up you know there are
some bizarre hypotheses one might have
one hypothesis is what people will look
back to a time when there was scarcity
when people could say well what do
people choose to do at that time justice
for a very long part of history and even
to some extent today people look back to
you know to antiquity do you know the
religions created long in the past and
so on and say well you know when those
things were created and you know people
were really have had the important
issues going on let's look at how they
resolve them at that time and one of
them or one of my more bizarre
hypotheses is is today is sort of the
first time in history of which most a
large fraction what goes on the world is
being recorded in some way or another
and so there will be in the future you
know this this is the first time in
which that's been brutally happening and
so one of the you know one of the things
that could happen the future one survey
the current set of purposes aren't
really issues anymore people would say
well at a time when people really did
have you know scarcities of various
kinds what did they choose to do let's
go study that time as carefully as
possible and then every detail of what
we do in our time which ends up getting
recorded ends up becoming sort of
further for well that's what it really
means to be a human with purposes let's
go do what they did in 2015 or whatever
I think that's a slightly you know I
think that's a slightly extreme version
although you know but when we look at
the the large span of history and going
back to the kinds of places people who
look to you know purposes from a few
thousand years ago it's not quite as
crazy as it might have first seen but
you know I think one of the issues is
one of the things I I would like to have
a a great answer to is okay so what do
the you know derivatives of humans of
the future what do they end up choosing
to do with themselves and it's some you
know one of the one of the potential bad
outcomes is well they're just playing
video games all the time you know would
be that the future of civilization is
everybody's playing video games you know
they're playing World of Warcraft of the
future so to speak the sort of the
history of AI it's kind of a it's a
funny history and it's sort of an
evolving word in its use in in in
technical language so to speak in these
years
AI is very popular in people
some idea of what it means so we can
talk about AI and people have some
actually what we're talking about I
watched this evolution over the course
of probably was it must be basically 40
years now and it's gone from being well
in the sixties before I was aware of
what was going on
everybody thought let me even go further
back back when computers were first
being developed in the 1940s and 1950s
the typical title of a book about
computers are in order an article about
computers in newspaper was giant
electronic brains the idea was that just
as things like bulldozers have automated
and steam engines and so on automated
mechanical work so computers will
automate intellectual work there'll be a
a giant art tranq brain that promise
turned out to be harder than people
expected people didn't know what was
involved in making brain like activity
and it turned out was very easy now
they're even like kung they're amusing
movies from 1950s computers as a eyes
got into sort of science fiction ish
portrayals from long ago
that's one cute wonderful desk set which
is about basically an IBM computer being
installed in some company and making
everybody not have a job to do and so on
it's kind of cute because the computer
gets asked a bunch of reference library
questions and it's movie and done so as
we were building Wolfram Alpha one of
the questions was can we do all of the
reference library questions from the
desk set movie back in 53 or whatever it
was and actually we could do them all
finally in 2009 turn the thing that that
happened was so there was first a great
deal of optimism that we could automate
intellectual work in the same way as
we've been able to automate mechanical
work and a lot of government money got
spent on that in the early 1960s and so
on and it basically just didn't work and
and things happened like there was this
particular approach to well normal
networks have been discussed
particularly by McCulloch and Pitt's in
1943 and they've kind of come up with
this model for
for how how brains conceptually formally
might work and they made the observation
that they're sort of brain like model
would correspond to being able to do
kinds of computations like Turing
machines and they had the idea of they
knew about the universal Turing machine
idea from Alan Turing from 1936 and so
from that it came emerged well we can
make these brain like neural networks
that will be able to be general
computers in fact that thinking was the
way that Turin's work on universal
computation flowed into the practical
work that was done by the Antioch folk
and by men and people like that on
practical computers it didn't come the
record from Turing machines it came
through this sort of sight road of
neural networks but then people didn't
they set up simple neural networks and
the simple neural of books didn't do
terribly interesting things there's a
guy called Frank Rosenblatt who invented
these things called perceptrons which
were kind of one layer they're all
networks and then there's sort of
terrible thing that happened in the 60s
to neural networks was Marvin Minsky and
Seymour Papert wrote this book called
perceptrons where they basically proved
that perceptrons couldn't do anything
interesting which is correct that proof
was absolutely correct they can only
make sort of linear distinctions between
things the problem was that people and
this is a typical sort of academic trait
or something that people said well these
guys have written a proof that these
neural networks not do anything
interesting therefore no neural networks
can do anything interesting so let's
forget about neuron that works and so
that that happened for a while meanwhile
there was sort of an old there were
there were these couple of different
approaches to AI one base stones that
are really understanding at a formal
level sort of symbolically how does the
world work the other based on kind of
doing statistics and kind of
probabilistic kinds of things and there
was sort of a a well are we going to be
able to do symbolic AI and one of the
sort of test cases of that is can we
teach a computer to do to do something
like integrals teach a computer to do
calculus that was sort of a a test case
from the late 1960s AI and then there
were things like machine translation
that people thought would be
good example of what computers could do
things like this anyway the basic bottom
line was by the I guess the early
seventies that started kind of crashed
and there was a phase where there would
be sensible exploit systems which were
the next round of AI which came up in
the late seventies early eighties which
were sort of teach the Machine from a
human have a machine learn the rules
that an expert users to figure out what
to do and so on kind of petered out fact
my my first company ended up somewhat
against my wishes going into somewhat
into that direction in the end may kiss
the the that was some that was the next
phase and then kind of AI kind of became
this crazy sort of phone nobody really
does that it's a fake thing that doesn't
you know there's nothing interesting
that but for quite a long time there's
been a this question of AI I myself have
been interested in some how do you make
an AI like thing since I was a kid
basically which is depressingly long
time ago now term I was interested in
particular and how do you sort of take
the knowledge that as humans accumulate
or have accumulated in our civilization
how do you automate kind of answering
questions on the basis of this knowledge
and so on and I thought about this first
actually around 1980 and I sort of
thought about how do you do that sort of
symbolically by actually building a
systematic system that can break down
questions and turn them into symbolic
things and answer them or and I kind of
concluded well to really do this well we
have to have sort of a brain like thing
that involves sort of fuzzy questions
fuzzy answers these kinds of things and
I thought you know building a brain is
kind of hard I've worked on it a bit I
you know worked on dawn that looks even
at that time doesn't really make much
interesting progress kind of put it
aside for a while I kind of have this
approach of having these you know
difficult projects which I try to think
about every some number of years and try
and figure out you know is the world
it's the ambient technology and the
world ready to actually do this
now and so I backin now in the mid you
know 2002 3 ish timeframe I was like
okay I should think about this you know
make a sort of computational knowledge
system I should think about that
question again what does it take do it
and I realized that actually the science
that I had done pretty much showed that
my original belief about how long had to
do this was completely wrong in my
original belief had been in order to
make a serious sort of computational
knowledge system you first have to build
a brain like thing then you have to feed
it knowledge just like we learn things
in a standard education and then you'll
have sort of a good computational
knowledge system but what I realized as
a result of a bunch of science that I
done was that sort of there wasn't this
was talking about earlier learning that
there isn't sort of this bright line
between what is intelligent and what is
merely computational it kind of assumed
that there was some magic thing so the
you know that the transistor of
intelligence or something there was this
sort of magic mechanism that allows us
to be you know vastly more capable than
the other thing but it's merely
computational and it turned out what I
kind of showed scientifically that's
just not the case so you know one of the
challenges always in in something like
me at least is how do you take this kind
of basic science sort of almost
philosophical conclusions and actually
decide to do something on the basis of
do you actually you know take that
philosophical dog food and believe in it
and for me taking that was okay so I
actually build technology if it's
possible to do this actually build a
technology stack that actually does it
and so that's what led to a mouthful for
example and what I discovered from that
is that yes it really works to be able
to take a a large collection of sort of
acknowledgement in the world and
automatically answer questions on the
basis of it using what are essentially
merely computational techniques now
there's a footnote to that which is kind
of an important footnote which is that
when one thinks of what is merely
computational one often thinks okay
one's writing the program
how does one write a program well a
programmer sits down and they say I want
to write a program that does this
alright this module I'll write that
module I think about you know how am I
going to achieve what I'm well I'm
trying to achieve with this program
memory every sort of step has you know
it's I'm taking one step at a time to
get to where I'm to go the the what I
discovered was that was sort of an
alternative way to do engineering which
is something much more analogous to what
biology does in an evolution and so on
which is just to say out there in this
computational universe of possible
programs as an infinite number of
possible programs if you just go out and
look in that in that space of possible
programs even just look at random at a
trillion programs and say what do these
programs do one might have thought that
programs which are simple enough that
one can actually have good coverage of
so all possible programs were given kind
but might think that one just none of
them would do anything interesting
they'd all be just simple programs that
do simple things who cares but actually
what I had found scientifically was that
that wasn't the case and that even very
simple programs particularly I looked at
Southern automata but also Turing
machines lots of other kinds of things
even very simple examples of those kinds
of programs can already do very
sophisticated things and one of my
conclusions was that's really
interesting in terms of understanding
how nature works but that's also
important in terms of finding technology
in effect what we what we normally do
when we build a program is we sort of
build step by step as piece of
technology the other thing we can do is
just go out into the computational
universe and mine technology out of the
computational universe you know
typically the challenge is the same
challenge that we face in doing physical
mining that is we go we find this
amazing supply of I don't know let's say
iron with magnetic properties or cobalt
or something that some gadolinium with
some special magnetic properties say
okay great it has these wonderful
magnetic properties what do we do with
this well the question is can we connect
that that capability to an actual human
purpose something that a goal that we
have to something we want a technology
in the case of magnetic materials we
have plenty of ways to do that what we
find is that there are all sorts of
wonderful things in nature the question
is can we in train them into our
technology by finding some useful human
purpose that they achieve and in terms
of programs sort of the same story there
are all kinds of programs out there even
very tiny programs that do very
complicated things the question is can
we in train them for some useful human
purpose and this is a thing that we
learned have do have you know given a
particular purpose given a particular
goal just go exhaustively search a
trillion programs and find one that does
a useful thing for that purpose and
sometimes those programs are doing
things like making random number
generators hash coding systems doing
things that have to do with natural
language understanding sometimes they're
doing more creative things like one
thing we did but years ago now was
having a music generation system why you
just basically press a button will go
search a big space of programs it will
find a program that according to the
same heuristic matches some particular
musical style and we'll play you that
sort of an interesting case actually
this is a case of kind of automated
creativity people say well you've got
these machines they'll never be you know
if there's one thing that humans are
better at it's it's being creative
actually the thing that I find most
interesting with that is a creation site
is that I had kind of assumed that
people would say oh you know I need some
inspiration you know composers and so on
would say I need some inspiration about
my composition and then maybe I can
dress up that inspiration using a
computer but instead I run into people
who say it's kind of a nice site that
you have I go there to get inspiration
that's some kind of you know a little
core of a tune which I then dress up as
a human to make it be meaningful and put
it into what I'm trying to do so it's
kind of a case where you know we're
seeing that this attribute of sort of
originality creativity is something that
is is is readily available in its
computational universe it's so the same
thing as saying you know go out into the
physical world and go find these these
beautiful places to photograph so to
speak in the world they exist already
the question of us picking one we care
about to look at but I mean back backing
up to this question of so what sort of
the the arc of AI so one of the things
that we discovered was that it really
does as a practical engineering matter
there's really a lot that you can do by
basically discovering programs in the
computational universe of possibilities
rather than merely building a program
step by step what we also spend a lot of
time doing is building this thing called
language which is this knowledge-based
language which tries to sort of
incorporate the knowledge of the world
right into the language so so kind of
the traditional approach of computer
languages is to say let's make a little
computer language that represents the
operations that computers intrinsically
know how to do allocating memory you
know setting values of variables you
know iterating other things changing
program counters whatever else is so the
slightly higher level version of that
but it's fundamentally once once telling
computers to do things in their own
terms and that's been kind of the
tradition of basic programming languages
for 50 years my theory about these
things is let's try and make a language
which handles not so the computers but
to the humans and try to make a language
where the languages as much as possible
just being able to take kind of what the
humans think of and convert it into some
form that the computers can understand
and part of what the humans think of is
the humans know of the world they know
about you know the existence of
Cambridge Massachusetts or they know
something about you know that there'll
be a sunrise tomorrow type thing and the
question is can you encapsulate the
knowledge that we've accumulated both in
science and in the collection of data in
the world into a language which we can
use to to communicate with computers and
and that's sort of the big achievement
of my last 30 years or something has
been to be able to do that and one of
the things that the significant there is
when you're trying to solve the sort of
problem of doing computational knowledge
having such a language
that's the way you need to encode sort
of things about the world and things you
can you can do in the world but in terms
of the sort of the arc of AI so one sort
of set of things that would be
considered sort of very a iishe is being
able to take the knowledge of the world
and be able to answer questions on the
basis of the knowledge of the one has of
the world being able to and so you know
there's a whole list of things people
with seven six days you know when we can
do this we'll know we have AI when we
can do a some you know an interval like
from a calculus course when we can do
this than that well know we have AI or
we can sort of do a conversation with a
computer and have it seem like a human
well you know at this point one of the
things that had seemed to be difficult
there was well gosh the computers
doesn't know enough about the world you
know you start asking they you know the
computer what day of the week is it I
might be able to answer that whose
president probably can't answer that
these kinds of things and at that point
you kind of know you're talking to a
computer not to a person at this point
but it comes to these sort of Turing
test conversational tests of AI people
who've tried connecting for example of
an alpha to the Turing test boss they
lose every time because we really have
to do is start asking it sophisticated
questions and it can answer them and not
even can do that at the time you've
asked it a few different you know
disparate kinds of questions
there'll be no human that that knows all
of those things yeah
the system can know them so in that
sense we've you know we've achieved
really good AI at that level
now there's another branch which is
there's certain kinds of tasks that are
sort of very easy for humans that have
traditionally been very hard for
machines standard one is visual object
identification what is this thing I we
can know what this is we have some easy
description of it but the computer is
just hopeless of that well in the last
basically year I've completely changed
so for example in in march/april
sometimes over the spring we brought out
a little image identification system
website etc and by
companies have done somewhat similar
things I think I was very somewhat
interesting reasons other people's it
doesn't deserve to be better but it
happens to be somewhat better um it and
what it does is you show it something
and for about 10,000 kinds of things it
will tell you what it is and it does a
pretty good job you know you can it's
it's fun to try and confuse it it's fun
to show it an abstract painting and see
what thinks it is but it basically does
a pretty good job of saying what it is
how does it work it works using the
exact same technology basically that
McCulloch and Pitt's kind of imagined in
1943 lots of us worked on in the early
eighties but no one that works and so
question is what was it what what
happened that made it work now didn't
let it work that well if you look at
what the system actually does today
there it may need 5,000 controllable
nouns in English common nouns which you
can make pictures of maybe 10,000 if you
include so much specialized things like
special kinds of plants and peoples and
things that people can with some
frequency recognize well the thing that
we can now do is we you know we train it
on 30 million images of all these kinds
of things and it's this big complicated
messy neural network probably doesn't
matter much what the details of that
neuron network are we do this training
takes about a quadrillion GPU operations
to do the training and at the end of it
it does a pretty good job of recognizing
10,000 kinds of things and we as humans
are impressed by this because it's
pretty much what we humans can do and it
pretty much had about the same training
data that we have it's about the same
number of images that you know a human
would see in the first couple of years
of their life it's about the same number
of operations that have to be done to do
the training it's about the same number
of neurons and the kind of at least the
first levels of our visual cortex the
details are all different the actual way
that these artificial neurons work is is
little to do with the way that that
actual neurons in the brain work but
it's conceptually similar and there's a
certain kind of user you know a salty to
what's going on that you have this
essentially a really what it is at a
sort of more mathematical level it's
it's this
that's a composition of a very large
number of functions that have certain
continuity properties that allow you to
effectively use calculus methods to
incremental a train the thing and once
you have those attributes you you it
seems can end up with something that
does the same kind of job that we do in
doing the geologic recognition and you
know it's actually interesting because
back in the 80s people have very
successfully done OCR optical character
recognition so they were able to take
you know the 26 letters of the English
alphabet and so on and say okay is that
a is that B is that a C and so on that
could be done for 26 different
possibilities but it couldn't be done
for 10,000 possibilities it's really
just a matter of the scale of the whole
system that makes that possible today as
a kind of a a have we talked to AI yet
um you know this is these are important
components I mean there are basically a
few of these this there's no object
recognition
there's voice to text and there's
language translation and those are kind
of three kinds of things which humans
manage to do with varying degrees of
difficulty I can't do language
translation for any I mean human
language really may be massive a little
bit but you know people can learn to do
human language translation
um these other two you know voice to
text well people learn to do that and
there's a lot of recognition people are
sort of they learn the first couple
years of life like it or not to do that
so so the thing that we're these become
essentially these are these are some of
the missing links to how do we make
machines that are kind of human-like in
what they do and for me one of the
interesting things has been sort of
incorporating those capabilities into a
precise kind of symbolic language and
there's a whole lot of stuff to say
about some that is a kind of a 500-year
story about what we now need to do in
terms of having a symbolic language to
represent the everyday world we now have
the capability to say you know this is a
glass of water or something now we
actually have to find a good but we can
we can go from picture of glass of water
to the concept of a glass of water now
we have to
have some actual symbolic language to
represent those things and you know in
my own efforts I you know started off
trying to represent kind of mathematical
technical kinds of knowledge and then
went on to lots of other kinds of
knowledge I'm sort of I think we've got
a pretty good job done now of sort of
systematic objective knowledge in the
world now the question is to represent
kind of everyday discourse and the kinds
of things that people say to each other
in a precise symbolic way and there are
certain kinds of you know you might have
enough in a precise symbolic
representation you might say X is
greater than 5 okay that's a sort of
predicate you might also say you know I
want a piece of chocolate that's also a
predicate it has the but it has an I
want in it rather than a you know sort
of chocolate has higher calorie value
that and such and such and so we have to
try to find a sort of symbolic
representation a precise representation
of these kinds of things that we have
traditionally expressed in in human
natural language and actually I've been
interested in this this is one of the
things like thinking about these days
and it's kind of kind of interesting
because I you know I'm I like I like to
do my homework and I like to find out
what other people figured out about this
so I start reading literature about this
and most of the literature points back
to the 1600s and there was a lot of
people like wide nets in the late 1600s
and I got John Wilkins these were the
people who had there's this period when
there were these things that they called
philosophical languages and the idea of
a philosophical language would be it was
essentially what I'm now trying to do as
a symbolic representation of the world
but one thing that I really like is I
look at the philosophical language of
John Wilkins and you know you can see
how did he divide things that were
important in the world and it's both
it's somewhat sobering but somewhat
pleasing in some ways some aspects of
the human condition have been the same
since the sixteen hundreds that's the
same types of issues that come up and
some are very different I mean the the
whole section on on you know depth and
various forms of human suffering is huge
at that time and in sort of today's
ontology would look a lot smaller big
achievement there are also other
other aspects of it's interesting to see
you know how would a philosophical
language of today differ from a
philosophical language from the mid
1600s this is a this is a measure of
progress I think to see to see how that
you know what kind of difference there
is that you know so this is one of the
things that I'd like to be able to do is
to have a sort of symbolic
representation of everyday discourse in
the way that we now have a symbolic
representation of sort of systematic
discourse it's that there are many of
these sort of attempts at formalization
that have happened over the years you
know I think in in mathematics for
example Whitehead and russell 1910
principia mathematica that was the sort
of the great effort to the most the most
the biggest show of effort at least had
been previous efforts by Frager and NPR
know that were a little more modest in
their in their presentation to try and
see how would you formalize in that case
mathematics in a precise system it's
sort of interesting what they managed to
do right what they did wrong ultimately
they were wrong in the idea of what they
thought they should formalize they
thought they should formalize some kind
of process of mathematical proof which
turns out not to be the thing that most
people care about but you had asked
about what will be in modern Turing test
or will be a modern analog with your
intestines the interesting question I
mean I think that the sort of the they
being able to have the conversational
BOTS which is kind of Turing's idea
that's definitely still out there that
one hasn't been solved yet it will be
solved the only question is what's the
application for which it has solved and
for a long time I have been you know
kind of like like a why do we care type
thing because I was thinking the number
one application was going to be customer
service and well that's a great
application it's you know in terms of a
a my favorite way to spend my life that
isn't particularly high enough on the
list what I realized though about the
Turing test and things like customer
service because customer services is
precisely one of these places where
you're trying to interface between you
know you're trying to have a sort of
conversational thing happen one thing I
realized is that the one big difference
between
time and our time is that our method of
communicating with computers there's one
huge difference which is in his time
what he imagined was it's a conversation
you say some things to it or you type
some things to it type some stuff back
in today's world it shows you a screen
back and actually the the case that I
was curious to see a few years ago was
you know you go to a movie theater
there's you know you can buy a movie
ticket from a person and buy a movie
ticket from a machine so there was the
question of at what point you know
people like me you always like to use
the latest you know techno toys you know
as soon as those things appear to movie
theaters right I was using the Machine
only and for a long time there's nobody
else using the Machine and then in urban
movie theaters you started to see more
and more people using machines and and
now most people I think use the machines
but one thing it's interesting about
those machines is how is the transaction
with the Machine different from the
transaction of the human and the main
answer is there's a visible display on
the machine so you know you say you know
it's it might ask you something that you
just press a button you can see
immediately you know you can use your
eyes to understand something the visual
system to interpret something it's a
little different and so for example
North nothi you know if you ask it
something and like you know in when it's
used inside Siri Siri if there is a
short answer we'll say back the answer
the short answer to you what most people
want is the visual display of the big
report that shows you know that the
infographic of this or that so this is a
this is something which is sort of
interesting because it's it's a non
human form of communication that turns
out to be richer than traditional human
communication that is you know if we
were all incredibly fast perfect artists
we could you know as we're talking we
could draw them infographic and say this
is what I'm talking about but in fact in
most human human communication where
we're left with pure language whereas in
human to computer to human communication
we have this much higher bandwidth
channel of visual communication that
turns out to be important and so so the
traditional Turing test I think is a
little bit it's all funny because many
of the most powerful applications kind
of fall away because
have this additional communication
channel so you know I've been interested
so for example here's one that we're
actually trying to pursue right now is a
a bot to communicate about writing
programs so you say I wanna write this
program I wanted to do this says you
know it'll say well I'm written this
little piece of program is what it does
is this what you want
blah blah blah it's a kind of a back and
forth but there's also other kinds of
bots that we've looked at other things
like tutoring BOTS or it's like okay you
know you should understand this piece of
chemistry or something and how do you
you know and that's interesting because
it's actually actually kind of a an
interesting problem because you have to
make a model of the human that is if
you're trying to explain now what's the
right thing to say at this point you
know do you explain this okay what is
the human confused about you have to
have a model of the human to know what
they're confused about and so on I think
it's a no but but well it's been
difficult for me to understand it is in
the case of you know when do you achieve
a sort of Turing test AI type of thing
it's like as there's there isn't the
right motivation there's not the right
you know one could as a toy one could
make a little chat bot that people can
chat with but I don't think and I think
that will be the next kind of you know
we can see the current round of deep
learning particularly recurrent neural
networks and so on I can make pretty
good models of human speech and so I'm
human writing and so on so it's pretty
easy to type in you know you say how are
you feeling today and it kind of knows
that most of the time when somebody asks
somebody how are you feeling today this
is the type of response you did and you
know for example one of the one of the
toys actually playing over but I want to
figure out what I can automate
responding to my email I know the answer
is now the sign when you know a good
Turing test for me will be why can I
have a bottle respond to most my email
and it's um this is a and that's sort of
an interesting you know there
that's a it's a tough test because some
you know some aspects of email like a I
don't care about this throw in the spam
folder type thing that's comparatively
easy but if it's somebody says you know
what should we do about this
inconsistency in some design of our
product of this and that and the other
to be able to answer that in any way
that's um you know to be able to say do
you approve this thing to be able to
answer that with any reasonable degree
of confidence is hard and the thing to
realize about that is most of those
answers one has to learn them from the
human that the email is connected to
those big I mean I I I think I might be
a little bit of ahead of the game
because I've been collecting data on
myself for a it's not about twenty-five
years so I have I have every piece of
email every keystroke I've typed for
every piece of email for 25 years of a
keystroke but maybe twenty years or
something and lots of others other stuff
like that so so in a sense I should be
able to train an avatar in AI that you
know will do what I can do perhaps
better than me you know more easily the
most you know one of things I think is
kind of interesting think about it is in
a world where a eyes are figuring out a
lot of stuff for us people worry about
the scenario oh my gosh the a eyes are
going to take over my belief about that
scenario is that something much more in
a sense amusing will happen at least
first which is it will quickly become
the case that the AI can figure out it
knows what you intend to do what you
want to do and it's really good at
figuring out how to get there
and so just like you know with a car GPS
we tell it we want to go to this
destination and people like me just I
don't know where the heck I am I just
follow my GPS years ago when GPS is were
much younger I've learned two things my
children are always amused by the fact
that I had a very early GPS and was like
drive drive this way this way this way
we actually were on a on one of these
piers going out into Boston Harbor that
was
it's like I just follow the GPS but you
know what will happen what to the point
is is that Oh there'll be a an AI that
knows our history and knows oh yeah
you'll probably go to you know on this
on this menu you're probably going to
want all of this or on this you know
you're talking to this person you should
talk to them about this you know I've
looked at your interests I know
something about their interests these
are the common interests that you have
you know these are some great topics
that you can talk to them about um and
more and more you know people the AIS
will suggest what we should do and I
suspect people most of the time just
follow what their eyes tell them to do
because they're probably better than
what they figured out for themselves so
I think I mean you know to me this is
the AI take of a scenario that happens
is the laziness of the humans it's not
really laziness it's like take good
advice you know the AI is telling you
what to do it's better than what you
would have figured out for yourself just
do what the AI says it's a you know
there's a sort of a complicated
interaction of in terms of Technology
and so on it's this this question of
that you know you can do terrible things
with technology you can do good things
with technology people will always be
people and some people will try and do
terrible things with technology and some
people will try and do good things with
technology I think one of the things
that I really like about technology
today is the kind of equalization that
it's produced across lots of kinds of
people I mean there was a time when I
used to be very proud that I had the
best computer of anybody on you but now
I have the same computer that's pretty
much anybody I know
I'm you know we have the same
smartphones and pretty much the same
technology can be used by a decent
fraction of the 7 billion people you
know that exist
um it's not perfectly flat but it's it's
reasonably flat and I think we'll see
the same type of thing
of other areas of Technology whether
it's medical technology other kinds of
things well you know in a sense I don't
know whether it's luck or whether it has
to be that way that these you know these
pieces of technology that one's
producing are very broadly you know can
be very brutally available it's not the
case that there's a sort of the king's
technology is different from everybody
else's technology and I think that's a
that's an important thing now in terms
of how I mean one of the things that I I
always notice because you know we we
make stuff that we sell to people and
people use all over the world and you
know I've sometimes we've even thought
about publishing these indices of how
much does Mathematica get used how much
does Wolfram Alpha get used in different
countries about world because you know a
huge amount you know which cities and
you know you know all kinds of stuff but
you know their countries which are
really very technologically
sophisticated there are countries where
they really not you know there and I
think you know we can and so it's sort
of an interesting thing to me today the
great frontier I think you know five
hundred years ago was literacy today
it's doing programming of some kind
today's programming will be obsolete and
not very long in other words for example
when I was first using computers in the
70s people would say well if you're
really a serious programmer you're going
to be using a seminal language now I
often ask these computer science
graduates did you learn assembly
language well yes I have knows of
section one class about assembly
language okay why do people not learn
assembly language because basically
computers are better at writing assembly
language than humans are and it's only a
very small set of people who need to
know the details of how you know
language gets compiled into a standard
language and so on well a lot of what's
being done by armies of programmers
today is similarly mundane it's tough
where the goals can be described much
more succinctly and it turns into some
giant blob of Java code of JavaScript
code on
and there's actually no good reason for
humans to do writing all that stuff you
know that's what people like me trying
to do is to automate that so that we can
automate the process of programming so
what's really important is just going
from what the human wants to do to
getting the machine as automatically as
possible to get that done now the thing
that's interesting right now one of the
things I'm really interested in right at
this moment is this sort of the
equalization that this is producing
because it means that in the past if you
wanted to write a serious piece of code
a program that did something important
and real there was a lot of work you
have to you know you have to really know
quite a bit about software engineering
you had to invest you know months of
time in it you had to you know if you
were some you know you'd have to hire
programmers who knew this you have to
learn yourself whatever big investment
now you know the big achievement from
having automated a lot of the stack is
that's not true anymore you know a
one-line piece of code even a thing you
can tweet sometimes already does
something interesting and useful and
that means that it sort of unlocks a
vast range of people who couldn't
previously make computers do what they
do things for them to let them make
computers do things for them and so now
what happens well so one things I'm
interested in is is at this point kids
and fancy professionals are really at
the same level in terms of what they can
do in terms of teaching computers what
I'm showing computers were telling
computers what to what to do for them
and so now one of the things I'm
interested in is how do you how do you
teach that kind of computational
thinking and programming to a broader
range of people in the world as possible
and one of my sort of little private
things I really would like to see is for
there to be you know a large number of
random kids around the world and random
countries who learn so that the new kind
of capabilities of knowledge-based
programming and so on and get to the
point where they can produce code
effectively that's as sophisticated as
anybody you know in the fanciest kind of
most educated places can and I think
that's a I think this is within reach I
think we've got to a point where so if
anybody can learn to do sort of
knowledge based programming and more
importantly can learn to think
computationally because the actual
mechanics of the programming are pretty
easy now what's difficult is imagining
things in a computational way and
thinking through how do we you know how
do we how do we conceptualize this
activity that we have in some
computational way and so one of the
things I'm interested in is how do you
how do you teach computational thinking
and this is you know we've had I mean
mathematics for example there's a
thousand years of history about how we
teach mathematical thinking and we know
to the level of you know which chapter
of the book goes here and there it's
like I was just asking yesterday
actually might we're talking about some
for some initiative we have I was was
asking about calculus books I think they
always have 14 chapters if I'm not
mistaken I asked how long if they have
those same 14 chapters and the claim was
that that the very first calculus book
written by Colin occurring in 1727 had
some of the same structure many of the
examples were the same so it's been
something which has been developed over
over a long period of time
and is very precisely known sort of how
you feed mathematics to humans so a
couple of points to make first of all in
the case of you know if you're writing
Wolfram language code and I'm ultimately
responsible for the design and structure
of how the language works in the case of
you know DNA code and biology there's
nobody who can point to and say you're
responsible for you know you designed
this it's something that has evolved
over a long period of time and much like
a human natural language it is going to
have some degree of there's some degree
of complexity and on what it's going to
do when you have a design language the
what you know it's it should do what the
designer thought it should do now which
is not to say that it isn't super useful
to program living systems not least
because we are living systems and
because living systems are the
universe's well the only
example we know a successful molecular
computing we may you know there may come
a time when we've managed to engineer
things when we managed to design a
lifelike thing that is as designed as a
computer languages today but that's
we're not at that point so we have to
you know we have to be using the
molecular computer that we have which is
you know our biology now in terms of of
how to do that programming I think it's
a super interesting question I think
that's been kind of you know if you look
at the nanotechnology tradition there's
been this kind of idea how do we achieve
in our technology answer you know we
take technology as we understand it in
large scale today and we make it very
very small so we we say you know how can
we make a CPU chip that is you know on
an atomic scale well where you'll like
it mechanically but fundamentally we're
using the same architecture as a CPU
ship that we kind of know and love um I
think that that isn't the only approach
one can take and you know a lot of the
things I've done looking at simple
programs and what they do suggests that
you can have even very very simple very
kind of impoverished components and with
the right compiler effectively you can
make them do very interesting things and
I think that is my own guesses are sort
of I there's one of these projects sort
of doing molecular scale computing that
I've wanted to do for so long I just
don't quite think that the ambient
technologies to the point where one
wouldn't have to spend a decade you know
building ambient technology to get to
the point I'm kind of hoping that there
were almost of the day when it's
possible for for you know somebody like
me who isn't going to build all that
ambient technology to actually do
something with moto computing but I
think my I guess about how how one would
do that how one could do that is to say
okay we've got these components these
components are enough to make a
universal computer and you might say
well I don't know how to program with
these components but by doing sort of
searches in space of possible programs
and so on one starts to build up a you
know building blocks that one can then
create a compiler for it and the
surprising thing is that surprisingly
impoverished stuff is capable of doing
sophisticated things and the compilation
step isn't
Muhsin as one might expect in other
words one might think oh gosh if if it's
only you know a little I don't know like
I have this very tiny Turing machine
that's the simplest universal Turing
machine that has two states and three
colors and has a little tiny rule that
you could write it in English it
probably a sentence long sentence long
but you could make a picture of it it's
really tiny and simple um that Turing
machine you might ask the question how
can I actually compile a program that I
might care about down to that Turing
machine haven't done it but I think that
what one will find is that there's a
layer of nasty messy sort of machine
code and then above that it gets pretty
simple and that that layer of nasty
messy machine code will be will add some
inefficiency maybe a factor of 10,000
maybe more but a factor of 10,000 is
nothing when you're dealing with the
scale of molecules as compared to sort
of large scale things and so you know I
guess my own prejudice and thought would
be that so that the searching a
computational universe and trying to
sort of find programs that are
interesting fine building blocks that
are interesting is a good approach I
think that a more traditional
engineering approach that says you know
let's try to by pure thought figure out
how we build stuff my guess is that's a
that's a harder road to hoe it doesn't
mean it can't be done but my guess is
that one will be able to do some really
amazing things by just saying these are
the components we have a good
representation for them what can we now
let's search the possible programs we
can make with these things now welcoming
out now the question is one might say
well we can get this combination of
molecules will do all kinds of fun
things it will make this big blob of
stuff that will do this it will do that
you might say but what do we care and
then we have to answer the question you
know it's back to this question about
connecting kind of human purposes to
what is available from from the system
you know what one question is what what
does the world look like when many
people know how to code coding as a form
of expression just like English writing
as a form of expression you know men
to me some simple pieces of code are
quite poetic you know they express ideas
in a very clean way that's very you look
at and say ah that's that's there's this
kind of a an aesthetic thing much as
there is to expression in a natural
language um but now now in general what
we're seeing is is sort of this way of
this way of expressing yourself you can
express yourself in natural language you
get the best result by drawing a picture
you can express yourself in code one
feature of code is that it's immediately
executable it's not like when you write
something somebody has to read it and
the brain that's reading it has to
separately absorb the thoughts that came
from the person was writing it I mean a
thing I've realized again one of the
things I'm I'm thinking about right now
that's I'm very frustrated I can't
figure out I'm just sort of on the cusp
but I haven't got that yet so what I
realized is that you look at sort of how
knowledge is transmitted in the history
of the world so to speak one form of
knowledge transmission is essentially
genetic that is you have an organism and
you know it's progeny has the same
features that it had okay so that sort
of level 0 level 1 is the kind of
knowledge transmission that happens with
things like visual object recognition
where the new critter is born it has
some girl network the neuron network
doesn't have anything you know it has
sort of random connections in it as the
critter goes around the world and it
starts recognizing different kinds of
objects and it learns that knowledge so
it's kind of something which without
sort of without any and that's what
throughout the animal kingdom
you know critters have been learning as
object recognition is that sort of the
next level of knowledge then as a level
of knowledge that was sort of a big
achievement of our species which is
natural language the ability to take
knowledge and represent it abstractly
enough that we can communicate it sort
of this in a disembodied way brain to
brain so to speak that we don't have to
the individual brain doesn't have to
relearn from the raw material the the
knowledge can be taken out strata and
can be
to the next brain downline so to speak
and you know arguably the the natural
language it's kind of you know arguably
the most important inventions of our
species and in human history and it's
what led to in many respects our
civilization and many many other things
so it's like really important well now
we've actually got another level of this
which is with and probably one day it
will have a more interesting name
but with essentially knowledge-based
programming and so on we have a way of
taking a representation of knowledge in
the world it's an actual representation
of the world it's not just a mathematics
sort of computer language or something
it's a thing that represents you know
real things in the world but it does so
in a precise symbolic way that has this
feature that not only is it
understandable by brains and communicate
with other brains and to computers it's
also immediately executable and I pretty
sure that this is really a big deal and
in a pretty sure that just as in some
respects natural language gave us
civilization that's the question of what
will knowledge-based programming give us
and B you know one bad answer is it will
give us the civilization of the AIS that
would be kind of disappointing for the
humans that's kind of what we don't want
to have happen because there could be a
point at which the AI is a did a great
job they're communicating with each
other they're they're doing all these
kinds of things and we're pretty much
left out of it because we don't have
there's no intermediate language there's
no nothing sort of interfaces with our
brains anyway so one of the questions
that I'm I'm super interested in right
now is this question of in this sort of
fourth level of knowledge communication
what you know what is the big thing that
that would lead to it I kind of think
you know if you were you know caveman
allgo something and you were just
realizing the language was starting it's
like could you imagine civilization from
that point and it's you know you'd have
to and I I feel like what what should we
be imagining right now and you know this
relates to this question even for humans
and most people could code what would
the world look like and there are
clearly many trivial things that would
you know contracts are written in code
you know restaurant menus might be
written in code and you could say you
know this is how the food's getting made
okay I want to change this piece and
that piece it's on things like this
there are things that sort of simple
things like that that change I think
probably they're much more profound
things that change mean they're you know
the rise of literacy gave us some things
that were chemists bureaucracy for
example which didn't really you know it
had existed in the past but I think it
dramatically accelerated the the
bureaucracy for metal worse gave us I
think sort of greater depth of you know
of governmental systems and so on for
better or worse but I think the and so
you know there's a question what does
that look like in the case where most
people could can code now when you when
you ask about you know how does the sort
of the coding world relate to the
cultural world well so one of the things
I've been thinking about recently is
when you think about for example high
school education and there's a question
of okay you know how do you teach
programming coding and that kind of
thing computational thinking a high
school level and one of the
possibilities is well you have a course
about that and you tack it onto all the
many many many things that people are
being taught today the other
possibilities it's much more interesting
is you just rethink all the existing
areas and you say well if we also have
computational thinking how does that
affect how we study history how does
that affect how we study languages
social studies whatever else and the
answer is it has great effect I mean in
there's a lot of things that you can for
example imagine you know you're writing
your essay today the raw material for a
typical kids essay is well I read
something and this is the raw material
and I'm going to write what I think
about that it is not the case that kids
can generate new knowledge very easily
but so then the computational world
that's no longer true it's very
straightforward for a kid to go and you
know if they know something about
writing code to go over to the you know
beautifully digitized historical data
and so on and he'll figure out something
new and then you're writing an essay
about something where you say this is
what I discovered today so to speak
I can write an essay about it I think
that's that's part of the the way that
you know I don't think it's sterile at
all the waiting this is the achievement
of knowledge based programming it's no
longer sterile and the reason is because
it's got the knowledge of the world sort
of knitted into the language that you're
using to write code so if you take
mathematics as an example right so
there's this right now there's this area
of the people teach which is sort of a
pure mathematical area but at least
basic math gets into all kinds of places
it hasn't gotten so much into the
humanities but in you know it's it's
something where where it's just part of
the the way we think about things is so
at least basic math so similarly
computation is something that in these
times is part of the basic way we should
think about things and the great thing
about computation is that if we think
about things in terms of computation and
then the things become sort of
immediately executable they become
things which where once we have the idea
computationally and we know a little bit
of a mechanics of how we write you know
code it's pretty straightforward
mechanics then given that idea once
we've had it once we've formulated it
computationally we can then get the
machines to go do the work and a kid can
get a machine machines do the work just
the same way as the fancy researcher can
do it I mean you know that I was saying
earlier was I think this is the biggest
suti an AI on its own does not have a
goal goals are a human construct so the
thing that came out of lots of science
stuff I've done is this realization that
sort of intelligence and computation are
kind of the same thing and there's
computation all over the universe
whether it's in a turbulent fluid
producing some complicated pattern of
flow whether it's in some you know
celestial mechanics thing of you know
some interaction of asteroids with this
that and the other whether it's in
brains and so on and so this question of
does it have a purpose right what is its
goal you can ask that about any of these
systems does the weather have a goal
does climate have a goal does now and
this is a very quickly I mean this
unfortunately there's one of these
things which people have been asking
this since Aristotle
right and this is the you know this is
kind of the final cause question and so
on for Aristotle and one can't unpack it
a little bit so this whole sort of
doesn't thing have a purpose so let me
try and unpack it a little bit I haven't
I don't claim to have completely
unpacked this question but one question
is can you tell if the thing has a
purpose it was this made for a purpose
so look at Stonehenge for example well
Stonehenge made for a purpose was you
know presented with a thing was it made
for a purpose now a lot of stuff that we
see today it's very obvious that it was
made for a purpose by humans
because it has a lot of the vernacular
of human engineering history so you know
we see a thing with cogs and no the
Antikythera device when you know when
people started looking at this lump of
gunk that was you know dredged up from
the you know of 100 BC 200 AD period you
know shipwreck you know as it was it
made for a purpose while you you know
you when it was dropped and broken to
their little cogs sticking out and we
kind of immediately know this is made
for a purpose and it isn't just a pile
of gunk because that's part of the
history of human engineering um and so
given the history it's very easy to
recognize human purpose in things I mean
this is a little bit similar to this
question of you know is it alive or not
on earth it's very easy to answer the
question is it a live one that you look
at fairly easy you know we look at those
that have RNA does it have cell
membranes of these kinds of things that
come from the history of life on Earth I
remember when I was a kid you know the
first first Mars Landers were landing
right and I remember this is their life
on Mars and is the green stuff that
seems to happen every season you know
vegetation or whatever and I remember I
was really curious you know what would
the tests be and you know from today's
time he's a they're pretty amusing I
mean the basic test that was was used
was scoop up a piece of Martian soil
feed it sugar and see if it eats it yeah
that was the that was the top test of is
it alive now I don't think any of us
would believe that that life has to be
something that eats sugar but you know
the question of what is the abstract
death
life that's really hard you know there's
a and it's very tends to be very sort of
anyway the back to this question of
purpose how do you recognize purpose so
there are bunch of other huge examples
you can get so one example is look at
the Earth from space can one tell that
there's anything with a purpose hanging
out of the earth come and tell that
there's civilization on the earth and
it's a it's sorry I did this experiment
15 years ago now I asked astronauts what
do you see on the earth that shows you
that there's intelligence on the planet
so to speak and the first thing I was
told was in the Great Salt Lake in Utah
there is a straight line that has turns
out to be a causeway that divides what
turned out to be two areas that have
different very different colors of algae
so it's you know it's very dramatic
straight line it's like okay there's a
straight line and I found that I was
interested in where's the longest
straight line made from lights as one
knows that there's a road in Australia
that's really long and straight and
there's a railroad in Russia I guess in
Siberia basically that's that's really
long and it has sort of a you know
lights bit go on you know when it stops
at stations and things that are lights
there so you'd see some straight lines
and things and then and another another
good example is some in New Zealand
there's a Morris perfect circle baseball
mountain rapist okay so this was I was
doing this research I guess it made me
go now before the web was common I'd say
you couldn't just go to look up awesome
statue into this so anyway we we got in
touch with them we're trying to get maps
of the big an autonomy we're in touch
with the New Zealand Geological Survey
and they said if you're writing a
textbook please do not say that Mount
Erebus is a circular volcano the circle
does not come from the volcano the
circle comes from a national park that
was drawn around the volcano and there
are sheep or something that graze you
know inside the National Park but not
out
the way around and that's what leads to
the circle so this is another example of
human you know there's a piece of
geometry that comes from the humans but
it's pretty difficult to find really
clear examples of sort of obvious
purpose on the earth as viewed from
space and I think you know the other
question that comes up it's a question
for the extraterrestrials so to speak
okay you know if we want to recognize
extraterrestrials out there how do we
tell if a signal we're getting has a
purpose so you know 1968 pulsars
discovered you know every few
milliseconds I guess knowing how long
was the first of all saref again but
something between no seconds and seconds
you know yeah you hear kind of this this
flutter like sound that's a periodic
thing and you know at the time it was
you know the first question is is this a
beacon because you know what would make
a periodic thing like that it must be
for a purpose well actually it turns out
it's just a neutron star rotating but
this question comes up over and over
again
what gives evidence of a purpose and in
fact back in the early nineteen
hundred's I guess Marconi and Tesla were
both people who sort of listening to
radio transmissions from away from the
earth and sort of a question you know I
think I've coming out a lot I think in
the middle of the Atlantic you know
could hear these you know we it sounds
that sound a little bit like whale songs
for them they're kind of you know they
come from radio type things and the
question I think Tesla was very much on
the this is the Martian signaling us
type thing how these went well in fact
it's some modes of their own sphere that
are effectively a magnetohydrodynamic
phenomenon they're just physics and this
is one of these cases of like the
weather has a mind of its own so to
speak how do you tell whether it's a
thing which has a you know intelligence
and purpose and all that kind of thing
or whether it's just magneto
hydrodynamics of the ionosphere
a nap jump that's a so this is how do
you tell if the thing has brothers it's
hard on one protein that I think one can
potentially apply is does the thing that
Chi
if you can identify a purpose that is it
minimal and achieving that purpose that
is if you see a thing and it's mostly
you know a a for coming into it but it
has incredibly elaborate ornamentation
on it you'd say well its purpose is a
fork but it also has all this ornament
which is not relevant to its purpose
now it's ornament the ornament may
itself have a purpose to have people
give people a different emotional
reaction to their fork or whatever else
it is but what what is some this
question of is something minimal for its
purpose and does that mean that it was
built for the purpose so so when you
look at the thing there are typically
different explanations you can give for
what happens one is the mechanistic
explanation it does this because the
ball rolls down the hill because at the
next moment of time the gravitational
pull will do this and this and this or
the rope ball rolls down the hill
because it's satisfying you know the
principle of least action and it is
globally trying to optimize this
particular thing and you can you know
they're typically these two explanations
you can give for something via the
mechanistic explanation and the you know
to a logical explanation and the
question of which is the winning
explanation which is the right
explanation there even know is so one
possible criterion is the thing was
built for a purpose if it is minimal and
achieving that purpose the problem is
that essentially all of our existing
technology fails that that test we can
imagine technology that works that way
but most of what we build is absolutely
steeped in technological history and is
incredibly non minimal for achieving
that purpose you look at a CPU chip
there's no way that's the minimal way to
achieve what the CPU chip achieves yet
you know it's it's steeped in all this
history of our engineering technology so
so anyway this is this question of how
do you identify if a thing has a purpose
I think is things really hard I think
it's really but for example for the
extra-terrestrial question it's really
important because it's like you know one
good thought experiment is imagine that
the extraterrestrials could arrange
stars however they want
how would they arrange them to show that
they were arranged for a purpose but
they put them in a straight line
probably not because they can imagine
all kinds of physical processes which
might do that but they put them in it
it shouldn't put them in equilateral
triangles because that there's a
particularly simple physical process
that does that you know would they have
a by Koch design that they have a you
know some piece of you know alien
artwork you would undoubtedly not
recognize the alien artwork it's having
a intelligent purpose and so on so it's
a it's really a it's a you know I think
it's an important question because when
we look at you know radio noise from the
galaxy it's like it's very similar to
you know the CDMA transmissions from you
know cell phones it's you know it's not
fundamentally different from that and
it's it's you know they those
transmissions use pseudo noise sequences
which happen to they have certain
repeatability properties but they come
across as noise and they are actually
set up doesn't always for the purpose of
not interfering with other channels and
so on so it's it's a really a funny
thing what you know how do we recognize
sort of a a fundamental purpose and and
the whole thing gets even more messy
when we say we ask a question like so
you know if we observe Prime's being
generated from our sequence of primes
being generated from pulsar we'd say
what generated these that you need a
whole civilization that would grow up
and discover primes and make computers
and did this and make radio transmitters
or is there a another explanation that's
just that some physical process makes
primes and then that physical process
may have all kinds of weird things going
on inside I mean there's a little so an
automaton I made up once that that makes
Prime's
and you know you can see how it works
you take it apart of just has a little
thing bouncing around inside it and I've
come up sequence of primes and you know
but that didn't need the whole history
of civilization and biology and so on to
get to that point so it's really a
slippery thing whether you know when you
observe something was it created for a
purpose how do you tell if it has a
purpose these kinds of things
see I don't think there is an abstract
sense of purpose I don't think there's
an abstract
meaning - in other words I think what
you end up with is the universe if
you're ending up with us weird thing
where you have to say does the universe
have a purpose then you're doing
theology in some way you know does it
there isn't an abstract purpose I think
I think there's no meaningful sense in
which there is an abstract notion of
purpose that is that purpose is
something that comes from history and it
comes from so you know one of the things
that might be true about computation
might be true about our world that would
be kind of disappointing is maybe we go
through all this history of biology here
civilization and so on and at the end of
the day the answer is 42 or something
and that's just you know that's the end
so it's because that's that we got to
the answer I would say you went through
all of that you know what it crazy you
know what a crazy place you went through
all these four billion years of you know
there is kinds of evolution and so on
and all the stuff and then you got to 42
well actually nothing like that will
happen because there's this notion of
computation with irreducibility which is
kind of the thing that comes from girls
there are universal computation and so
on but there are computational processes
that you can go through and that things
often go through where there's no way to
shortcut that process in other words you
can't just no you can't say oh you were
wasting your time I mean much of science
has been about shortcutting computation
done by nature so for example if we want
to you know we're doing celestial
mechanics we say let's predict where the
planets will be a million years from now
well you know we could just follow the
equations follow each step and see what
happens step by step
but the big achievement of you know when
we think there's a prediction in science
it's because we're able to shortcut that
and just jump from you know from where
we are now and reduce the computation
we're able to be smarter than the
universe and figure out you know this is
the end point without going through all
the steps and that's been the sort of
story of prediction in science but the
good news is in a sense it's bad news
for science it's good news for us having
meaningful lives so to speak that there
isn't a way to just say okay we can
shortcut ever
you know with a smart enough machine and
smart enough mathematics we can always
just jump ahead and get to the end point
without going through all the steps we
actually have to irreducibly follow
through those steps and that's in a
sense that's why that's why history
means something if it was the case that
we could get to the end point without
going through the steps we would you
know in a sense history would be in some
sense pointless wouldn't you know I
think I think this this fact that you
know bad for science because we can't
make these predictions but good for the
meaningfulness of the history of
civilization and so on it's that you
know these details sort of are reducible
and I think in a sense when one realizes
that sort of ever think and have these
attributes like intelligence and so on
one realizes that if we are going to
distinguish that the thing that has to
be special about us is all of these
details about us it's not going to be
some big feature like it's not going to
be the case as I thought it once that it
was that there's us that's intelligent
and there's everything else in the world
that's not it's not going to be some big
abstract difference between us and the
clouds and the you know the cellular
automata and the whatever else it's not
an abstract different it's not something
where we can say look you know this
brain like neural network is just you
know qualitatively different and this
cellular automata thing rather it's a
detailed difference that you know this
brain like thing was produced by this
long history of civilization etc etc
whereas this Sonor ton of them was just
created by my computer in the last
microsecond you know I think I think it
said so but my belief about you know the
problem of the abstract AI is very
similar the problem of extraterrestrial
intelligence you know it's the
recognition of when is a thing
when does the thing have a purpose when
is a thing intelligent you know these
are these are I think these are again
just questions I I don't get so that
answer I'll be very you know it's a you
know of course one of the great things
in science is why have we not found that
a extraterrestrials why you know how
could we possibly be that's unique and
you know
what extent you know that maybe maybe
that's a silly question because maybe
there's intelligence all over the
universe and we have to then ask well
just how close is it you know does it
have RNA does it have you know did it
invent a notion of democracy or
something and you know a lot of these
other attributes like that we think of a
lot of what we when we start trying to
break down and say well it will be
intelligent you know I I will be
intelligent if it can do blah blah blah
if it can find Prime's if it can produce
this and that and other you know there
are many other ways to get to those
results and that's a consequence of the
fact that there just isn't a bright line
between intelligence and mere
computation I think that's the I mean in
a sense it's a very it's a disappointing
you know it's a it's another part of the
Copernican story so to speak you know we
used to think you know as the center of
the universe all this kind of thing and
now at least we think gosh we're special
because we have intelligence that
nothing else does and I'm afraid you
know the bad news in the sense is that
that that really isn't a distinction and
by the way that lack of a distinction I
think is pretty critical for thinking
about the future of the human condition
because his is one of my I sort of I
don't know scenario that I'm I'm really
curious about it you know let's say
there's a time when human consciousness
is readily upload of all into digital
form everything can be virtualized and
so on and pretty soon we have you know a
box of a trillion Souls there are
trillions souls there in a box they're
you know all virtualized and we look at
this box and in the box there'll be you
know hopefully nice molecular computing
immediately derived from biology in some
sense but maybe not but there'll be all
kinds of molecules doing things that
Ron's doing things the boxes doing all
kinds of elaborate stuff and then we
look at the rock that's sitting next to
the box and inside the rock there's all
kinds of elaborate stuff going on all
kinds of electrons doing all kinds of
things and we say what's the difference
between the rock and the box of a
trillion Souls and that's where that's
the and the answer will be well the box
of the trillion souls has this long
history and the details of what's
happening there were derived from the
history
civilization and you know people
watching videos made in 2015 or whatever
and you know all these kinds of things
whereas the rock well it came from this
geological history but it's not the
history that is like you know it's not
the particular history of our
civilization but I think this is the
kind of this question of you know
realizing that there isn't sort of this
distinction between intelligence and
mere computation leaves you leads you to
this these these things like imagine the
future of civilization ends up being the
box of a trillion souls and then what is
the purpose of that what do we you know
for example from our current point of
view in that scenario it's like every
soul is playing video games basically
