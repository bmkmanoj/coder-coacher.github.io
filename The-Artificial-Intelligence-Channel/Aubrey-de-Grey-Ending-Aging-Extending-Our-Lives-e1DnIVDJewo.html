of natural phenomenon valid in principle
not amenable to medical intervention and
that complete nonsense
aging is simply a biological phenomenon
that causes things to go wrong with us
and such a miracle
in principle and furthermore interpret
well that a good idea or not something
the really waging it is simply the set
of precursors early stages that we don't
want to get so um really intervening in
aging would be preventative geriatrics
and that's touch you know it's a
ridiculous sort of completely messed up
to even think about the idea that
defeating aging with medicine would be
sometimes so do you think a cognitive
aging if it's something that's not
amenable to medical stations change
dramatically I mean because things that
people used is the
I don't think that's the same thing I
think people have changed their attitude
to exactly what counts as died of
natural causes and even appears for yet
but nevertheless we still think about
diseases you know that happened I agree
but the concept of dying of old age they
think of trying to go they did what you
want if you escape all the bad things
but that's obviously it really just
comes down to terminology or maybe dying
without haven't got any of the thing
that medics have got around giving names
into the feasibility I think the main
reason why I feel the thing of change is
because we have made so much more fluent
progress over the past decade especially
in developing regenerative medicine so
stem cell therapy tissue engineering a
bunch of other things that would not
normally be thought of when I mentioned
but which still come under that rubric
in the sense that they constitute
restoring function by restoring
structure at one level or another
another level so we've come squeakums
we've come an enormous way we're going
to notice a gap in order to get to the
point where we're generating medicine
can have a comprehensive impact on aging
but my mind
we are definitely within striking
distance of that now and that's what
takes because the sure that no way in
the world an intervention that actually
cure name in the sense of loss treatment
their intrinsic but the idea of
something that constitutes essentially
repair which dimensional's that's what
we're about some really
- that has become absolutely I think
actually one of the ways in which this
conversation tends to get confused if
I'm the guy with precisely because
journalists especially tend to find it
easier to sell papers by
sensationalizing a little bit and
talking very much about the consequences
for longevity without emphasizing the
fact that they are simply consequences
in other words that actually what we're
talking about all the time you're simply
postponing ill health and thereby as a
side effect we're spending day the only
real difference between medicine and
future perspective medicines against
aging and every other type of medicine
is a matter of degree the extent to
which we would extend life is much
greater once we can what we think about
really confident agreement raging than
any extension of life that we achieve
with medicine
la Pucelle all medicine without
exchanging good health restoring good
because each of these ways of describing
it has connotations in people mind I've
tended to end up gravitating to the word
defeat aging because I want to emphasize
that we are talking about science is
really you know the problem in
definitely something but equally I don't
want to use words like you that have
and
this preventive medicine treating the
precursor to a greater so in your way
it's on its way you talk about this yes
okay escape velocity is the term that I
came up with in I think before and the
ideal wedding I was going to play with
that phrase is that preventive
maintenance in principle can postpone
ill health the malfunction of any
machine whether it be your body or
whether it's a simple man-made machine
in the car you could postpone
indefinitely but only if the maintenance
is comprehensive enough so let's talk
about cars format so if you if you do
the sort of protective measures on a car
that the law requires there the car
works really well so maybe 15 years
lucky but if you do substantially more
comprehensive maintenance on it then as
we know cars
but even on video and work just as well
as they did with no personnel to do but
the only reason we don't duplicate card
when I went into areas so the threshold
of Copperheads missiles are quiet now
the thing is that when you have nearly
but not quite reached that 11 of God
branch of this forgiving machine you
asked on buying time
supposing we had therapies that were
good enough that they could postpone the
ill health of all day by let's say 30
year so what that would mean is you
would be able to take people who were
already 60 and fix them up well enough
that they would become 60 again
eventually but until they were okay now
if you just kind of eating the same
therapy then you would hit diminishing
returns look at ultimately the reason
why I say whatever therapy is not how
you can think of and see what I mean is
there's certain types of damage that
they don't work on yet and those type of
damage there's talk of molecular tell
you that problem are accumulating anyway
irrespective of the therapies and
therefore eventually on their own even I
wasn't using the therapies difficult
going to take you over the pathological
threshold including biomedical
technology so the chances are this
someone who had these therapy at age
sixty comes in Spanish the age of 90
basically again they're not going to get
the sense that a bit anything because
the therapies will have been improved in
comprehension a similar thing so that I
could get more thoroughly rejuvenated
the second time around even though the
problem of recognizing with is
intrinsically more difficult problem
that's only true if the therapies have
been improving operated by a sufficient
amount and for that sufficient amount of
what I call endeavor to escape velocity
the minimum rate at which we need to
improve the comprehensiveness of the
therapies in order that we can
indefinitely stay one step ahead of the
problem despite having not yet achieved
one I certainly did I think that
actually the first generation of
therapies that give even a couple of
decades of postponement about relational
health will be sufficiently
comprehensive to to achieve our deputies
say philosophy and furthermore once we
get there it's going to with the pool of
John the heart that everything that
needs to be done thereafter will be
essentially minor refinements and the
extensions of what would render so that
was a very active ascending side of
things and therefore should not be very
difficult
to develop oh I don't think we're going
to see any significant event a little
help until we get to a reasonably
comprehensive level of sophistication on
for seven of the major categories of
damage that but once we've got even a
reasonable amount well I call the flesh
generation therapy which I think we have
at least a 50-50 chance of getting to
within about thirty five years from now
then I think all right so let's talk
about that what do you think generation
okay this question says what the third
people be and that's how they will be
delivered so delivery well I think be
pretty much by this sort of methods that
we're seeing already it'll be it'll be
injections things it will be perhaps
some surgery
replacing organs that will there will be
a lot of pressure but what will be what
we're delivering is the book on getting
better so as I said I tend to describe
the problem of this accumulating diamond
davell health has been subdivided into
seven subproblems and these are
categories of damage types of molecular
and cellular alteration to the
composition and structure of the human
body that happen throughout life even
starting thorbourne and that eventually
contribute to it so there are three will
three types of change never won lots of
cells cell dying and not
magically replaced by the division and
differentiation about ourselves and that
is the least one to describe in terms of
what people who do because you've all
heard it already
but essentially what stem cell therapy
is always whether it's for specific
acute condition or whether it's for the
gradual or chronic lots of cells that we
see in certain aspects of aging like
Parkinson's or if just you put in new
self because what we've not doing it for
you is having too many cell because
cells are dividing when they shouldn't
that's what cancer is and there are
various ways to
to defeat cancer that a lot of course
undergraduate investigation I've always
been very pessimistic about cancer I've
always held it by far the hardest part
of Aging specs we have natural selection
on each side and the approach that I've
been pounding through combating cancer
is very elaborate and sophisticated the
only slogan will be midget but I think
it's worth well basically I say we ought
to indiscriminately comprehensively
eliminate the possibility for cells to
divide indefinitely basically by doing
suppression or a really profound
depression of cheerleader elongation of
telomerase and that we've used by but
not only enhancer this is the thing the
thing that really makes it very very
hard to kill cancer cells if you have to
also avoid killing all the rest of our
cells and the thing about a telomere
elongation is that it doesn't cut any
self at all for a while so essentially
if you know it's like a automatic one's
completely eliminate your ability to
make any kind of extension of
determinism any cells it's pretty doable
with being targeting to acumen
then the countless women I'll tell you
anymore great but actually you die
anemia at my factory because they've got
various tissues but need a little bit of
little memorize to keep their steps on
coming thing is if you actually do the
arithmetic
based on current understanding of the
frequency of cell division of the
originating stem cells in any rapidly we
doing tissue at scale then around ten
years that you take before the stem
cells reach that everything living so
well it could principal if that's what
we've got to actually develop the
sophistication that clean and calm
pension enough doing targeting to be
able to actually eliminate this one
where in the first place technically
well then to essentially solve the
problem while we go remove the
immortality of the stem cells but one
doesn't because what we took the replace
a sensor provides basically to replace
the stem cell to replace the stem cell
pools in these few interviews but we
need to memorize and of course it's a
tall order but it might not be so tall
as to be impossible with
Wow it's very expensive getting sick
having too many cells but in this case
not because cells of the body when they
shouldn't but rather cells are not dying
when they should and this is something
that most people never think of because
you know that's done yes in very certain
cases of the body where the Southwest
I'll ask her to die
probably the most obvious one is the
immune system where that cell
proliferate my crazy to go into an
infection then most don't have to die
connecting back there a certain the
dying part stops happening
the immune system is filled up with self
in another in what we want to do and
there are other barriers other cases in
aging well same sort of thing happen
anyway so we need to fix that and
actually one for doing so is to use the
immune system against yourself to
identify what cell surface markers show
distinguish ourselves another approaches
suicide gene therapy
actually dr. prochik when the salic
selfie requesting other projects their
diagnostic of that's being used actually
into the group of content very
effectively in our studies with one
quite recently looking at simple
selenium salvage of course lessons
because they exhibit the same sort of
phenotype as rigidly senescent cells in
culture that's what was made that has an
accelerated accumulation of those cells
and they crossed it into a background
where they could just use tamoxifen to
activate it got a useful suicide gene
ourselves and got what a precedent that
leads a typically really puts the
problem of the accumulating debt
resistance cell what I'm showing of
course that potential
and not necessarily it's not really an
image for yourself if you whatever type
of cell happens to be wasn't you wanna
get rid of so then there's for molecular
target document
the first one is much cooler mutations
so much country is many people we know
are this very important part of all
mental cells that do the chemistry of
breathing they do the business of
binding oxygen with nutrients so to
extract energy from a nuclear DNA so the
only part of the cell DNA that I very
much but it's essential and we take it
rather is that accumulation of cells
like that other cells that have
potentially had all that might come from
DNA I get messed up is important in
aging it's still controversial as to
exactly how it's important that one
really get along
it must have um so that's 95 years ago
long before I came along
someone suggested that we might be able
to fix this problem by actually putting
copies of the mitochondria
into the nuclear DNA of course modify in
such a way this will work even with
anything on place
Lisa's not crazy because there are at
least 13 proteins including mitochondria
night but a thousand or more proteins
because the nuclear DNA code much going
to proteins that are probably happening
naturally imported into the mitochondria
yeah now it turns out that even if we
could do the gene therapy part according
to her bio base to get that's it for
copy this to my kids in English we still
have to do a bunch of modifications to
overcome the resistance of these
proteins to being imported back into the
mitochondria that is generally believed
to be actually the reason why English is
for us we completed the job of
transferring a little might come good
but especially over the past couple of
years has been a couple of advances
which appear to make that problem look
solvable so that's well it's perfect
some of you may be thinking why leave it
to the nuclear DNA what's so good about
nuclear DNA what's so good about putting
the mitochondrial DNA to do clicks
anyway surely you can slow mutation yes
but only incredibly slowly the
mitochondrial DNA is really badly into
the wrong places right next to the sort
of the main DNA tucked in such big
namely free radicals created by the
mitochondria as part of its normal
operation it's not so well it hasn't got
the DNA is not wrapped around these
proteins called histones that protects
nuclear DNA first other things that that
makes the rate of accumulation of might
be protective nevertheless you know
nuclear mutations happen they cause
cancer of course so surely what about
the mutation of stats happening nucleus
but don't go to cancer well I firmly
believe we don't need to worry about
that and the week we don't even worry if
it was because of cancer in other words
if cancer can kill us with one cell nine
seriously are the risk or the
requirement not to die the cancer before
we
ah spring has driven the evolution to
develop DNA repair it making machinery
in the nucleus so that everything else
is protected unnecessarily well and this
is something that based on the traversal
you know no one really questioned title
for my certainly is true you know the
rate of accumulation of nuclear DNA
damage then the answer seems to be that
the rate of accumulation is so low as to
be undetectable anybody could know
cumulation to speak of any funding a
project back okay so what's the what are
the other three types of molecular well
there's another one that's inside the
cell like which is just molecular
garbage
so metabolism processes make why product
all the time that have no down or XP but
it's a very very rare so that they're
only created at a very slow rate then in
many cases evolution hasn't really got
around to bothering too
wiser explain well this one is nothing
so instead the tough question and just
forgive me that's gradually himself so
of course eventually the problem rather
like if you don't have for a month
any weekly pollution hasn't taken the
trouble to deal with this problem
particular acts of garbage is because
the accumulation is slow enough that's
in the wild we thought we did anyway
from protection in the starvation but
some of the most important ones do so
but I often they oxidize derivatives of
cholesterol but macrophages don't have
process getting into macrophages and
it's actually poisoning them so that
they eventually stop working in the
artery walls and turn into little foam
cells there's a undead macrophages that
are the first histologically bit of walk
stage to atherosclerosis um if if
macrophages could process oxidized
cholesterol we would not get cardio
that's a little bit as simple as that
it's simple macular degeneration which
is a major
because they like that but Chloe is
we've results showing genuine protective
effects in cell culture against the
number one oxidized cholesterol
derivatives the one that's the most
abundant most toxic for a particular
charge that cell viability of improved
if the same time it being the question
chosen workplace so yes we're we're
pretty happy about how that going of
course the long way to go we've
definitely got to you know get the girl
was working in in like my said well
looks like I'll chair and think that we
can think my clinical trials but once it
works it's gonna be just even comparably
more effective against cardiovascular
disease than anything we've got today or
need anything coming down the pike yeah
but it's just you know tinkering around
the crunch of the pathologies rather
than actually getting rid of the
underlying cause and so yeah anything
that that comes up with having of
geriatric medicine you've got to
remember that it's really are losing
back because ultimately you're treating
something which is caused by something
that's accumulating geriatrician job is
intrinsically getting harder
we have a because we do so to get the
gist of the brain and sure enough it
went away and they were invited to get
pretty good evidence now of course the
mass models of Alzheimer's are actually
real rather and not many people really
think that if you could do the same
thing in humans then it would be a
completely irrelevant well I think that
it's quite likely to be a component of
an eventual panel of things that we do
the will care advocacy so under when you
say that the miss masters are formed a
kind of
in fact me too but do they have to
actually invoke the first one but long
story is now in phase three going on
everyone's quite a book the very cold
actually initiated before the best but
before the phase two trial was over we
can't get out maybe college so well
right pastry at the last stage before
regulatory approval in the u.s. yes
everyone's pretty pretty optimistic
about that the garbage elsewhere we have
a project that we're funding actually
the two places one a habit of one in
Texas but different type amyloid maybe a
different stuff would you keep it like
to the heart and appears to be extremely
important in terms of the cause death or
really all people
it's called senile systemic amyloidosis
but it's the same concept we're using
kind of activate the immune system
against mr. um I finally left one that
one is Stephanie so our bodies of course
are not themselves with all that stuff
between sell the stuff between selves
not just garbage
the exercise of the matrix this lattice
of proteins that whole budgeted together
and that matrix needs to be elastic
especially in certain cases so the
artery wall is the major artery pose the
best example of course they vote and all
the constant pulsation of blood pressure
from the heartbeat and as good on the
artery walls get stiffer and that's bad
for it very bad for it'll call data
protection is the main reason why I
better go about it with aging which was
had a massive number of downstream way
so question what's the stiffening
happening twice is happening answer is
basically it would all be caused by a
protocol glycation which is the chemical
reaction or rather a chemical reactions
that start with it starts with
circulating sugar molecule attaching to
proteins that sometimes that sequence of
reactions leads to chemical bonds
between adjacent project and the random
is that the chemical structure of um is
totally bizarre very very weird
structure that happens all completely
different from anything that the body
selectively bravely
without messing up the Mexico and that
example people looking at there was an
initial breakthrough which no we're not
really sure still whether it really was
from the static one back in the 19th
looking at one particular of apparent
very abundant type of cross-linked
people didn't get very good with nothing
telling the clouds with bad people they
might probably because that type of
people less common but it's now very
clear what is the most abundant rustling
it's a particularly weird one with a
seven thing with rain but anyway we are
actually engaged right now so fun way to
crack that one I just we are the only
criterion in other words we prioritize
one of these things within each of these
bands not subscribe that rid of it is
the extent to which other people with
little way we're quite small we're
calling and so we have all the time
so the easier part of all such as for
example that trial to get real amyloid
those are very much attracted attacker
in fact that clavicle
only after the initial aren't they
that's right yes now you would think
that but I'm not from them you know
that's what publicly funded research is
for to do stuff that do blue sky you
actually yeah I took the crack the
private sector and that's true
unfortunately science professionally
will be acutely aware there might be a
problem with public funding side as well
there's not enough money for it ever
and what that leads to inevitably is a
massive bias against high risk/high
getting work it means that essentially
almost everything that's funded is
funded on the basis of feasibility those
like an enormous penalty in the end to
the scientific evidence as done a peer
review into a proof of silence if things
basically if you fact if you have the
ground you get some of the government
and the private do you want to do does
not lead to some high-profile
publication then yet you're screwed
so so people just work on South class
they know good work in fact they've
already done right it's very very hard
to do just on cancer
what prospect do you see for approaching
the problem just from the early
detection point of view so using their
technology or something similar
presumably if we can detect cancer it's
the very early stages they're all
curable
okay so the question I'm going to repeat
the questions you might remember too
because an obvious question I can say
yeah will we be able to bring cancer
really under control simply or at least
predominantly just by getting much
better at detecting cancers really early
now I absolutely do want to say that
only sexually has enormous value we're
sure the great thing about human beings
is that we will never die of cancer
unless and until a cancer gets to have
one called metastasis where cells start
falling off the edge of the counter is
the circulation in sufficient numbers
that very occasionally there so we'll be
able to read in Grasse people
foothold somewhere else in the body and
start crowing again it's that it's then
the country's become pretty much
incurable and they've gotta cancel well
before then and get out then result
that's good it may not gonna make
another difference however bonus that
cancer is like all of these other things
I'm talking about age-related disease in
other words it's a good difference goes
up with age if you look at the
demographics you can get us somewhat
more confused answer but we don't want
to get distracted by that because that's
actually generally believed to be what
sort of selection effects in other words
you see a decline in the incidence of
cancer relative to other thing because
there is heterogeneity in population
with regard to how soon they get cancer
and so you end up being left with the
people who just got lucky of being here
in this so let's look at that in any
individual risk of going there getting
cancer goes up exponentially
so even if you can find cancers as
quickly as possible you still gotta have
a way of getting rid of them in doing it
more and more and more often in
eventually getting internation returned
the one way or another we've got to find
a way to preemptively eliminate the
possibility that cancers can ever get
big enough circulars it wasn't
emphasizing it with if I can play
devil's advocate for a minute and the
world don't you like it already why
should we all live longer a side effect
the question is are you telling me that
medicine is a wonderful great thing
I have no idea whether we're going to
have an overpopulation problem or how we
pay the pensions or won't dictator live
for everything that I in fact what I do
I'm pretty good idea actually
whether you seriously think that the
risk of their problems if worth letting
people carry on getting all the vehicle
and disability to go back so I'm sure a
lot of people thinking this I would like
to live longer besides from a bit of
diet regular exercise and looking both
ways before crossing the street
what should I be doing now to sort of
prepare for therapy 2025 years time
pretty much nothing that people can do I
worry about everything with your mother
- you know don't smoke don't get it away
convinced about it right unless you
happen to be one of those unlucky people
who are aging unusually rapidly in one
or another way like Ray Kurzweil goes up
and down with type 2 diabetes it's 30
and detective Lee asked on April a
little health if you're already the sort
of person is going to get 280 closer to
happily without my trouble therefore the
only things can be done is to increase
the chances of these therapies coming
along soon enough to take you to the
next Rick so you wouldn't recommend
something like calorie restriction or
anything like that I'm pretty
pessimistic about calorie restriction I
think that the evidence as well told us
very strongly that color restriction
will postpone age-related ill health and
therefore extend life much less
effectively in long-lived species like
humans than it they have been repeatedly
about to do in shortly speaking like
mice and rat essentially the logic goes
the only reason why something so simple
as calorie restriction actually can have
this extraordinary complex effect namely
postponing all of these disparate
effects of aging is because its program
we've got genes that respond to nuclear
deprivation in this particular way okay
the blue prioritizes our metabolic so
the question is well we do that when we
have those genes and the answer is
because it's good for evolution
procreating but then we have to take
into account the fact that long
Fanning's are much rarer than short
panics and therefore that the Eagle who
should be blessed to have machinery to
survive 20 years for example on purity
what we did you know had periods of food
and no food and no food
yeah the same flight essentially the
material again max is that it's a true
it's only it happened and I certainly
found that intimate of plastic works at
least that well as I respect you look at
a restriction in many many experiments
have been done but still the question is
how well what's the period you know it's
a long time therefore it's rather like
the fact that we look we lost the
ability to make measurements see
something many of you probably don't
know is that almost all mammals can make
their own vitamin C it's not a vitamin
for that there's only three times in the
history of ovarian evolution where that
classes been lost in apes including us
it's been lasting fruit bats actually
nothing guinea pigs and the reason it
Purdue to be in all cases about the with
a period during evolution when the
availability of infancy of the diet was
so good so reliably that was no pressure
to maintain the drinks so these being
obviously got mutated all genes always
did all the time in the germline and of
course normally that really keep teens
in because of selection against the
mutation
coming in the diet and by the time the
reliability became less became less
reliable it would do they send you we
sailed off living less time and having
more elaborate more impressive metabolic
acrobatics to postpone aging and we
started living longer in the ad lib
scenario where we have like so the
people is requested to maintain that
response to famine I would say yes we
obviously do still have the intrinsic
evolutionarily conserved ability to
respond to deprivation with various
changes in expression that clean up that
all try many priorities just the author
is milder wattage age you can extend
life I mean is this really a question
that's founded on an internal
contradiction because it sort of assumes
both that we have medicine and that we
don't I believe that the Rays and
hearing limit in how long in the absence
of medicine in other words basically
know there are certain aspects of being
alive that are non-negotiable you've got
to breathe right and really it's
fabulously bad for you
which would essentially are a major
contributor to all that I could damage I
talked about earlier um so you know
that's going to put a an absolute lower
limit on how on the rate of accumulation
of these various types of damage
irrespective of the little tweaks well
they're distinguishable from each other
but that's all in this in the context of
a situation where medicine doesn't exist
if those various types of damage would
being caused by breathing and by other
non-negotiable expected I metabolism
then any limit that the might appear to
be no longer applies we're given a
little bit about this study it was a
very spectacular result on the face of
it and so the first red flag if it was
published in a very nice Journal and
that it was it came out of a group from
Africa like she's not known for the
quality of science but of course you
know some good things can air yourself
that way so that's not even the story it
just got people to look more closely at
the boat
and a couple of big problems with that
first of all active arrow but your
internal contradictions in it like the
average lifespan that mentioned in the
text it's way different from the amount
that's shown in the graphs I think that
to me actually the biggest problem that
they this study looked at three great
they have these rats
that they look at controls obviously
normal they looked wraps that were fed
this disease for the rings and they had
now um four rings well you know they are
this mysterious uncharacterized pixie
dust you know you can't really say
anything you've got me for any
preconceptions about what they might do
they might not be magic they got at
least half as much life extension from
the from the olive oil a bit different
foolery and that was still like off the
scale far longer than West Iraq
especially so there's a whole bunch of
the way that they
could've gone wrong they could have
actually added up yeah mistakenly using
some species of Tunisian rat that
actually Nathalie lived a long time not
eating with others or they could have
some technician could replace to the
rack you are the famous story about
replicative senescence about the whole
concept of tomb in there shortening
causing cells to stop dividing where hey
flicks predecessor as the mentor of all
of this thing okay I'll actress Carell
had come to the opposite conclusion
because his technicians were keeping
them happy by replacing this do you
think closer to applicability the
Scrambler there's a patent thicket
developing and possibly the research
slow down yeah excellent question so
people people are very interested in
what you might call the endgame here at
the moment at the moment a huge
proportion of the returnees we don't
there's early stage that I mentioned it
there people I guess I guess using
business terminology will be called
Greek identity and so there is of course
the gradual accumulation of IP they
lived like a property both in
we even have a couple I'm a lead - um
that's what I'm notall worried and the
reason I'm not is because people care so
much about aging it's going to be
different in this way everything about
they if you think about today's
situation we've got this massive thing
called called the anti-aging industry
huge industry that's based entirely on I
think that tells us exactly how you
people's excitement going to be is the
way that I see at some point in the
relatively near future less than 10
years like we say with high probability
we are going to reach a point in the lab
with mice that is exciting enough so
it's not just people like me no experts
the world over are going to be you're
willing to go on camera and say yes it's
only a matter of time before
regenerative medicine for you beings
become comprehensible now
actually first burn anything down now
when that happens that is what the real
pandemonium's are going to occur not
when the therapy the ride but when the
therapy become widely anticipated look
of course you know scientific new
religion it's not just say the opinion
Oprah Winfrey will say that actually did
it rather than later and that's what it
will become impossible to get all that
did unless you have now one of the war
on anything actually me of course it
means putting a humongous amount of
money into the science the science that
we need to do right now in the lab you
know I would be running out of ideas on
how to spend money if I had more than
100 million dollar yeah
you know if I had one order of magnitude
more money than we actually do have it
we I'd like me are 30 or 40 million I'd
still be pretty happy but that's because
it's all in mice once we get to the
clinic last stage it's vastly more
expensive but that's fine if there's a
lecture or pressure to do it um but if
it's not just the research there's also
all the tedious stuff all of the
investment in infrastructure building
hospitals to provide this that when they
have a long training enough medical
personnel to acquire them when they come
along and exactly what you said making
sure that the property structures you
know ownership and incentives and so on
in the private sector also
nautical with and conducive to the
pacing of these therapy things available
in Italy possibly another thing actually
become into their hotel mentions of it
often comes up it goes relating is the
mode delivery of these therapies once
they come along where delivery means
access terribly expensive therapies you
know terribly expensive turbines to die
and not to be terribly universally
available they tend to be only available
to let you have the nice report but we
all fall you know greater inequality
among the model now of course but the
better which is that not having these
therapies many people get all itself
extremely expensive the only reason one
eye therapy for the diseases of old age
today are limited by those pay is
because they don't work very much and
therefore you may perspire those sleeves
abolished by a tiny little bit but then
you still got the Aunt Mary big wilder
stick said I look ugly to these Belinda
got areas that you wouldn't have if you
hadn't use with arabism at this model a
is the to make and being destined that
you never get that expense at the end
and the well-known statistic was says
that throughout the industrialized world
the amount of money spent in medical
care for people in the last year of
their life is more than in the ha'la'tha
that I put together irrespective of how
old are they done um so what's anymore
that that's also of course there's all
the indirect costs to do with the other
people who that kid
to look after them over duct tape all
those things right so the economic
arithmetic is completely we are actually
about stop funding a study looking at it
more this in much more detail on you
know everything you can imagine
economics not cut economics the
demographics and politics and everything
about that by a very well-respected
group in Denver but even without any of
acne what to do definitely say that it
would be economically totally suicidal
but any industrialized nation not to
invest in this and thereby save any of
the research on existing organisms that
exhibit negligible senescence beholden
to your work um so they've done any of
the work that's been done on organisms
are already don't into a how they run
this to what we do um unfortunately this
point now there are a number of
organisms which either seem not to eight
at all or which seem to have defenses
against aging than we do but
unfortunately in almost all cases the
reason makes the we the reason they do
makes them irrelevant to us and in the
case where relevant the amount the
extent to which they do better than
asked is so mild that it's unlikely that
we be able to make much of a difference
so let me give an example urging um
there's a learning English with that
seem really not awake at all
there's a famous one some clam that with
found in Iceland not long ago
that's about going you know the more
famous jellyfish types things that take
to undergo actual reversal of
development and go back to an embryonic
state called Terry Thompson what what
this thing is that they don't have a
central nervous system function arises
from being made that design to be
non-dividing for the lifetime of the
office and cell division is an
extraordinary powerful rejuvenating
mechanism it dilutes the way in on
genetic damage it selects the way
genetically genetic damage it's a great
thing if you have if you decide to
create an organ organ whether it's the
brain or whatever that doesn't do that
anymore
then you are selling your soul awaiting
so we can't really use one album by that
they're animals like fish tend to be one
to grow throughout life even
indeterminate growth has the capacity
for adding incorporation that means that
cells can die and be replaced because
the system and therefore loosely
pressure to maintain when they die
because the alternative exists simply to
keep ourselves alive in a undermining
state and in evolutions okay what about
anything that lasts a long time is
easier so again because we've got in the
brain for example be crying if we had
slow but steady the other genesis
replacement of cells every so often
throughout the brain but unfortunately
that we could have any one or two parts
of the brand is not the whole brain so
yeah one good example where we might be
able to learn something is there there
are some mammals in particularly the man
will call the naked mole rat which not
only to live a lot longer than closely
related animals the central to the side
and so on but also don't get cancer they
really really I mean we we don't get
cancer never been feeling them all right
and nobody has the faintest idea why
that should be well I'm not pleased with
some recent discovery showing a dish
all defensive over and above what we've
seen in other animals but they seem to
be well we're pretty sure that a lot
water still to be discovered about how
they do I think we might be able to
learn something that but that's pretty
much the only case where I think we can
learn some command what we do incredibly
well in turn away about that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
