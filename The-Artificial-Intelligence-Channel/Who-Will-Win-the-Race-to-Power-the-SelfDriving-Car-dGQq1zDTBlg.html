from under so I'll let them introduce
themselves so we have a gentleman from
the system space a gentleman from
commodity or mainstream semiconductor a
gentleman from startup semiconductor
that's oriented toward partially toward
automotive and I'll let them introduce
themselves hey everybody I'm Edwin Olsen
I'm a I've got a bunch of hats I'm a CEO
of Maine mobility which is building
low-speed electric vehicles autonomous
low-speed electric vehicles most
recently I came from Toyota Research
Institute where I was the co-director
for autonomous driving and then I was a
principal investigator on Ford's
autonomous car driving program going all
the way back to DARPA urban challenge
and I'm also a faculty member at the
University of Michigan thanks for having
me Charlie and it's interesting to be in
this crowd I usually hang out with other
Hardware people so I'm probably one of
the few people here that doesn't have a
PhD or isn't looking to invest a million
dollars but I've been doing micro
processors and systems on a chip FPGAs
for thirty years so I try to power all
the stuff that you guys are coming up
with and make it fit into the box hi I'm
Angie egg day I used to be a professor
at Washington University in st. Louis
and electrical engineering but since
1999 I've essentially been an
entrepreneur founded a few semiconductor
companies all of them the first one was
a network processor company which court
became an edge router at VC insistence
with a spectacular failure and then I
taught for a bent back to the University
for a year and I started a second chip
company this was a physics processor
that was fairly successful and
we got bought by Nvidia it was an Nvidia
I was the first GM of CUDA and then I
joined AMD and I ran their fusion
processor application aging division
until 2015 and then I didn't I don't
like big companies so I started my third
startup under in 2015 we are still in
stealth mode so I can tell you it's a
chip company and we are very interested
in automotive so we're about we're gonna
talk about hardware ok all the stuff
that runs all these wonderful software
algorithms that we've been mostly
talking about earlier in a day and in
the automated driving space there is the
highway scenario which is kind of in
beta mode right there's a bunch of cars
that now are able to drive on highways
with you no human intervention but the
human is able to let the car drive on a
highway but this is just one subset of
the of the industry and what is coming
next is a TAS or automated driving
assist systems for city driving and this
is much more complex system from a
hardware perspective we talked earlier
in a day about sensor fusion where
you're essentially have to process
images from lidar radar ultrasonic sand
cameras you have to do that in pretty
much real-time because you have to
decide you know what's a tumbleweed and
what's a grandmother you have to be able
to process deep learning algorithms
which is computation intensive because
no one is able to process all these
known and unknown corner cases so the
thing has to be able to learn and you
have to be able to process as was
pointed out optimization and queuing
algorithms so what we're talking about
is a supercomputer on wheels now there
are two models or maybe more maybe
you'll point out some different ones but
there's the I would say the open
approach which is basically we're gonna
put out a very powerful piece of
hardware and then the Tier one OEMs and
the car manufactures will program
against those chips
but that requires a lot of power for
example Google Way more I think made
some statement that you'll need about 50
tera Plouffe teraflops for automated
driving and that's a lot of computing
power a lot of expense and a lot of
power consumption the other approach is
an integrated one where you're
essentially building the software and
you are building software-defined
hardware for that software so that you
can have a more efficient system but
it's pretty much one vendor takes
responsibility for this and there's
about 18 to 25 big chips in a car not
today but in a car of the future and the
main automated driving system takes a
lot of computing power so with that I
like to open up to the panel and my
first question is how much power do we
need to pull this off all right I guess
my turn so I am kind of a contrarian in
terms of what the hardware is needs to
be I'm not I don't really ascribe to the
idea that 400 watts and the backseats a
good idea we we built a sort of absurd
system back in 2007 which had two
kilowatts of of computers in the back
and we had to add a generator to power
that and the generator made too much
heat we had to add an air conditioner to
cool that and and and that sounds silly
but actually thermals and packaging are
a really big deal
so I tend to think in terms of how can
we really be efficient in terms of the
amount of compute going on and to push
those numbers down so there's power in
terms of compute power and there's horse
power in terms of watts luckily in our
industry typically the amount of
performance gained per watt news is
increased over time either through
shrinking or probably more relevant to
this crowd through accelerated types of
processing so clearly at today I think
we're still early in the game
everybody's still deciding how again
what the rules of the game should be and
I think there is going to be a role for
generalized computing
be at arm via x86 whatever to do to
provide the flexibility to bring all of
your algorithms into play naturally over
time the industry will optimize there
will be more and more dedicated hardware
for the acceleration of those algorithms
that are proven to be the best
essentials with open hopefully open
hardware assists for improvements over
time
and I mean where that balance ends up
we'll see you know analyze people
probably have a chance to define that
will it be more on the open processor
side or more on the custom silicon side
yeah I've never been a big believer in
blanket statements about teraflops
because those make sense for if you're
building general-purpose processors but
in autonomous driving we've got some
very specific use cases and we
essentially know the modalities of the
sensor so I think the my vote would go
to specialized processors in which case
teraflops is kind of a big measure I'll
give you an example for my previous
company we were building a physics
processor we built the pipeline for
collision detection and then some
software research I improved algorithm
by a 20 X so there's worthless so we
went back and we took the new algorithm
and we put that into silicon and that's
what's gonna happen so Google yes they
want general-purpose Rossa because
they're a software company but you don't
want to build a general-purpose
processor with an unlimited amount of
experimentation that's what FPGA is are
for I think it will be a lot if you
count it in today's generalized
teraflops but there's so much advance in
software that's to be had that will
require much less performance and
they're very less power so your your
serve of the school that the algorithms
will define the hardware yes which is
different than we used to be in a
semiconductor industry where Intel our
friends at Intel will put out a chip and
people would program for it now we're
writing the software and we're building
the hardware to accelerate the
algorithms so it's a big change
yeah it's a specialized field you need
that and
is a big determinant in in these
applications and the market is big
enough you don't need a generalized
processor you can build a chip just to
address this market so how much power
can we get away with in a car you are
saying something you have two kilowatts
which just sounds like a power plant to
me you know how much power can we get
away with you are saying something at
lunch is a level that you would prefer
in your vehicles yeah so you know an
interesting factoid to have in your head
is that one horsepower is about 750
watts so in one per spectrum one
perspective we should have plenty of
power but actually dealing with the heat
is a huge issue so one of the the rules
of thumb that we worked and worked with
at one of the OEMs is that basically if
you've got a small box
you know grapefruit-sized you can put
about five watts at most in there or
else you're going to have to go to
active cooling and active cooling is a
pain in the butt because then you you
have warranties warranty problems and
reliability issues so we've really
started to think about how to
decentralize the compute and want to get
five Watts here five Watts over there
all in different grapefruits and then to
really address the overall power budget
as well yeah yeah I definitely see that
as the the right way to play it
we I believe there's gonna be one large
central processor for coordination
control generally sitting under that
under the - where it has some amount of
shared air cooling with the cabin so you
can use a lot of cars the Tesla uses a
Tegra all right so it's not necessarily
an automotive great processor but it can
transition at the rate of change of the
larger industry leveraging advanced
processing technologies advances and
just generalized computing and then the
grapefruits had talked about could be
distributed in two two and a half to
five watt chunks with specialized
processing perhaps for each one or four
you know just distributed multiple revs
of each of that chip so how much power
belongs in the image sensors and both
probably more in compute power how much
power belongs in the image sensors the
lidar is the radars
cameras and how much processing power
belongs in central central processor how
distributed is it is it a mainframe or
is it a network approach one thing I
just want to make a point with it's not
necessary five watts you can go to 12 to
13 watts right now without active
cooling because you can do thermal
advantages I mean you can reduce the
thermal resistivity in fact the surround
cameras are typically about 12 watts and
they have a very thin die they have an
air gap put silver plating there and
then they have a pedestal made out of
say aluminium which is essentially the
whole chassis so you can increase the
wattage and still have no active cooling
but you're right ultimately it's it's on
the order of by a steel watch yeah yeah
but in terms of I think the most power
will be at least the way I've seen OEM
to discuss the architecture they're all
talking about domain controllers and
domain controller is that processor
which combines everything essentially so
there's an a test domain controller
there's an informal infotainment domain
controller and right now the domain
controller is what consumes the most
power it's because it's not optimized
yet that's typically the Nvidia
processor and there's also an NX p
equivalent which hasn't got that much
traction but going forward I would say I
think they want to avoid active cooling
because active cooling is not only
expensive but you know automotive
companies generally to our advantage
they prefer robustness to innovation so
safety will always trump innovation in
traditional car companies and if they
build self-driving cars we should be
grateful because that's why we drive at
70 miles per hour knowing that we can
corner and if the car won't fail us if
you do that then you really want to be
able to automotive qualify these sensors
and therefore you want that five to know
the Edwin Edwin's a grade of sensors so
that essentially says that anything that
has a longevity which is automotive
grade must be into that budget so that
puts
constant on the domain controller itself
that's the reason why I'm saying there's
fifty teraflops today it's not possible
to do that in five watts so you'd have
to wait somebody somebody's clearly
wrong here right yes the question is it
a supercomputer or distributed computer
it's very similar to a car is gonna be a
iot experiment right you have a it's an
Internet of Things in a car there's all
the end points our sensors and the
question becomes do you put the active
processing at the sensor at the endpoint
and send back to the controller
essentially metadata or are you
streaming essentially the raw images and
it's really disturbing to have a full
wall-sized view I apologize to everybody
it has to deal with this right now
so the yeah you know do we do we bring
all the data back to the central
processor and have that supercomputer
function centrally to start
like many innovation revolutions you
know you and I lived the smartphone
transition from you know the early 2000s
where we started with the the first ARM
processors and then we added a video
processor and then we had an image
signal processor we had an audio
processor we had high speed data data
compression so as as each function
became defined we added it we put it on
the same chip and we used your your IP
to connect them all so what I you know I
can see the exact same thing happening
over time to the car everything will
probably start on a pool of let's be
real probably a pool of x86 is sitting
in you know in the cockpit and people
will realize that you know it's cheaper
more power-efficient to create these
independent processors and some of them
will hold on to that one piece of
silicon now a a processor for automotive
or they'll be disaggregated and you'll
start seeing
that the the database ship act is the
metadata rather than wrong if we could
wave our wand and design the perfect
system architecture it'd be great to to
have every camera have the local compute
with a super optimized application
specific processor right there and and
then have just the information that you
need come back to the domain controller
the central computer I think and that
works great with the power it works
great with cheap cabling so you don't
have gigabit ethernet links all over the
car it's a win in a ton of ways in one
way that it's salient to this particular
panel is that that is also very
compatible with the idea that that
camera module or that radar module is
itself a black box that was obtained
from some other vendor it's
interoperable right you promote
interoperability that's right the
challenge is that it's hard enough to
make these things work and inevitably
when you if you've dealt with a black
box Center you end up wanting to pull
your hair out because you want to turn a
knob on how it does tracking Association
or or you know the mobile eye you know
you just want to tweak this one little
thing but you can't and so that has
really pushed a lot of people I think
myself and we heard it from new tana me
into building more of a full stack where
we just kind of take it on ourselves
because that allows us to stick our
fingers into into the system so I think
there's a tension there between the the
ability to have an ecosystem of
component suppliers and the ability to
make the darn thing work right and this
is the key question so I think module
you're you are saying that the the car
companies they like safety functional
safety over innovation but yet
innovation is what's needed to make
these very complex systems work I mean
you can have a very safe car that's you
know wandering down the highway and you
know he's hunting from edge to edge of
the of the lanes right so what is the
role of big companies versus small
companies in this ecosystem I mean do
startups with innovative lidar for
example innovative light our components
or I forget the gentleman's name this
morning he was saying that there's a 50
million dollar phased array radar Agis
opportunity right so
somebody comes up with phased-array
radar for you know some reasonable
amount of money what what is the how
does that get into these systems given
the conservatism of the of the industry
and the pension for for functional
safety and you know being consistent
with with legal liability issues so I
think right now there's a huge
opportunity for disruption in the
automotive industry not just because of
the the transition to autonomous driving
the traditional players that have
dominated the silicon for cars for
decades now are either weak or
distracted NXP Freescale all have been
absorbing each other now to be absorbed
by qualcomm TI is neglecting large-scale
digital VLSI at this point in favor of
analog st is kind of wandering off into
the into the weeds Rene sauce still does
good stuff but largely for a Japanese
market so that the traditional
entrenched players are are not keeping
up with the needs of innovation which
can potentially did allow Nvidia to take
the lead for autonomous driving have
opened the door for a company like Intel
or now Qualcomm to bring technology from
generalized computing into into the
vehicle but for these new entrants being
a silicon provider to the automotive
industry is tough I started my career
there and you know the time to volume
revenue it can often be six to eight
years and when you're you know also a
mobile phone provider that's used to six
to eight months you know having that
financial model is difficult for a
company to have to have both within
one-one corporate structure so I think
the the opportunity the changing market
you know where we are as a semiconductor
industry it is going to open some doors
for younger companies to get in there
but then they have to also meet the
liability service guarantees ISO 26262
certifications which are tremendous
overhead above and beyond simply selling
a chip you have to you know not only
provide the silicon area that now
provide a solution as you're saying
which potentially has quite a bit of
software which we never get paid for
right so it's a it's an opportunity but
it's gonna be very expensive opportunity
yeah I think I mean so many conductors
have always been capital intensive so
that's not new
so semiconductors supplying automotive
they have the capital intensity as well
as the delay the long time to revenue so
that's probably not easy to fund through
a VC model in fact very few
semiconductor companies funded by VC at
least in the u.s. though I think they're
all in China right now the VC funded
semiconductor company but on the other
hand you know the who benefits the most
from Bizet's the OEMs and the tier ones
and that's all large companies OEM if
you look at the sizes of the OEMs they
range anywhere from 75 billion to 250
billion dollars a year
tier ones they're the top hundred tier
ones the smallest one is a billion
dollars the largest one Bosch is about
fifty billion dollars so they have the
resources to do chips for themselves so
that's going to be the alternative model
because this helps them and why it is
particularly important for semiconductor
companies is that if you don't design a
chip to be functionally safe
good luck time to do it forcefully after
the fact it's incredibly expensive so
the only way to make it reasonably
economical is you design for safety your
design for a still be your SOC oh no it
will be it's still expensive but you
know these companies are big and they're
our model for instance a rumor probably
true that Tesla is now designing chips
they hired some big chip architects from
AMD and other places I'm sure they must
be for the same reason that Tesla can
afford and Tesla story the smallest OEM
I mean Toyota is a giant and all the
other science compared to Tesla so they
have resources that's going to have to
be the alternative model tool to cope
with the new setting and semiconductor
needs in this change
market I think another way to look at I
agree with everything who said here
om SAR slow for a reason because it's
really hard to build 10 million of
something where they all last 120,000
miles without the wheels falling off I
think I think everybody who's gone into
building cars that sort of realized whoa
maybe I bit off more than I I want I'm
intended and so that's really led to a
culture in the OEMs of moving slowly
deliberately double-checking and
sometimes that's in conflict with with
technological innovation we the OEMs are
not oblivious to this we see all of the
OEMs have their own way of trying to
overcome this and become more agile more
tech company agile for Toyota it was
creating Toyota Research Institute for
Ford it was somewhere between the smart
mobility and the Argo thing and you see
this everywhere but the one other thing
I would say is that this is a space
where the big players they their job is
to move the needle for their company
right and these are huge companies with
huge market capitalizations and so they
they tend to fixate on like the four
trillion dollar transportation market
and when there are opportunities that
are smaller you know like these pathetic
little billion-dollar markets here and
there they really don't don't attract
their attention and those smaller
markets oftentimes are the ones that
provide the greatest opportunity for
doing something fast and agile and
high-impact and it just is it's below
the radar which I agree with you I think
you know company the size of Toyota or
the big OEM or a small OEM likes a PSA
they don't want to build something for a
billion dollar market and so they want
to build a sail take level 5 to build a
level 5 car of the kind they want it's
nearly impossible I mean I think you
said it's in beta that's gonna be like
Google perpetual beta you'll never get
to level 5 I think yeah but if you want
to do special location like campus or
you know just portions of the highway
yeah that can be done but that market is
not that big enough
think to them but that's really
interesting to a small company you know
five billion dollar market damn great we
can do it so I think my my influence
from this is that the only level five
car will not be a car on the road that's
why I question your topic of automobile
on wheels it'll be a flying car and
there many reasons for this you know
when you go from 2d all cars and run
revving on 2d you go from 2d to 3d it's
dramatic right it's so much easier to
navigate they know pedestrians you know
all the sensors will make sense and now
with the drone technology in fact I saw
a report last week from a company Shanxi
China they're building a drone which can
carry a one ton weight so you can easily
build with the with the drone structure
the only thing that's remaining is the
battery technology because to fly a
certain level you need battery but
battery test again is improving there so
Tesla might come out the first flying
car but it's so much easier say I'm 90
in the air much easier than I 90 on the
road and so that's I think the first
level five car in my opinion will be a
flying car if one of you so you know I
said instead of going above you go
underground right that you you you dick
Thomas while you're in it you're in a
tube in a single line right you can be
safe when you drive that you can't so so
one of the what I take from this is that
we don't know exactly how it's going to
evolve and there'll be there'll be many
twists and turns but one of the big
disruptions for the automotive industry
is that now people are essentially
buying cars for the autonomous be the
autonomous capability of those driving
assist capability becomes one of the
decision criteria for the car rather
than just fuel economy and and
performance so this week we had Ford
removed their CEO and replace them with
a head of their automotive automated
driving division it's just a one-off or
is this something that is kind of start
of of the the major players in the
industry being impacted it's not another
one off obviously if you look at the
recent news out of GM as well they've
cut and run from India and they're
cutting
out of Europe there you know cutting
back in a number of markets where and
they have traditionally had or not made
money or lost money and they're trying
to clean up their books so that they can
invest in you know what unfortunate
billion may spend on cruise or whatever
but you have to continue to invest in
the technology that they believe is
required for them to survive as an
entity going forward if if you there was
an interesting article yesterday I think
and CNBC you know projecting that in
2025 or 2030 oil would go to $25 ABEO
simply because consumption would drop so
much with as the the number of both
vehicles and shared vehicles autonomous
driving shared vehicles goes up you're
just going to sell fewer cars you're
going to have higher utilization of cars
you know essentially the cloud computing
you know paradigm applied to vehicles so
you know definitely these I think you
know GM sees it for didn't see it and
now the guy who was in charge of that
technology at Ford is in charge so
you'll see this transition throughout
the nisshin there's gonna be in a
painful consolidation there and you can
definitely see that the trend I think
that my dream of man pointed out that
just like mobile phones my group at
Texas Instruments got out of the mobile
phone industry when it became obvious
that the OEMs we're going to do their
own silicon when Apple and then Samsung
chose to do their own I believe a lot of
the carb makers will do their own
silicon like Tesla and then the question
for the semi dentistry other than the
foundries it is how do you make money
with those supporting those car
companies building the chips for them
design the ships for them designing IP
for them you know what what can you know
how do you play in that ecosystem where
a lot of people have you know lost to
Apple as Apple continues to suck up he
percent of the mobile phone profits okay
but the the phone makers were themselves
a technology companies right
basically the I used to sell to General
Motors in early my career and to Ford on
behalf of excellent chemical and they at
least certainly at the time didn't have
a whole cadre of chip designers in their
employ and they certainly didn't have a
ton of software talent right so how do
they get that done how do they make that
transition I mean sounds like a gut
wrenching change I think
there's mounting ever increasing
evidence that last year was actually
peak auto so just touch on this which is
going to force the automakers if they're
gonna continue to make money to find
some other way of selling vehicles at a
higher per per per item price in order
to be able to keep things afloat and
that's where the autonomous car stuff
comes in there's a credible way that you
can bring in more value on a per vehicle
basis and if the total number of cars
are going down you got a compensate in
the other direction what the car the car
makers are really afraid of is becoming
handset makers where where you know
there's someone else's OS that goes on
top of their car and you know they they
just turn into making vehicles and
someone else is owning the customer
interaction and I think that's why we
see so much jockeying for a position
right now because everyone wants to own
the relationship with the customer
because that's where the revenue is
actually going to come in and so I think
there really is this existential problem
right now they see the markets going
down they're afraid of becoming handset
makers where someone else swoops in and
makes their cars super profitable but
for someone else there'll be fewer cars
sold in fact I think they'll be
ultimately the car market it is a mature
market it's a replacement market and
except for a few rich people who like to
buy cars for fun most people buy cars
when they need to when they've driven
say 150 thousand miles when you have
level 4 cars the business model that
even Ford is talking about about fleets
of cars we won't sell to consumers you
don't own a self-driving car you'll have
fleets and they provide services but
those please will get used much
or there'll be more miles driven because
today at 10 p.m. if I want to get a nice
game I don't feel like I driving
somewhere and getting it there I can
just call a car and get in there or
maybe get my child to go and get a car
do it so more miles will be driven so
more cars will be sold I don't think
that's I don't know the number of cars
would be less well you know our family
members are many families you have we
have a teenager at home so we have
pickups at home right now I think in the
future you know a lot of families will
have none but maybe you'll have one you
know if you want to have you want to
really have control you don't really
want to you know uber for every ride
yeah you keep a car but would I get a
second or a third I don't know if I if I
could know for sure think about how many
cars do you think are on us roads today
the 330 million people there's 1.2
billion cars on the roads the average
age of a car is 14 years I I don't keep
a car for 14 years but the car gets sold
and my point is it's all replacement
markets so you got to look at the number
of miles driven by the cars and I think
that will increase with level for cars
no mantling people will go everywhere by
car because you have to drive it's so
convenient you need a paper I think it's
likely that the total number miles will
go up but the utilization of today's
cars is so low that it's possible that
even with an increase in total number
miles that the number of vehicles needed
to meet that will actually go down
there's a lot of squinting involved in
these projections but I think that's
what everybody's afraid of so we you
know we don't know the answer to that
one I think there'll be quite a few
twists and turns but one one last
question before we open up the audience
who owns the data from all these sensors
who owns the data that's a good question
everybody wants to own the data and
certainly the sensor manufacturers want
to collect their data in order to
improve their algorithms we were having
a nice argument over lunch about how
important that data really is but
nonetheless we want to collect the data
I think the challenge is that when you
have when you don't have a vertically
integrated system where one company
basically owns the whole stack and
instead you have a
a syndicate of companies with Mobileye
providing the the lane tracker and and
some other company providing something
else and someone else providing the
fleet management then then things get a
little bit thorny about where the data
goes and who gets to use it this is a
generic problem for many industries
there's a new story recently that
ancestry.com somebody actually read
their fine print and and then wrote a
story saying you know when you sign up
for ancestry coms DNA analysis they own
your DNA forever
unless you unless you request them to
take it out of their database and they
can still say no if they're actively
using your DNA for research purposes and
they can use your DNA to give it to
other businesses to evaluate you for
insurance purposes all kinds of things
jobs and and so yeah that's in and when
you sign away that data when you choose
to use an autonomous driving vehicle to
some extent you're gonna be signing a
shrink-wrap license that says I'm gonna
let GM or Ford or Tesla keep track of
you know when I go to the movies or to
the mall or to less savory destinations
and you know they're gonna they're gonna
know where I am when I am and they're
gonna use that information and you know
at a metadata level much less than the
actual graphics level of you know your
interactions with cars and a on a
minute-by-minute pace that's why you're
driving so there's some thorny legal
issues there but right now it's the big
I just land rush the data rush right now
is to get ownership of the customer to
own data so that you can use it to do
whatever you want with it because that's
what you're empowered to do today I
think transactions between that some
companies and consumers I think
consumers are less informed so this sign
away rights to data as you just pointed
out however the data transactions are
the negotiation between companies is
much more dependent on who holds the
balance of power in the negotiation and
not intensity based on size
my best example is mobile I am you know
mobile I was a small company still is
but when they negotiated with the OEMs
over probably a thousand times bigger
than them they got rights to the data
from all the OEM and all the Tier one
when they drive mobile I for the test
driving and they drive you know a few
hundred thousand miles Oh Ames a few
million my mobile I got rights to the
data why because at that point there was
no alternative so I don't think the OEMs
knew what they were selling you I mean
this is not that long last year they did
it too and I'm sure I mean OEMs are
pretty smart
it's just that whoever has the balance
of power that's our businesses I mean if
you have something valuable you can
negotiate for it so I have to apologize
we're out of time but maybe maybe one
question from the audience if I may so
where do the states and the federal
government Cygnus in terms of the data
ownership so one of the you may remember
that nitsa came out with the AV guidance
November of last year and one of the
bullet points there was that a company
making autonomous vehicle technology
needs to address what they do with the
data the interesting thing is that it
wasn't prescriptive in any way it didn't
say you shall do this or shall not do
this it was more of you have to say what
you do and then if it presumably if the
transportation a do T doesn't like your
answer they can push back on it but
that's all been very nebulous</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
