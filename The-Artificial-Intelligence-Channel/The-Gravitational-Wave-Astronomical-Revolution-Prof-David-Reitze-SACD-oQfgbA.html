forum at the National Academies I'm Jim
Lancaster I'm director of the board on
physics and astronomy here at the
Academy's and it's my great pleasure to
introduce David Wright see who is our
speaker tonight I'm gonna give you a
little background about David David is
actually a physicist sees a laser
scientists after obtaining his
undergraduate degree at Northwestern he
attended the University of Texas where
he entered the field and it's a very
demanding field of ultra-fast laser
science and for those of you aren't in
the field that's an area where they take
lasers they're able to stretch them and
reduce them and compress them and
generate light at the femtosecond level
that's the level at which atoms interact
and then they use them to study atoms a
very demanding field
David graduated in 1990 he went on to
industry work for Bell communications
then he went to a national lab Lawrence
Livermore and then he completed the
trifecta by going into academia by
working at the by getting a tenure
position at the University of Florida
where he still has a position and the
interesting thing is even though as
demanding as ultra-fast lasers is
apparently that isn't demanding enough
so about 20 years ago David decided to
take his laser capabilities and start
using them in the field of gravitational
physics he joined the LIGO team served
as the team's spokesman from 2007 to
2011 and 2011 he took a leave of absence
from the University of Florida and
became the executive director of LIGO
position he now holds David has a number
of honors that recognizes his
accomplishments he's been elected a
fellow of the American Physical Society
in the optical Society of America and
then last year year he and other
members the LIGO team received the
National Academy of Sciences award for
the scientific discovery of the year so
with no further ado do I join with all
of you in welcoming dr. right see here
tonight and look forward to hearing
about the gravitational wave revolution
thank you Jim
thank you very much Jim for that nice
introduction I'm delighted to be here
tonight it's really an honor to give a
lecture in the National Academy of
Sciences and what I want to talk about
are a number of groundbreaking
discoveries that I think collectively
make up what I would call a revolution
in astronomy in the last two years let
me get started
so let's start with this this is a slide
you're going to see again later on these
waves that you see the red and the blue
waves are gravitational waves that were
detected by the LIGO observatories on
September 14th 2015 which is when the
revolution really began the picture you
see on the right-hand side of your
screen is what produced those
gravitational waves the collision of two
black holes and the fact that we can
make this measurement is really really a
very stunning feat of physics and
technology so as I go through this talk
I'm gonna start by telling you a little
bit about Einstein and not so much about
general relativity but about a
consequences for gravitational waves
then I'm going to talk a lot about the
detector how we make these spectacularly
sensitive measurements using a technique
called interferometry and then the last
probably half maybe a little bit more of
the talk is going to be about the
discoveries that we made first the
discovery that I'm talking about now the
black holes and then there's basically
the observation of the collision of two
neutron stars which was a spectacular
event in many many ways as I hope you'll
see all right so let's get started so
this is everything you need to know
about general relativity in one picture
alright what's there well what's there
is the earth and the Sun and up until
Einstein in 20 and 1915 came up with his
theory of general relativity we had
Newtonian gravity and Newtonian gravity
basically said there's a Sun there's a
there's an earth there's a body there's
another body they have mass they're
attracted through the Newtonian through
the Newton's laws Einstein came about
and said there were problems with this
building on something called special
relativity and he he wanted to try and
understand really what was going on with
gravity and one of the things that even
Newton himself recognized was that the
Sun and the earth are talking to each
other through the exchange of this force
called gravity however how does the Sun
know the earth is there and how does the
earth know the Sun is there it must take
some time for the information to get
back and forth Newton said I don't know
how to solve that problem but I can
write down equations that work really
well all right for basically launching
rockets satellites and calculating
orbits in our solar system it was
Einstein who then said aha I under I
have the missing part in the missing
part actually is geometry and what
Einstein says about gravity is basically
this that the reason the Sun and the
earth are experiencing a force between
one another due to gravity is not
because there's some magic exchange of
information it's because both of those
objects have masses and both of those
masses interact with the fabric of
space-time that that they sit in so in
other words Einstein says matter and
energy are one thing that's e equals
mc-squared Gratton Einstein also says in
general relativity that space and time
are one thing and then he puts them
together and so what really is happening
according to Einstein is that the Sun is
attracted to the earth because what's
happening and the earth is attracted to
the Sun because when you put a massive
object in the center of an empty space
it changes the natural geometry of space
a curved space-time and the earth you
can see there's a little dimple there on
that green grid the earth also
experiences that curvature and the earth
is actually moving in a straight line
the geodesic is the experts call it but
that straight line actually happens to
be
motion around the Sun due to the fact
that space is curved at that point right
and that is really what general
relativity is about but now here's the
catch and here's why this is such a
tremendously difficult project alright
the way that space and time and matter
and energy interact is very weak so it
takes a huge amount of matter and energy
to put a little dent or a little dimple
in space-time and the the coefficient
the coupling coefficient as the experts
would say is 10 to the minus 43 gravity
is a fundamentally very very very weak
force much much weaker than all the
other fundamental forces of physics and
that's why it took a hundred years for
us to go from Einstein's general
relativity to the detection of
gravitational waves now we need to tell
you about what gravitational waves are
as objects are moving as their
accelerators I'm walking across yours
I'm waving my hands I'm actually
radiating gravity if a gravitational
wave we're coming at you out of the
board you would see space if I were to
put a ruler down the ruler rests in
space the space would stretch in one
direction compress in the other
direction and then this would continue
to oscillate it turns out there are two
polarizations and that's what those two
polarizations they're what you're really
measuring the amplitude of a
gravitational wave is something called a
strain anybody who's gone through
engineering or basic physics should
understand what a strain is it's as
change in length per unit length when I
put it when I take an aluminum bar for
example I put a force on it all right
I can compress it a little bit well
that's what mass does to space as it
mass accelerates through space it
compresses it and stretches it a little
bit to produce these gravitational waves
if I leave this on too long you're all
going to get hypnotized and go to sleep
but I will say something there's
something really fundamental about this
and it has to do with that quantity H
that's strain Delta L over L suppose I
want to measure a gravitational wave
well if I start there and I get close to
the origin the amount of stretching and
compressing is not very big but as they
move further away from the origin it's
much much bigger so in order to measure
a gravitational wave you have to measure
a displacement and you have to measure
it over a base
and the name of the game the thing that
we have been trying to do in LIGO and
other gravitational wave experiments
over the last 40 years is basically make
big enough baselines and make small
enough displacement measurements that
you can actually see this effect now the
really funny thing about all this is
that Einstein in the paper that he
actually predicted that gravitational
waves exist immediately then said but
they're of no physical consequence and
that's a direct translation from from
the paper this quantity a is the Delta L
over L and if you translate that
quantity says that a the gravitational
wave amplitude strain that we're trying
to measure must have a virtually
vanishing value in all imaginable cases
right so Einstein himself thought that
this was just a mere you know
consequence that you could never
actually measure it was something that
came out of the theory but that had no
consequence and he was actually right in
1916 and to demonstrate that I'm gonna
calculate or I'm gonna show you the
calculation at least the answer for the
calculation of what you could try and do
in a laboratory so this is a mad
scientist areas right there notice
there's a guy standing back here that
guy is actually the smart person in this
in the room right the mad scientist is
going to basically take these two
massive objects thousand kilograms
they're about a few meters apart from
one another and he's gonna spin them
around a thousand times a second now you
don't really want to be in the room when
this experiment is done all right and if
you do that and you calculate the size
of the gravitational wave you get that
that Delta L over L is 10 to the minus
35 0.34 zeros and a 1 right that is a
dauntingly small number for any
experimental scientist any experimental
physicist to try and measure so einstein
had it right back in 1916 there was just
no technology that you could use to do
this but then there was a recognition
really about 50 years ago that there
were other sources in the universe that
were produced gravitational wave and
this
what is the beginning of the revolution
in astronomy so we're gonna do the same
experiment we're going to let nature do
it for us we're gonna take two neutron
stars what are neutron stars they are
basically the cores of exploding stars
supernovae that are left behind we'll
get more into this later in the
presentation it turns out that they form
in binary systems in other words they
pair up and orbit around one another and
as they're orbiting around one another
their orbit decays because they're
producing gravitational waves right they
wave they have a mass of about 1.4 times
the mass of the Sun if you do the same
calculation you come up with a number
that's a little bit more reasonable it's
still very very tiny but a little bit
more reasonable 10 to the minus 21 so
the challenge that we have is how do you
make a detector that is capable of
measuring 10 to the minus 21 and that's
what I want to spend the next couple of
slides on but first since this isn't a
talk about astronomy I want to make a
comparison between gravitational waves
and electromagnetic waves so let's what
what are the same things what are the
different things between them so we're
all familiar with electromagnetic waves
light radio waves gamma rays x-rays
things like that they're produced by
accelerating charges they travel at the
speed of light and electromagnetic waves
they interact strongly with matter and
this is both a blessing and a curse for
astronomy and for many other forms of
science that use light they're very
easily absorbed so when light from a
star comes and goes billions of light
years or millions of light years and
hits your eye that photon that came from
that star is gone all right
they come in two polarizations and
they're in the parlance of physics
they're spin-1 fields and they produce a
quantico tonn's
what about gravitational waves
gravitational waves are produced by
accelerating mass and the accelerating
mass produces a gravitational wave but
in order to be detected it has to be a
really really big mass moving at really
really fast speeds and accelerating at
relativistic speeds they also according
to Einstein travel at the speed of light
so that's a sin
similarity they interact very weakly in
fact not at all really with matter and
that's what makes them so hard to detect
and that's in fact the consequence of
that thing that I showed you a few
slides ago where you have this matter
and energy equals 10 to the minus 43 or
10 to the 43 of space and time they
they're going through you right now as
the moon goes around the earth
you were being bathed in gravitational
waves but because the size of the effect
is so tiny you don't feel it they also
come in two polarizations and I showed
you them before and they are what we
call spin to Fields and that actually
has to do with the way they're generated
the generation mechanism it has to do
with conservation of momentum and energy
we call them gravitons that's the quanta
all right okay
so now I want to talk about how we do
this experiment and this is a this is a
basically Observatory that was funded by
NSF NSF's LIGO the laser interferometer
gravitational-wave Observatory here it
is here's one of them so this is the
LIGO Livingston Observatory and the
first thing that you should pay
attention to is size so the whoops let
me go back back there we go these are
cars right and that is about this is
about two and a half miles in length all
right this one is in Louisiana there is
equally one in Hanford Washington so
that's up there and they're identical
and and if you when we go through the
talk at some point hopefully you'll
understand why we have two of these
observatories all right so this four
kilometers this is the Delta L in that
equation so we're trying to measure
something over a four kilometer baseline
using this technique called
interferometry if you do a calculation
in your head I told you we're looking
for strains that are about 10 to the
minus 21 that means you're looking for
displacements that's the Delta L that's
the distance over over that baseline by
which space is stretched and compressed
as a gravitational wave passes that's
about 10 to the minus 18 a little bit
less than that all right so so we're
trying to measure something on the order
of 10 to the minus 18 meters all right
how small is that right let me give you
a comparison if you were trying to make
a measurement this this with this
precision for example measuring the
distance from the earth to the Sun
center of the earth descent of the Sun
that would be like making a measurement
to the precision of the diameter of an
atom which is 10 to minus 10 meters all
right you can think about it in another
way suppose we were trying to measure
the distance between the Sun to our
nearest star Proxima Centauri which is
about 4 light-years away quite far
that would be like measuring the
distance to a precision of the width of
a human hair all right so that's the
scale at which we are trying to make
these measurements all right how do we
do it again we use interferometry so
this is a little graphic that was made
by a really great graphic designer at
Caltech named Tim Pyle and I'm gonna I'm
gonna show you basically a video here
this is the laser this is something
called a beam splitter it's going to
split the light in two equal parts one
part of the the beam is gonna go this
way hit this mirror come back the other
beam go this way hit this mirror and
come back and what you're trying to do
is measure the relative distances
between these two the beam splitter and
the mirror here and the beam splitter in
the mirror here so you're trying to make
a differential measurement and this guy
right here this is the photo detector
this is the thing that actually is the
receiver so I'm gonna play the movie and
hopefully you'll you'll get a better
understanding of it so let's so the
laser beam sends out two light beams
notice that there are color-coded
wavelengths the wavelength of the light
is about one micron this is very pure
laser light that's the reason we can do
this experiment they come back if the
lengths of the arms are equal no light
gets to the photodiode all of the light
actually comes back here you don't see
that but as a gravitational wave passes
right what happens is the interference
pattern changes because the length
changes and you're basically using these
light waves as rulers right and in this
case you you're you're you're looking
over one light wave so so art the lay
the light waves that we use the lasers
that we use are about 1 micron all right
and so these just in this case the
length is changing by about a half a
micron in fact we need to date make that
measurement much much better we need to
make it about a trillion times better
than this so we're looking for again 10
to the minus 18 10 to the minus 18
meters all right all right well here's a
picture of it I'm not going to go into
too much into the details of the of it
but I want to show you sort of walking
through the scale at which you have to
build these devices to make them work so
let's start with the laser which is
actually right behind there this is the
world we believe the world's most stable
laser certainly one of those stable
lasers we then bring on actively
controlled seismic isolation let's go
back there we go
actively sorry I'm having actively
controlled seismic isolation you can
think of this actually as active
suspension so the earth is moving very
very with high amplitude you don't feel
it but it's actually moving about a
micron and so what we do is we place
eyes monitors all around and we then
feed back to a platform where where the
rest of the interferometer is and
suppress that noise by about a factor of
a thousand the next thing we do is we we
have these wonderful mirrors these
mirrors are the world's most precisely
figured mirrors there are about 35
centimeters in diameter and they reflect
the light back and forth so that
interferometer that I showed you the
demonstration that I showed you before
is actually made up of mirrors like
these and then finally we take those
mirrors and we suspend them we use a
concept that physicists know and love
called harmonic oscillation and if you
basically take something and turn it
into a harmonic oscillator when you
excite the top of the harmonic
oscillator the transfer function to the
bottom the amount of motion that gets
transferred to the bottom
is suppressed by a great amount
basically as falls off as one over the
frequency squared so these are the basic
ingredients there's a lot more that goes
into this their control systems that go
into it there's tremendous amounts of
data that get produced by these
interferometers about fifty five mega
megabytes per second nevertheless this
is this is sort of the the ingredients
that you put in place to be able to make
these measurements and this gets us to
actually a level of measurement of about
10 to the minus 23 meters over a certain
frequency band here all right I should
point out that in addition to the two
LIGO observatories there's also other
gravitational wave Observatory so
there's one in Pisa Italy called Virgo
and then there are two gravitational
wave Observatory is under construction
one in India and one in Japan and these
observatories will be operating later
this decade or early next decade and
these form a network of gravitational
wave detectors and that's actually
something that's gonna be very important
for us too okay now I've told you a
little bit about the detectors if you
have more questions I'm happy to answer
them later on but now I want to get to
the revolution all right and the first
revolution is the discovery of
gravitational waves from a binary black
hole merger so this revolution really
began about 1.3 billion years ago when
these two black holes what's a black
hole again when a star explodes a big
massive star explodes if if the star is
big enough and the explosion is big
enough what will happen is the material
that's left behind will basically
gravitationally collapse and it will the
gravity will become so big relative to
every other force that it will fall into
a gravitational well and become what's
known as a singularity a singularity in
space-time and the black that you see
there is basically an event horizon it's
something that prevents you from
actually seeing that singularity in
space-time these are very massive and
very compact so one of these black holes
is 36 times the mass of the Sun
it's about the size of maybe Maryland
the second black hole is a little less
it's about 29 times the mass of the Sun
a little bit smaller but you could yet
you get a sense of scale here that these
are very massive and very compact
objects and they too because of our
discovery we now know form in binary
systems and can dance around one another
so let me show you what's happening I'm
gonna actually this movie that I'm
playing here is not really a Hollywood
movie it's actually a simulation based
on solving the equations of general
relativity on a computer and then
graphically rendering them so you'll the
stars in the background are just there
for your reference so here's what those
two waveforms actually came from right
these two stars orbit or black holes
orbiting around one another they're
moving very fast these guys when they
actually collide with one another are
moving at about half the speed of light
and what's left over is one big final
black hole and that black hole actually
has some very unique characteristics
during the collision we started with a
36 solar mass and a 29 solar mass black
hole at the end of that collision what
was left was about 62 solar masses and
if you do the mathematics in your head
you'll say some masses math ISM mass is
missing and that's correct there's about
three solar masses that has just
vanished and the question is where did
it vanish it went into the production of
gravitational waves in the last fraction
of a second as these two event horizons
merged and collided to produce this
bigger black hole approximately three
solar masses of energy was produced in
gravitational ways now you can from that
calculate what astronomers will call a
luminosity or we would call power how
much power was radiated in that event
and the answer is is about twenty to
thirty times the total radiated power in
the electromagnetic universe at any
given time so this was by far the most
powerful event in the entire universe
when that
now that and all of that information
came out of the squiggles that I showed
you on the graph before there's a whole
really sophisticated set of computer
algorithms that we use to extract that
information all right now I want to come
back to something that I think is
another element of this revolution first
of all the black holes that we detected
were undetectable any other way at least
we believe that because they don't
produce any electromagnetic radiation
there's nothing else there for them to
to stir up charges and produce light so
it's only gravitational waves that can
that can detect them now one of the
things that is very important to know
about LIGO is that the frequency band
that we are able to detect gravitational
waves from roughly runs from about 10 to
20 Hertz to a few kilohertz and if you
remember what you learned in biology
that's that's the basically the same
frequency range that we hear at so this
is the audio band here and what we can
do the interferometers that we detect
these things are transducers they
basically take that squeezing and
stretching of space-time produced by
this collision of these two black holes
and they turn it into photocurrent
at the photo detector at the output of
the unifor emitter which we can then
store and play back
so that thumping that you hear is
actually the ripples in space-time as
they're crossing through our detector so
this is the first time the analogy that
we use which is a bit strained but it
isn't this is different from what
electromagnetic astronomy does which you
know you see pictures you measure light
you measure x-rays here we're actually
listening to space space-time stretching
so we're now in a position and we'll
come back to this more later where we
can actually get audio information about
the universe I'm gonna play this again
but now I'm gonna make it a little bit
I'm gonna shift the frequency up by
about 400 Hertz and the thing I want you
to pay attention to these are the
waveforms this is frequency this is time
I want you to pay attention to this up
chirp here as these black holes collide
with one another the waveform actually
accurately Maps out their dynamics
that's called a chirp and gravitational
wave physicists love that sound
all right now what have we discovered
with LIGO in the last two years well
there was first event which I just
talked about which was really the
beginning of the revolution but since
we've been running we've run over two
years on and off we've actually
discovered six pairs of black holes
colliding with one another to produce
bigger black holes and this plot looks
kind of simple in the sense that it's
basically just a bunch of black holes
merging with one another on the y axis
is solar masses but there's really a
tremendous amount of information in this
plot first of all this is the first time
we'd ever observed two black holes
colliding with one another that had
never been observed before it tells us
that first of all binary black hole
systems exist and that's actually
interesting in itself second of all it
tells us that the dynamics are such that
they can collide with one another they
can radiate their energy and smash into
one another in a lifetime it's less than
the age of the universe that's actually
quite interesting probably the most
interesting thing though is the fact
that these are very heavy solar mass
black holes and
a stellar-mass black hole so all of the
black holes that were detected by other
means x-ray astronomy for example all
right we're all sort of between the five
and 20 solar mass range so this is the
first discovery that when I just showed
you immediately this changes the way
astrophysicists think about black holes
because these are much heavier
stellar-mass black holes right where do
they come from how do they form so these
are questions that we're starting to be
able to answer as we keep operating our
detectors as we get more and more of
these things the questions we're going
to be able to answer are where did these
systems form how did they form how many
of them are there in the universe turns
out it looks like there's where we have
an optimistic estimate for the rates of
black holes the colliding in the
universe the other thing I'll point out
that I think is quite interesting which
again is sort of tilts towards this
revolution theme is the prior knowledge
about stellar-mass black holes comes
from x-ray astronomy which is a very
very powerful tool all right and what
you measure there you measure by a black
hole's accreting matter from companion
stars and producing x-rays as the matter
gets accelerated and falls into the
event horizon of black hole
and over the past 40 years there have
been maybe 25 of these black holes that
we can identify as having known masses
and if you count up here we have 18 so
within two years we've basically almost
doubled may be increased by 60 or 70%
the number of known black holes just
with this one new technique called
gravitationally so this is quite
exciting so the first discovery as I
said was made in September 14th we
announced it to the world in February of
2016 actually here in Washington DC at
the National Press Club and it got some
attention and for me what was quite
funny is that it actually got the
attention of in popular culture so I'm
just gonna play it show you a few things
here so this was a comic strip that came
out in The Guardian newspaper the online
edition on February 12th and the UK and
I'll read it for you because it's quite
funny all right so it says obviously we
could not see these waves the only way
we know they are real is by using
another extremely sensitive device which
detects scientists having feelings of
the
excitement so this this person is having
excitement because their field is seeing
or detecting a gravitational wave this
person is excited because they're eating
a sandwich right what what really made
me laugh and I think a number of us who
work in this field laughs was this fun
fact scientists emotional reactions are
also the fraction of the width of a
proton that is not true all right
very soon after maybe about three weeks
after our announcement this was sent to
me this is a website so you can now buy
gravitational wave fashion and and you
in the front row if you look at my tie
very carefully you'll notice that it's
actually a gravitational wave time
New York City and March of 2016 again
about six weeks after this there's ad
campaigns about gravitational waves real
estate so quite quite funny all right
so so so this was really amazing
exciting we were all the people who
worked in this field we're very excited
because it took us a long time this this
LIGO got started really in the 1970s and
80s and became a project in the 90s so
it took 40 years for four people working
and I feel there are many of people that
actually the colleagues of mine who when
the Nobel Prize have been working on
this for a really really long time right
but then something really interesting
happened in its the second revolution
that I think took place all right and
that's the detection of a binary neutron
star merger so let me start this by
telling you why this is exciting before
I tell you what we actually saw so
unlike the black holes alright I'm
coming back to something I've talked
about the beginning if you have two
neutron stars that are locked in orbit
around one another they have matter
they're made up of salt it's basically a
giant atomic nucleus that weighs 1.5
times the mass of the Sun it's made up
entirely of neutrons they're also moving
really really fast when they collide
with one another and when they collide
since there's matter there's going to in
addition to gravitational waves there's
going to be light in all all forms so if
if you could capture a binary neutron
star at the moment of its collision
seeing it happen before as the binarism
gravitation where's that produce and
know that it happens quickly you might
also be able to see it in visible and
infrared light and radio waves and
neutrinos and x-rays and gamma rays are
many many ways you can do that so this
is this is called multi messenger
astronomy and it's the I would say it's
sort of the you know the Hollywood
analogy that I would give is this is
like having talkies so so the the
electromagnetic telescopes give you the
pictures and the gravitational waves
give you the sound all right so we have
a network of these detectors I actually
showed you pictures of them before and
the reason we have a network of these
detectors is because we want to know
where in the sky a gravitational wave
comes from and it turns out that that's
a bit of a tricky business
unlike electromagnetic telescopes which
have arc second or maybe arc minute
precision localization so if you point a
telescope you know that an event is
coming from that direction or that
direction gravitational wave
interferometers individually are very
poor at that kind of game they're
actually more like microscopes they see
gravitational waves from almost every
direction so the way you get around that
is you have multiple you basically make
a network of these things and you time
the gravitational waves as they come in
so so these are the the network one the
existing network and the ones that will
be on soon and the idea is basically you
have some gravitational wave emitter
here and it produces a gravitational
wave and by measuring the relative time
difference you know you can resolve the
waves in each detector you know the time
delay between each of the the detectors
and that allows you to construct
triangulate basically and construct a
position on the sky from which these
which this gravitational wave came from
all right but again I want to emphasize
that even with this we are still we in
the gravitational wave business are
still very very poor at this game of
localizing so instead of arcminutes or
our seconds we deal with tens to
hundreds of square degrees and that's a
challenge actually for the astronomers
but
we're able to actually do something with
this so this is the second revolution
this is September I'm sorry August 17th
2017 it starts actually not with us with
gravitational wave community but with
the the Fermi satellite operated by NASA
and they see a burst of gamma rays as
soon as we know that that happens we
look at our data there's a quite a funny
story about that and we see this and
again you might recognize this as time
this is frequency there's that chirp and
this to us is what we call a gold-plated
event this is such a solid event it's
immediately obvious that it's it's some
low mass probably binary neutron star
material and our collide collision and
then another satellite the ISA integral
satellite actually sees gamma rays at a
slightly different frequency a little
bit higher energy alright and
collectively together at this point we
knew very quickly that we were probably
in the dawn a multi messenger astronomy
and what happened next was quite
interesting if we were able to gather
all of our data very quickly took us
about 40 minutes from the time we knew
of the Fermi event and to look back at
our data and make sure that was actually
valid data and then we send out alerts
and we send out alerts to a huge number
of telescopes around the globe here's
actually a just a map of some of those
telescopes I think overall 70
observatories participate in this
including seven of the satellites of the
Hubble satellite - Chandra satellite
participated in this and they all then
went to look and where did they look
well here's where they looked alright so
these are the Arab boxes and the one
that you should pay attention to is the
one that's got the arrow 11 hours after
we made our discovery a telescope in
Chile the Swope telescope identified
that there was a new object in the sky
in this galaxy this is NGC 4 993 that
wasn't there before
and they know that because they have
references so so what had happened at
this point is that and they then sent
out an alert to all of the telescopes in
the world saying we've seen something
and then what happened I think is
probably one of the most massive
astronomical campaigns in recent memory
maybe maybe ever approximately 70
satellites as I said across all bands so
from gamma ray to x-ray to UV to optical
to infrared to radio all right basically
made observations and you if you see
that dot right there that dot right
there that is the remnant of these two
mutrah of these two neutron stars
colliding is called a Killa Nova and
I'll do a simulation of what that looks
like in a moment but over a period of
days and even weeks and actually it's he
still being looked at today in the radio
they're eight they were able to collect
spectra and the spectra told them some
of the underlying physics that's going
on the astrophysics that's going on in
this event and it turns out to be very
interesting astrophysics indeed as we'll
we'll see but I just want to emphasize
how impressive this is all right this
comes out of a paper that was
co-authored by 3,500 astronomers and
gravitational wave physicists thousand
of us in the gravitational wave
community about 2,500 in the
astronomical community I can tell you
that writing a paper worth 3,500 authors
on a major discovery of this type is not
an easy thing to do well we did it we
were able to actually get it done and
and it's really remarkable the amount of
telescope time that was spent on this
and here is actually yeah here's the
picture that emerged from from all of
these observations all right so here
this is actually a graphical simulation
there's no computers in this so these
are the two neutron stars that are
orbiting around one another they're
actually moving in about a third of the
speed of light when they collide they
release a burst of neutrons and they
produce a gamma-ray burst and that was
the gamma-ray burst that was seen before
all right they also produce as time goes
on they produce the ultraviolet light
blue light red light infrared light and
eventually radio waves as
the matter from the the collision of the
neutron stars actually expands out and
hits the interstellar medium and this
process produces a lot of interesting
nuclear reactions something called our
processes so you've got a very very very
dense - very dense atomic nuclei that
are supermassive so this is the world's
best particle collider and as these
neutrons are free they undergo beta
decay and what happens is there's a rich
dense neutron environment so a lot of
nuclear reactions take place and those
nuclear reactions actually lead to some
some some elements that we we know and
love right so this is the periodic table
which you've seen before and the color
coding shows you where we believe all of
these elements come from so hydrogen and
helium mostly come from the Big Bang the
lighter elements in blue here come from
either massive star supernovae and / or
dwarf stars which are smaller stars that
like our Sun will eventually end up to
everything that's in in yellow here all
right comes about from merging neutron
stars so all right are mostly produced
by merging neutron stars so if you're
wearing gold if you're wearing silver if
you have platinum on chances are that
the gold the silver the platinum that's
in your rings or your bracelets or
whatever was produced by the collision
of the neutron stars much like this one
many many billions of years ago the
abundances of elements these heavy
elements olanta knives has to be driven
by that process and that all of the data
from from our from our observations is
consistent with that so that's actually
quite quite nice if anybody has any
uranium I don't you do it was also
produced it was also produced here now
this is really interesting right because
if you think about it all right first of
all how does a neutron star form it
forms because the star explodes it's the
end of the life of the star all right so
that's one and then that star basically
populates you know that that explosion
produces elements of
produces elements up here then that star
happens to be in a system paired with
another neutron star that also well
supernova it explodes produces a neutron
star and then they collide again so this
these elements are really founded in and
are really really twice they have to go
through a process of exploding and
colliding to be able to get there so all
right so this is just sort of the
beginning of this whole story this is
like I said the first and second wave of
the revolution what I want to leave you
with is the final parting thought here
and that's this everything that I've
told you happens in this frequency band
so you can think of gravitational waves
much like a liquor Ming and any waves
are having a spectrum we and the
gravitational wave ground-based
community look at what we consider to be
the sort of the highest interesting
frequencies or shortest wavelengths or
compact Astrophysical events taking
place however there's a whole range of
longer wavelengths and lower frequencies
that also are interesting and let me
just walk through some of them for you
all right so below us all right so if
you go from maybe this is one Hertz this
is a kilohertz in this range from about
a hundred micro Hertz to one Hertz there
are lots of interesting sources there
including massive black holes
intermediate-mass black holes that have
smaller black holes running around them
and you can detect them using a
space-based analog of what we do that's
called the laser interferometer space
antenna and this is something that is
going to be launched we hope probably in
the 2030s right and you're looking at a
completely different kind of event with
this so it's quite complementary to what
we do in fact the black holes that we
detect will be seen by oops sorry will
be seen by Lisa years before we see them
so Lisa will be able to tell us when
we're going to be able to
black holes going one step further in
every galaxy we believe almost every
galaxy there's a big massive black hole
supermassive black hole ten to the six
to ten to the nine solar masses when
those galaxies collide those
supermassive black holes can get found
to one another and they also will orbit
around one another produce gravitational
waves they can also be detected by a
completely different technique using
radio basically pulsar timing by
measuring the difference in timing of
pulsars that are in our galaxy that
difference carries information about
these massive galaxies that are
colliding this supermassive black holes
then finally perhaps the most
interesting is the Big Bang itself all
right all we know about the universe
comes from again mostly electromagnetic
radiation electromagnetic radiation
didn't exist in the universe until about
380,000 years after the Big Bang and
that just has to do with the dynamics of
the universe when neutral neutral
hydrogen formed and light was able to
light was able to escape
however gravitational waves were
produced right almost at the moment of
the Big Bang and they are detectable
using different methods using basically
very very sensitive bolometer x' they
have to be in a very special place in
the South Pole if you could detect the
gravitational waves from the Big Bang
you'd be able to look at the universe
right at the moment of his birth and
that would give us tremendous amounts of
information about about how the universe
form in cosmology so so we are right now
just at the very beginning of this
wonderful revolution and I should point
out that as we go forward all of these
things will be taking place but we will
be making improvements to our detectors
the point where we believe within a few
years we'll be seeing black holes
colliding every few days maybe even
every day we'll be seeing binary neutron
stars colliding every month we'll be
able to maybe detect supernovas there
are many other sources that we can
detect so there's there's really a wide
panoply of of interesting astrophysics
out there so I think with that I'm going
to stop and just again give my main
message that I think this revolution has
begun it's quite interesting I want to
thank the National Science Foundation
who has really really been committed to
this project over 40 years this was a
very high-risk project when you first
hear about it when I first heard about
it I thought it can't really work and
then I studied a little more and I did
the fact that the NSF supported us I
think is a testament to their commitment
to fundamental science I have colleagues
at Caltech and MIT and then there's a
much broader collaboration called the
LIGO scientific collaboration it's about
1,200 people that really are very much
responsible for most of what I've talked
about here tonight so thank you for your
attention I'm happy to take questions
please go ahead
it's gonna be a fuzzy question but I was
reading something to the effect that the
probability of that initial collision
from the first detection is actually
quite improbable is that correct to do
what what's the announced to show about
the likelihood of two black holes of
that kind of a mass existing and somehow
managing to find each other yeah so
they're two two ways to answer that
first first way is in our game it's all
about rates it's a question of how many
of these binaries black hole systems
exist how often are they produced and
the uncertainty before we made our
observations in those rates was actually
quite large was three orders of
magnitude so from that sense you know
maybe it was a little bit lucky but not
much I think that more interesting
question you're asking is the fact that
they were heavier mass black holes that
actually is something that I think was
very very surprising there are models in
fact every believe maybe people in the
audience who know more about this than I
that that you can predict if you have
two stars that are locked in orbit you
know each of them explodes as long as
the energy that's released in that
explosion doesn't kick the other star
out of orbit and then it explodes you
can form an isolated binary system but
in order for those systems to be very
heavy there are very special conditions
on the on the stars for example they
have to be very old stars they have to
be mostly hydrogen like stars so that
part of it is the part that I think is
surprising and and as we get more of
these we're going to start to do what we
call population
studies alright you get a you could
basically get a populations of masses we
also are interested in the spins of the
black holes that's a little bit harder
and will start to be able to answer
these questions a little bit more but I
think the mass part of it actually was
quite surprising so why don't we go over
here yeah so similar to sonar is there a
way for you to derive information about
things that the gravitational waves have
passed through on their way to the
detector so to give you more insight
into sort of the internal function in
black hole or other yeah not so much the
internal function I mean what we do is
so not right you could you could easily
put Bose headsets on and listen to that
chirp that I played and after you get
really good at it you could say that's a
10 solar mass on 20 solar mass black
black hole the wave form has a lot of
information and that's actually how we
get the masses out of the black hole I
can explain them later if you're
interested I all of these gravitational
waves are natural when they come they
basically stretch and squeeze the
detector so you get that you sort of get
that information for free as they pass
as they pass through the detector the
challenge for us is to see more of these
and so what we're trying to do is make
better and more sensitive detector so
that Delta L over L we have ideas from
we're making that even ten times more
sensitive all right and that will that
way we'll be able to see these things
much much more frequently I think I
answered your question I hope I did if I
didn't rephrase it more about as so you
talked about the the large mass of
objects as they create the gravitational
waves and you detect the waves
themselves but how much do you learn
about the things the wave has passed
through oh yeah so so we rely on our
knowledge of general relativity alright
two things about that first of all these
wave sources basically where they're
produced the the we measure the
amplitude of the wave which falls off as
one over the distance all right so all
once we extract the masses from the the
wave forms we then can say something
about how far away they are so we know
that the other thing to say about it is
that that gravitational waves interact
extremely weakly with with with the
earth so there's there's in some sense
no effect other than the fact that we
record
this waveform that we can gain
information from I guess that would be
the best way I said okay as you bring
more observatories online in addition to
perhaps improving your training a
triangulation a bit are there other
things you learn by having or yeah so
one thing I didn't talk about I talked
about it briefly was polarization all
right so so the polar gravitational
waves are common two polarizations and
the source learning something about the
the polarization emitted from the source
will tell you something about the
astrophysics so the source for example
if you if you think about a binary
neutrons or a binary system that's
orbiting right the light that or the
gravitational waves that come
perpendicular to the plane aboard it's a
circularly polarized whereas the light
that comes this way is linearly
polarized so if you can resolve the
polarizations you can say for example
something about the angles of the
inclination and things like that so
there's a little bit of information
there that the thing the really the the
thing that the the network gets you is
that these detectors are not always
online and so like right now they're
there's no interferometer there's
actually working we're all offline
trying to make our make improvements to
our detectors when they are all online
some of them they drop out there's
always something that perturbs you know
for honor earthquake for example
sometimes a truck drives by and causes a
problem and they're that sensitive and
so by having more of these on you just
have redundancy in the systems that you
can that you can be able to still detect
the grid of the gravitational way so
those two things polarization and
redundancy or actor yes so what's the
outlook in being able to measure the
gravitational waves from merging white
dwarves you know I'm not sure how much
more sensitive it would have to be and
what the timeframe would be before that
would be possible yeah so that's what
Lisa does right so so the what the white
dwarfs actually because they're not as
stiff as neutron stars or as black holes
basically they should as they get close
to one another they rip apart so the
wave forms actually the
the frequencies of waveforms basically
only go up to sub Hertz and things like
that so so Lisa will be able to see see
some of those things very much I was
just wondering if you mentioned that
Einstein sort of predicted the concept
of these waves it's not the amount of
technology that would come along to be
able to measure them from your
perspective what would you say is the
biggest surprise that you were the
community of experience and trying and
being able to measure them yeah so the
biggest surprise well many but let me
just start at the top the the fact that
you could actually see the squiggles in
the data
none of us predicted that everybody
thought that we would have to use
computers thousands of coure hours of
computers to tease out the waveform we
use a technique called match filtering
where we do cross correlations the fact
that this this way this thing was so big
that you could see it in the data it was
very simple filtering was just shocking
to us that was number one the other
surprise I think was the fact that the
first neutron star the binary neutron
star that I talked about we were able to
get it with the tool ago and the one
Virgo detector and there's an
interesting story there too and and get
the e nm community all the astronomers
to point their satellites in the first
event we actually see both light and and
gravitationally
that was something that I would have
never predicted myself so so those are
the what what else is surprising there
are lots of binary black holes in the
universe that's quite surprising they're
very they're very massive that's quite
surprising we now think we know where
heavy elements come from that's quite
surprising so that's that's all there's
a lot of good stuff there are there any
questions from that I'm told that there
might be some questions coming in online
all right we have a few questions from
online bill asks are there any
indications of what a black hole
collision would look like well so the
simulation that I showed is what it
would really look like if you were if
you were in a spaceship about oh I don't
know a thousand kilometres maybe five
thousand kilometres from those two black
holes
and you you were looking at the orbital
dynamics that is in fact what you would
see those the the merging of those two
event horizons what happens inside that
we have no idea that's just something
that that physics doesn't tell us how to
get to at this point and Laurie asks is
there any loss of mass in this merger
when the black holes collide yeah
absolutely so in the case of in most
cases there's about one to two or three
solar masses that are produced and in
this collision so basically it's like
take three times the mass of the Sun and
just pull it goes away and it goes into
gravitational ways so a lot of this is
this is e equals MC squared in its most
pure form and are there any concepts on
how cosmic streams strings are a part of
this so we search for cosmic strings we
have a you know so there are models for
for cosmic strings how when they cross
one another they basically will produce
a cusp and that cusps will produce
gravitational waves so we look for that
we haven't seen it so we can't really
say anything other than the fact that
we're looking and if we see some bursts
of gravitational waves it we might be
able to say that it comes from cosmic
strings so stay tuned that's one what I
would say stay tuned for okay anything
else all right I think we're done thank
you very much for your attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
