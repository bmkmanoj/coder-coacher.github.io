all ask some deep and difficult
questions why is the world filled with
wall how can we make it better how do we
give meaning and purpose to our lives
well as difficult as these questions are
many people have answers to them for
example some people believe that
morality is dictated by God in Holy
Scriptures when everyone obeys his laws
the world will be perfect or problems
all that are the fault of evil people
who must be shamed punished and defeated
or our tribe should claim its rightful
greatness under the control of a strong
leader who embodies its authentic virtue
or in the past we lived in a state of
order and harmony until alien forces
brought on decadence and degeneration we
must restore the society to its golden
age
well what about the rest of us in
enlightenment now I argue that there is
an alternative system of beliefs and
values namely the ideals of the
Enlightenment that we can use knowledge
to enhance human flourishing many people
embrace the ideals of the Enlightenment
without being able to name or describe
them they've faded into the background
as the the status quo or the
establishment other ideologies have
passionate advocates and I suggest that
enlightenment ideals to need a positive
defense and an explicit commitment and
that is what I've tried to do the ideals
of the Enlightenment I suggest can be
captured in four key ideas reason
science humanism and progress let me say
a few words about each it all begins
with reason with the realization that
traditional sources of belief are
generators of delusion faith revelation
tradition Authority
charisma mysticism intuition the
hermeneutic parsing of sacred texts are
all ways of being wrong reason in
contrast is non-negotiable as soon as
you try to provide reasons why we should
trust anything other than reason as soon
as you try to suggest that you are right
that other people should believe you
that you're not lying or full of crap
you've lost the argument because you've
appealed to reason now humans on their
own are not particularly reasonable
cognitive psychologists most notably
Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman have
shown that human beings are likely
liable to generalize from anecdotes to
reason from stereotypes to we all seek
evidence that confirms our beliefs and
blow-off evidence that disconfirms them
and we're overconfident about our
knowledge our wisdom and our rectitude
however people are capable of reason if
they establish certain norms and
institutions such as free speech anyone
can criticize the claims of anyone else
such an open criticism and debate
logical analysis fact-checking
and empirical testing which brings me to
the second of the Enlightenment ideals
science science is based on the
conviction that the world is
intelligible that we can understand the
world by formulating possible
explanations and testing them against
reality science has shown itself to be
the most reliable way of understanding
the world including ourselves an
important enlightenment ideal is that
there can be a science of human nature
and that beliefs about society are
testable just like any other beliefs
about the world science provides not
just technical know-how and handy
gadgets but fundamental insights about
the human condition naturalism the
universe has no goal or purpose related
to human welfare with the implication
that if we want to improve that welfare
we've got to figure out how to do it
ourselves entropy in a closed system one
without input of energy disorder
increases things fall apart stuff
happens and that's because there are
vastly more ways for things to go wrong
than to go right
evolution humans are products of a
competitive process which selects for
reproductive success not for wellbeing
as a manual can't put it out of The
Crooked Timber of humanity no truly
straight thing can be built this leads
to the third enlightenment theme
humanism that the ultimate moral purpose
is to reduce the suffering and enhance
the flourishing of human beings and
other sentient creatures now that that
sounds pretty obvious who could be
against human flourishing and the answer
is there are lots of alternative moral
systems that prioritize other things
such as that the ultimate good is to
enhance the glory of the tribe the
nation the race the class or the faith
to obey the dictates of a divinity and
pressure others to do the same to
achieve feats of heroic greatness or to
advance some mystical force dialectic
struggle or perso pursuit of a utopian
or messianic age humanism is feasible
because humans are endowed with a sense
of sympathy another recurring
enlightenment theme that is we can be
concerned with the welfare of others we
feel others pain by default our circle
of sympathy is rather puny we tend to
sympathize only with genetic relatives
with close friends and allies with cute
little fuzzy baby animals and and that's
about it but our sense of sympathy can
be expanded through the forces of
cosmopolitanism through education
journalism art mobility and reason I
can't insist that my interests are
special just because I'm me and you're
not and hope for you to take me
seriously so when we're engaged in
discourse that forces us to expand our
circle of sympathy to include
others the final enlightenment ideal is
progress that if we apply knowledge and
sympathy to reduce suffering and enhance
flourishing we can gradually succeed
now if human nature doesn't change how
could progress be possible and an
important an answer from the
Enlightenment is it's possible through
benevolent norms and institutions by
which we can deploy energy and knowledge
to combat entropy we can magnify the
better angels of our nature such as
reason and sympathy
while marginalizing our inner demons our
biases our illusions our tribalism our
dominance our vengeance examples of
enlightenment institutions brain
children of the Enlightenment our
democracy declarations of rights markets
organizations for global cooperation and
institutions of truth seeking such as
academies scientific societies and a
free press so how did that enlightenment
thing work out well if you ask most
intellectuals the answer is not very
well because I have learned that most
intellectuals hate progress and
intellectuals who call themselves
progressive really hate progress if you
think we can solve problems I have been
told then you have a blind faith and a
quasi religious belief in the outmoded
superstition of the false promise of the
myth of the onward march of inevitable
inevitable progress you are a
cheerleader for vulgar American can-do
ISM with the rah-rah spirit of boardroom
ideology Silicon Valley and the Chamber
of Commerce you are a practitioner of
Whig history a naive optimist a
Pollyanna and of course a Pangloss an
allusion to the Voltaire character who
declared all is for the best in the best
of all possible worlds now by today's
standards Pangloss would be categorized
as a pessimist because a real optimist
would think that they we can do much
better than the world we find today this
is
definitely not the best of all possible
worlds but the case for progress should
not depend on what on an attitude a
temperament whether you have a sunny
disposition it can be treated as an
empirical hypothesis human well-being
can be measured we can measure life
health sustenance prosperity peace
freedom safety knowledge leisure
happiness I submit if they have
increased over time that is progress in
enlightenment now I try to make the case
with graphs plotting measures of human
well-being over time because of the
constraints of this room I although I
feel naked telling the story without
graphs behind me I'll have to do a
combination of verbal description and
pantomime to convey the same point well
let's begin with the most precious
resource of all life itself through most
of human history life expectancy at
birth was around 30 years but thanks to
vaccination sanitation antibiotics and
other advances in health and medicine
life expectancy at birth today in the
developed world is greater than 80 years
and in the world as a whole 71 years
virtually no one guesses that it is that
high through most of history that the
biggest hit to human lifespan has been
child mortality indeed even in a country
as wealthy and advanced as Sweden 200
years ago about one third of children
did not make it to their fifth birthday
today in the poorest parts of the world
no more than 6% of children fail to make
it out of there there are fifth birthday
this would be sub-saharan countries like
Ethiopia which just in the last 40 years
have brought their rate of trial
mortality down from 25 percent to 6
percent still too high but the but the
improvement is is continuing maternal
mortality is another contributor to
premature death and in Sweden 200 years
ago one percent of
others died in childbirth that has been
brought down now to a third of 1% in the
poorest countries of the world and with
most of the measures of well-being
unfortunately I can't depict it in
graphs but the general pattern that you
see in measure after measure is that
before the Enlightenment about 250 years
ago pretty much everyone was wretched
there was a universal poverty and hunger
and early death European and American
countries were the first to make the
great escape from universal poverty and
early death followed though recently by
Asia southern Asia and now sub-saharan
Africa is closing the gap health the as
someone who has spent a good chunk of
his career studying the grammar of the
past tense in English I can identify my
favorite past tense sentence in the
history of the language it comes from a
Wikipedia entry for smallpox and the
entry begins smallpox was a disease
caused by two viruses yes the definition
is in the past tense because smallpox
which killed some 300 million people in
20th century alone has ceased to exist
and similar progress has been made
well not quite similar yet but other
diseases are slated for the past tense
including polio and guinea worm and even
diseases that will not be extinguished
are all coming down in the mortality
rates pneumonia diarrhea malaria measles
hiv/aids sustenance in starting with the
Agricultural Revolution in Britain in
the late 18th century with crop rotation
other advances in agronomy later
synthetic fertilizers the mechanization
of farming selective breeding has
captured in the Green Revolution thought
to have saved a billion lives and
transportation networks the number of
calories available per
has increased in every part of the world
including sub-saharan Africa and India
now this would be a dubious form of
progress if all those extra calories
were just making fat people people
fatter but in fact undernourishment
is being decimated in 1947 approximately
50% of the world met the definition of
undernourishment that fell to about 33%
in 1970 and it has come down in every
part of the world it's effectively zero
in the developed world but also coming
down in Latin America Asia and
sub-saharan Africa as a result famine
which was one of the Horsemen of the
Apocalypse
which could strike any continent without
warning for most of human history has
pretty much been banished except for the
most remote and war-torn corners of the
world prosperity for most of human
history economic growth pretty much was
a non-existent a tiny little increase
until the Industrial Revolution in the
18th century which initiated a blast off
of exponential growth with a result that
gross world product increased about 200
fold in the last 250 years once again
this was an uneven process it began with
Europe and the Americas thanks to the
growth of Education and Technology and
institutions that foster commerce and
trade but again this would be dubious
achievement if it simply made rich
people richer again but in a development
that seldom appreciated the growth of
prosperity is starting to put an end to
extreme poverty extreme poverty is
standardly defined as the minimum amount
necessary to feed oneself and one's
family by that criterion 200 years ago
about 90% of the world's population fit
the definition of extreme poverty that
has now fallen to less than 10% and the
United Nations has set as one of its
sustainable development goals
the elimination of extreme poverty
everywhere on earth by the 2030s may we
all live to see to see that day as a
result of the decimation of extreme
poverty global inequality has been
decreasing now it was it's inevitable
that with the Industrial Revolution and
the first expansion of wealth that
inequality must have increased because
before the Industrial Revolution
everyone lived in squalid poverty pretty
much when with the discovery of new
sources of wealth from industrialization
I admit that some people escaped from
extreme poverty leaving others behind
therefore increasing global inequality
but more recently because of
globalization and trade and markets poor
countries have been getting richer
faster than rich countries have been
getting richer and the global inequality
index has been decreasing
now of course within wealthy countries
like the United States and Britain
inequality has been increasing but
perhaps what's more relevant is not so
much the gap between the rich and poor
but the situation of the of the poor
whether people not so much whether
everyone has the same but whether
everyone has enough and in a revolution
that is seldom appreciated there's been
a massive expansion in the amount of
social spending that is reallocation of
wealth to the poor the sick the young
the old in every developed country it's
even called even has a name called
Wagner's law for most of history even
the wealthiest countries devoted perhaps
1% of their GDP to social spending today
the median is 22 percent of social
spending even a country like the United
States which is behind the Western
average allocates 19 percent of its GDP
to social transfers thanks to these
social transfers while inequality has
increased poverty has not by the measure
of disposable income that is after
taxes and transfers the poverty rate in
the United States has fallen by one
measure from about 30% in 1960 to about
6% today and if it's measured by
consumption by what people can afford in
food and clothing and shelter the
poverty rate today is less than 3% peace
for most of modern history war is the
natural state of international relations
and peace was a mere interlude between
wars I have a graph from a previous book
the better angels of our nature why
violence has declined which shows the
percentage of years that the great
powers of the day the major states and
empires were at each other's throats in
in in major Wars and it goes from about
a hundred percent in the sixteenth
century
to zero percent today there has not been
a great power war directly pitting two
great powers against each other since
the United States faced off against
China 60 years ago if we zoom in on the
post-war period we see that another
unheralded development which is with ups
and downs the global rate of death in
warfare has been dramatically decreasing
during the era of the Korean War about
20 per hundred thousand people per year
died in war that went down to about nine
or ten during the in the 1960s during
the Vietnam War about five in the 1980s
during the iran-iraq war and the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan today even with
the worst war in a generation the Syrian
civil war it's about 1.2 with the
signing of the peace agreement between
the government of Colombia and the FARC
guerrillas the last war in the Western
Hemisphere came to an end so we're
living in an era in which an entire
hemisphere is free of war and indeed 5/6
of the world's surface is now free of
war freedom and rights despite obvious
backsliding in Russia in Turkey in
Venezuela
and just today in in China the overall
trend towards democratization has not
been reversed in the world has never
been more democratic than it has been in
this Democrat in this decade in 1971 the
world only had 31 democracies half of
Europe was behind the Iron Curtain
even in Western Europe Spain and
Portugal were fascist dictatorships
Greece was under the control of a
military junta most of Latin America was
under the control of military
governments Taiwan South Korea are all
dictatorships today they have all become
democratic and from 31 countries in 1971
today a hundred and three countries are
democracies comprising about two thirds
of the world's countries and two-thirds
of the world's population within
countries as well the power of
governments to to brutalize their
citizens has been gradually curtailed
capital punishment which used to be
pretty much universal has been abolished
in country after country if current
trends continue they probably won't but
if you were to extrapolate the line for
abolition of capital punishment capital
punishment will vanish from the face of
the earth in about ten years in another
development in country after country
homosexuality is has been decriminalized
it used to be a criminal offense in just
about every country and every year
another couple of countries
decriminalize homosexuality child labor
in England in the mid nineteenth century
they are immortalized by Dickens in
Oliver Twist for example about a third
of the children were put to work in
farms and factories thanks to for the
premium on education mechanization of
Agriculture and an increased valuation
of the lives of children that went down
to pretty close to zero a trajectory
that is now being replicated in the
world as a whole in 1950 also about 30
percent of the world's children were put
to work today it is now 10 percent and
continuing to fall Kahler sati Aarti won
the Nobel Peace Prize a couple of years
ago for
his efforts hugely successful in
bringing down the rates of child labor
violent crime in the homicide statistics
in many parts of the world go back 800
years to the Middle Ages and in the 14th
century the homicide rate in England and
Netherlands and other European countries
was in the order about thirty five per
hundred hundred thousand per year thanks
to the frontier regions being brought
under the control of the rule of law and
the anarchy and the code of vendetta
being replaced by a criminal justice
system that rate has fallen to about one
per hundred thousand per year a thirty
five fold reduction that is a process
that seems to be replicated whenever
frontier regions are brought under the
rule of law the same thing happened in
New England when the anarchy of the
frontier fell under the rule of law same
thing happened in the American Wild West
made famous by the the cowboy movies and
even parts of the world that today
remain notorious for their high rates of
violence like Mexico I have had a a five
fold reduction compared to the rate of
violence in the 1930s that process has
continued in the United States which in
rates of violence as with in many other
areas of human flourishing the United
States is kind of a backwater when it
comes to wealthy democracies in pretty
much every measure of human flourishing
flourishing we fall behind our
democratic peers most notably homicide
where our rates of homicide have been
between five and ten times that of
European countries but even in the
United States the rate of homicide has
fallen by more than half in just the
last 25 years it's not just the most
extreme crime namely homicide that has
shown reductions but the rate of rape in
the United States has fallen seventy
five percent since the 1970s the rate of
domestic violence has plummeted and the
victimization of children in school
yards in the home rates of bullying
faith rates of physical abuse rates of
sexual
have all gone down indeed we have become
safer in just about every other way that
you can imagine thanks to advances in
the design of automobiles and highways
better licensing requirements better
traffic law enforcement we are 96% less
likely to die in a car crash compared to
the early 20th century
we're eighty eight percent less likely
to be mowed down on the sidewalk 99%
less likely to die in a plane crash
fifty-nine percent less likely to fall
to our deaths
92 percent less likely to be burned to
death 90 percent less likely to drown 92
percent less likely to be asphyxiated
there's one exception to this trend and
if I were to be able to show you the
graph you'd see a bunch of curves all
going down for various accidental causes
of death but one of them going up and
that is the category that public health
experts call death by poison solid or
liquid at first when I saw that curve I
wondered why people were suddenly
drinking bleach or eating eating rat
poison but it turns out that that is the
category that includes drug overdoses
and the opioid epidemic is one category
of safety that has gone dramatically in
the wrong direction however were 95
percent less likely to be killed on the
on the job and we're globally far less
likely to be killed in an act of God in
a earthquake a brush fire a volcano a
flood a feminine famine what about the
quintessential act of God everyone's
favorite metaphor for an unpredictable
date with death the literal bolt from
the blue the thunderbolt hurled by zeus
yes we are 96% less likely to die from a
lightning strike compared to several
decades ago knowledge in through most of
European history no more than 15% of the
population knew how to read or write
today that figure is a hundred percent
in the developed world but in the world
as a whole
the literacy rate has exceeded 80
percent and for people under the age of
25 90 percent this is true not just for
boys as was traditional but but for
girls the world is approaching gender
parity in literacy and in Basic
Education and perhaps the most
incredible example of human progress
that that that I have come across one
that still strains most people's
credulity we are getting smarter in a
well replicated effect called the Flynn
effect IQ scores have been increasing by
three points a decade for almost a
century thanks mostly to the spread of
education probably also because of the
rise of public health and probably also
the spread of symbols and abstract
concepts into everyday life trickling
down from science academia and
technology well does any of this bring
any gains in quality of life all these
things that economists like to measure
and quantify well by pretty much any
definition of quality of life yes for
example we as Charles Dickens reminded
us in a Christmas carol in the
nineteenth century people worked about
65 hours a week that has fallen by 22
hours a week and most workers today get
three weeks of paid vacation in addition
to the reduced work week in the domestic
sphere we used to spend about 60 hours a
week on household housework and by we
that really means women since housework
traditionally and to a large extent
today is gendered but thanks to the
ubiquity of electricity running water
and labor-saving devices like
refrigerators vacuum cleaners washing
machines dishwashers and stoves which a
majority of households have including a
majority of poor households the amount
of time that we lose housework has
fallen from about 60 hours a week to
about 15 hours a week and in fact an
entire day of a week of one's life it
used to be called wash day a day in
which women did nothing but wash clothes
has been returned to our lives thanks to
the reduction in the workweek and the
reduction in house in housework leisure
time has been increasing even since the
1960s putting aside the gains from the
early 20th century if you were to see
the graph you'd see one anomaly which is
that the amount of leisure time for men
has steadily increased the amount of
leisure time for women increased through
the early 90s and then kind of leveled
off and the reason is that women spend
more time today with their children in
fact a single working mother today
spends more hours a week with their
children than a married stay-at-home mom
spent in the 1950s
so forget Leave It to Beaver we also
spend less of our paycheck on
necessities in 1920 people had to fork
over more than 60% of their paycheck to
food clothing and shelter today it's
less than a third well does any of this
make any difference for our happiness
and the answer is it does in a majority
of countries for which we have
longitudinal data that tracks happiness
over time there's been an increase
United States by the way is an exception
the United States happiness is pretty
much stagnated although it hasn't gotten
worse and more generally if we take if
we step back and we look at the effects
of economic development on happiness we
look at the full range of the scale from
poor countries to rich countries then we
see that there is a very strong but
logarithmic relationship between GDP per
capita and happiness both across
countries and within countries so as the
world gets richer its people on average
get happier well has this all happened
at the expense of the environment
initially it surely did but in a
development that few people appreciate
the environment is rebounding and in a
kind of report card for the state of the
environment that done at Yale University
the environmental progress index 78 out
of 80 countries have shown an increase
in Environmental Quality in the last
several decades this includes the United
States
where since the passage of the
Environmental Protection Act in 1970 our
GDP has gone up the number of miles that
we drive every year has gone up the
amount our population has gone up but
the rate of emission of air pollutions
at the same time has gone down so the
idea this popular both among the the
hard green left and the hard libertarian
right that you can have environmental
growth or you could have environmental I
sorry you could have economic growth or
Environmental Protection but you can't
have both is false we have had both
thanks to an environmental regulation
which needless to say are currently
under threat in temperate parts of the
world deforestation has basically fallen
to zero as farms have been abandoned and
are reclaimed by forests even in
tropical forests where there's still an
alarming amount of deforestation the
amount of deforestation has peaked and
has come way down we have to bring that
to zero but the direction is downward as
the world has shipped more and more oil
by sea there have been fewer and fewer
oil spills and more and more of the
Earth's surface both land surface and
oceans have are now protected against
economic exploitation about fifteen
percent of the world's land area and
about twelve percent of the world's
oceans well I've reviewed a case under K
after case of what one would have to
call human progress
how is this reflected in the news well
one more graph that again I'm gonna have
to pantomime because I can't have
project it I data scientists use the
technique of sentiment mapping which
automatically analyzes news stories for
degree of positivity positive words and
negative words and what it is shown is
that the New York Times has gotten
pretty much more and more morose over
time that's not just the New York Times
a sample of the world's new sources
shows the same increasing gloominess so
why do people deny progress
one answer comes from an interaction
between the nature of human cognition
and the nature of journalism Amos
Tversky and Daniel Kahneman identified a
shortcut that the human brain takes a
rule of thumb by which we assess
probability and risk and danger called
the availability heuristic namely the
easier it is to recall examples from
memory images anecdotes narratives the
more likely we think something is well
now think about how the news works news
is about the stuff that happens it's not
about stuff that doesn't happen you
never see a reporter saying Here I am
reporting live from a city that has not
been struck by terrorists today or a
school that has not been shot up or a
country that has been at peace for 40
years as long as the number of bad
events hasn't fallen to zero there will
always be incidents to report on the
news you combine that with the
availability heuristic and you get the
impression that the world is getting
more dangerous and always has been
there are other psychological quirks
that I think inflate our sense of dread
and doom in a phenomenon sometimes
called the negativity bias that bad is
stronger than good we dread losses more
than we savor gains we worry more about
threats than we appreciate improvements
lead to not only a sense that the world
is always a dangerous place but it kind
of opens up a niche for professional
imagines and doomsayers and profits to
remind us of threats that we may have
overlooked
indeed this sets up a kind of perverse
prophecy market where the gloomiest most
morose prophets are the ones though -
which we Accord the greatest moral
seriousness as Morgan Housel the
financier writer put it pessimist sound
like they're trying to help you
optimist sound like they're trying to
sell you something
okay let me conclude with three general
questions about progress in an
Enlightenment one might reasonably ask
isn't it good to be pessimistic isn't it
important to rake the muck afflict the
comfortable speak truth to power well it
is up to a point but really what's
important is to be accurate that is to
be aware of problems and suffering and
injustice where they occur but also to
be aware of ways in which they can be
reduced because there are dangers to
thoughtless pessimism one of them is
fatalism why waste time and money on a
hopeless cause why why throw money down
a rat hole trying to alleviate poverty
in the developing world if the poor will
always be with you it's precisely the
conviction that we can improve solve
problems that gives us the confidence to
solve the problems that remain also
thoughtless pessimism can give rise to
radicalism that if every institution is
failing if all our problems are
intractable society is just spiraling
downward circling the drain then we may
as well raise the institute institutions
of modernity smash the Machine drain the
swamp burn the empire to the ground
empower a leader who promises only I can
fix it and out of the hope that anything
would be better than what we have now
well that can be a history reminds us
that can be a dangerous kind of
desperation because the sentiment that
things can't get any worse can be wrong
is wrong given how much better things
have become even with the problems that
remain second question is progress
inevitable and the answer is of course
not there is no magical arc bending
toward justice or tide of rising human
improvement that will make things better
off all by themselves
quite the contrary the laws of the
universe are indifferent to human
well-being
and left to their own devices things get
worse not better solutions create new
problems which have to be solved in
their turn
and we can always be blindsided by nasty
surprises and they do happen like the
world wars the 1960's crime boom the
opioid epidemic in the United States
also there are severe global challenges
that we have not yet solved prominent
among them are climate change and the
threat of nuclear war an improbable but
potentially catastrophic event I think
we are best off seeing these as problems
that are unsolved but solvable climate
change must be addressed by
decarbonisation via carbon pricing
including carbon taxes and low zero and
eventually negative carbon technologies
denuclearization I ought to be pursued
via enhancing international stability
and programs of threat reduction and
arms reduction the two more graphs which
I would show you if I was showing graphs
so that progress in both of these
endeavors is by no means a utopian
aspiration but it's in to some extent
it's been happening if you plot the
amount of co2 that countries emit per
dollar of GDP you find that there is a
an arc that Britain for example first
country to industrialize had huge carbon
emissions when it relied on wood and
then coal but then less as a switch to
oil and gas and renewables and nuclear
the United States follow the same
u-shaped curve China has repeated that
trajectory India and the world as a
whole
so industrialization is not inexorably
committed to a flaming carbon but
decarbonization is a process that has
begun it has to be accelerated much more
has to be brought to zero but those
graphs suggest that it is not impossible
likewise few people are aware that the
world's nuclear arsenal has been reduced
by 85 percent since the height of the
Cold War indeed about 10 percent of
American energy comes from
nuclear power from decommissioned Soviet
weapons again that ideally should be
brought to to zero
final question that I'll raise does the
enlightenment somehow go against human
nature this is a frequent act with
accusation from defenders of religion
and nationalism but humanism all sounds
very good but isn't it kind of arid or
tepid or a flattened view of human life
as if the conquest of disease famine
poverty violence and ignorance is boring
do people need to believe in magic a
father in the sky a strong chief to
protect the tribe myths of heroic
ancestors well I don't think so
for one thing secular liberal
democracies have proven themselves to be
the happiest and healthiest places on
earth probably in the history of our
species and they're the top destination
of the people who vote with their feet
also I dare say that applying knowledge
and sympathy to enhance human
flourishing when properly appreciated is
heroic glorious and I dare say spiritual
thank you very much
have I used up all the time or is there
time left request we've got some time
for questions for the audience just
raise your hand and I will come - I do
have a Q&amp;amp;A mic here we'll get to as many
folks as we can and folks please do keep
your questions to questions Thank You
Steven um I have a lot of admiration for
you as a public intellectual that you
write some great books to read and I'm
not about to argue with your statistics
on human history however I think your
unfettered optimism is a bit irrational
I think was Martin Rees who said a good
way to figure out how long things are
gonna last is to see how long they've
lasted and the Enlightenment and Western
modern Western civilization there's only
a couple hundred years old so and I was
looking at the curve you had of GDP and
it's just it feels like it's just going
against the thermodynamic and
probability gradient it just feels like
you're gonna just fall off so do you
think okay yeah do you think that maybe
don't you think maybe this is a local
maximum and that with the uncertainty of
climate change and artificial
intelligence that all bets are off
well a few things there's no law of
physics or the university says that the
GDP growth has to level off or stop
because GDP isn't about stuff GDP is
about things that people value and in
particular as with the advanced in
technology we get more and more human
benefit with fewer and fewer atoms I
mean our smartphone has replaced
something like 50 appliances most
wealthy countries have reached peak
stuff that is they we consume less
timber less steel less every resource
but life keeps getting more and more
interesting because we just process bits
on our on our cell phone so GDP there's
no law that says the GDP has to level
off that is if that is a myth a climate
change indeed is an unsolved problem as
I mentioned and maybe we won't solve it
but no maybe we will paths towards
decarbonization have been laid out there
is no law of physics that says that we
cannot solve the problem there may be a
lack of political coordination and will
but there's plenty of photons that hits
the world surface from solar energy
there are plenty of opportunities from
nuclear energy to supply the world's
energy needs even with exponential
growth continuing into the future in
terms of the long run like the very long
run well yeah the sun's gonna expand
into a red giant it's gonna boil away
our oceans we are gonna die and you know
it along run we're dead and so there is
undoubtedly a local maximum in the span
of of millennia hundreds of millennia
and millions of years but I there could
be you can't say that there isn't but
none of the arguments that there are I
think holds water and I think the threat
of runaway artificial intelligence I
haven't mentioned that tonight but I do
discuss it in detail in the in the book
is a is completely fanciful I think it's
like the the fear that many of us
remember of the y2k bug now if you
remember in 1999 anyone remember how
nuclear missiles were going to launch
from their silos planes we're gonna fall
from the sky nuclear power plants were
going to meltdown I personally think
that the threat from artificial
intelligence is it is in that category
that's different than the threat of
nuclear war and climate change which I
think are real are serious are unsolved
but might be solvable but I'm not
worried about robots so first off thanks
for coming today and thanks for the
great talk if the mainstream media is
negative in nature then does not mean
there's a trade-off between being happy
and being informed even if we're
consciously knowing it's going to be
negative yeah there is something of a
trade-off and I I do discuss that in the
chapter on happiness that one of the
reasons that I speculates no one knows
the reason why given the rising
objective fortunes of Americans why is
our happiness stagnated and in in some
ways the percentage of Americans who
call themselves extremely happy has has
gradually sunk somewhat and some of it
may be that as we become more aware of
the world's problems just as when we
grow up and we become more mature our
worry burden increases when we become
grown up so we have to pay the rent and
make a living and put food on the table
as a species we have to now worry about
things that a couple of generations ago
people didn't worry about like in the
1950s probably the peak of American
influence and and and glory and standing
you know people didn't worry about
racial inequality they didn't worry as
much as we do about nuclear war I mean
they were you know there was the atomic
cafe there were Tomic bombs are kind of
cute in the early 1950s housewives
enjoyed domestic bliss with all their
appliances poverty was invisible African
Americans were invisible and as we
became more aware of American foreign
policy blunders of poverty of
environmental degradation then I think
wasn't surprising that each one of us
might add to our personal worry list
some of the world's problems I mean now
there are people who are anxious about
climate change even though there's
nothing whatsoever that they personally
can do about it so you're right I think
there is something of a trade-off and I
think one of the challenges in us to us
as individuals is how to be mature and
responsible about taking the world's
problems seriously without all of us
worrying ourselves to death and whether
it'll be through your mindfulness or
meditation or cognitive behavior therapy
or pharmaceuticals or advice from wise
people it is a challenge that we face as
we grow up and become mature citizens
thank you for being here mr. Pinker um I
was wondering about what you thought
caused the Enlightenment so you can
think of human history beginning a long
time ago but civilization being
relatively new but even in that span you
it's only the 1700s sort of that you
know made people value signs and
humanism so how well how could you think
of those causes and yeah no it's a great
question and with all as with all
historical questions the problem being
that it only happened once so we can't
kind of rewind the tape and play it
thousands of times and add up all of the
different outcomes and of course there
were predecessors to Enlightenment ideas
in
classical Greece during the Renaissance
so here's some possibilities one of them
is historical memory of the carnage of
the Wars of Religion of the 15th and
16th sorry 16th and 17th centuries and
people realized that horrific results
happen when you take your religious
beliefs too seriously and the
Protestants massacred Catholics and vice
versa the Scientific Revolution of the
17th century showed people that age-old
convictions could be flat wrong and that
the path to understanding had to be in
applying reason making beliefs tentative
subject to empirical verification the
age of exploration the fact that
entirely new continents came into
people's consciousness with all of these
people's doing things very differently
than Europeans did forcing you to step
back and and and and they work the
Enlightenment thinkers were kind of
cultural anthropologists in appreciating
the diversity of human cultures and
saying well maybe things we've always
taken for granted should be given
another look they the final contributor
may have been a technological
development namely the only industry
that showed a huge increase in
efficiency prior to the Industrial
Revolution of the 19th century was
publishing so in the 18th century the
cost of printing a book or an a pamphlet
and distributing it plunged at the same
time as literacy surpassed the 50% mark
for the first time in European history
and ideas proliferated pamphlets and and
broadsides and treatises and manifestos
kind of went viral by the standards of
the day which meant that they
proliferated in a matter of weeks you
know not minutes but still and so
there's a huge exchange of ideas and
concomitant with the exchange of ideas
people became more mobile it was easier
if you are persecuted you could hop on a
ship and go to Amsterdam or to London
and when the heat got too high and a lot
of the Enlightenment thinkers were
persecuted but managed instead of being
beheaded they found safe havens
somewhere else so the mobility of both
people and ideas I
they also played a role and those are
those are some conjectures I really
enjoyed the book in this talk and I'm
looking forward to your talk with Sam
Harris and my question is on the topic
of artificial intelligence you suggest
in the book that the way to deal with
the way to deal with the risk of
malevolent super intelligent AI that
can't be turned off is simple just don't
build one it seems to me like the
intelligent people who are concerned
about the risks of AI actually think it
will be malevolent and tamper proof that
it won't be malevolent and tamper proof
by design but rather it would be an
unintended consequence given the
potential for good and profit do you
think that it's realistic to expect that
simply not building one is a viable
possibility yeah I do because and I have
a pretty extensive discussion of it in
the in a chapter on so called
existential threats one of them is that
they just the we got to resist the
temptation to think that as things get
smarter they get more ambitious and more
malevolent we kind of project human
primate psychology on the concept of
intelligence and I think that it's
inevitable as as computers get smarter
they're going to want to control more
resources they'll see us as rivals and
that I argue just a fallacy now there's
I think a more sophisticated argument
sometimes called the value alignment
problem that maybe in they won't
actually want to dominate us or displace
us but will be collateral damage for the
goals that we do set them so we say ok
robot cure cancer then it will draft us
all as guinea pigs in fatal experiments
and owe me nothing we can do about it or
we say increase happiness and we train
it on happiness with a picture of a
smile and it'll tile the universe with
smiley faces and confirm convert every
atom in the universe into a smiley face
i I think these scenarios are actually
self refuting for one thing they assume
that we are going to be so brilliant
that we'll design a
artificial intelligence with power to
cure cancer but so stupid that will give
it control over all of our bodies and
over all of society without thinking
well gee what could possibly go wrong
and that the intelligence itself will be
so brilliant that it could devise
experiments that would cure cancer but
so idiotic that it would interpret our
the goals that we set so literally that
it would it would kill us all in the
process I think these are Ivan these are
not just exotic but I think just badly
conceived scenarios even someone like
Elon Musk oh I have tremendous respect
for who calls it artificial intelligent
a threat well why is he building
self-driving cars isn't he worried that
someone will program in take me to the
faster the airport fastest route
possible and the car will just go on a
straight line and mow people down on the
sidewalk and crash through buildings
well he's not really worried about that
because he wouldn't build a car that
would accept a command like that and
likewise real artificial intelligence
won't interpersonally won't give it
control over every molecule in the
universe it won't the idea that
intelligence will take off in such a
unstoppable exponential process I think
is falling victim to the current hype
cycle in AI which AI is always subject
to and that a lot of the current systems
for all their successes are not as
brilliant as they're made out to be this
is a widespread understanding about the
people actually in the trenches of AI
research and also these scenarios
confuse Intel general intelligence with
with Laplace's daemon the hypothetical
entity that knows the position and
velocity of every molecule in the
universe and can predict what's going to
happen by sheer cogitation through sheer
computation now Laplace is demon is
impossible for a variety of reasons and
what real intelligence consists of is
interacting with the world by trial and
error empirically and they'll always be
a limitation of how smart a system can
get base
Stan how embodied it is how connected it
is to the the real world of atoms and so
the fantasy of take off faster than we
can control it I think is disconnected
from the actual nature of intelligence
how about I don't think we've had a
single woman asking a question so yeah
thank you a huge fan of your work um I
feel like a lot of us are saying
everything well it sounds great what
about X won't be well but what about X
won't X be terrible
let me say it what about X 1 X be
terrible I know you talked about the
Flynn of the Flynn effect the increase
in intelligence and how I think you
mentioned in the book that it's started
to slow down is there any oh yeah it's
definitely that may reverse I mean I'm
thinking about studies about
intelligence and number of children
being inversely correlated in some
Western countries is that a cause for
concern yeah there's a things that I
think it's called de DS law things that
can't go on forever don't and the fluid
effect is absolutely leveled off in the
countries that in which it's gone on the
longest it won't keep increasing whether
there'll be some discotheque effect of
like the movie anyone see the movie
idiocracy that kind of plays out for
comic effect as best we can tell that
that doesn't seem to be a strong effect
and doesn't seem to be certainly strong
enough to reverse me the Flynn effect
going in the other direction and the
world contains if you think about how
what percentage of the world has not had
the opportunity to put its innate
intelligence into full use I mean the
percentage of people in Asia in Africa
all these the the top 1% of the IQ
distribution that has not gone to
college or graduate school that that
probably will in the next several
decades if current trends towards
education continue there could be a
massive recruitment of underused
brainpower across the globe that I think
would swamp any kind of a theocracy
area hi thank you for for the talk my
question for you is in relationship to
your finding of the happiness factor
being leveled off for us in the United
States correct yeah and the CDC 2016
causes of death and the 2016 morbidity
all correlate to what seems to be the
stress factor there are ways of the
Bruce McEwan's work with the stress
cycle allostatic load and if it is not
that what is going on is how we perceive
that it is because of our negativity
bias that we're always looking for worst
case scenario and our inabilities and
the Earth Institute Columbia's Earth
Institute and United Nations did a
sustainable happiness what is the
happiness factors in the world factors
that were identified were positive
emotion resilience mindfulness and
pro-social emotions and and freedom and
GDP per capita
well mm-hmm in fact those are the note
number one and number two but yes but
those are also factors all of them at
social trust lack of corruption yeah yes
yes so that thing's the two and the
thing regarding the news I mean that
again the the it's again towards the
negativity factor right it becomes news
because it's more the exception than it
is a common factor for us indeed and and
I should emphasize that that progress
does not mean everything gets better for
everyone always because that would be
magical that wouldn't be kind of science
driven problem-solving and indeed in the
United States in the last five to ten
years there's definitely been a
regression in a particular sector of the
population identified by Angus Deaton
and Anne case namely mainly concentrated
in less educated more rural baby boomer
white men where life expectancy has gone
down suicide has gone up the life
expectancy there enough of them that has
dragged down the life expectancy for the
country as a whole they're defying the
pattern of the rest of the world so this
this is an example of how there can be
local reversals of progress and indeed
the stress might be a contributor the
the negative health effects of stress
because the it's concentrated in sectors
where there has been unemployment and
underemployment
although could also be more direct
namely the loss of health care and
health benefits some of its
self-inflicted because of the
availability of opioids some of it
driven by a by suicide so this is
unmistakably a reversal of progress here
in the United States and one that it's
imperative to to address but it's just
an example of how progress doesn't
happen by itself we've got to identify
the problems and I solve each one in
turn all right and I think it's time for
the signing if you have any final
