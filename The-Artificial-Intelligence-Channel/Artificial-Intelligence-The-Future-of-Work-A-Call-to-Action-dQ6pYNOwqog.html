participants could come up a lot of
people have been asking about what we
can do about some of the the issues that
we presented today well first of all
we've created a LinkedIn group you can
find that on bitly slash fo W forum and
we'll flash that up on the screen at the
end of the the sessions today so that
you can continue the conversation there
but we've put together this particular
roundtable with as many of the internal
stakeholders at MIT as possible to bring
them together and talk about their angle
on this issue and this opportunity of
creating shared prosperity and taking
advantage of artificial intelligence and
the future of work Kathleen Kennedy has
kindly offered to try to corral this a
wily and crazy group of participants
she's very intrepid in that regard she's
done so previously in a number of
different very large projects at MIT
from solve to hub week to the newest
activity at MIT
our tough tech venture capital fund
called the engine so Kathleen's the
perfect person to bring this group
together and and have a useful
conversation about our call to action
Kathleen thank you Dave and thanks for
that fantastic introduction and really
thank you and all the organizers for
these two days they've been incredibly
inspiring and this panel is Dave said is
really about what can MIT do and as
Randy Davis said on the last panel we'd
been here before and that made me
reflect on a statement that I heard and
I think it was Martha Edison that said
in a meeting years ago that one of mi
t--'s best inventions was itself and
that made me then think about when MIT
was founded we were in a bad spot in the
US and MIT helped to transform the US
economy and it feels like we just heard
from Jeffrey Sachs
and everyone over the last two days that
were sort of in one of those spots again
and so our charge
here is what can MIT do what can we do
to really move things forward and to
transform the US economy and really the
world to get us through these issues
around the future of work so we have
pulled together a lot of the key people
from across campus to help us start to
think about that so I'm gonna have Tom
kick us off and to help to give us a bit
of a framework because really what we
want to do is go from talk which we've
done a lot of and I think it was
fantastic to hear all the things that
we've talked about to go to action so
Tom if you want to give us a framework
to help the rest of the panel as we talk
about this for the next hour what should
we do good well thank you Kathleen and
thank you everyone for sticking with us
this afternoon I want to particularly
welcome our Provost Marty Schmidt and
our vice president of research Maria
Zuber who will help us to think about
the future this has been a fantastic two
days but it'll only be a historic two
days if it's a start of something we've
had good discussions now as Kathleen
said what are we gonna do about this I
think there are three points that came
through in the discussion that give us a
beginning roadmap for where to move
forward first I believe we have reframed
the debate about technology in the
future of work away from efforts to try
to define or predict how many jobs are
going to go how many jobs are going to
be created - what can we do to make sure
that we shape technology in the future
of work to create a more shared
prosperity as Jeff Saxon just about
every speaker as is emphasized the the
action orientation of MIT is poised and
ready to do this I believe and I think
that's our challenge to move forward to
say we can do some things and and we
have to figure out what those things are
secondly I think we we got some clues to
what some of those things are not in
full form but at least the broad
outlines of a consensus of some steps
that need to be taken and it's
arts with what so many of us have
emphasized the importance of lifelong
learning and as Raphael rife said in the
beginning upskilling the workforce on a
continuous basis before the crisis
occurs but also the need to better
integrate the design and the development
of technology with the development and
design of work systems bring those two
together and help listen to the
workforce itself in how to shape the
future of work in ways to make these
technologies pay off most effectively
for the firm for society and for all the
stakeholders involved the need to make
sure that we do compensate fairly those
people who will be adversely affected
because there will be significant
numbers and we have to do a better job
of that than we have done in the past
and then as we're going to hear from a
variety of people particularly from Eric
we have a whole array of policies and
institutions that need to be changed and
need to be addressed in order to
complement the technologies and to work
with them to make them effective those
those points all came through and others
as well but they stand out for me as a
starting point and then the third thing
is the amount of energy from the people
who presented it it's clear that MIT has
something to offer and something to
contribute to this action plan and it's
our job now to put some meat on those
bones in and think about how to do this
and I would just offer one historic
point we have been here before we have
done some of these things before and
risen to major challenges at MIT when
society calls for an action plan whether
it was in World War two as far back as
that goes or in the 1980s when the
Commission on industrial productivity
came together to think about how to
address some of our challenges our more
recently with the production and the
innovation economy and and others like
that this perhaps is more profound than
certainly the last two examples I
offered but I think that's where we are
right now
and if we can put our energies together
like only MIT can do by bringing
technologists and experts in learning
that we're going to hear from sanjay and
research that we're going to hear from
liz that go out and to figure out how to
work with our industry partners and and
to think then about the role of
government policy altogether there's no
place like this Institute that can do
that better and so that's what you're
going to hear from our colleagues here
we're gonna hear about educational needs
and using our online tools we're going
to hear about work to go out into
industry and how we can understand how
they are addressing these issues or
maybe how they might address them more
effectively and then we're also going to
hear about the power of the technologies
themselves and how we can better join
work and technology as we move forward
so let me just turn to our colleagues in
and go from here thank you Tom and
thanks for that framing I want to I want
to take it now to daniela and you've
obviously been at the center of this for
a very long time and csail is at the
heart so talk to us about action and
what you've already been doing and what
more you think we can do so a Seafarer
and of course MIT and the work of many
of the speakers who have been here
provided us with such an interesting
blending of perspectives which is really
important as we think about artificial
intelligence and people and work so I
would like to observe that I don't
believe we can stop technology from
advancing and changing the world but
yeah but what we can do is we can be
leaders and we can we can be right there
at the forefront of technology inventing
the future and inventing ways of making
the world better with with the new ideas
and the new results however it's very
important to pause and think about
consequences and that we get to do so we
get to decide how to how that how
technology is used
and what we can do about consequences we
observe of course this requires a number
of factors it requires contributions
from policy requires conversations
between technologists and economists and
policy makers so research in in this
field is extraordinarily powerful and
advancing AI and the vamping robotics
today is is amazing we we can begin to
imagine a world where routine tasks will
be taken off our plates where we have
intelligent assistants supporting us
with what we do so that's on the
technology side the other thing I would
like to observe is that we also have to
reconsider how we educate and train our
students both at the University and
beyond both within the field of in my
case computer science and beyond and I
would like to observe that up until now
education has been kind of a serial
process we study and study and study for
as long as we want some people to high
school some people with a bachelor's
some people all the way to PhD and then
we quit studying and then we go and work
and work and work and but as things are
changing this model will not work so
well so we have to start thinking about
models of Education that include some
some form of parallelism where through
experiential learning in other words
through working we can we can learn and
as as we work as we as we develop as
part of the workforce we continue to
train and retrain so I I think it's it's
important to consider how do we go from
the serial approach to education to the
parallel approach to education and most
importantly technology will not have
direct consequences without the support
of policymakers
who will ensure that the technology gets
used and how the technology gets used so
so including policy in our discussions
and in our development of technology is
very important
daniela thank you and you opened the
door to where i want to go next with
eric and talking about policy sure well
i think we have to realize that
technology has always been destroying
jobs it's always been creating jobs it
transforms many more and one of the
things we can do as policymakers is not
try to hang on and preserve the old jobs
but rather embrace what joseph
schumpeter call creative destruction and
how can we create a policy going forward
that makes the new jobs better and more
fulfilling than the old ones and more
plentiful and good people worth a can do
and I think so I wrote a lullaby that I
think mothers and fathers could could
sing to their kids to help remember what
the policy should be I don't know how
good it is but kind of goes like this
there was a neural net saw cat AI e i o
catch e know so well that I use that to
remind myself what the what the policy
implications could be and I hope you all
sing it to your children
so e stands for education and Daniela
and we've talked about that a lot today
it should be at the top of the list and
it's not just investing more in
education it's reinventing education
along the lines we talked about to
embrace the kinds of things that
machine's don't do well in creativity
interpersonal connections teamwork we
don't do that well in education in fact
in many ways it seems like education is
almost designed in the 20th century to
stamp out education get people to sit in
rows of desks and stop being creative
just listen and that's of course exactly
what we don't need in the second Machine
Age going forward the second letter i'
is for immigration and i think that one
of the big mistakes were making in our
society today is not embracing all the
smart people from around the world that
wants to come here that we educate and
then we force them to go back i think
whenever someone gets a degree from MIT
or any school
there that should be stamped with a
green card to say please please stay
here and that would be a policy that
would I think be very helpful to the
dynamism of the country the next e e IE
is for entrepreneurship and as I
suggested we shouldn't be trying to
protect the the past from the future
freeze in the old jobs and in Boston
there's a policy to to take money from
lyft and uber and the new ride-sharing
services and give it to the taxi
companies and trying to get them to to
hang on a little bit longer or some some
cities just ban these new services
altogether and over and over
entrepreneurs who have new ideas face
barriers from the entrenched incumbents
but the the job creators the people who
invent new Goods and new services
they're entrepreneurs and we should make
it easier for them to invent new things
for people to do new ways of combining
technology and capital and labor to
create value that take advantage of
these new systems and allow us to do
things that we couldn't have done before
ee i ee i the next i is four incomes and
we need to do a better job of supporting
incomes and so the Earned Income Tax
Credit is my own personal favorite these
are this is a way of subsidizing and
supporting wages it's like in a way a
little bit like the the minimum wage but
the difference is the minimum wage is
paid entirely by the employer in a way
is a tax on people who come up with new
jobs and say you guys great job coming
up with these these new jobs for people
but we want a special tax for you to
help pay them more and I think we should
responsibly from everybody in society to
help lift those up and the Earned Income
Tax Credit actually encourages
businesses to come up with new jobs and
audre brains to come up with new job and
then the people who are engaged in the
workforce they get more income and I
think they don't just get income I've
learned from my sociologist friends like
Bob Putnam they get a meaning and a way
of contributing to life and that's very
important to them uh-huh but to all of
us and last but not least is over
original research and I for that I want
to stress the importance of
understanding this better I'm at MIT so
maybe I'm a little
biased I'm a researcher but I think that
there's a lot of evidence in economics
that this is what drives economic growth
is drives higher living standards is
coming up with original research not
just the applied work that the companies
new entrepreneurs are doing but the more
fundamental research on the technologies
but I think especially we have a
bottleneck now in understanding how the
economics and political and social
systems need to also be reinvented so if
we do those five things I think and
those are all roles for government we
could go a long way to making this
transition much better and and have
these technologies be what they are
meant to be some of the best things that
ever happen to humanity all right so
that's the policy foundation thank you
Eric very much and I will now always
remember that lullaby love it sing it to
your children your nieces or your
grandchildren I think it's it's gonna
catch on it's going to be big so I want
to take it now to Liz and I think you
opened the door there with talking about
one thing I might ease also very good at
is doing research with industry and
really when we're talking about work
that's talking about companies so how do
we help companies think about how they
need to reinvent work well I don't have
a lullaby to sing but I'll start with
some thoughts I just want to reflect a
little bit on takeaways I had from the
extraordinary two days here and
particularly from the social science
perspective that there were I would say
three things that I I took away that I
think inform our direction at MIT going
forward the first was uncertainty I
think there was actually a fair amount
of humility about knowing what the
future holds we don't know what that
path is and there's no one you know
we're not looking to a crystal ball to
try and predict and I I appreciated that
the second piece was for all the
boundless opportunity people talked
about limitations they talked about
limitations in the technology and they
talked about the friction of adoption
and we can define friction a lot of ways
but frictions for firms and industries
for particular regions even in in
adopting new technologies and I think we
need to acknowledge that and the third
one that I was really excited about and
you know I felt was embodied MIT and the
larger community here was the principles
that need to be reflected in the use
this technology fairness in the way we
collect the data the way it's used
fairness and access and on all those
dimensions I think MIT can be a leader
and and and so first and foremost in
terms of the uncertainty I feel like we
need more knowledge about what's
happening in firms in industries and on
the ground and we we have an enormous
obviously long history at MIT of working
with firms about that but we know that
no adoption of technology is
frictionless right we know it differs
between the size of industries large
firms small and medium sized firms our
PI work showed the talents for SMEs in
terms of adopting new technologies and
how challenging that can be we know that
technological feasibility is not the
only dimension for how firms are
adopting new technologies when we talk
to firms today particularly large firms
they're looking at the cost of
deployment they're looking at existing
facilities and what the cost of this
deployment of new robotics might be
whether in customization we really need
we need do we have robotics that really
can be as flexible as we need to be and
really replace you know humans and so
there's a whole host of things that we
don't yet fully I think have a handle on
and I want us to see basically more work
more evidence that I think is going to
help us stop jumping from these two you
know utopian dystopian pictures and get
into the reality and the evidence and I
think that the regional ecosystems also
and we've heard about that today in many
different ways but they're responding
differently institutions are responding
differently we're going to learn a lot
over the next five years and that's the
that's the timeframe I feel like I'd
like us to be really focusing on we'll
come back to the five years yes so it's
very interesting to think about the new
principles that need to be embraced like
you said lease fairness privacy and to
really consider that we could have
extraordinarily creative and novel new
solutions that in some sense blend the
perspective from from the different
sides from economics and from technology
so by understanding that these are
economical issues we can invent new
algorithms
that are by construction fair they are
provably that will probably protect your
privacy so it's really interesting to
think about the role of Technology and
the role of policy in solving some of
these problems it's not either/or I
think that the solutions would
necessarily have to to blend the two
perspectives and and come together so
there is a lot of opportunity for or a
new work that's why you're sitting next
to each other but I think actually so
look I want to come back to that point
but first I want to come to Sanjay and I
want to go can we go a little more
tactical and let's really start talking
about what can we do and you've been
charged with with how do we reinvent
education ya know it's very interesting
question you know we have an education
system that's only about 200 years old
and it was born in the throes of the
Industrial Revolution and really we took
away sort of the apprenticeship system
and replaced it with a system that
creates automatons and now we're
concerned that they'll be replaced by
automatons so we need to fundamentally
rethink our education system that sort
of point number one I had the good
fortune of of taking over a project that
was created initially by then Provost
Rafael wife and Anant Agarwal which is
the concept of massive open online
courses and online education I'm the
vice president for open learning
EDX was spun out of MIT with an
investment from MIT and Harvard EDX has
itself reached with completely online
courses about 11 million people
worldwide in 195 countries and MIT
courses which are branded MITx on EDX
have reached about nearly 3 million
people unique so you know it's a big
impact but the interesting thing is that
the and by the way should I should say
that Tom and Daniella are two of our
stars and these online courses and we
hope to get the rest of our colleagues
involved as well but the interesting
thing is we will be taught the median
age of these students would be like you
know 18 or 19 or 15 trying to get into
college it is 27 and what that means is
that
The Hunger is amongst working
professionals so that's point number one
and we're in early days we have some
challenges which I'll talk about in a
minute point number two is our one and
done model of Education is sort of
awkward and artificial you study for two
years or four years finish your high
school you get your degree and you're
ready for the rest of your life
surely that cannot be the future a
future in which jobs have life
expectancies which are shorter and
shorter
you know truck driver that's a job
that's going to vanish pretty much and
so we have to really elevate ourselves
and teach meta skills and teach students
to learn new skills adapt and so on
which comes back to my automaton sort of
comment and you know maybe in some day
in the future every employee at every
company is going to spend two hours
perhaps on a Friday morning simply
upgrading their skills because let's
face it we're on a treadmill that's
going backwards slowly and if we don't
keep jogging gonna fall off the
treadmill the third point I want to make
and this is we're sort of in the early
stages of this is I think that the
separation of work and learning is
artificial and imagine you know in a
couple of years an engineer goes to
maintain a Lufthansa aircraft slanted
Logan and as she walks up to the to the
engine her you know hololens glasses
give her details on how to fix you know
that latest on his engine was lost
maintained in Singapore you know they
another ten thousand miles before the
blades get refurbished oh by the way did
you know that next year we're going to
go to a new internal alloy and you know
blink your eyes if you want a and I put
a a podcast on your way home right so
this business of learning just in time
as you work I think will become a new
reality the fact of the matter is we
have to learn all the time and we're
very excited at the office of digital
learning to take all this forward
excellent ok so before I go to Barbara
which I will in a moment I
so I'm going to open this up to the
audience we want this to be an
interactive discussion and we want to
hear from you on on ideas that you have
around what MIT can do but first I also
I'm actually just very curious how many
here in this audience have taken an MIT
X course excellent
good okay so ready for your questions in
a second but Wow while you're lining up
Barbara let's talk about how we can
bring at MIT technology experts together
and our business experts together and
actually start to do some meaningful
things I know you've been already
thinking of doing about but I'd also
like to comment particularly on the
education front which absolutely we're
at a point where it's already being
reinvented because people are accessing
means to learn online in a variety of
ways and and it's and it's happening in
all sorts of places in all sorts of ways
it has to be at least five years ago now
I went out to look at some automation of
factories in Lancaster Pennsylvania in
that region and there was a program in
place for workers to gain higher-level
skills in combination with the Community
College in work at you know in place and
on their own time and there's a write in
Fall River there's a community health
facility where Bristol Community College
and the community health facility have
collaborated so that the learning is
happening and certification is happening
in place one of the things that I I
would love to see is for the research
the original research that Eric is
talking about be in part going out and
looking at what's going on rather than
presuming right off the bat that we the
leaders will come up with the answers to
go out and and see where this transition
is already occurring we we had this
wonderful moment this morning with rusty
Justus and
let's go out to Kentucky and take a look
at that let's go out to these places and
see where this transition is happening
what are the barriers and the
opportunities for more entrepreneurial
activity in places like this what are
the real barriers is it the barrier of
imagination is it a barrier of finance
what's the ecosystem that needs to be in
place is it the fact that we need an
infrastructure policy that brings
broadband there but we don't really have
those answers yet but we have the
capability of looking at this and
bringing the perspective from many
different starting points across this
institute into the country in a way that
is a two-way street so I'd love to see a
lot more interactive learning and
original research that involves going
out and looking at the companies that
are making the transition and talking to
the workers that are making the
transition and looking at these
communities that are trying to figure
out a version of entrepreneurship that
is in Silicon Valley and is in Boston
but is something very particular to
these communities I want to do a speed
round real quick and then were going to
come to the questions but I think all of
you have already been doing that a bit
Eric I know with your inclusive
innovation competition Daniella of
course with working directly with rusty
just real quick what are your what are
your thoughts on what Barbara just said
and how can we do more no this is
absolutely critical I was just yesterday
teaching my PhD class in between some of
the sessions here and we talked about
how going and visiting companies is kind
of like a secret weapon that you kind of
learn what's really happening before you
go and do the econometrics and and for
me the inclusive Innovation Challenge
has been a great resource to hear from
hundreds of companies doing just amazing
things to use technology to create
shared prosperity inclusive not just
central and let me just give you a
couple really quick examples and we
heard yesterday I think was today about
how machines can diagnose radiological
images better as well as humans but if a
human and machine work together they can
do better than you
of them can do independently or there's
a chatbot that that sebastian thrown
help developed and he uses it to help
people up choose online courses but the
interesting thing is that they found
that just having the chat by itself
we're didn't really work very well
instead they have it work with humans
who also in the chat rooms and the chap
I kind of gives suggestions about you
know this mic might consider this course
or this price point or even this
phrasing of a response and he had about
a 50% improvement in throughput on that
but there are lots and lots of examples
of how AI and humans can work together
and I think that's something you don't
hear about quite as much in the research
as you see when they're actually rolled
out in the practical implications almost
inevitably you end up having some kind
of a hybrid system where people do parts
of the job and humans to other parts I
mean and machines do other parts and the
net effect is is a better product for
the customers lower costs and a better
work environment for the employees the
hybrid system that's interesting daniela
real quick say well i I agree with Eric
and I will give you one example and we
are working with physical therapists to
bring autonomous wheelchairs in
hospitals and this is an example of how
technology plus people could do better
because technology could take the boring
part of the job leaving people with the
time to apply expertise so right now in
in hospitals physical therapists have to
travel to the hospital room to pick up
the patient push the patient to the gym
they have their session and then the
physical therapist takes the patient
back so a significant amount of time of
the the physical therapists time is
actually spent doing they're just
pushing the wheelchair so if you
introduce technology if you introduce
autonomous switchers which are ready to
go we can we can have them then we will
increase the amount of time the
therapist spends with the patient and
that's good for the physical therapist
that's good for the patient in addition
to that back to a question about working
together with
industry I would like to say that Cecil
actually has a program that is centered
on industrial connections and this
program has been creating a suite of
training courses online courses in fact
Laurie Glover heads this program is a
director of this problem program and we
have had tremendous success we have
worked in collaboration with other
departments at MIT our Big Data course
touched over 10,000 professional
professionals which is really
significant and so we're really very
excited about doing more of this through
our program we also find that when we do
research with companies it really helps
to have people exchanges so it really
helps to have engineers from companies
come to spend some time with the
researchers at MIT because this way we
learn from companies what is actually
important what are the assumptions that
really matter to them and they come to
us they retain and they get a longer
time horizon about what is coming
awesome Liz quick yeah pack where she's
only be attacking people well just to
say so a few years ago as part of this
production of the innovation economy
work our team was out in the field
interviewing small and medium-sized
companies about their adoption of
technology and what we found was this
real barrier to access and we'll be
going back out and seeing those same
firms in 2018 and at the same time
working with some of these robotics
companies who are trying to penetrate
this market have a lot to offer at a
reasonable cost that is really you know
increasing productivity and capabilities
but there's a real barrier for getting
into those companies we have the the
large companies aren't really focused on
the supply chain just yet and we have to
find ways to help those companies don't
real quick
we do a lot of work with companies and
their workforce sometimes companies and
unions we've done that over the years
bring
them to campus doing studies with them
and then working cooperatively to
implement these ideas most recently with
Kaiser Permanente on a lot of these work
and technology issues but let me just
mention one different kind of study that
we have underway right now and that is
to go to the workforce itself we just
completed a national survey of what
workers what kind of voice do workers
want on these kinds of issues and we've
got three of our really crackerjack MBAs
out there working with some of the newly
emerging worker organizations to find
out how they're using technology and
social media and other things to try to
improve the world of work so we can
bring that perspective into this process
as well it's there's a lot going on up
there and the workforce is very eager to
engage these issues all right and then
Sanjay and then we're gonna go to the
questions Sanjay you've hired bill Bonn
billion to do examine what what's going
on out there whatever you have any
initial findings from so it's very
interesting I think it's not it's great
question and when the rubber meets the
road you know all sorts of truths emerge
that first few courses are very high
tech that made a lot of sense for
example Daniella's been involved in a
bunch of these courses on big data etc
but when you get down to things like
manufacturing you really need to
understand where people are what skills
that don't have finding the gaps and
bridging them to a point where our
courses are useful to them so for
example we did a course with Boeing it
was Boeing was deeply involved in in the
needs we developed the content it's won
several awards what Bill is doing for us
is really mapping out billabong billion
is mapping out working with Liz and
others the landscape there of all the
activities and all the gaps so we can
try and fill the gaps as opposed to do
something that from here sitting in
Boston seems to make sense fantastic
all right question here say who you are
and please try to keep your question
brief and say who you would like to
direct it to absolutely well this is
question is actually directed to
everyone my name is Laura Taylor kalle
I'm at the Council on Foreign Relations
and I'm a recovering policymaker as now
to research of her various reasons but
at the council where also we've launched
a task force in the future of the US
workforce and really looking at these
issues from a global competitive sustain
point to the main things I appreciate a
lot of the comments you all made two of
the main issues that we deal with as
policymakers are one who is the most
appropriate actor for a lot of the
policy recommendations that you all have
suggested and and the other piece of it
is how do you scale so how do you get
the information on what's being done at
all these various sort of local local
levels and then how do you take the
information that you get from them that
particularly you all at MIT get on all
these various randomized control trials
or various pieces of research and then
use that to scale it in order to
actually make policies that you can
implement at the federal state and local
levels so one of the things I would say
I would implore you all to do is to
figure out a way of making the the
research and the data that you do have
much more widely available and
collaboratively done with the government
as well as with industry in order for us
to be able to make make policies that we
can scale and bring forth for everyone
thank you thank you Bob let's start yeah
that's a great question and I guess one
of the opportunities is that there are a
number of what I would call intermediary
organizations that have credibility and
our convening powers with policy makers
so at the state and local level in
particular there's the National
Governors Association the National
Conference of State Legislators there's
a conference of mayors there all of
these organizations and the potential
for making these ideas and policy
recommendations accessible through those
organizations because they're always
looking to for good ideas and
particularly good ideas that have
grounding in practice that they can
recognize and they can see they can do
so that's that's one thing one way to to
move this along and similarly in
business organizations through
you know organizations like the
precision metal forming Association the
National Association of Manufacturers in
manufacturing their health care
associations and so forth so it's the
potential for spread is a greater if the
ideas are accessible and if
organizations that are credible to those
players and where they gather and where
they have their conversations if those
ideas are well we've also talked about
that those institutions are breaking
down though and so what is the rise of
the new but Eric you want to or time you
want to pick up on that well I think
there's a variety of emerging
organizations in addition to what
Barbara mentioned those are our viable
but I think what we have to do as a
community as we move forward you know
we're used to doing our careful research
and then publishing in the Journal of
irrelevant facts and statistics that
nobody reads I will continue to do that
because that's very important and and
that's not going to go away but we've
got to communicate in new ways we've got
to make sure we get our research out at
a much faster pace to the people who can
use it in ways using all of the tools of
social media and a lot of interaction
and our best impacts have come when
we've involved those groups in the
research so not in doing it but in
helping to think about the problem and
helping to disseminate the work so I
think if we build those partnerships and
we use the modern tools of communication
we can have a bigger impact with our
work as we go forward in the next five
years than in the past that's really
interesting danielle and then eric so i
think we have to create opportunities
for people to have sustained to spend
the same time working together on these
issues and this requires resources
because that's the only way you you get
people to work together on a problem
that it's it's really the best way to
bring people together is to have them
solve a problem so I'll give you an
example at csail we have a Center on
privacy policy and so the center has
theoretical computer scientists has
systems researchers
AI researchers and and researchers in
policy and economics actually the cross
Institute activity and this is
extraordinarily exciting because through
this through the work of of this blended
perspective you could really see what
technology can do and then the
policymakers can really understand the
scope of technology and figure out what
needs to be put in place in order to
ensure that technology is maximized and
used for the greater good there so let
me build on you asked who is there who
is a key actor and I've had the
privilege and the opportunity to talk to
a bunch of people at you know up to the
most senior levels of government state
and local and national and after talking
to them I've come away quite convinced
that that the key actor that needs to be
influenced is the citizen it's you guys
they often I talk to these people
they're like you know what Eric I get it
what you said make a lot of sense I read
your book or whatever but unless the
voters are behind me I can't do this I
can't people want something else they
think that the problem is with
immigrants or with something else so
until we change the conversation until
we get people understanding what are the
things that need to be done or that can
be done and that we're not going to be
able to change the policymakers for
better or worse we live in more or less
a democracy and a lot of the other
countries are like that too and those
policy makers really do respond directly
or indirectly to voters they care about
that and I'm so glad we're having this
conference here because I think we're
doing a really important public service
is getting all of you engaged hopefully
you'll get more of your friends and
colleagues and fellow citizens and
voters engage because unless you guys
are part of the conversation I don't
think those policymakers are going to
listen to Daniella or me or Tom or any
of us they may understand it
intellectually but they are also
ultimately going to act in their
political self-interest
I would just like to add that this it's
kind of on us to really explain to the
public at large how what we do
can make it can make their lives better
in new ways companies yeah you really
have to step up right great
okay next question sure my name's Peter
always normally when there's a call to
arms which is this is what it sounds
like you need some sort of adversary to
really raise the level of urgency and
define you know that in five years we
have to get this point for this to
really be successful so who would you
consider your adversary would you say
it's Silicon Valley is it China is it
the government it's a person I don't
think it's an organization I think it's
the state of the world we find today
that was emphasized for two days about
wages and economic conditions being
stagnant and the anger and the divisions
that that has caused in our society
that's what we're fighting against and
if we fight against those conditions
then I think we will galvanize our
energies in the right way but I don't I
don't see a an enemy out there I mean we
could we could conjure one up but I
think it's the situation that we're in
and if that continues to get worse then
we are as a society in a very very deep
crisis all right I'm just gonna say that
I think populism is a very dangerous
outcome of what's going on today in this
country and abroad particularly we see
in Europe and so you know we may not
want to point our finger at that but
that is the dark side of all of what tom
has just said and it is really important
for us to challenge it and try and do
something about it
all right next question hi my name's
Alan Davidson I'm a fellow at new
America in Washington DC and also a
fellow at IDE and a fallen engineer from
MIT I and most recently a refugee for
the Obama administration I left
government in January then at the
Department of Commerce and my question
is really about how do we build more
capacity particularly in this technology
policy business conversation and that
you've touched on because there is I
will say from the front lines that there
is a desperate need for more leadership
in this space and more people coming
into this field
who
have the ability to understand the this
very complex system that we as a society
need to manage and I will say that in
government I benefited a huge amount
from talking to some of you and we
benefited as an administration but it's
small pockets and it's you know some
somehow still a little bit a few and far
between
I mean MIT does not have a law school it
does not have a public policy school
there aren't a lot of places that offer
even the leadership that MIT does how do
we get more and how do we train and
inspire more young people and how do we
get more research in this space what can
we as a community do to get more of this
I think Daniela and Sanjay I really want
to jump in this how do we how do we
train more people I am so excited about
the idea that in the first twenty first
century we should have digital literacy
everyone should know how to use
computers and solve problems with
computers and and so we should start
from kindergarten and if we start from
kindergarten by the time you get to
graduate high school you will have the
skills required to do to enter the IT
economy and so this actually requires
serious rethinking of our schooling
system of what we teach in schools what
we teach as part of the undergraduate
education and as part of the
professional education and also what we
teach online yeah I couldn't have said
it better I think and by the way I also
think that if you look at your because
we do a lot of work in k-12 if you look
at citizens under the age of 15 kids
actually changes already happening in
some ways I think we are the problem a
lot of the mother YouTube generation
they learn on Khan Academy and in fact I
think that tsunami is gonna hit
universities and they're gonna ask us
what the hell we're doing here you know
when a kid has grown up you know as a
maker is asked to sit in a classroom and
listen to the professor talk right I
think to Daniela's point digital
literacy meta skills cognitive skills
creativity these are things this is a
revolution we have to create now so
our graduates are more elastic real real
quick we have some experience in doing
this and Barbara and I have talked about
bringing young researchers other PhD
students young faculty members from
around the country to engage with us and
to support them to get on with doing the
kind of research in the kind of
translation that policymakers need we
did this a number of years ago when the
sloan Foundation funded a whole bunch of
industry studies and we built a network
of those young researchers there are now
the leaders because that's 10 and 15
years ago and they're now the leaders in
our academic fields they've built a
whole association called industry
studies association to do that we can we
can be a hub for engaging others and if
we use the reframing of the debates that
we're talking about here today we will
get lots of young people to be inspired
to do the kind of research and translate
it then for policy makers I was so
excited to hear from bitsource
this morning to hear rusty anybody can
learn to code the coal miners can learn
to code you can learn to call anybody
can learn to code and in fact the idea
of taking some of the undergraduate
curriculum and pushing it down to
schools is totally doable in fact MIT is
already doing that through a course
organized by Lincoln labs called a
beaver works Summer Institute where
where kids get to write get to build the
same robots and write the same kind of
programs that our entry course and entry
undergraduate courses in robotics to
accomplish so I like to tell young
people that if they know how to make
stuff and they know how to program it
then they have superpowers because they
can imagine anything they can make it
and then they can breathe life into it
through programming people and machines
superpowers and in fact we heard
yesterday about Tom Malone's new book
coming out called super Minds the power
of people and machines and so I think
it's we've got a really exciting
opportunity and
of us and MIT is poised to lead and I
wonder I see that we've got Marty
Schmidt sitting in the front row if
you'd be open to commenting on the
action that we talked about here and
what what you think about what we should
do and what we're what we're doing is if
you want to add on anything about people
and machines and how we engage better
and communicate in new ways and reinvent
education thanks Liz you know you were
going to call me
I thought you did I thought you were
making notes for us
well I took notes no I think this has
been a great discussion and obviously a
great two days and I think my takeaway
is we've got a lot of great ideas and
and the question is how do we synthesize
those into actions and particularly I
think understanding there was a comment
made that I think is really spot-on
which is how does this scale how do we
get to a scale where we really have
impact at the level we need to and so I
think that's to me the most important
question that's in front of us is which
of these ideas can we really bring to
scale and have impact that's a good
challenge I think for all of us to take
away Thank You Marty and I'm sorry that
I took you by surprise there but you
thought on your feet like a good MIT
Provost Thank You Barbara the challenge
I think particularly after these two
days is not which of the ideas but how
do all of these ideas come together and
what's the vision that's gonna drive us
I mean from from what I've heard in the
last couple of days and the way I see it
is if we're looking some number of years
out yeah we'll have among individuals
this sense of confidence that they can
navigate in this environment and that AI
is actually an assist to them in moving
through a life that is continuous
learning and continuous churning in a
sense but there'll be this level of
confidence and a sense of stability and
that somehow we have to figure out how
to get there
at a community level all of this is an
assist to address some of the really
challenging issues that are facing
communities around transportation around
community health around education as
well and somehow and building ecosystems
for economic activity when we look at
places like Kentucky it's not a function
of let's just move away from here but
this is where we want to stay and we can
make this so at a community level we
figured it we figured out as a society
how to make this all work and at the
national level that it helps us to get
get back to the notion of making good
policy choices that are informed by good
information and that we have real-time
much better information I mean a lot of
the information that we rely on in
policy should we choose to use
information is old so how do we bring
all of this together and what is mi
t--'s special contribution to that
future and I think there's an enormous
contribution at MIT and I think we're
gonna continue this conversation so
Barbara thank you for that those last
words and I look forward to that
conversation as I'm sure all of you do
and thank you so much for all of your
contribute contributions today
thanks everybody we move</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
