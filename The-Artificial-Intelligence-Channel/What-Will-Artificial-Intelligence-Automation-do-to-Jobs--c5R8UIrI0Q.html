Institute's annual Aspen forum on
whether artificial intelligence and
automation are destroying or creating
jobs this is about an hour okay
intelligence so not a day goes by that
we don't see another story in the media
about how artificial intelligence and
automation either one are absolutely
coming for our jobs and you can see it
already just take a look at the
relatively low labor low and declining
labor force participation rate and also
to that it'll allow for the creation of
completely new jobs and industries just
as in previous revolutions and there so
there's nothing to worry about and in
any event occupational churn is at an
all-time low so clearly there's nothing
to worry about and so probably the truth
is somewhere between those inclusive may
be and so that's what this panel is
going to talk about our automation and
AI just boil it down a substitute or a
complement to human labor and we've had
a great panel to discuss this today I'll
just introduce them very quickly in
alphabetical order their full BIOS are
in the in the program we first have
Diane Bailey is an associate professor
in the School of Information at UT
Austin where she studies technology and
work her current research interests
include engineering product design
remote occupational specialization big
data and healthcare and ICT for economic
development and she conducts large-scale
empirical studies often involving
multiple occupations countries and
researchers Joe Besson is executive
director of the Technology Policy
Research initiative at the Boston
University School of Law despite being
at a law school he's an economist and
has done research on whether patents
promote innovation why innovators share
new knowledge how technology affects job
skills and wages his latest book is
learning by doing the real connection
between innovation wages and wealth Ajay
Kumar is a researcher at the adaptive
systems at interaction group at
Microsoft Research she works on several
subfields of AI including planning
machine learning multi-agent systems and
human computer networks human-computer
team work sorry she particularly focuses
on real-world applications that can
benefit from the complimentary abilities
of humans and machines
Hal Varian is chief economist at Google
he's been involved in many aspects of
the company including auction design a
kind of metric analysis finance
corporate strategy and public policy
also an emeritus professor at the
university at UC Berkeley in three
departments Business Economics and
information management okay so a good
place to start off this panel is to talk
about what we actually mean by
artificial intelligence and and a in
sort of at the bid brief preliminary
discussions about panel AJ brought this
up as I sort this should be the great
place to start so I'll ask you to lead
off and tell us sir where we are today
with AI and what we mean when we're
talking about it thank you Scott
first of all thanks for inviting me to
this panel as a person who's studying AI
and doesn't really involved in these
policy discussions that much it's a
pleasure to be here and hear the
discussion so AI artificial intelligence
is a field that is around 17 years old I
started with Alan Turing when he wrote
his paper on computing machines and then
around 1950s the the fathers of AI came
together and wrote a paper that said
this is what AI is I think we are going
to be able to solve this AI problem in
three months if you work hard enough and
they had a meeting where they discussed
all of these different applications of
AI that we think about today so many of
those applications were discussed back
then too the problem ended up being a
bit more difficult than they thought
it's going to be some things turned out
to be easier some things turned out to
be harder and that's why we've been you
know as a field going through these ups
and downs and winters and summers where
we kind of realize okay I think you are
getting getting better at this oh no I
think this is still pretty hard and kind
of do this back and forth so what is AI
from there are multiple definitions of
AI wonderful nation that I like very
much talks about it's the activity of
making machines intelligent and what we
mean by intelligence is for whatever
domain you are designed for we expect a
machine to act
spirit leave it in its environment by
sensing its the environment by acting on
it that's what we mean by intelligent
machine
however intelligence is a term that we
think of humans for like we think humans
are intelligent other animals are not
and a lot of the abilities that humans
have we expect an AI system to have so
another definition that's more human
focused is having these abilities that
are special to humans so what is going
on right now why we think AI is so much
in the press when I was a graduate
student like 10 years ago the advice
that was given to me was like if you're
in the job market don't say that you're
doing AI because AI was a term that was
so kind of poisonous and people thought
nothing ever comes out of AI however
that was the time that Google was
booming and Google is an AI company from
the birth so what is really going on is
that there are three factors in the last
five to ten years that came together to
make some of the algorithms we already
had in the field very very successful
for some tasks that humans are really
good at like perception what are these
factors these are we have a lot of data
now coming from sensors coming from
crowdsourcing coming from human
activities and the World Wide Web we
have more competition than ever before
and that's going to increase as well and
these two factors made some well-known
algorithms like deep neural networks
very very successful now we know how to
train these existing algorithms and
through this now we are seeing great
advances in perception tasks like speech
recognition image recognition and well
defined tasks like for example go the
success that deep mind had so when we
see these tasks that are very be
associated with humans like perceiving
the world world understanding what the
objects are we are saying I guess
machines are really getting intelligent
this time um just before we go into the
labor aspects of it AI discussion has
been around for people working out for
70 years it comes and goes the
popularity you
the case that it went the last time it
was popular someone might have had a
panel like this where people were
sitting up there saying this is the time
it's gonna work or is there really
something different this time so I think
that's the question that we are here for
to discuss nobody knows the answer of
that however when you look around it one
before just a new wave there were there
are already a lot of applications of AI
that people use every day like search
engines like all of the optimization
algorithms that run in supply change
management systems so it's not like AI
wasn't there
I think it AI was good for some tasks
that humans weren't good at like
understanding probabilities making
planning decisions making optimization
decisions now with these new techniques
AI is entering into tasks that AI wasn't
good at but humans were really good at
and that is creating first of all the
discussion around what other tasks
machines will be able to do now that we
have these techniques and second what
does this mean for the human jobs and
that that is something we need to see
however there is another discussion
which is does this mean that we are
getting too general artificial
intelligence which means I'm gonna have
one AI technique that's gonna become so
good that without much customization I'm
gonna be able to solve all a AI tasks I
don't think we are getting there and
that's my personal opinion
okay so let's jam you've been writing
about labor and AI so tell us your view
are we going to be jobless and is that
good or bad
yeah my not in the next 10 or 20 year so
we've actually had AI in the workplace
and in the marketplace since set in 1987
where AI systems were used to do fraud
detection and credit card systems but
we've had computer automation some of
which isn't so different from my a AI
since the 1950s what's interesting is
that we're seeing an acceleration both
in the
the scope of things that AI can can
handle and and maybe in the pace of
group at which its addressing them so
it's about automation and and what's the
impact of automation and we parentally
have I think a basic minima Sun many
people basically misunderstand what
automation means for jobs it's it's
commonly assumed if a job is some tasks
in a job or automated that jobs are lost
in that occupation and that's simply not
true we can look at manufacturing and
yes we're very well aware lots of
manufacturing jobs have been lost to
automation in the 1940s there were
nearly half a million textile workers
cotton textile workers in the US and now
there are only 16,000 and most of that
difference is from automation there's
some from global trade but that's
clearly had a dramatic effect on many
communities and many workers and their
families but the thing to remember is
automation can also increase jobs and in
fact we only got to have half a million
textile workers because for the previous
hundred years before 1940 automation was
accompanied by job growth well this
seems strange how can automation
sometimes create more jobs and and
sometimes eliminate jobs and what's
going on and what does that mean and and
it comes down to demand when you when
you look at something like textile
automation at the beginning of the 19th
century the average person had one set
of clothing automation meant that the
price of cloth went down which men
people could afford more demand was very
elastic so they bought a lot more in
fact they bought so much more that even
though they needed fewer workers to do
to produce the cloth many more workers
were employed because they were buying
that much more cloth you come to the mid
twentieth century and people have
closets full of clothing you know a
further price decline is just simply not
going to produce much more demand for
cloth and so then you have automation
has a net effect of eliminating jobs you
know if you look today what's happening
with computer automation
we see lots of evidence of examples
where computer automation
just like the early textile automation
is creating jobs so one of my favorite
examples is the bank teller you know
there's a great untapped demand er there
was a great untapped demand for getting
cash at remote locations the ATM machine
came along and people assumed that's
gonna wipe out the bank teller in fact
we actually have more bank tellers since
the ATM was installed in numbers and and
the reason is it made it cheaper to
operate a bank branch banks could open
up more branches and serve more people
there was a market demand for that and
so they just built so many more branches
that even though they needed fewer
tellers per ranch they were employing
many more and that's I think the pattern
that we're going to continue to see in
many sectors of the economy not in
manufacturing over the next 10 or 20
years and that's basically what I think
the immediate response is going to be to
do AI as well so I know Diane you'll
have response time before we go to you
it's you you say that even accelerating
change in AI will generate more jobs
more quickly but that's completely you
know that's counter to what some others
say about they're also AmeriCorps in
hopes that for example who spoke here a
couple years ago says that one of the
differences is that the rate of change
isn't allowing industries to catch up
and you're I'm sorry allowing the local
market to catch up you're sort of saying
exactly the opposite right that the
faster the faster the change is the
better it'll be yeah yeah so and well
there's two things yes and no so if a
faster change will actually yeah if you
have elastic demand and you're making a
faster change you're gonna you know so
that that productivity improvements are
bringing job growth if you make faster
productivity ruins are gonna have faster
job growth at least for the period of
time while we're that's occurring it's
gonna be disruptive though in another
sense and I and so I don't mean to I
maybe was overly optimistic in the way I
described things which the key when the
question is are we going to be seeing
mass unemployment in the next 10 or
the answer's no are we going to see lots
of individual jobs destroyed yes but
we're gonna see jobs destroyed and
others created as that pace accelerates
that's disruptive you know those textile
workers in North Carolina need to find
jobs need to have skills there may be
job there are jobs opening up in the
rest of the economy and and and same
thing everywhere else we're we are
seeing and we'll continue to see jobs
eliminated so the the acceleration will
put more stress on her ability to to
transition people to retrain them to
move to relocate them dammit you know
you're much more less optimistic well I
would just push a little bit by asking
this in in 2004 guy named Gordon Lee for
a wrote a book called the job training
charade and and what he talked about was
that we were losing a lot of
manufacturing jobs in a way that we
talked about that was well these people
need to be retrained into other jobs so
for example will train men to be bakers
and then work at the supermarket in a
bakery well it turned out that there's
only so much bread and pastries that we
can eat and that there weren't enough of
these other jobs for people to take and
that the language of job retraining
started to change from teaching people
new technical skills to enter different
jobs to focusing on what they called
soft skills and people started to be
told well the reason that you have it
you don't have a job isn't because
you're lacking some technical skills
it's because your communication skills
aren't very good or this kind of thing
you don't work well on a team it started
to put the onus on workers for their
lack of soft skills rather than
recognizing that we'd had a structural
shift in the economy and what kinds of
jobs were available
I was asked about two weeks ago to sit
on a National Academies of engineering
panel to talk about engineering
workforce and how they needed to be more
adaptive to survive in this new economy
that we're going to be seeing and I work
at a large public institution the
University of Texas so getting an invite
to sit on a National Academy of
Engineering
was kind of a big deal and means I can
put it on my CV and make sure you might
get a 3% raise instead of my 2% raise
okay had some skin in the game but I
turned it down and I turned it down
because I told them I didn't believe in
the promise of their panel okay though
they thought that they were putting the
onus on engineers to become more
adaptable learn new skills be a quick
learner they're telling all of us these
things rather than saying you know what
we're gonna start seeing some really
fundamental shifts in the economy and
maybe we ought to start planning for
that as all of us not just us
individuals running around suddenly
becoming more adaptive better quick
learners moving up the scale because
there's only so much room at the top if
what we think about AIA might be true
there's only gonna be so many jobs up
there and not all of us are equipped to
go up that handle it in conceptual
ladder to take those jobs at the top so
that worries me what's gonna be left for
everyone so I think there are a lot of
problems with job training and I think
it's even more complex than that we've
got issues about Geographic relocation
because we're you you see a lot of the
jobs appearing is not where a lot of the
unemployment is you also have a great
difficulty my book is called learning by
doing and one of the themes is that a
lot of new technology related skills
have to be learned on the job and it's
oh it's not a matter of the classroom
entirely we have to come up with new
ways of getting people experience but I
think we do see plenty of sectors where
there are mid skilled jobs emerging in
numbers and maybe difference in nursing
nursing jobs that have been you know in
great demand for a long time yet it's
still often very difficult for people to
transition into those and and maybe we
don't have enough well III think we
don't understand what it what's involved
and in making all these transitions to
say something specific but also you're
gonna bring in the longer term but
demócrata demography so sighs I want to
say a word about this job training issue
which i think is very interesting if the
demand for the jobs here and the skills
are here there are two ways to solve
that problem you can bring the skills up
to the demands or you can bring the job
down and in fact there's a lot of that
that's going on through technology
because it used to be to be a cashier
you had to know how to make change well
used to be a to be a taxi driver you and
I had to know how to navigate around
town not necessary anymore used to be to
be a veterinarian had to be able to
identify a hundred and fifty breeds of
dogs not necessary anymore we can do
that with with AI or with your phone for
that matter so this cognitive assist is
really a big deal because it allows for
the kind of on-the-job training you're
talking about you drive around town you
kind of learn your way you learn how to
make change because that's what the
Machine tells you you learn the breeds
of dogs on the job and there's a lot of
delivery mechanisms now which are
extremely efficient in the on the job
delivery of education so look at YouTube
there are 500 million video views per
day of how-to videos on YouTube and I'll
bet you almost everyone in this audience
has fixed something in their house by
going and looking at YouTube video so
these aren't just high-level cognitive
skills like solving quadratic equations
or areas they're actually important
manual labor skills that people can
learn how to weld how to replace the
screen door how to hang a window I mean
all sorts of different things but if I
were gonna play devil's advocate here
that's a lot of repair people who didn't
get called in to do some work say it
again if I were gonna play devil's
advocate I might point out that those
are a lot of repair people who didn't
get called in to do work yeah that's
right but the point is when you look at
the my next part of my talk will say
about it what happens to them all right
so I want to I want to talk about the
theme that relates to this discussion we
talked about the demand for labor and
the theory is or some people suggest a
wreath at AI and automation reduced a
demand for labor on the other hand if we
look at the supply of Labor we get quite
a different story because there's only
one social science that can predict ten
years ahead
and that's demography right everything
kind of pales besides that so let's look
at demography 1946 that's when the baby
boom started basically 1946 to 1964 and
after the baby boom that was the baby
bust and after the baby bust there's the
echo and the baby boom and you can look
through this whole whole series of
population changes and basically add 65
years to it and we see what's happening
now namely all those baby boomers are
retiring and that's followed by the baby
bust what does that mean right now the
labor force is growing at half the rate
of the population in the decade of the
20s you're going to see the lowest
growth in the labor force ever since
they started measuring in around World
War two if you look at the labor force
if you restrict immigration the labor
force is actually going to decline now
all those baby boomers are retiring they
expect to continue consuming right but
you need some workers somewhere to be
producing the stuff that they need to
consume and so you've got this race
going on between automation which is
increasing productivity and you've got
the supply of labor which is really very
very low to declining and we've got a
good in the u.s. go look at China Japan
Korea Germany Italy they're seeing
outright declines in the labor force and
it's very very worrisome from the point
of view of the future of their economies
now look at robots so what countries
have the most investment in robots
guess what China Japan Korea Germany
Italy they have to have those robots
they have to have some improved
efficiency some improved productivity in
order to produce the stuff that their
population is going to be demanding so
that's true it's a worldwide phenomenon
and by all accounts unless there are
some really big surprises on the
automation side theory to see a tight
labor market in developed countries for
the next 25 to 30 years and that's just
reading it right off of the demographics
how far down the line do you see that
the labor force becoming more yeah
what's it
when you look at the figures around 2060
you start seeing the labor force growing
at the same rate as the population and
it's interesting you think this is all
because of this huge shock of World War
two that's created at this gigantic
demographic event which doesn't really
work itself out for a hundred years so
it's the baby boomers fault yeah of
course so it seems like so so far I
think there are four separate four
issues one is sort of sort of the
general short-term versus the long-term
and the second is I is there anything
you could do for people who might be who
might rush over the right word is
displaced in the short run and does job
training play a role given what we've
learned about the effectiveness of that
then the distributional effects which
could be both short and long-term and
then over time the demographics and the
demand for labor which will swamp
everything so Diane what in the short oh
sorry end of the inequality issue
whether it's just whether the benefits
just accrue to a small group so dang you
turned down this position at the
academies but what do you think then
what what should their project have
focused on to address your concerns I
think that what we ought to be paying
attention to is power dynamics so you
know you hear a lot if you read about
books on AI and predictions about the
jobs that folks will do things like look
at Bureau of Labor Statistics data that
described jobs and describe the tasks in
jobs and they'll say well based on that
description of tasks will tell you that
some percentage of jobs are going to be
automated or replaced by AI within some
period of time right and so they're
doing that simply based on the
description of what people do no job is
just what you do every job takes place
in an environment that's surrounded by
for example all kinds of occupational
norms and perhaps regulations so I spent
a decade studying how and
years are using new computational
techniques and software things like
finite element analysis because I wanted
to understand how it was changing design
and analysis in that field and what it
was doing to the workforce I'll just
give you two quick examples that kind of
point out issues of power and when
workers have power and how they can
control technology choices that are made
for them and when they aren't in power
so the example that shows some power
actually is power that's held by the the
government somewhat if you look at civil
engineers who design building structures
like the one that we're in their
solutions are governed by strict laws
and regulations that involve things like
peer review and county review of plans
for buildings because if this building
were to fall down those of us who
survived would sue okay so the person
who's responsible is the senior engineer
who put his professional stamp on the
drawings for this building and because
that person faces professional liability
they're very careful about using
automation in their work because they
know that computer software programs can
yield unrealistic solutions based on
infeasible in some shion's in the first
place and for civil engineers everything
is about those assumptions of how load
travels through buildings for example
that guide designs and so they've
rejected a lot of automation it's not
that they don't use techniques like FAA
they do but they don't use any
automation between the steps of
engineering design and analysis that we
see in other fields now I'll go to
automotive engineers I didn't rip it
then are you are you portraying that as
a positive thing about engineering
because we don't I mean does that
necessarily make us safer or less safe
but they're rejecting it I think it
makes us much safer and I would be I
would hesitate to ride in an elevator in
a building that I thought that a
computer had designed and all of the
civil engineers that I watched would
tell you the same thing okay and it's
because you have to watch and make sure
I could go and countless examples I
don't study things at the macro level I
study things as a micro level I spend
hours sitting at the elbow of engineers
while they're designing and while
they're designing I talk to them the
computer crashes we have time for a
short interview I ask them why did they
choose that interview why did they do
this thing why did they at the
automotive firm I was in they had a
secret laptop with secret software one
that they weren't supposed to use
anymore that they had locked in a desk
that was empty and the boss didn't know
about it because there were only suppose
they were restricted in software
programs they were supposed to use these
are the kinds of things I asked them why
do you pick these technologies why do
you use these technologies so the so I
think it's a good thing that the
legislation was there any civil
engineers took safety they didn't take
it as a harness and something they
wanted to shake they took it as an
ethical obligation and something that
they were proud of something made them
different okay Automotive Engineers
automotive engineers do not have the
same kinds of things
guiding their work yes they have the
National Transportation Safety Board
that
tests vehicles but there's no stamp that
has to be put on them the vehicles just
have to pass these government tests
their work has been rationalized their
work has been digitized their work has
been computerized
in ways that is changing what's
happening with that workforce so very
quickly I'll just say that the engineers
that I studied in their firm since about
2004 have a hiring freeze on analysis
engineers in the US they only hire
analysis engineers simulation engineers
in India because they built a big center
there and my team spent months at that
Center and we spent months in Michigan
and what they do in that Center is they
have offshored
the work of building the FE a models and
the reason they were able to offshore
that work was because we've digitized
the models we've digitized and we've
mathematize and that means you can
travel they can travel on computer and
lines and so people in India are able to
do that work for a fraction of the cost
of what a u.s. engineer once so this was
my point about adopting how could the US
engineers that wanted to do that work be
adaptive in the u.s. think they'd have
to move to India you couldn't do that
job anymore in the US so that was a
change it came about because those
engineers didn't have the same kind of
power to control what they do and I'll
conclude with just a group that does
have power radiologists guess what all
of your medical scans can also be sent
abroad for reading and they are they're
often sent at night when your radio just
doesn't want to be woken up so they send
it to India and in India a radiologist
will examine it and it comes back to the
US why do we still have radiologists
employed in the US because the ära
their professional association lobbied
for legislation that says that those
scans have to be signed off in the
morning by a board-certified u.s.
trained radiologist somehow responds to
to that oh wow i think i think that's
absolutely right that the radiology not
only can be done in india but now can be
done automatically and that's been
actually true not just recently but
that's been true for a decade or two
because in a lot of cases recognizing
the malignant cell or something like
that is is really pretty straightforward
it can be done by even relatively on
trade labor now there are border cases
and lots of things where you might want
to have some adult supervision of the
sort you were describing but then adult
supervision can also be turned into
basically exercising exclusionary power
to keep a privileged position so yeah I
think that's true I've often said would
have driverless vehicles would have
autonomous vehicles on the road now if
it weren't for those darn human drivers
not to mention the pedestrians which are
even worse
if you have a controlled environment
then you can like a freeway like an
expressway a controlled environment it's
really possible to have autonomous
vehicles right now and it was possible
to have autonomous vehicles at least a
decade ago and in that context it's
dealing with all the exception handling
this is a problem in many of these cases
so when we hear discussions about AI
there is a lot of discussions about like
super intelligence or like taking old
jobs away but I worry about something
more short-term than that which is as AI
applications enter the society these
applications AI algorithms have their
problems too and how are we going to be
handling these shortcomings of AI
algorithms is gonna be the determinants
of how we get value out of these
technologies so I mentioned at the
beginning that deep learning is one of
the reasons that there is this new
excitement about AI however that
excitement comes with a downside these
algorithms are very hard for people to
understand so when these algorithms are
making a prediction and this relates
very much with the Ann's comment about
oh if I know when my algorithm is doing
the wrong thing then I can override it
so with statistical techniques and when
these algorithms are there are learning
from large amounts of data it is quite
impossible to understand when these what
these algorithms are gonna be doing for
each case on top of that these
algorithms get updated pretty often
for example Tesla cars they are
algorithms about how they are going to
be driving gets updated pretty much
every week and as a driver you are
expected to understand this week how
should I trust my Tesla so there is a
big transparency problem between the AI
algorithm and either the user or the
controller or the supervisor of this
algorithm and we need to do a lot of
work to make that layer transparent in
the sense that we can actually create a
trustworthy partnership between the
human and the machine so that they can
work together so that we can get to that
case where
okay I know my algorithm is not doing
the right thing
I should override but there is a sharing
of responsible to issue two when that
happens for example one of the cases
where AI algorithms has been used in in
public space is parole decisions and
sentencing decisions that happen in our
legal system so for decades for a decade
now and it's not a new thing that
statistical learning algorithms have
been employed in courts for making
sentencing and parole decisions so there
is a beautiful probably article that
discusses issues by having such a system
working with judges and that's a great
read for all of us to understand that
some of the social issues that come
through the use of AI in public space so
one issue is if you are a judge and need
under time pressure need to make these
decisions wouldn't it be much easier for
you just to agree with the Machine
decision what do you really gain by
overriding it because it's a lose-lose
case if you override it and the person
commits a crime then you're involved if
the algorithm says something you follow
fit it it was algorithm decision so we
need to really think very hard about the
balance of opinions and the control and
who is really responsible for these
decisions when you actually have a team
of AI and human making decisions who is
responsible in that case these these
case studies also show that AI
algorithms can be quite biased for
example they were analyzing hearty
statistical techniques for making parole
decisions for african-americans and
whites in the society release these
sorry to interrupt I mean these are huge
huge issues but let's try to stay more a
little more narrowly focus because we
could we can you know expand but but I
mean but but still to take that theme
though how in your work or in other's
work do you try to bring how do you try
to make humans and AI complementary
whether it's in labor or in trying to
understand what's I think we need to
move away from this thought that AI is
gonna automate and humans are gonna
adapt to it
that's not what needs to happen I think
what we need to work on is yes
we are gonna be automate we are going to
be working on automation forgiving these
kind of capabilities to AI but we have
to design really hard about we have to
think really hard about the design of
the system we are developing and that
middle layer in terms of the AI
explaining itself to the human human
having some transparent layer between
bita machine and working on that
coordination and I think that's the only
way we are gonna get this equation right
yeah yeah I think there's some other
issues too so think about the exceptions
and self-driving vehicles the the very
often Black Swan events very very hard
to predict and so you need a huge amount
of data to come up with any sort of
reliable estimate of how safe a vehicle
is so you think about self-driving cars
where say Tesla has an enormous amount
of proprietary data that it's guiding
its algorithms but an insurance company
or government regulators don't have
access to the same done or the public in
general so it becomes very difficult to
understand what the actual risk is
without some sort of data sharing or
others you know there's a new set of
issues I think emerging in terms of data
transparency and exactly right there
will be demands for interoperability and
data sharing for safety reasons look at
the airline industry as an example I
mean when there's an airline event
there's immediately an investigation by
several different parties with different
script issues and interests and they try
to resolve the cause of the event and
make sure it doesn't happen again I
think that same infrastructure that same
set of procedures be carried over into
this context without much objection
who's going to stand up an object of
that kind of investigation one thing
about the news when you look at the
journalism on AI they're always picking
the accept that the kind of interesting
cases go and poker and all these games
and other things if you want to get an
idea of what's really done in the
ordinary sorts of cases go look at
Kaggle
Cagle is a company that sets up machine
learning competitions so one company
might say we will offer a prize of a
million dollars to the party that's best
able to predict hospital readmission
within 90 days using this data set and I
have to say two qualifications one is I
was an angel investor in Kegel and Kegel
was recently acquired by Google so
nothing to do with each other those two
facts but but it is quite interesting
because you can see things like housing
appraisal Zillow put up a data set of
houses features and values and come up
with the best model for appraising
houses YouTube videos Google actually
put up 4.5 million labeled YouTube
videos and has a contest and trying to
predict what people are doing in the
video because even though still images
we have a very good technology for that
now we don't have a good very good
technology for videos for active people
moving around are they exercising their
dancing as they fighting you know
whatever readmission the hospital
example I mentioned recognizing leaves
counting plankton I mean there's just
all sorts of applications 230 some
applications and you can get an idea of
what is actually going on in ordinary
business practice and it's quite quite
interesting what's happening there so I
think we're gonna see this diffusing and
there will be the really exciting cases
like the driverless vehicles and and
humans beating Xen go champions but
there's a lot of ordinary activities
that are being automated as well ai has
a long tail problem so that this comes
to your point where you say there a lot
of edge cases in the real world
ai has to deal with a lot of edge cases
and if you look at although in cases
where we have a lot of data if you look
at the distribution of the data for some
cases we have a lot of data but if the
cases get more edge and edge and edge we
have less data and the common techniques
we use that the statistical learning
techniques are
very good to learn head of this
distribution not so much the tail so to
get the tail right we really need to
think very hard about how to get it
right it could be through collection of
edge cases creating you know datasets of
those edge cases sharing and within the
industry but we also need to think about
some kind of collection of techniques
working together not only stick to one
thing but collection of techniques
working together and maybe with human
supervision to to get those edge cases
right because just saying okay we are
getting 95% accuracy on this data set
doesn't necessarily mean that that
application is going to be providing
value to you in the short term and that
comes to your question about why we
haven't seen productivity effects from
AI yet because when you think about
those accuracy curves you need to think
about what is the point where I'm gonna
be able to get value from this
technology and that's a that's a
different question so today I'm gonna
say somethin hell and I won't go to
questions too so get them ready um I
just wanted to return to the subscribing
thing because I think one thing to bear
in mind is for us to pay attention to
the rhetoric that's being used around AI
and I agree that the media focuses on
the fascinating cases but I also think
that the tech companies put out a lot of
rhetoric of their own an example for
self-driving vehicles is I bet all of
you can tell me how many motor vehicle
deaths a year we expect to save by using
self-driving vehicles because they use
this number in every article it's 1.2
million lives what you might not know is
that's the number of motor vehicle
deaths per year worldwide the number in
the US and it's not that we don't care
about the rest of world but explain why
they're different the number in the u.s.
is 35,000 deaths per year to let you
know where that number sets I'm going to
situate it between what's right below it
and what's right above it right below it
5% lower deaths by falling down right
above it 25% higher death by poisoning
okay we don't see I say ice Aleutians
per falling down or being poisoned we
see AI solution
for a motor vehicle deaths well it's
talked about minor vehicle deaths they
reached a peak in the 1970s and they've
been decreasing ever since and why have
they been decreasing because of
mechanical and electrical improvements
in vehicles that have been ongoing and
also because of regulations and laws
things like DUI laws and sobriety
checkpoints in mandatory seatbelts so
you have to ask yourself why are we
therefore so interested in self-driving
vehicles it looks like the thing about
saving lives isn't really it it's
solving a problem it's already solving
itself and if you look at commercial
truck drivers which is the first group
of the first day that point
pardon I mean the number of deaths from
from automobiles is going down but that
doesn't mean that self-driving cars
wouldn't reach further reduce it than
that right though self-driving vehicles
might help to reduce the number but the
number that we're talking about
realistically is 35,000 in this country
and then you can look at other countries
if you look the University of Michigan's
Transportation Institute and 2014 put
out a map of the 25 countries with the
most via motor vehicle deaths per year
and if you look at that map you're going
to get a sense of what the roads in
those countries look like there are no
way that because of things like how
brought up they're chaotic roads you're
not going to have them I go to India a
lot I have for the last two decades
there's no way you're going to have
self-driving vehicles in India and the
chairman and CEO of Maruti Suzuki which
is the largest automaker in India says
the same thing he says we're gonna have
self-driving vehicles there anywhere
anytime soon because it's chaos on our
roads right so so we have other ways
that we can bring these numbers down so
I don't think that the real motivation
for why we're going after self-driving
vehicles is to reduce motor vehicle
deaths I think that there's some other
motivation and I would love to have that
conversation because baby the
conversation is we could really redesign
our cities and improve and end some of
our climate change problems won't that
be wonderful let's have that
conversation help
let's see oh yes
well well I will say if you look at the
examples you gave they have this common
theme namely there's advances in
monitoring so people who fall over if
they're monitored within their home that
can be notified either by themselves or
by the home can say there's a problem
same thing I just saw in fact a talking
pill bottle that warns you about what
you're taking and whether you already
took this this morning and all sorts of
other things so there are a lot of cases
I don't know if I'd call it AI but I
would you say technology where you're
seeing technological advances of one
form or another that help people live
safer more productive lives and in a way
that this issue about the self-driving
car the problem is dealing with all
these exceptions I asked the team do you
break for squirrels now that's a
decision right because avoiding ass wart
squirrel could cause lots of damage
elsewhere they said no I said do you
break for dogs they said how BIG's the
dog
do break for deer well yes of course we
break for gear because there's a huge
number of accidents involving the deer
what we need is you know automate a deer
to avoid the car so we get out of the
way whenever we have a much safer Road
environment
let's say with little time of questions
Oh Larry wait alright let's come back to
the topic demand for labor and back in
my graduate school days
Vasiliy leon TF Nobel Prize winner
throughout to the class the horse
paradox or horse story pointed out that
between 1900 and 1940 the population of
horses in the United States had gone way
way way down why the costs of the
internal combustion engine and we had
horseless vehicles rather than personal
person list vehicles for personal
transportation outside of urban areas
for short-term haul within urban and and
you know hauling Freight within urban
areas and of course on farms and cars
trucks tractors you know now didn't
totally reduce you know eliminate all
horses there was still a small
population left but clearly the market
clearing wage for horses went way down
below reproduction sustaining levels
fortunately horses have shorter lives
fortunately we feel differently about
how to deal with surplus horses but so
the question is could we are we
confident and how I take your point
about labor supply may well you know
modify
ameliorate but still the issue of the
demand for labor
we've been arguably we've been so lucky
over the past two centuries that that
technology shifts haven't really
diminished the demand for labor if
anything pushed the demand for labor out
but we can't rule out the possibility of
a technology change doing to humans what
the technology changed between 1900 and
1940 did to horses so the question is
either what happens if we're horses or
of course they say that the population
of horses had not decreased well right
that the market clearing wage Falls way
way way way low and then what right ok
so there - two issues here one is it's
difficult to retrain horses I mean it's
not it's not a direct comparison so you
have you know we can certainly look at
occupations that have largely gone away
and we've taken those people and
absorbed them in in other capacities and
that's generally been true now why has
it been true so if you look at
individual occupations it's a story
about demand so when demands elastic
there's job growth but when demand
starts getting inelastic further
automation leads the job declines and
and they can be dramatic so in the in a
10 or 20 year time frame we're not going
to see a dramatic change in the nature
of demand but it's a good question
further out are we going to basically be
able to satiate demand in one market
after another after another so that
there are no jobs left and that really
raises sort of a broader philosophical
question about what is it that humans
want
so people have john maynard keynes in
the in the 1930s and I think leon TF had
some writings in a similar vein talked
about you know you know by this time we
were gonna have a huge amount of leisure
time
and technological unemployment if you
look at what's happened to leisure time
the yes the workweek has declined fairly
dramatically since the you know the the
1800s when you had a 72 hour workweek
and now we're down to 34 hours but it's
been remarkably slow because and you
have to ask ultimately at some level
it's because people are getting value
there's a demand for things that they
believe they're consume or demand for
even how they obtain their leisure and
leisure enjoyment so the technology of
leisure has dramatically increased you
know in terms of video games in terms of
movies and and and all these various
things so that the question comes down
to in 50 years are the good is it going
to be anything that humans want that
machines can't deliver and I I think
some we're at a philosophical level do
humans want interaction with other
humans the humans want you know is the
personal role an important aspect of
what humans want both in terms of what
they're doing for gainful employment and
in in terms of how they want to consume
and I mean I I don't think I would deign
to answer that but it I can I can simply
point to some very bright people like I
Cannes
you know just had a very hard time
imagining all the additional things that
humans might want that might cause them
not to have a 10-hour work week I just
wanted to say a couple follow-ups on
that one is 80% of the u.s. economy
services so clearly people are involve
on to be involved with other people
because there are lots of those services
you could automate pretty easy I don't
really need a person to lead me to my
table at the restaurant you could flash
little arrows on the floor or something
to make that happen but we want that
okay people want those services on the
work week nothing's written in stone
about a five-day workweek Mexico if you
look in the OECD countries work week in
Mexico's 45 hours and US 37
in the Netherlands 30 hours France is
slightly behind at about 33 so you can
take some of that increased productivity
and leisure if you want absolutely no
question about it and you would get very
few objections I think if people said
hey let's have every weekend be a
three-day weekend which is pretty much
what's technologically possible today
that could easily happen if people chose
to move in that and that direction and
finally I want to say one last word
about the first invasion of the robots
first invasion the robots was around the
1880s and 1910 or so and its domestic
robots it's washing machines it's dryers
it's dishwashers it's lawnmowers sewing
machines all of those mechanical
innovations have made home work far far
more productive and so you saw women in
particulars Deirdre mentioned shifting
from the household into the labor market
and you've seen this tremendous increase
in output from a household basis partly
due to that kind of innovation like an
animation I've introduced myself as an
economic his historian and besides the
beside the secret handshake which we
have we're supposed to tell people about
how things were the same in the past and
I don't think AI is distinct from say
the say
say the bow and arrow which is a
substitute for Spears or the horse which
is a substitute for human
s injures on foot and of course these
technologies have implications the horse
was an instrument of the aristocracy
because they were expensive to maintain
for a while but III think on the whole
these these robots which is what a
shovel is a shovel is a robot a scythe
is a robot are to be viewed with
optimism and here's a number which ought
to be in everyone's mind
it's not true that the number of jobs
created or lost in the United States or
what's reported every month about
200,000 jobs when things are good -
200,000 jobs when things are bad in fact
every year 20 million jobs are lost in
the United States this is an eye ooh
workforce of a hundred and sixty 160
million so there's a tremendous amount
of churning quite appropriately in in
2000 there are a hundred and thirty
thousand people employed in video stores
so I urge you all to be of goo to be of
to be of good cheer I think we could
probably have time for one more question
also I just want to point out that
actually comes back to something that AJ
said right at the beginning which is
whether we're moving towards I think you
called it a general artificial
intelligence right right is it a general
purpose technology or is it a shovel and
there's a huge difference between this
I'm back on that dirty because I want to
know then if you're rejecting Aaron
Olson and others have have argued that
if we look back at other technological
innovations like the McCormick Reaper is
an example he uses yes it transformed
agriculture and threw a lot of people
out of work but because we didn't have
simultaneous innovations going on in
other industries there were places for
them to go pretty quickly and his
argument is is that what we're gonna see
with AI is simultaneous innovations
across all industries so there's like
nowhere left to run
would you would you say that you don't
agree with that idea how he knows that
they're happening across I think he's
looking even at the present
China radically change I think we should
we need to we need to wrap up so we'll
take a short break let's say ten minutes
and we'll start the next panel because
if the next panel goes over then we're
gonna miss the Eclipse and we won't let
anybody out to go see it so be back here
by 10:20 but join me in thanking the
panel for what I thought was
