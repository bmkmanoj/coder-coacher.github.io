as a left brain symbolic structured
if-then-else binary sort of our
computing then synapse or neuromorphic
computing brain inspired computing is
about patent admission slow synthetic
parallel on one hand your flops
floating-point operations per second on
our site we have shops synaptic
operations per second to give you a
perspective of you know since the
project started where we are
projector least started in 2004 with a
single person you know leading from then
on to an almond Institute on cognitive
computing which actually just off your
present at and so it's really great to
have you and then from then on we worked
on the largest blue gene/l the largest
blue gene p and largest blue gene queue
to carry out increasingly larger
simulations this is of course a Henry
Markham's favorite one in and then we
won the DARPA synapse project grant and
worked very closely with Todd Hilton
Gill Pratt and Dan hammer storm we
mapped out the wiring diagram by
collecting the largest data set we
created the worm scale chips with 256
neurons
I mentioned the simulation of the scale
of human brain with 100 trillion
synapses to development of the TrueNorth
ecosystem so not only do we have a chip
but we have an end to end programming
paradigm from user interface deep
learning down to a programming language
firmware as well as the whole user flow
and debugging tools right in on top of
that we have created various boards and
we are making plans by December of next
year to create a 128 chip system that
should happen so we are now just at the
beginning of the next generation in the
next generation we already can imagine
new chips new software ecosystem new
training new systems and even new
sensors and new algorithms and
applications which have fundamentally
allow us to create completely new neural
networks and we have a roadmap for
building systems by using example of the
scalability of TrueNorth
in the whole idea is a server spiral
we went from architecture to simulation
to chips to applications and now that we
have the benefit of insights not just
from our work from work for colleagues
as well the we can actually again do
another turn on the spiral and the
ultimate vision which I believe will be
possible before 2020 ends is that we
will be able to produce a brain in a box
which was the original vision of synapse
project 10 billion neurons in 2 liter 1
kilowatt this is no longer science
fiction it is happening so the project
you know has received a lot of adulation
I just want to flash it in front of you
real quick but this is very important
last fall we had a chance to present the
tiled board to President Obama and we
received a real signed letter
congratulating the team just become a
prized possession for our team and it
was presented to the House panel on
science
as well as Senate panel on science and
with that I'd like to thank the DARPA
program managers for the vision their
partnership like to thank in our current
customers Air Force Research Lab DARPA
Lawrence Livermore National Lab Army and
hopefully Navy coming soon these are for
the collaborative work
I saw professor Phillip Wong you know
who's been part of the project since
very early on Department of Energy eight
IBM labs and fabbs and just the synapse
product itself at six universities but
of course now we have expanded I would
like to thank Livermore and then NSA for
all the supercomputers that they gave us
and all my wonderful colleagues it's a
really a joint work and some of them at
Alma than today with that thank you very
much for your attention and thank you
for inviting me Murad and please please
remember to see my colleague dr. Palmer
Ola today evening for the demos John so
is the question we agreed upon right but
the question we agreed upon right
exactly
no no so some of us do do back
propagation and spiking neural networks
and and some other things but the the
question that I have is right now your
training is done offline yes and I think
it would be fantastic to implement all
that on a 28 board chip do you have any
plans to put that learning algorithm
into the chip and accelerate that
portion of it we certainly do and it's
again you know it's a accelerating
learning has to be done with far more
clear than accelerating inference as you
can understand because you don't want to
tie yourself down so that you cannot
explore the full space of learning
algorithms I'm certainly happy to talk
to you about this so now for your for
your brain in the Box
1-liter you were definitely you to later
sorry
you know what guys this is not fair you
would I give you ten liters okay okay
but you would still need a different
solid-state circuit technology so what
what will be your choice
seven nanometers that would be
sufficient to put a brain in a box will
visitors I see but you know just just to
be very fairly iBM has a huge investment
in advanced process technology right and
we're continuing to do that and as such
technology becomes available that can be
integrated with the existing process we
stand ready to take advantage of it so
you know I I'm an engineer I'm not a
scientist and I want to make things work
so I'll accept anything that works
thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
