fantasy a fantasy I've had it involves
well I've overpowered his Elite Guard
I've fought my way into a secret bunker
and I've managed to knock his Luger out
of his hand his cyanide pill that he
keeps to commit suicide rather than be
captured he snarls at me he comes at me
in a rage we wrestle I managed to pin
him down put handcuffs on him and then
say Adolf Hitler I arrest you for crimes
against humanity
this is where the the Medal of Honor
version of this fantasy ends and the
imagery begins to darken what would I do
if I actually had Hitler in my hands and
it's not hard to imagine once I allow
myself sever his spine up I don't know
can I is this on now it's on okay so not
hard to imagine once I allow myself
sever his spine at the neck take out his
eyes with a blunt instrument puncture
his eardrums cut out his tongue leave
him alive on a respirator
you know tube-fed not able to move not
able to speak not able to hear to see
just to feel and then inject him with
something cancerous that will infest
every single cell in his body now I've
had this fantasy since I was a kid and I
still do sometimes and when I really
think about it my heart beats faster and
it's all these plans for like the most
evil wicked soul in history except
there's a problem which is I don't
believe in Souls and I don't believe in
evil
and I think wicked is only appropriate
for a musical but on the other hand
there's there's all sorts of people I
wouldn't mind seeing killed but I'm
against the death camp penalty but I
watch all sorts of violent schlocky
movies but I'm for very strict gun
control but then there was this one time
I was in a laser tag place and I had
such a good time hiding in a corner shoe
people over and over until this like
pimply kid zapped me like a million
times in a row and then snickered at me
and made me feel very unmanly so
essentially what is obvious here is um
your typical human when it comes to this
extremely confusing topic of violence
now obviously as a species we have
problems with violence we have used
shower heads to deliver poison gas
letters with anthrax passenger planes as
weapons mass rape as a military strategy
we are a miserably violent species but
there's a complication with that which
is we don't hate violence we hate the
wrong kind of violence because when it's
the right kind we leap in we paid good
money to watch it we hand out medals we
vote for we mate with the people who are
masters at it when it's the right kind
of violence we love it
and there's an additional complication
because amid us being this miserably
violent species were also a
extraordinarily compassionate and
altruistic one so how do you begin to
make sense of us the biology of us at
our best moments and our worst moments
and all those ambiguous ones in between
now one thing that is clear is it as
utterly boring to understand the biology
of the motoric aspects of your behavior
your brain tells your spine tells your
muscles to do something and hooray
you've behaved
what's incredibly complicated is
understanding the meaning of the
behavior because in one setting firing a
gun is some appalling act in another
it's an act of like heroic
self-sacrifice in one setting putting
your hand on top of someone else's is
deeply compassionate and another it's a
deep betrayal
the challenge for us is to understand
the biology of the context of our
behaviors and that one is really really
challenging and one thing that's clear
is you are never gonna really understand
what's going on if you get it into your
head that you're going to be able to
explain everything with this is the part
of the brain or the gene the hormone or
the childhood experience or the
evolutionary mechanism that explains
everything because it doesn't work that
way instead any behavior that occurs is
the outcome of the biology that occurred
a second before an hour before and all
the way to a million years before okay
so to give you some sense of this okay
so you're in some situation there's a
crisis there is a crisis there's rioting
violence going on people running around
and there's a stranger running at you in
an agitated state and you can't quite be
sure what their facial expression is
maybe they're angry maybe they're
frightened maybe it's threatening
they've got something in their hand that
seems like a handgun and you're standing
there and you have a gun and they come
running at you and you shoot and then it
turns out that what they had in their
hand was a cell phone instead and thus
we asked a biological question why did
that behavior occur in you and what's
really the central point is that's a
whole hierarchy of questions why did
that behavior occur what went on one
second before in your brain that brought
about that behavior now to begin to
understand that the part of the brain
that's at the top of the list of usual
suspects is a brain region called the
amygdala you want to think about
aggression and think about the brain you
think about the amygdala if you
stimulate the amygdala and an
experimental lab animal you get an
outburst of aggression humans who have
rare types of seizures that start there
rare types of tumors based on the
amygdala uncontrollable violence if you
damage the amygdala you blunt the
ability of an organism to be aggressive
okay so the amygdala is about violence
except if you sit down your typical and
MacDowell adjust and ask them what the
amygdala is about that's not the first
word that's going to come out of their
mouths because for most people studying
it with the amygdala is about is fear
fear and anxiety and learning to be
afraid in other words we've just learned
something very interesting which is you
cannot understand the first thing about
the neurobiology of violence without
understanding the neurobiology of fear
and
world in which no amygdaloid neuron need
be afraid there'd be an awful lot more
of us sleeping between lions and lamps
now the thing to begin to make sense of
what the amygdala is what parts of the
brain does a talk to and which regions
talks to it in turn now next region that
is incredibly interesting is called the
insular cortex now
the insular cortex is in fact incredibly
boring if you're a lab rat or any other
mammal on earth because it does
something very straightforward you bite
into a piece of food and it's spoiled
and rotten and fetid and rancid and all
of that and what happens is as a result
your insular cortex activates and it
triggers all sorts of reflexes your
stomach lurches you gag you spit it out
you you have a gag reflex very useful it
keeps mammals from eating poisonous
foods and you do the same thing with
human get a nice human volunteer who
inexplicably is convinced to bite into
this food that's rancid and disgusting
and they're in a brain scanner and
they're insular cortex activates we do
something fancier all we have to do is
think about eating something disgusting
and the insular cortex activates but
then something much more subtle sit down
someone in your brain scanner and have
them tell you about a time they did
something miserable and rotten to some
other human or tell them about some
other occurrence of some human doing
something miserable and rotten to
somebody else and the insular cortex
will activate and every other mammal on
earth it does gustatory disgust but in
us it also does moral disgust and what
that tells you is why it is if something
is sufficiently morally appalling we
feel sick to our stomachs it leaves a
bad taste in our mouths we feel soiled
by it we feel nauseous we feel because
our brain invented this symbolic thing
of moral mores and standards some 40 50
thousand years ago and didn't invent a
new part of the brain at the time and
instead there was presumably some sort
of big committee meeting and they said
okay
I'll discuss there's there's that
insulator that does like food disgust
there's okay it's in their portfolio now
give me some duct tape the insular
cortex is now gonna do moral disgust as
well and it has trouble telling the
difference and no surprise the main part
of the brain the insular cortex talks to
you in the human brain is the amygdala
because once it decides this thing is
disgusting you're a couple of steps away
from it being scary it being menacing it
being something you need to act against
now in lots of ways it's very cool the
insular cortex does this because suppose
you see some moral ill that needs to be
cured and some of the time that can take
an enormous self-sacrifice that could
take the ultimate sacrifice in some
cases and if moral outrage was this
abstraction this just the sort of
distanced sort of state it would be hard
to pick up a head of steam to really be
able to act against it the viscera your
stomach churning that's where the force
comes to to make a moral imperative
imperative that's great
but then there's a downside because the
insular cortex is not very good at
remembering it's only a metaphor that
you were feeling disgusted and suddenly
you have that whole problem of the world
of people who are disgusted by
somebody's behavior which in somebody
else's eyes is just a normal loving
lifestyle disgust is a moving target and
time and space and there's the danger to
decide that being morally disgusted by
something is a pretty good litmus test
for deciding between right and wrong and
we sure know all the ways in which that
can get you into trouble and probably
most of all every ideologue in history
has had a brilliant intuitive feeling
for how the insular cortex works which
is if you can get your minion to the
point that when you talk about them them
living in the next Valley them who think
differently than you who pray
differently who love differently if you
can get your followers to the point that
when you invoke them insular cortex
activate because there's something just
disgusting about them you're 90% of the
way towards pulling off your successful
genocide
key to every good sort of genocidal
movement is taking them and turning them
into being such infestations and
malignancies and whatever's that they
hardly even count as human anymore okay
so we've got this sort of axis between
the insular cortex and the amygdala
meanwhile we've got the most interesting
part of the brain far and away a region
called the frontal cortex frontal cortex
I've just wasted the last 35 years of my
life studying a part of the brain called
the hippocampus which is kind of
interesting and like it's done well by
me and I've been you know that's right
but I wish I'd been studying the front
the frontal cortex it's the most
recently evolved part of the human brain
we've got more of it than any other
species on earth and what does it do the
frontal cortex makes you do the harder
thing when it's the right thing to do
and impulse control and gratification
postponement and long-term planning and
emotional regulation and what does the
frontal cortex spend an awful lot of
time doing sending inhibitory
projections down to the amygdala hoping
to race there in time to say wait a
second are you sure that's really a
handgun wait a second I wouldn't do that
if I were you I know this seems like a
brilliant idea right now but believe me
you were going to regret it the frontal
cortex very often racing to try to
control the amygdala now there's this
picture of the frontal cortex all it
does is occasionally go slumming down
the amygdala and preach to it about like
temperance or whatever but in fact
there's bidirectionality
the amygdala has plenty means to talk to
the frontal cortex what's that about
every time we're in a moment of extreme
aroused state and we make a decision
that is hideously stupid and disastrous
that seems brilliant at the time because
that's the frontal cortex being
marinated in what's down below in other
words there's this very tempting view
the frontal cortex most recently evolved
it's this gleaming shining computer like
part of our brain it's sitting there
just marinating and all the emotive
going on underneath it's bi-directional
communication now finally in terms of
making sense of this frontal cortex the
whole notion of doing the harder thing
when it's the right thing to do is a
value free judgement what do I mean by
this sometimes you have to have an
incredibly strong aerobic least ugly
frontal cortex to resist the temptation
to lie and that's at the centerpiece of
some of the most important sorta
crossroads in our lives however once you
decide that you are going to lie you
need your frontal cortex to do it
effectively because it's your frontal
cortex that says ok remember don't make
eye contact don't use this right cheek
muscle at that point because you're
going to be tempted to twitch keep your
voice under control it could take an
enormous amount of discipline to go and
effectively like make the world whole in
a better place but it can also take an
awful lot of discipline and staying up
late and studying to be effective at
ethnically cleansing villages the
frontal cortex is value-free in that
sense ok
so we've gotten a sense of a couple of
the brain regions here that are
pertinent so that's what's going on in
one second before but no brain is an
island and what we now have to do is
take a step back so what was going on in
the seconds two minutes before in the
sensory environment
which triggered that amygdala to do this
where that frontal cortex to do that
what are the stimuli that are coming in
there now obviously in the scenario we
have the sight the sounds of this
rioting perfectly pertinent to making
sense there but then there's a whole
world of sensory stuff going on that's
subliminal that you hardly even know is
there and if you did not in a million
thing years would you think it's
pertinent for example when you have to
make split-second decisions you are more
likely to mistake a cellphone for a
handgun if the person holding it is male
is large is of another race your brain
processes that in 50 milliseconds that
is one twentieth of a second your brain
is already distinguishing the
incorrectly why is that that turned out
to have a really interesting piece of
the wiring of the amygdala okay so
suppose you look at somebody and there's
something in their hand that's either a
cell phone or handgun so what happens
the information goes from your eye to
this Waystation of the brain and
eventually gets to your visual cortex
and a first layer there sits and spend
some time and figures out what the
pixels are and then the second layer
turns the pixels into lions and the next
layer turns the lines and to curves and
eventually you got a four-dimensional
sort of picture of whatever and then
eventually some neurons in your cortex
says oh my I believe that's a handgun
and let's go wake up the amygdala and
let it know about it that's the simple
part it turns out there's a shortcut the
very first way station where sensory
information comes in shortcuts directly
to the amygdala in other words the
amygdala knows there's a handgun while
your visual cortex is still fussing
around with the pixels there that's very
good that's very helpful that it gets
that information quickly but it turns
out you need all those computational
layers in your visual cortex to tell
what's there accurately in other words
the amygdala gets sensory information
that's very emotionally aroused before
your conscious cortex does and the
accuracy is not great and thus if you're
tired if you're hungry if you're in pain
if there's a bad smell around if any of
those things are happening you are
biasing the amygdala towards mistaking a
neutral facial expression for a
threatening one mistaking a cellphone
for a handgun all of that occurring in
the seconds before okay but now we need
to take a step further back what about
hours two days before how was that
affecting how sensitive you are to
sensory information which then talk to
your amygdala and sturla cortex all of
that what we've moved into here is the
realm of hormones in that regard
amid a gazillion hormones that are
pertinent two of them stand out above
all others first one the inevitable
usual suspect hormone that's got to be
pulled in at this point which is
testosterone okay what is testosterone
about testosterone is the reason why
males
every culture and every species on earth
or such pains in the asses testosterone
causes a gret testosterone does not
cause aggression
what testosterone does is bias you
towards interpreting ambiguous social
information as being threatening as
being provocative take somebody and pump
him up with testosterone and they decide
that neutral facial expressions seen for
20th of a second are threatening take
testosterone and that brief exposure to
that neutral facial expression and
suddenly the amygdala is all agitated
and frothing at the mouth
what testosterone does is it exaggerated
Spri existing tendencies what it does is
sensitize you to whatever social
learning you've received about what kind
of aggression is just fine of what kind
isn't now the single most interesting
thing about testosterone is even that's
not what it really does testosterone
doesn't make organisms more aggressive
what testosterone does is it makes more
organ organisms more likely to do
whatever behavior is needed to hold on
to high status when it's being
challenged ok if you're a baboon what
that means is aggression because if
somebody's threatening you it's going to
be all about aggression that's the
entire world with a baboon remarkably
and humans put somebody in an economic
game where you get high status by being
generous and the offers you make and
testosterone makes people more generous
the problem isn't that testosterone
causes aggression the problem is that we
reward aggression with status so readily
and what that also tells you is if you
took a gazillion Buddhist monks and shot
them up with testosterone they'd be
running around and like frenzied gangs
doing random acts of kindness to see who
could do the most of them most quickly
the problem here is not the hormone it's
the values and the rewards that we place
on aggression okay meanwhile in that
span of hours today's the other hormone
that has just as undeserved of a
reputation but in the opposite direction
is this hormone oxytocin now oxytocin is
officially to sort of use endocrine
jargon it's officially the grooviest
hormone under
because oxytocin's by now-famous it
causes bonding between mothers and
infants and pair bonding between
monogamous couples and it makes you more
expressive and emotionally sensitive and
more cooperative and more charitable and
more trusting and there's a whole new
horrifying field of neuroscience called
neuro marketing where if you spritz
oxytocin up people's noses they're more
likely to believe all sorts of gibberish
and nonsense of people trying to sell
you stuff whether it's their political
viewpoint or some geek awe I mean if
they could spray oxytocin through the
vents and like Costco all over this
country what that would do to the
economy of like sort of the nonsense
that people would buy okay so oxytocin
promotes pro-social behavior until you
look more closely and when recent work
shows is that's exactly what oxytocin
does it makes you much more cooperative
and generous and charitable all of that
with people who you categorize as being
just like you it makes you pour more
pro-social towards in-group members and
when it comes to out group members it
makes people more xenophobic and more
preemptively aggressive and less
cooperative and the greatest study
showing this was a couple years ago and
this was a group in the Netherlands
where they got their usual sort of lab
rats which was college volunteers from
some like university there and what they
did was they gave everyone the standard
classic problem in philosophy the
runaway trolley problem is that okay to
sacrifice one person push him in front
of a runaway trolley to save five and
there's a whole world of research done
on that so they sort of established the
baseline levels at which people would be
willing to push somebody just save five
now what they did was they gave the
person they were pushing on to the track
a name a third of the time the person
would get a name that apparently is just
like your stereotypical Dutch named Dirk
or Peter or something like that a third
of the time or the remainder of the time
either of the two groups that people in
Holland tend to have a lot of out-group
hostility towards Germans oh that's
right world war two or people with
Muslim names so now you've got the snare
do you push Dirk in front of the trolley
do you push Auto in front of the trolley
do you push Mahmud in front of the
trolley and what they show is give
people oxytocin and there are less
likely to sacrifice Dirk whereas they
can't leap fast enough to push Wolfgang
and a mood there under the tracks
oxytocin doesn't make us nicer and makes
us nicer to people we're already
predisposed towards being nice to it
exaggerated s' us them contrasts okay so
now stepping back further how about
weeks two months before and this is now
entered the realm of neural plasticity
the fact that the brain can change in
response to experience and for example
if you've now just spent these last few
months mired in trauma and stress your
amygdala will have grown larger it will
form new connections the circuits there
will be more excitable and your frontal
cortex will have become more sluggish
and atrophied in other words at that
critical moment the amygdala isn't a
more hysterical hyper reactive State and
the frontal cortex has as much of that
much less capacity to get there in time
and say wait a second are you sure
before you pull the trigger there you
can see that changing okay but stepping
back even further now going back years
decades how about adolescence what going
on in adolescence is relevant now to
this one second of whether or not you're
going to pull that trigger and the
central fact of the adolescent brain is
that all of the brain is going full
blast fully mature except for the
frontal cortex which is still half-baked
at that point amazingly the frontal
cortex it's the last part of the brain
to fully mature it is not fully online
until you are about 25 years old which
explains an enormous amount of freshman
year in college it's the last part of
the brain to fully mature what does that
mean it means adolescence and early
adulthood is the time of life where
environment and experience are sculpting
your frontal cortex into the adult
version you are gonna have in that one
critical moment they're deciding what
the outcome is
what that also tells you is if this is
the last part of the brain to fully
mature it's the part of the brain least
shaped by genes and most shaped by
environment okay but now stepping even
further back how about back to your
childhood back to your fetal life
obviously pertinent because that's when
your brain was being constructed but
what people also have learned in recent
years is experience experience during
that period causes changers jargon in
the field epigenetic changes causes
permanent changes in some genes and
parts of your body are turned on forever
after other genes return to offer
lifetime consequences ah
in other words childhood matters this is
one of the molecular mechanisms by which
childhood matters and is a very
pertinent example of that if you have
spent your feet'll nine months being
just bathed at high levels of stress
hormones from Mom's circulation because
she is extremely stressed as an adult
thanks to epigenetic changes during your
fetal life your amygdala is going to be
hyper reactive and you're gonna secrete
higher levels of stress hormones which
makes the amygdala even more reactive
and makes the frontal cortex sluggish so
events back in fetal life but going back
even further
okay back to when all you were was a
fertilized egg and a bunch of genes
now obviously genes have tons to do with
everything here but here is the great
temptation to decide that genes are
determining anything genes determine
essentially nothing when it comes to
behavior because genes work differently
in different environments and the most
pertinent example here is a gene called
mono amine monoamine oxidase a mao-a do
not even dream of writing that down but
Mao a comes in a bunch of different
flavors a bunch of different variants
and if you have one particular variant
you are very significantly more likely
as an adult to commit antisocial
violence if and only if you were abused
as a child if you weren't having that
gene variant has zero increase in your
risk factor it's not your genes it's the
way the genes and
react with your environment and thus
starting with fetal life the
interactions between genes and
environment are going to shape enormous
li what state your brain is in in that
one critical second now of do you pull
the trigger or not okay but you got to
go even further back past you as a
single organism how about your ancestors
what were they up to for example if your
ancestors were pastoralists people
wandering deserts and grasslands with
their herds of camels or cows or goats
the odds are they would have invented
what is called a culture of honor
high levels of retributive violence clan
vendetta's warrior classes that's the
whole world of if they come and take
your camel and you do nothing about it
the next day they'll come and take your
entire turd herd and your wives and
daughters to clan violence going on for
centuries and what is clear is if your
ancestors were of a culture of Honor
centuries later that's still influencing
the values with which you were being
raised
including within moments of birth how
often mothers are holding their children
so centuries worth of that okay but
steps further back where the cultural
difference is coming from from
ecosystems one example of that you look
at people living in deserts and
historically they're likely to come up
with monotheistic religions look at
people and rainforests and they come up
with polytheistic religions look at
people in East Asia who live in flat
plain areas and they grow rice which
requires collectivist farming and you
get a very collectivist mindset about
cooperation get people in the hill
countries there and they grow wheat
which is done in individual families and
you get the same individualistic mindset
that you get in people living in
Manhattan all of it ecologically shaped
but then we gotta go even further back
because if you're talking about genes
anywhere along the way you're talking
about the evolution of the genes and
what you wind up seeing is evolution has
sculpted different primate species into
having different characteristic levels
of aggression some primate species have
virtually none at another extreme
high levels and there's all sorts of
biological traits that go along with the
two extremes and what about us we're
somewhere right in the middle between
the two extremes okay so in other words
if you want to understand why did this
behavior occur you've got to take into
account everything from one second
before to a million years before okay so
what do you conclude from that ooh
it's complicated okay that's very useful
but how about ooh it's complicated and
you better be real careful and real
cautious before you decide you
understand the causes of a behavior
especially if it's behavior that you
hunt judge harshly because things can
really go wrong with the wrong
attributions and we have a very dark
stained history of that occurring
precisely for those reasons now for me
when I look at all of this information
the single thing that I find to be most
important has to do with change every
single biological fact that I've given
long the way here is subject to change
over time ecosystems change thousands of
years ago the Sahara was a lush
grassland filled with hippos and giraffe
cultures change in the 17th century the
scariest people in all of Europe were
the Swedes who spent that whole century
rampaging all over Europe and the Swedes
have not had a ward in 203 years they
changed and most of all brains change
circuits form neurons weaken patterns
grow parts of brains expand per and as a
result people change and they could
change extraordinarily some examples of
it change in people that can occur over
the course of decades a man who moves me
enormous Lee a man by the name of John
Newton he was a British theologian he
was a leading abolitionist played a
central role in the role in the banning
of slavery at the beginning of the 1800s
in England John Newton spent the early
decades of his adult life as the captain
of a slave ship and after he retired
from that he spent decades as a local
parson still investing in the sleigh
if trade and growing rich from it until
one day something changed in him
something changed something changed and
he celebrated it and the thing that he's
most known for historically in him that
he wrote Amazing Grace
another example an am a man named Zen
Jia Bay who on the morning of December 6
1941 was the lead pilot in one of the
Bombardier squadrons that took off from
an Air Force Base in Japan and attacked
Pearl Harbor he was one of their star
pilots he led one of the divisions there
and 50 years later to the day as an old
man he came towards a ceremony at Pearl
Harbor commemorating it as an old man
came forward in broken English and
apologized to some of the elderly
survivors on the ground there and spent
the rest of his life close with some of
them think about that transformation if
one of those men that he befriended had
become a captive is's during World War
two he might have happily walked him to
death in the Bataan Death March and if
he had been a captive of one of those
American men who had killed him he might
very well have taken his skull as a
souvenir which was a standard thing done
in the Pacific during World War two with
dead Japanese and instead fifty years
later he's writing a letter to that
man's grandchildren consoling them when
grandpa has died change can occur even
faster over the course of hours and the
example that just mesmerizes me was the
first winter of world war one the
Christmas truce of 1914 powers-that-be
had worked out a truce that was supposed
to go for a couple of hours and the idea
was along the trenches of France people
would be able to come out and retrieve
bodies from no-man's land and go and
bury them so German and British troops
came out and retrieved bodies and soon
they helped each other carry the bodies
and soon they helped each other dig
graves in the frozen ground and then
they prayed together over the dead and
then they shared Christmas dinner and
then they exchanged gifts and by the
next day they were playing soccer
together up and down no-man's land
and exchanging addresses to get together
and see each other after the
was over and those truces went on for
two to three days until the officers had
to arrive and threatened to shoot these
men unless they went back to killing
each other and all it took was a couple
of hours to completely reorganize these
people's sense of who counts as an
assassin to them and us being all of us
in these trenches on both sides dying
for no damn reason and them being the
faceless powers behind the lines using
us as just pawns and sometimes change
can occur in the course of seconds two
minutes now historically probably the
single biggest horror in terms of
American consciousness from the Vietnam
War was the malai massacre a brigade of
American soldiers went into an
undefended village full of civilians and
killed between 350 and 500 of them
gang-raped women and girls beforehand
mutilated bodies utterly nightmarish
because it occurred because the US
government covered it up for as long as
possible because ultimately they just
did slapping of a few wrists and because
it was not a singular incident it was
one of the nightmares of Vietnam War the
Nilay massacre was stopped by one man a
man named Hugh Thompson Thompson was
piloting a helicopter gunship flying
over the village and was seeing American
soldiers firing activity oh they're
under attack by Viet Cong landed there
got out and was viewing the
incomprehensible sight of American
soldiers shooting elderly women digging
out babies from underneath the bodies of
their mothers and shooting them and
figured out what was happening and Hugh
Thompson got into his helicopter and in
the course of minutes undid every bit of
training he had had as to who is an us
and who is of them he took his
helicopter landed it between the last
group is surviving villagers there and
American soldiers coming at them with
their weapons landed his helicopter and
turned his machine guns on the American
soldiers and said if you do not stop I
will mow you all down and what is most
important to me is none of these guys
had fancier neurons than any of us
same neurotransmitters same genes same
enzymes no fancier than any of us what I
think we're left with here at the end is
a version of life that inevitable
exasperate in cliche those who don't
study history are destined to be able to
repeat it what we have here I think is
the opposite those who don't study the
history of extraordinary human change
and those who don't study the science of
how we more readily go from the worst of
our behaviors to the best ones are
destined not to be able to repeat
unbelievable magnificent moments like
these so let me stop at this point
and if there's any questions ok ok
someone coming into microphone what's
happening in the future of neurology
that would give us hope for
understanding the brain better having
better outcomes ok let me just take this
book here that I happen to see sitting
here let's see I haven't read this yet
but I skimmed it for the picture okay
here's one figure I don't know if you
could particularly see it on the left
page it's a whole bunch of graphs and
the whole point is it's a bunch of
graphs that are doing like this for a
long stretch and then suddenly they do
that
what those are are the number of
publications by year in various topics I
talked about for example at the top one
two thousand two two thousand six two
thousand ten two thousand the number of
papers in the medical literature
concerning the topic of oxytocin and
trust everything about it has been
learned in the last ten years here we
have brain and aggression 1985 there
were essentially zero papers published
by the last decade more than 2000 every
single one of these the vast majority of
what we've learned has come in the last
whatever short amount of time we
only a couple of hundred years into
understanding that epilepsy is a
neurological disease and not demonic
possession we're only about 50 years
into understanding certain types of
learning disabilities are due to micro
malformations in the cortex and people
with dyslexia and it's not laziness or
lack of motivation
the vast majority these factoids are
1020 years old and all that's gonna
happen is we're gonna learn more and
more of that stuff and what we're going
to learn more and more is to recognize
the extent to which we are biological
organisms and our behaviors have to be
evaluated in that realm for my money
what that eventually does is make words
like soul or evil utterly absurd and
mean evil but it also makes words like
punishment or justice very questionable
as well I think it will require an
enormous reshaping of how we think we
deal with the most damaging of human
behaviors because none of it can be
thought of outside the context of
biology well you did mention Rashard
Buddhists but I have a sense that in my
life at least have been exposed to a
number of techniques for creating people
that are like that
for example Buddhists people who
practice be possible people who undergo
psychoanalysis or series activities that
come from that group group relations
work or group therapy there are tools
that have that effect what I'm
considered what I'm wondering about is
why those things are not customary not
they're not they're not institutions we
don't have for example UDC so doesn't
have a program to to cause people in the
community to meet together there are
packages that can do that but it doesn't
happen and what's why is that
well the easy punchline is because
they're usually really hard to do one
example that comes to mind okay so
you've got conflicting groups that for
decades for millennia have had us of
them dichotomies in their head have been
at each other's throats and for decades
this notion has been floating around
among psychologists something called
contact theory which is if you bring
people from hostile opposing groups
together and they get to know each other
they're gonna recognize hey we're all
the same there and it's going to be
wondrous and we're all going to be like
singing Kumbaya and this is going to be
terrific and that's been the motivation
for all sorts of these programs taking
Palestinian and Israeli teenagers and
putting them in summer camps Irish kids
Northern Irish Catholics and Protestants
all of those endless versions of these
and what that extremely large literature
is shown by now is when it works right
it absolutely reduces intergroup
conflict can cause lasting changes in
perception where people could generalize
it beyond not just ooh now I know
there's one Israeli I know who's
actually good guy good could generalize
can generalize even to other groups of
them nonetheless most of the ways in
which you set those settings up wind up
making things worse because it's very
narrow domains where these things I
you've got to get everybody on equal
grounds they have to have shared goals
they have to have an absence of any
symbols that reviewed is provocative and
if you have it anything other than that
you're gonna make things worse
in other words none of these things are
done easily but they're all workable
that's a question he talked about the
critical time of adolescents in the
development of what we consider right
and wrong and how do you address the
generation of coming up that have been
just inundated with violence within
their media within their video games
that they play in the defense of it sort
of desensitizes them to acts of violence
okay I as a parent and absolutely
horrified by all that stuff and can
easily go off on to a rant about all the
bad consequences of it and I could find
papers now that are looking at video
violence and the desensitizing effects
and and if I really feel like going down
too
like the second sub-basement and sort of
the Stanford Medical Library and pull
out journals from the 60s and there are
the exact same papers there where all
you need to do is replace the word
television with video games television
radio violence in the 1930s with like
detective stories of who knows what
every single generation is wrestled with
us and when you go through the mass of
literature looking at each new
incarnation what you see is on the
average all of those forms of violence
cause a short term burst in violent
behavior and individuals it dis inhibits
it but in terms of whether it has
long-term consequences and every one of
those realms you get a very familiar
punch line violent media makes
aggressive individuals more aggressive
and has no effects on anybody else
because what it does is legitimizes and
habituates and dis inhibits individuals
who already have the predisposition
towards just like testosterone that does
not a good invent aggression it
exacerbates pre-existing social
tendencies towards it so in that regard
the good news is it's no worse than like
you know cop dramas sitting by the like
fireside chats in the 1930s with the
radio there the bad effects are
nonetheless those who are vulnerable
this is a more vivid more visceral more
real form of imitating an awful reality
than anything that's been invented
before but the general effects turn out
not to be terribly malevolent yeah oh hi
well in your calculate how complicated
it is to explain a behavior and you know
the example you use well you could put
that the person with the you know trying
to figure it up the thing in the hand
was a gun could be a you know obviously
a police officer I mean it could be
anybody in that situation and a lot of
neuroscience has been brought into the
courtroom I mean for that American
brought into the classroom to to try to
you know use a brain scan to explain
something but I wondered and in
particular in the courtroom how do you
say where do you see that hit you know
where people are bringing brain scans
and says well the brain you know my
brain made me do it rather than me or
whatever I'm a great question insanely
contentious field
there's some very scary smart people
I've had to argue with the times sort of
taking the viewpoints that Neurosciences
know we're ready for prime time yet for
its appearance in courts just to give
you a sense of where neuroscience plays
a role in the American criminal justice
system the gold standard for deciding
that somebody who's committed a crime is
so organically impaired that they can't
be held responsible for their acts is if
they basically cannot tell the
difference between right and wrong which
is usually a way of describing extreme
sort of schizophrenic psychosis this is
something called the McNaughton rule and
was based on an individual almost
certainly a paranoid schizophrenic who
delusionally hearing voices attempted to
assassinate the Prime Minister of
England in 1840 that's a legal standard
in the United States based on
neuroscience from 1840 I mean I don't
think horses you to even evolved brains
at that point and that's the basis by
which the legal system works the area
that the legal system in the United
States has incorporated exactly zero
neuroscience is the realm of volitional
impairment
the realm of people who do know the
difference between right and wrong who
nonetheless cannot regulate their
behavior where is that that's when you
see damage to the frontal cortex and you
get somebody there who can tell you
absolutely which is the appropriate
thing to switch for you can reach with
5mm s but you only get one as a reward
or if you reach for 1mm you get five as
a reward and they will say yeah I know
how it works I need to reach for the one
because then I get much more eminent and
they go for the wrong one at the last
instant when you have frontal damage you
pass the McNaughton test you know the
difference between right and wrong and
nonetheless you cannot regulate their
behavior there is no state in this
country that regularly accepts
volitional impairment defenses in an
Criminal Court - horrifying statistics
that are pertinent to that 25% of the
men on death row in this country have a
history of concussive head trauma to
their frontal cortex other horrifying
factoid by the time you are five years
old
the
Oh economic status of your parents is a
predictor of the levels of stress
hormones in your bloodstream what do you
know what goes in the direction of the
poorer you are the more stress hormones
and the more stress hormones the less
frontal maturation by kindergarten your
SES by kindergarten if you were foolish
enough to have picked the wrong family
to have been born into that is already
going to impact the metabolism of your
frontal cortex the thickness of it the
number of connections being made there
by age five you were already three steps
behind in terms of from for regulation
behavior because of SES differences in
this country so in that realm the
consequences I think are enormous and
hugely underappreciated I'll try not to
kill eight my question it has to do with
the role of testosterone and then maybe
they and maybe some consequences of it
and what we can do about it so if if if
it's not related to aggression but it's
related to the an increased reward for
status where does it act in the brain
does it act in the brain and then given
that so many kids may suffer especially
these days with impacts in the brain
that might affect their aggression as
adults they have some that you given the
violence in the world today would a
pharmaceutical route be at all suggested
before they get before any kind of
cognitive training because it's a you
know the drug industry will latch on to
anything but I feel like that's
something they haven't done I don't I
don't think that's a long-term solution
either great ok which part of the brain
has the most receptors for testosterone
the most sensitivity to it makes total
sense the amygdala the amygdala is
ground zero for sensitivity to
testosterone does testosterone cause
amygdala neurons to fire to in effect
invent aggressive outputs not at all if
and only if the neurons are already
firing testosterone makes them fire
faster testosterone does not turn on the
martial music it ups the volume if it's
already been turned on now in terms of
okay so let's make the world a much
better place here how about
we get rid of all those mails okay maybe
not that okay so at least let's castrate
and well now that's not very well what
about okay how about if we
pharmacologically block some the effects
of testosterone and what you see there
besides it being mighty scary is a track
record of not working very well in a
number of places on earth the two places
where it is most been explored is big
surprise India and the state of Texas
there have been state ordered chemical
castration z' drugs which are given
which block testosterone receptors which
is in effect the equivalent of removing
testosterone from the scene usually for
intractable violent sexual offenders and
what the legislate and what the
literature shows is essentially it has
no effect whatsoever because such
aggression has very little to do with
aggression that has very little to do
with sexuality it has a whole lot to do
with domination and fear and issues like
that pertinent to that you take any male
on earth of any known species and take
out his testes and that almost certainly
was the first experiment ever done in
endocrinology about 10,000 years ago
when like some bull chased some people
around the backyard one time too many
and they wrestled him down and got rid
of the testes and suddenly he was a much
more tractable male if you castrate a
male of any species out there on the
average levels of aggression go down
they never go down to zero though and
the critical thing is the more
experienced that male had being
aggressive
prior to castration the more it's going
to stay there afterward in other words
the more experience you have with
aggression the less it is dependent on
hormones and the more it is a function
of social learning so that unfortunately
or otherwise is not much of a panacea
there see final question final question
hopefully a more optimistic more
optimistic note so you mentioned the
chronicity of the amygdala enlarging
with chronic stress and there are things
perhaps that we could do for people who
have experienced chronic stress I'm
thinking of people who have been on
multiple tours overseas and have done
to be exposed to horrendous things and
do horrendous things so now that we're
having people do that more often they're
coming back and then ending their lives
and I'm wondering I know people have
tried meditation maybe yoga might work
but are there ways that even with the
example of testosterone and really the
amygdala that the role of the amygdala
and in invoking aggression are there
ways that we can reduce the size of the
aggression or the size of the amygdala
yep the realm where that's been most
studied is with PTSD combat trauma PTSD
and sexual violence PTSD where you see
with the PTSD there you get expansion of
the amygdala it becomes hyper reactive
it is over generalized into it being a
terrifying world out there my lab for a
while was doing some gene therapy work
on trying to protect the amygdala from
stress hormones in ways that like as a
circus trick was kind of useful but it's
not going to help a mammal anytime in
the next century or so my sense from
sort of the clinicians I've spent my
time around is that PTSD is not really
anything that's ever cured people learn
how to manage it how to contain it there
is no clear biological cure for it but
something fascinating and horrifying has
emerged in the literature in recent
years what is PTSD about it's obvious to
anyone have its fear its terror it's the
trauma of people trying to kill you of
watching your buddies killed around you
left and right it's it is anchored in
fear and the fear of the violence that
may harm you and those who you love but
the whole field has had to accommodate
an extraordinary finding in recent years
which is drone operators get PTSD they
get PTSD at the same rate as do warriors
out in the battlefield drone operators
sitting there living in some suburb of
Edwards Air Force Base somewhere out
there who get up in the morning and
remember to drop off the clothing at the
cleaners and get into traffic jams and
barely make it to work on time and then
sit in a simulator there for eight hours
blowing up people
on the other side of the planet and then
rush out at the end of the day to watch
their little girl in a ballet concert
and then go back to killing on the other
side of the globe the next day these
people have PTSD at the same rate as do
the actual soldiers and that is
completely challenged the notion of what
it's about it's not the fact that there
is nothing more abnormal and terrifying
to us than the notion of somebody
violently killing us that rather it's
the utterly bizarre and abnormal notion
of us killing someone else and that's
causing an enormous rethinking as to
what PTSD is about and lurking in there
is a little bit of optimism a man named
David Grossman who was a colonel in the
US military wrote a very influential
book called on killing analyzed the
history of the extraordinary percentage
of people throughout Wars in the middle
of battle where their lives were on the
line at any given second who nonetheless
never fired their guns that there is an
enormous inhibition against doing that
after the Battle of Gettysburg there was
something like fourteen thousand rifles
left next to the dead in the field there
that were collected the majority of them
had not been fired the majority of them
had been loaded repeatedly I'm just
about to shoot I better low I better
load again I better load again enormous
inhibitions against that and he argues
that somewhere in there is the greatest
bit of optimism asking people to kill
somebody faceless on the other side of
the planet that's easy
asking them to kill somebody whose eyes
they see from 10 feet away hand to hand
there's historically an enormous
inhibition against that that's some room
for optimism there nonetheless in the
context of the US military now trains
more drone pilots than actual pilots oh
well remember what I was saying before
about castrating males or oh I don't
know just hold our breaths and try not
to fall into too much despair I don't
know I spend my time on the college
campus and I keep perhaps delusionally
trying to like console myself that this
is gonna like generate a whole new
generation of active
some like if it produces 10 times the
activism that say the 60s did it's still
gonna be an uphill battle to undo the
damage that's gonna be done in these
next four years I suspect so I don't
know I don't have a whole lot of grounds
for not being despairing in these times
and you guys get to live here and watch
this day by day I at least get to live
out in la-la land out in California and
sort of ignore it when we want to okay
