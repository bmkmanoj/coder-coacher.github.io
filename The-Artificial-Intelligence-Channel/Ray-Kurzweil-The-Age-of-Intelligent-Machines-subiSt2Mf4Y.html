the sounds of the future I'm Ray
Kurzweil I recently visited Stevie and a
number of other innovators who live and
work in the age of intelligent machines
okay here I am with my new synthesizer
and this is great all these different
keys and all these buttons etcetera this
is incredible
but here I have this visual display now
just imagine if you are not here how I
know what it says be lost but because of
the technology because of the
interfacing of speech synthesizers with
these instruments I can push the button
know what it's saying by listening to
it's a hit record button to start and
stop record sequencer activated record
low sequence
Oh
machines are talked up machines that
play music
machines that capture the flexibility of
human movement
machines that learn
you
these are among the projects and new
ideas on the frontiers of artificial
intelligence
the science and the art of creating
intelligent machines
you
machines are capable of almost anything
in principle and the reason for that is
very simple machine at Yale University
Professor Roger shank the thing that we
want to do when we think about
artificial intelligence is we want to
think about how the daily processes or
our lives actually are composed in terms
of individual steps for example how do I
go about composing the sentence I'm
saying now how do you go about
understanding it
we don't really know offhand but what
the science of artificial intelligence
is about is trying to figure out each
step ok let's put on the microphone the
real problem is not can machines think
but can people think well enough about
how people think to be able to describe
how they think two machines Stephan
Michael outski a research scientist
helps Robert Yi a quadriplegic test a
new artificial intelligence system I
just got involved in this project three
days ago
I've been handicapped approximately two
years I fell down some stairs concrete
stairs walk an injured mine own three or
a few things I've been working on this
project to develop a robotic aid for
disabled people for the last four years
our final goal is to develop a practical
device that a disabled person could use
every day
in their everyday life to perform early
simple manipulations in a home-like
environment things like getting a drink
of water or getting something to eat
opening the door answering the phone
things like that
it looks the vehicle over to the left
now left this is the first time any
handicapped person has ever worked on
this Veterans Administration research
project at Stanford University it is a
system in which a mobile robot is
learning to obey spoken commands stop
moving at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology Professor Marvin Minsky well
what's happened in research in
artificial intelligence is rather
surprising I think many of the problems
that we thought would be very difficult
30 years ago turned out to be very
simple and many of the problems that we
thought would be very simple came out to
be very difficult so this is I think one
of the most difficult Sciences that
people have ever attempted the science
of intelligent processes the science of
complicated processes some of us tried
to get machines to solve what we thought
were very hard problems through
mathematics play chess solve puzzles and
it was quite easy to get a machine to
play a pretty good game of chess
took only couple of years to get a
machine to play master level chess took
only another 10 or 20 years no machine
has been world champion of chess but
there's a machine that was world
champion of backgammon if anyone cares
and those things weren't so hard to do
so many of the things that people
respect highly turned out to be easy and
yet simple things the kind of thing that
a child does when it tries it true laces
that's far beyond anything we can do now
not just making mechanical hands that
could handle the strings but
understanding how loops and not work and
understanding how the loops contain each
other and what holds it not together is
a very complicated problem I don't say
that a child understands that explicitly
but it has some idea about it a very
young child can distinguish between
house pets it knows the difference
between a cat and a dog but this is
something an intelligent machine still
cannot do teaching a machine to
recognize different
depends upon a computer science
technique called pattern recognition
machines have been taught to recognize
the unique characteristics of each
letter in the capital letter A for
example the angle at the top enclosed
space a crossbar and a concave region at
the bottom of four such features
machines can now read the alphabet as
readily as any person building on this
ability to recognize letters reading
machines for the blind can now read
those letters aloud as words sentences
books now with technology I can do
things that I've always wanted to do
immediately like reading this book spoke
it's called blues medalta I can just
simply pick it and this machine turn the
machine on
scanner moving to the top of page
looking for the first line a no matter
how verso the parameter could never
match the sound of blue pens which
featured several guitars harmonica drums
together everyone wants to feel as if
they can be as independent as possible
I'd be one really wants to have the
freedom of doing reading discovering
things on their own the latest blow
soldiers so expect their repper
technology for me is has been like a
brother
mother affirmed it has been that very
thing that I have not been able to do
this helped me to do that is to see
without question it is been another
another one of those sunshine of my life
instead of the machine talking to us
let's see what happens when we talk to a
machine each word spoken makes a
different pattern thunderstorm
thunderstorm a child can understand
those words machines are just beginning
to hear again pattern recognition is the
starting point intelligent machines now
use pattern new line recognition and
expert systems to recognize whatever a
person dictates in ordinary language
period counter clockwise
lest the Palo Alto experiment combines
pattern recognition with other facets of
artificial intelligence mechanically the
system is actually rather simple it's
just years and motors but the tricky
thing is the computer control of the
robot there are sensors on the robot or
there is the coordination of the motions
of the six joints of the arm and they
three wheels of the vehicle and then
there is the whole issue of how do you
interpret the users commands to get the
robot to move in the correct way start
over we're very big on speech for a
device like this not just because we're
dealing with a disabled user and speech
is the obvious input mode for that but
just because speech is so expressive in
most general terms you can convey an
enormous amount of information with just
two or three words and close
very good what remains to be done is to
devise a good natural language interface
to the robot the human user has to be
able to talk to the robot in normal
English you have to be able to say
things like go into the kitchen open the
door to the refrigerator and get me the
bottle that's on the third shelf from
the top
what is the ultimate goal of this
project the robot has to tell the person
what it's doing to in fact the robot
should be able to respond to questions
like what are you doing or why are you
going into the kitchen or why haven't
you brought me why haven't you done what
I told you
why don't you got myself why did you
drop my sandwich where is my sandwich
the computer understands the words right
now but it it doesn't understand the
sentences and that's the next step but
it's a big step so it turns out that
getting food from a kitchen requires a
lot of knowledge we take for granted in
computer terms its knowledge about a
particular domain teaching a machine
everything there is to know about a
kitchen or any other special area of
human knowledge is another part of
artificial intelligence a methodology
called expert systems at Stanford
University professor Eadie
Feigenbaum to discover and work on these
basic problems in artificial
intelligence we have developed a
particular kind of methodology that
methodology calls for working on
difficult applications problems
primarily drawn from the sciences and
engineering and for medicine we do this
because we feel that the best way to
find a new idea and to test an old idea
is to throw our ideas against the hard
wall and see where those ideas break
by visualizing different molecular
structures one expert system enables
biologists at the University of
California Medical School to actually
see molecules that have not yet been
created simulating biochemistry in the
computer scientists are learning some of
the properties of new forms of life at
the University of Pittsburgh Medical
School an expert system is being
developed to help doctors diagnose the
patient's problems more quickly and with
greater scientific accuracy the system
helps the doctor ask the right questions
and zero in on the right diagnosis a
study of a similar system found that
within at least one medical specialty
the expert system was as accurate as
human doctors expert systems can help
heal the sick they can also help wage
war military analysts predicted by the
1990s artificial intelligence technology
will be of greater strategic importance
than geography or manpower artificial
intelligence can also help commercial
aviation suppose you're flying 40,000
feet over Yosemite National Park an
expert system developed at SR I in
California makes it possible for the
pilot to see what it would be like to
fly through the mountain pass
a variation of this system helps
architects and city planners figure out
the consequences of putting up new
buildings and their impact on the
surrounding area inside some of those
buildings will be the offices of the
future with artificial Wang laboratories
president red Wang surfaced at raw data
let me show you what we can do today
with artificial intelligence technology
show me in office I think physically the
offices aren't going to change very much
but what we do in an office and how well
we communicate to other people can
radically change I think with artificial
intelligence computers will be better
able to really handle all the nuances of
communications of being able to make
sure that people know where the
information is know where the people
that they're connecting to our pie chart
I think the big thing to remember though
is that artificial intelligence is going
to play a role in making all of us more
productive it's not going to be
replacing people but it's going to be
able to really help us work better at
the knowledge bases that we have imagine
a museum with thousands of paintings and
a scholar who wants to see particular
works of art that are not on display
using ordinary English the skull of the
scribes - the expert system the style
and content of the works being studied
here with a system called focus vision
which scholar locates the specific
paintings in minutes instead of taking
hours or days newspapers expand our base
of knowledge every day an expert system
called dummy has been developed to help
layout each page more quickly and
accurately heidi cogman rather than
telling the program and writing a
program and saying specifically this is
what you need to do what you do in our
dummy program is say this is what I want
you to accomplish you figure out how to
do it that's how it works that's what
our official intelligence does and
that's what we can see in this program
we want to get smarter as we gather
information so the problem of learning
is really important today I because you
can't expect that these machines are
going to have a lot of knowledge that
the way they're going to get that
knowledge is by spoon feeding we can't
expect that what you're going to do is
teach a machine every detail about the
entire world by typing it in it's got to
grow in a normal way the way people do
it's got to gather experiences come to
its own conclusions organize its memory
according to its particular experiences
as Yale University Roger shank helped
develop an expert system called chef
what chef is is a program which attempts
to simulate a great Chinese cook an
example of that is chef who's been told
find me a dish with beef and broccoli
and it doesn't have any dishes with beef
and broccoli so it looks for what else
it has the problem is that when it finds
a beef and green beans for example green
beans and broccoli actually have
different properties and when yin
broccoli has turned out to be much too
soggy given the amount of cooking time
the program restores that and remembers
this particular failure so the next time
it comes in to this kind of situation
where it has to do that kind of
substitution it won't be so stupid as
eating broccoli so what it's doing is
it's learning to reason about its domain
based upon its past experiences in other
words it's getting smarter on the basis
of experience which is very much a very
important thing for computer programs to
differ
I think the world will change a lot as a
result of what artificial intelligence
can bring to it smart computers that
certainly make our lives a lot happier
and a computer chef would make me happy
I don't know about anybody else
I write programs programs make drawings
drawings made completely by the computer
this isn't the case of computer aided
all thinking Harold Cohen has been an
artist and computer scientist for over
20 years I talked with him in his studio
in San Diego on the University of
California campus where he has developed
his own expert system to create original
art
the computer being creative I think
creativity is a relative term clearly
the machine is being creative the
program is being creative to the degree
that every time it does a drawing it
doesn't draw nobody's ever seen before
including me I don't think it's
currently as creative as I am in writing
the program I think for a program to be
fully creative in a more complete sense
creative it has to be able to modify its
own performance and that's a very
different problem the computer creates
original art based on rules that Harold
Cohen programs rules that enable the
computer to draw a variety of pictures
that are different each time they are
drawn the pictures can be abstract art
or a composition with figures that
represent natural objects and people
I surprised you that a set of even a
thousand made rules can then create
really fine art yes it really does I
sometimes find myself looking at one of
the drawings and thinking come on who
are you kidding
Yuliya computer did that during good
health but someday when you have gone
this computer can keep creating original
drawings yeah I've always I've always
said that I'll be the first artist in
history who could have a posthumous
exhibition of new work so from works of
art to the factories of the future
expert systems are becoming a regular
part of decision making we once thought
should only be handled by people imagine
thousands of computer parts and hundreds
of thousands of different ways of
putting them together to build just the
right computer a digital equipment
corporation the largest expert system in
the world called ex-con is used to
configure almost every computer the
company makes guided by over ten
thousand rules it plans the assembly
process calling problems to the
attention of the technician it would
take several hundred people to do the
job now done by ex-con
in Milwaukee Wisconsin the allen-bradley
factory one virtually without employees
uses expert systems to handle the
complete manufacturing cycle
the control room processes orders from
customers around the world the factory's
basic product is an electrical device
which can be assembled in about 650
different forms
the factory automatically follows
production of each unit through the
entire process it once would have taken
200 workers to do all this now it's done
by a handful of managers and technicians
and a lot of artificial intelligence
the flying shuttle a machine invented
250 years ago this innovation in the
weaving of cloth signaled the launching
of the first Industrial Revolution it
was a revolution that vastly enlarged
our physical and productive capabilities
it brought with it profound changes in
the way we live and the way we worked
while jobs were lost many new industries
were formed and the total number of all
kinds of workers increased
put your finger under the letter now
mankind is on the threshold of the
Second Industrial Revolution a
revolution which expands our mental
capabilities the number and quality of
job opportunities can continue to
increase if and only if our educational
institutions and training programs can
keep pace to the growing demand for
technological advances a chairman of the
Xerox Corporation David Kearns well the
statistics are almost overwhelming
we have 700,000 dropouts a year but
almost worse than that there are 700,000
kids who graduate each year that are
illiterate but we think that artificial
intelligence can be a major factor in in
doing research and learning and then
actually be a major tool for people in
the learning process as researchers
explore new ways that artificial
intelligence can be used they are also
developing ideas about how the human
brain works Marvin Minsky well I have my
own theory of how thinking works and
this the theory is called the society of
mind and in this theory the idea that
there are a lot of little parts of your
brain each of them is a specialist in
something one is good at walking one is
good at being hungry one is good at
recognizing objects and each of these
different machines in your head has a
different skill it doesn't know how the
other ones work so we call this the
Society of mind a lot of little
specialists they each know very little
about the others but they learn how to
exploit the others each one learns a
trick to learn how to use another one
for its purposes all of this is going on
at once there may be hundreds or
thousands of these little I call them
agencies and so in order to study this
theory and test acquis needed a machine
which could keep track of thousands of
little processes perhaps it'll take
millions
that led to this collection machine the
machine has 65,000 computers connected
to each other in complex and changing
patterns much like neurons in our brain
500 million computer operations take
place in half a second
and harnessing this awesome
computational ability scientists can now
begin to solve some of those basic
problems they once thought were so easy
recreating with robots the kinds of
movements and visual perception a person
can accomplish at Carnegie Mellon
University professor Rajesh Reddy
here we are embarking and endeavor which
is more complicated than putting the man
on the moon and a wide range of other
scientific achievement and there are not
enough people working in the field in
1970 perhaps they may have been a few
hundred in 1985-86 perhaps there are a
few thousand but in order to really
solve all the complicated problems that
will arise around in this field we'll
probably need a few hundred thousand or
even a million scientists and
professionals working on a million of
tasks to achieve the kind of
intelligence that we expect out of r2d2
or c-3po type of robot
at some point when machines achieve the
capabilities we have there's no reason
they should stop at that anymore than
there's any reason that human evolution
should stop if people keep working on
intelligent machines
I think the machines will also have been
made to evolve far beyond what we can
imagine now and how we'll adapt to that
no one can say
upward right now I have to have a person
around Lord just to scratch my nose
backward to being able to bring the cup
to my lips made me realize one of the
potentials of a machine being able to
make me independent of other people to
realize Robert Yi's future and our
future what we need is knowledge and
this silicon the raw material of the age
of intelligent machines
it is an age that offers unprecedented
hope and unprecedented power it will
take a large measure of human
intelligence to use this new power
constructively and creatively
you
