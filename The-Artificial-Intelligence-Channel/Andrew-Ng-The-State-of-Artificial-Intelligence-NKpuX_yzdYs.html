tend to like going to conferences we're
gonna hang out and learn something
interesting so that's that's one of the
reasons I was look forward to coming
here um thinking let's start preparing
for this presentation I spent some time
thinking about what I thought might be
most useful to all of you for me to say
today and what I thought I'd do is say a
little bit about trends in AI why it's
taking off and then share a bit about
how AI might affect your businesses and
then close off with some advice for how
you can build your businesses in the
context of this rising category of
technology so some of you might say but
might have heard me say before this
phrase that AI is the new electricity
and what I mean by that is about 100
years ago we didn't have widespread
access to electricity here in the United
States but will the rise of electricity
that transformed every major industry
agriculture was transformed through the
rise of refrigeration Communications was
transformed through the Telegraph
manufacturing was transformed through
the electric motor healthcare was
transformed but today all of these
industries you have a hard time
imagining how to run these things
without electricity I think that AI
technology especially deep learning as a
small saying has now advanced the point
where we see a surprisingly clear path
for it to also transform every major
industry now despite all the hype about
AI and you know there is a lot of hype
it turns out that 99% of the economic
value created by AI today is through one
type of AI which is learning a to be or
input to output mappings for example
it's getting really good at inputting a
picture and outputting is it you you
know zero one and this is why we're
starting to have cell phones and other
devices and overseas even those that
unlock just using your face you know
something I used to work on AI the
inputs a loan application that's a and
outputs you know world world the
applicants repay the loan and it turns
out if you can figure this out this this
is
decent business in terms of figuring out
whether or not to approve someone's loan
application possibly the most lucrative
application of this today is online
advertising if you look at all the large
online web serving platform in the
Google Facebook Baidu Twitter and so on
almost all all the launch ad platforms
have a piece of air technology that
takes as input and ad and some
information about you about the user and
tries to output you know what you click
what the user click on this ad because
for the online ad advertising platforms
every click is money and so there is a
very large incentive to try to show you
an ad that you have a 5% chance of
clicking on rather than only a 4.5%
chance so maybe I don't know maybe not
the most inspiring but but certainly an
extremely lucrative application of AI
let's see speech recognition has been
working really well both Google and
Baidu have said publicly that over 10
percent of the searches on mobile
devices now come through voice search so
this large volume revenue and the reason
users are willing to accept voice input
is because beef recognition is finally
accurate enough for you to speak to your
cell phone and have a trance tracked
that pretty accurately so that's enabled
by phone via the inputs in audio clip
and I'll put the text transcript you
know machine translation input in
English sentence up for the french
sentence and self-driving cars I guess I
really don't the border from
self-driving car company drive down AI
and key components of every self-driving
car every modern self-driving car is the
input some information about what's
around you like a picture taken of
what's in front of your car and maybe
radar readings or lidar readings and
output positions of other cause right
and so and and and so this is and what
this learning a to be mapping is in a
technical term for this is supervised
learning when this idea of learning a to
be mappings is fit into the appropriate
this context this turns out to be
incredibly valuable
now one questions I've often been asked
is um you know what can they are really
do or you read about so much exciting
things in the in the news media there's
one rule of thumb that I've given to a
lot of product managers I think has been
helpful which is you know anything a
typical person can do with less than a
second of thinking we can probably now
assume automate so if you look a lot of
the examples I had on the previous lists
many of them such as look at the picture
and figure out is this a picture of you
many of those are tasks that a human can
do in less than one second and this is
an imperfect rule but this does not
perfectly cover by any means you do both
but has both false positives and false
negatives there's not a perfect group
but this is an example of a rule that
I've given to product managers before in
large organizations and this results in
in product managers running around
trying to find things that they could do
in less than a second to automate that
that was actually pretty valuable now
and and of course this is also a far cry
from the evil killer robots right now
one impacted is on the nature of jobs I
know mtech has been spent a long time
looking at the future of work as well is
that turns out that a lot of people
whose jobs are a sequence of one second
time strung together for example a
security guard watching a security video
yeah well what is their job they look at
the video figure out where the people
that's a one-second toss figure out
where the people standing that takes a
second figure out where the hits the
faces of these people that's the second
figure of any of these people that you
see are unknown you know bad guy like a
known shoplifter this in a second and so
there are jobs that are at significant
risk of automation because these jobs
are a sequence of one seconds house that
we string together and so I think to the
extent that those of us in check are
causing some of these on job
displacement problem
I think I think we have a responsibility
to help address these issues as well how
can can talk more about that later you
said now we'll mentioned the rise of
deep learning the rise of neural
networks driving a lot of the recent
excitement in AI so the basic ideas of
deep learning have been around for many
decades they've been recently but been
taking off only fairly recently so why
is that um if you remember maybe just
one thing from this talk remember
actually if you remember just two things
from this talk remember this picture if
you're not just one thing I think
there's something else out I'll say
later but why are new networks and deep
learning taking off just now this is a
picture that might try to explain it
which is if on the x axis I plot the
amount of data you have at all you have
for a task and on the y axis I plot the
performance and then what happened with
the digitization of society over the
last 20 years is for many vertical
industries we start to collect more and
more data and then because our
smartphones computers digital activities
generate data and also your health
record is more likely if 10 years ago
would have been a physical piece of
x-ray film today is more likely with
digital image the state of supply chains
used to be pieces of paper in filing
cabinets all over the globe that's now
much more likely to be stored in a
computer so the digitization of society
has caused us to move to the right on
this axis on a lot of industries but
what happened was for the traditional AI
algorithms really traditional learning
algorithms and for those of you that are
technical I mean things like support
vector machines logistic regression the
more traditional AI algorithms performed
like that it was as if even as you feed
it more data it didn't know what to do
with all the data we now have and what
happens starting maybe three four years
ago was we found that if we train a
small neural net going to use n n to
abbreviate neural network its
performance looks like that if we train
a medium-sized neural net a performance
of Steven better and if we train a very
large
neural net is performance kind of seems
to keep going up and so this means two
things first if what this means that if
you want the best levels of performance
you want to hit that level of
performance it means two things first it
really helps if you have a lot of data
if you're far to the right of this axis
and second really helps if you're able
to train a very large neural network so
um there has been a lot of algorithm
innovation in fact you you hear from I
should say I think Ian Goodfellow later
one of the TR 35 awardees that's been
driving some of the algorithmic
innovation as well but just merely
having computers fast enough the rise of
GPU computing to Train very large neural
networks as well as the availability of
huge data says I think have been two of
the biggest drivers of this some recent
rise in deep learning now it turns out
there's a lot of that there are also a
lot of different algorithms being
explored and I wanted to share view my
own perspective in terms of what's
really most valuable today right so I
talked about supervised learning which
is um learning this A to B mapping and
it turns out you know some of these will
just be buzzwords but don't worry if
they don't then turns out that other
types of machine learning you hear about
in the news for example transfer
learning is you learn from one problem
such as learn to recognize cats and dogs
and people and pedestrians normal
terrestrial objects and they use what
you've learned there to try to beat
x-ray radiology images because you have
a lot of data of cats and dogs and
people and pedestrians but much less
data of x-ray radiology images so that's
called transfer learning unsupervised
learning when I was leading the Google
brain project many years ago you know we
had a a I watch YouTube and they figured
out by itself that there was there were
cats there a lot of figured out this
concept of a cat by itself but learning
to figure things out by itself without
needing a lot of label data and then
there's also reinforcement learning
which is what was used in parts for
alphago as well as playing video games
it turns out that if you look at was
actually driving economic value today
there's a rapid fall off as you go down
this list in terms of the economic value
created today it turns out for example I
think reinforcement learning is one
class of technology where the PR
excitement is vastly disproportional
relative to you know the the actual
deployments today turns out that
supervised learning has a huge hunger
for data reinforcement learning has an
even greater hunger for data so it turns
out to be great for playing video games
because we're playing video games you
can play an infinite number of video
games in the computer or for certain
robotics applications this works very
well as well because you can build a
simulator for a robot and basically have
a robot play a video game of itself but
for but but but outside of that I think
it's the ways away from large-scale
deployment from from widespread
deployments having said that one of the
great things about tech is an drawl
dustless today and two years from now
you know what they're Vance's in
research maybe the ordering of this will
totally change but this is how I
interpret the D literature today um now
the rkvc you of course of supervised
learning right is that there requires a
lot of data in particular supervised
learning requires a lot of data with
both the input and the output B so for
sweet recognition a was the audio clip
and B was the text transcript so today
leading speech recognition systems are
built using north of you know 50,000
hours there's about five years of audio
data which is very expensive a very
difficult asset to collect raise you
have fifty thousand dollars of data
together with transcripts for all five
years of continuous order all fifty
thousand hours of data despite that it
so so what we're seeing with the rise of
AI era is a shift in corporate strategy
as well where it turns out that today
algorithms AI algorithms from a company
point of view are for the most part not
defensible there's so much open-source
you know where it gets out quite quickly
it's not that hard for most
organizations to figure out what
algorithms other other organizations are
doing maybe it's a concrete example so
you know I've had the privilege
leading AI groups at both Google and
Baidu and so today of a pretty good
sense of how web search technology works
but the leading web search companies
have a data asset that tells them that
if you search for United if you do
something United States you probably won
United Airlines if you are doing this
from the UK I guess Elizabeth or UK
you've heard you you more likely at one
Manchester United right the football
team so that data asset allows the
leading web search engines Google by the
Y and X being and so on to provide to
you much more relevant results because
there's a long tail in terms of what
users search for so even though today I
have a pretty good sense of how web
search technology works I honestly have
no idea how to build a small team to
build a competitive you know like a
nearly decent web search engine without
access to that data asset so in this is
one example where that data asset even
more than the specific algorithms are I
think very make mix a web search
business and incredibly defensible
having said that there is also maybe a
little bit of excessive PR about the
importance of data because for new
vertical categories so new applications
maybe a new product idea that you have
it is often possible for you to get
started even with a modest amount of
data so when I plan out and launch new
products I often plan out this type of
virtuous circle so you often see if
you're launching a new product you know
get a little bit of data that allows you
to launch a product having a product
allows you to acquire some users having
users increases the amount of data you
have and this results in a positive
feedback loop so they're after a period
of time you might have an update to
yourself have a have a defensible
business I mean one good example some
sample since I knew recently so the
company called Blue River to John Deere
for about three hundred million dollars
so I knew them when they were Santa
stood they were actually taking my cost
when they were Stanford students um and
and so they have built these big rigs
they go up and down fields agricultural
fuels and takes pictures of lettuce and
makes you know life in
decisions about which head of lettuce
shall live and which had a medicine
shall die so so when they were student
as a Stanford I saw them they were going
out to these views and using the cameras
and just taking a bunch of pictures of
you know these heads of lettuce in the
field and this allowed them to build a
data acid there was you know not huge
but but but they took enough pictures to
build a product that was good enough for
farmers to start to accept it and then
they started rolling these things up in
down fields taking pictures of all these
fields of cabbage and getting more data
and then having more users allowed
inject more data and so on and I hadn't
spoken of them recently but after their
having done this for a few years I would
not be surprised if today they have the
biggest data acid in the world of
pictures of heads of lettuce kind of
heart buried in the dirt and this aji
makes their business in my opinion
pretty defensible because even even the
giant tech companies the global giant
tech companies as far as I know do not
have disparate data assets so and this
actually makes their their business
difficult even for the very large tech
companies to to you know at least
challenging for them to enter so this is
one example the data accumulation
there's one example of how I think
corporate strategy is changing in the AI
error and in the deep learning error now
the last thing I wanna share of you is
is this and all right if you remember
just one thing from this talk yeah maybe
this is the thing I hope you remember
which is that there was a lesson I
learned you know studying or looking at
the rise of the internet doesn't want
and I want to share that lesson with you
because I think they'll be useful for
many of you as your organization's
navigate the rise of AI as well one of
the lessons I learned with the rise of
the Internet era was on if you take your
favorite shopping mall actually think of
it favorite shopping mall right you know
III live in Palo Alto my web I live in I
live near power also my wife likes
Stanford Shopping Center right but think
of your favorite shopping mall
uh-huh yeah well it's a student MIT we
used to drive north to the cheap outlet
mall favorite shopping mall let's say we
built a website for your favorite
shopping mall and let's see the shopping
mode even starts to sell stuff on the
website right that does not turn the
shopping mall into an Internet company
right so what defines the internet
company if it's not whether or not you
have a website that sells stuff you know
about five years ago I was talking to I
know I was talking to one of the CEOs of
the large retailers in the US and about
five years ago his CIO was saying to him
look we have a website and we sell stuff
on the website Amazon has a website
Amazon sells several website it's the
same thing but of course it's not the
same thing and you know today they're
there they're definitely struggling and
they knew with the onslaught from Amazon
so what is it that defines run on out
you're truly an Internet company like
Amazon versus you know a retailer that
just happens to have a website to me
what defines the Internet company is
whether or not you have architect at
your organization to leverage internet
capabilities to do the things that
internet that you do really well for
example Internet companies engage in
pervasive a be testing because you can
on the internet and if you don't your
competitors will and they'll learn
faster than you internet company is
sensor very short cycle times right we
are used to shipping a product every day
or maybe shipping a product every week
because we can on the internet whereas a
traditional retailer you know my
redesign their stores every six months
and so Internet company is a question
and have to push decision making down
from the CEO to the engineers and
product managers because the internet
products and uses is so complicated a
lot of knowledge about what needs to be
done lives only in the heads of the
engineers and product managers and so
you know in the traditional retailer may
be a CEO can make all the decisions and
then everyone just does what the CEO
says but Internet companies only the
engineers in the browser managers know a
lot of the best decisions you
have to push decision-making power down
to them up and actually have the
influence by some actually some of Jeff
Bezos is thinking speaking on some of
these but to me these are the things I
truly define an Internet company not
whether or not you run a website so this
was with what happened with the rise of
the Internet era how about the rise of
the AI era I think that if you take a
traditional tech company and add a bunch
of neural networks to it add a bunch of
deep learning or machine learning or
neural networks to it that does not make
it an AI company and I think that today
no one has fully figured out what it
means to be a truly AI company I am
biased because I worked at Google and
Baidu I think we're going by do I truly
phenomenal and among the four most
thought leaders in figuring out what it
really means to be a to be a truly AI
company I don't think any of us fully
know what this is yet
just as maybe twenty years ago you know
we didn't really know 20 years ago that
a be testing was would be such a big
thing I think we're still freaking out
one of these things but these are these
are some things that I think might turn
out to be true one is on strategic data
acquisition
for example I well I drew that positive
feedback loop when I decide what I want
to launch a project one of the criteria
I use is can we plan a path for data
acquisition that results in the
defensible business and so and there may
be another example I've done things like
launch a product on a geography in China
different regions speak slightly
different regional dialects so I've done
things like launch of product and wine
geography use that you know to get data
to attack the neighboring geography use
that to get Daisy but at neighboring
geography but we don't make money from
any of this we take all this data and
monetize it somewhere totally different
and so the leaving AI organizations are
starting to think through these frankly
so that Multi multi year chess games
require the data asset that allows you
to build a defensible business and this
data acquisition strategy really
complicated here's one you can go home
and implement AI organizations tend to
build unified data warehouses and if
you're a big company and you have 50
databases you know under the control of
50 different vice-presidents then it'll
be impossible if an engineer needs to
combine data from multiple data silos to
create value and if they need to get
approval from 50 different Veit from 50
different vice-presidents it's just not
gonna happen right so for example a
bunch of you travel to Boston today it
based on your web search we know what
type of food you like and based on your
GPS we know you're in Boston well that
could be put together to recommend any
restaurants you for tonight so the only
way for those things to happen either
for the engineer or for the software to
look at the data is if it's in the
unified data warehouse which which which
cyclically increases the odds of your
teams we've connected on so this is one
do then this is often a multi-year
exercise to completely implement that
but um and then I think what internet
companies tend to be very good at
spotting pervasive automation
opportunities
and and and also you know new job
descriptions right I feel like our
traditional job descriptions for how we
build teams and have them work together
breaking down a little bit and maybe
I'll just give one example of job
descriptions that I think are changing
so in the Internet era we have you know
product managers right that if you are
designing a new web app or a mobile app
a standard part of the workflow for
designing they'll say a mobile app is
for them to draw a wireframe right and
and a wireframe is basically a picture
I'm showing you you know to tell the
engineer what the app should look like
so oh no for the Facebook app you know
maybe there's a logo the table put your
friends faces there right have a
newsfeed there and five buttons at the
bottom so how the manager might draw a
wireframe and give this to an engineer
and say please implement this and this
is father work though we've figured out
in tech in Silicon Valley or in the tech
world in order to have product managers
and engineers work together but this is
breaking down but these old workflows
and processes are breaking down in the
AI error so for example if you're trying
to build a chatbot if a product manager
draws you know I don't know this picture
right so so actually one of the
companies I've been helping out with is
a chatbot cognitive behavioral therapy
chat bot mental health is a secondary
problem in the United States and you
build a chat bot called whoa bot that
gives in our case the hotel server
problem actor draws a wireframe says
chat bot says hi if the user says oh I'm
sad then the chat wall says this if a
product manager gives this picture to a
natural language processing engineer the
AI engineer or National Angus processing
engineer will say this is totally
useless I don't need to know what the
shape of the speech bubbles is I need to
know what's the substance of the
conversation my chat BOTS supposed to
have with a user or to take a more
extreme example right I mentioned been
helping with autonomous driving company
drives our AI if a you know product
manager draws this picture
right and gives this to an engineer and
says hey built this right again she says
it's totally useless is that why are you
drawing me a picture of a saw driving
car so we're training project managers
to use a new language to speak to
engineer and secure product
specifications for example our probably
managers now know to create a data set
and provide that to an engineer and say
dear engineer are you able to deliver
90% accuracy on this data set at
detecting calls between 1500 meters
distance so we're having new workflows
and processes for engineers and product
managers who work together all right I
think I'm running out of time let me
just do one last thing real quick and
then and then we'll we'll go to the Q&amp;amp;A
um you know with the rise of AI how do
you incorporate AI
into your company this is recommendation
I've been giving to the CEOs more of our
CEOs of large companies so most
companies are organized as follows where
your CEO and maybe multiple business
units report to the CEO or a bu is my
abbreviation for business unit what I've
been recommending to most companies to
leverage these AI capabilities we should
probably transform your industry is to
build a centralized AI team and then to
matrix in the AI talent into your
various different business units so why
do I recommend is that take an example
let's say this bu this business news is
your gift card division right you're
head of gift card you know might be a
great leader but there's a good chance
that they don't have the capability to
select and retain the top a Italian and
why would the top AI Risa
want to work for your gift card division
so I think that if you can build a
centralized AI team this gives you gives
your organization more consistent hiring
a promotion and HR practices in the AI
era and by matrix in the AI teams into
the various business units you can have
AI people sitting next to your gift card
division and figure out how AI can help
your give design or sales and so on
we've seen this patent before with the
rise of mobile you know maybe around
2011
none of us could hire enough mobile
engineers and we didn't really know what
we're doing from we didn't know GPS
would be such a big thing for mobile
what
for a few companies actually including
Baidu was COMPETES build a centralized
mobile unit matrix and talent but now
every I guess MIT and Stanford CS and a
grad drag just knowing how the program
for iOS and Android so now what's change
is that your gift card division unit
probably can hire mobile talent and so
many of these central units have
disbanded because it's now more
efficient for the distributing
organizations to just hiring their own
talent but and and if a I ever met rolls
then maybe a I will get there as well
but yeah doesn't look as maturing
anytime soon so I think at least in the
current era with very scarce AI talent
where we really don't know what we're
doing frankly and AI having a common
team to have common standards as well as
build company-wide platforms that are
useful for many business units I think
is a walk structure that I'm seeing that
they've been recommending the companies
I can could help help you build AI into
your organization's and this AI unit can
also what the rise the digital content
such as Coursera and and and many others
we now have tools for your chief
Learning Officer or your central AI unit
to provide very broad-based employee
training to just level of your whole
organization to better understand how to
incorporate these AI process in the
businesses I hope that was helpful
I'm definitely running over time we
should we should let me say thank you
very much
