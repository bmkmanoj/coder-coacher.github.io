being interviewed by Stephanie sy who
was recorded on March 16th 2018 this
Carnegie ethics studio presentation is
made possible by the Carnegie Council
for Ethics and International Affairs and
listeners like you we hope you enjoy the
program
welcome to ethics matter I'm Stephanie
sy our guests here in the Carnegie
councils studio is Andrew yang he is an
entrepreneur and the founder of venture
for America a fellowship program that's
given young entrepreneurs the
opportunity to start businesses and
create jobs in American cities he's also
an author and his most recent book is
called the war on normal people the
truth about America's disappearing jobs
and why universal basic income is our
future it is jobs that Andrew yang
clearly cares about and Andrew thank you
first of all so much for being here the
reason you have written this book about
universal basic income it's because you
worry about automation and I you know
when I read about you a lot of times it
was associated with this concern that
there would be some sort of robot
apocalypse so let's start there first
are you worried that robots are going to
take over well I am but it's not like
walking robots like I want to come in
and replace you and me in the studio
it's it's actually the case that robots
started arriving in the American economy
around 2000 and started displacing large
numbers of manufacturing workers from
then till now so if you look at the
numbers American manufacturing workers
went down from about 17 million to 12
million between 2000 and 2015 and of
those 5 million jobs lost the vast
majority 80% were due to robots and
automation so it's not that robots are
on the horizon they've actually been
here for a while and ok before you
continue let's define the difference
between a robot and machines because
machines have been a part of this
economy since the Industrial Revolution
and there's been a lot of talk about job
replacement and displacement because of
machines so
how do you define a robot you're right
that most of the the the manufacturing
work displacements due to like very
large stationary cranes and one yeah
repetitive work lots of in that walk-in
talk it's true so the the reason why I'm
so passionate about this I spent the
last six years in Detroit Cleveland st.
Louis Baltimore and other cities that
have really experienced the throws of
automation over this past couple of
decades and I worked with hundreds of
entrepreneurs in these regions trying to
create new jobs and I learned a number
of things over those years
one was the impact of automation on
these communities it's been very very
negative you can see very large numbers
of distressed commute in these
communities that haven't found new
opportunities and the businesses that
are coming up typically do not employ
large numbers of high school graduates
they employ smaller numbers of Engineers
and college graduates very typically so
it's the blue-collar workers that are
suffering but we've been hearing
definitely in this last election cycle
that that's globalization that's bad
trade deals but you're saying that based
on the statistics you've seen eighty
percent of manufacturing jobs in 2000
were actually lost to automation yes uh
automation is a much bigger driver of
job displacement than globalization and
certainly immigrants and that's
something that the American people I
believe are coming around to that there
was a recent survey that showed that
seventy percent of Americans believe
that technology AI software all of these
things are going to eliminate many more
jobs and they're going to create over
the next ten years which is 100 percent
correct they're right so so we're waking
up to the reality we're right now on the
third or fourth inning of the greatest
technological and economic shift that
we've ever experienced as a society it's
the greatest shift in human history that
shift though again I take it back to the
time horizon leading starting from the
Industrial Revolution but really in
earnest in the 60s and 70s with machines
and replacing workers on the assembly
line what is different about this time
that calls for drastic
Lucian's is it AI and machine learning
so part of it and one of the reasons why
I'm so passionate about this is that if
you start digging to the numbers you see
that we are in the midst of this process
and that our society is not dealing with
it very well
so you see these misleading numbers
about the unemployment rate on the
headline saying oh it's 4.2 percent it's
a near full employment a near full
employment not full unemployment and and
then you think oh things must be good in
the labor market but what that's masking
is that our labor force participation
rate is down to a multi-decade low
that's right sixty two point nine
percent which is comparable to the rates
in El Salvador and the Dominican
Republic much lower than it's been in
past periods ninety five million
Americans are out of the workforce and
aren't considered as part of the
unemployment rate including almost one
out of five in their prime working age
of 25 to 34 Wow
so there's a lot of weakness that our
headlines are not digging into and a lot
of that is driven by this progression so
when people talk about the Industrial
Revolution I honestly get a little bit
frustrated because it's it was a
different transition it was much less
dramatic it didn't affect as many
industries and if you look at it there
were actually widespread protests and
problems that arose true labor unions
came into existence around 1886 in
response to the early industrialization
and there was real social instability
are you concerned about social
instability becoming an issue with
automation or do you think that is
happening you know if you look at the
numbers it's definitely happening the
suicide rate among middle-aged white
Americans has surged to unprecedented
levels our life expectancy as a society
has declined for two strangers opioid
crisis seven Americans died of opioid
overdoses every hour so the the social
disintegration is already clear it's
just we're not paying attention to it
because our government instead of
putting up measurements that we could
all understand like hey life expectancy
declining that's shocking and terrible
in a developed country that's actually
almost unprecedented how is this
happening why and
so automation has been tearing its way
through the economy and society already
and we are coming apart at the seams
Donald Trump in my opinion is president
today because we automated away millions
of manufacturing jobs in Michigan Ohio
Pennsylvania which were essentially the
swing states he needed to win and so but
you don't hear Trump talking about that
and you know there's a lot more focus
why do you think there's less political
engagement on this issue and by the way
I forgot to mention that you have
announced your candidacy for president
in 2020 why do you think there hasn't
been more political engagement on this
issue I don't know of any other
candidate that's made universal basic
income which by the way we're gonna get
to his platform well the one of the
reasons I'm running for president is
that leading up to this so I'm the CEO
of venture for America my organization
has helped create thousands of jobs so
I'm meeting with senators and and
governors and the president on other
people and with a couple of them I would
say to them hey according to what I'm
seeing
we are automating away millions of jobs
and it's about to get much much worse
very fast because I have dozens of
friends in Silicon Valley and they will
tell you in private that what they are
doing is going to get rid of many many
jobs
I mean Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk
they've actually come out in favor of
universal Bayes I'm sort of universal
basic income because so it's because
they know they do know I mean if you put
them on a panel they might say oh some
jobs will be created some will be
destroyed but they know that the focus
of their activities is trying to save
companies money and most of the time
that means taking an activity that
humans are doing and automating it so
the example that I talked about the New
York Times was truck driving so the
incentives to automate truck driving are
a hundred sixty-eight billion dollars
per year and that's why we have the
smartest people in the country working
on it because they know there's a giant
pot of gold and and that that's the way
our system works so so I saw that this
was happening and I would talk to these
government leaders and I would say hey
guys like this seems to be the main
problem
it's driving all of these other issues
what are we gonna do about that and I
literally had politicians say to me we
cannot talk about that and the reason
why they cannot talk about it is because
the solutions are too dramatic and it
makes them seem extreme and alarmist
so what they'll do is they'll talk about
education and retraining let's say we
need to retrain American workers for
jobs of the future
which sounds great but where are the
jobs going to come from exactly well
part of it too is if you dig into in my
book the war on normal people talks
about this if you dig into the data on
the success rates of government
retraining programs they're essentially
entirely ineffective there's almost no
difference in outcome between a retrain
group and a not retrained group another
study had the efficacy rate at about 37
percent which and some of those 37
percent might have succeeded you know
without the program so so and this is an
instances when the government is
spending thousands of dollars trying to
retrain the worker which is not going to
be the case most of the time because 1
in 10 Americans works in retail 30
percent of the malls are going to close
and it's not like when I mall closes
they're gonna be government we trainers
around saying hey you just lost your job
let's so most Americans are not going to
go through government finance retraining
and even when it is offered it doesn't
work before we get into the details of
your universal basic income plan one
issue that I see right away with it in
other words giving people a monthly
income without conditions is it doesn't
seem to address the problem that you're
describing and in the in the large
broader sense which is there are going
to be fewer jobs for humans how does it
address in an evolving economy where you
know the top five companies in the world
by market capitalization are all tech
companies that don't hire nearly the
number of workers that like AT&amp;amp;T did in
the 1960s when it was the largest
company so you know how does this really
address you know an evolving economy or
do you just have a society where people
don't work and it's sort of a Robin Hood
economy in some ways where you sort of
take and tap
big tech that's using automation and
redistribute to those that aren't
engineers and that don't get a piece of
that pie and and this is where it gets
really deep and human and philosophical
which has been what's already got there
a little earlier than you probably
expected no I got there too because I
was writing this book and I consider
myself sort of like a practical
economist type but then you end up
heading to the human and philosophical
very quickly because you realize hey
what should people be doing if so using
the truck drivers as an example there
are three and a half million of them
number one job in 29 states 94% male
average age 49 yeah so you start
imagining okay let's say we automate
significant numbers of those jobs in the
next 10 years like what does the new
world look like and it can be shocking
and frightening because let's say that
transition goes poorly and then the ex
truckers riot in large numbers and block
highways with their their trucks with
Lada MO and their trucks which is
another problem so so that the reason
why couldn't use me our politicians
struggle so much with this is that there
is no quick fix and universal basic
income is a huge part of the solution
but it's only one facet of it and that
the great thing about universal basic
income is that it may allow us to
redefine work because right now we have
this model of work that's essentially a
subsistence model it's you should work
to survive you must show up will pay you
based upon how much time you spend and
you'll get like enough maybe a and at
this point a lot of Americans are like
that that actually wouldn't be true from
from any of their their jobs as well so
the great thing about this there's
actually very few great things about
this entire technological shift but the
one potential bright spot is that it may
allow us to redefine why we do what we
do and and so my platform has a few main
components Universal basic income is one
but the second one which is
as important is that we need to change
how we measure value GDP did not exist
as a measurement until the Great
Depression
and then things were going so badly that
the government was like we have to have
a measurement to see how how things are
going and then trying to improve it and
that's now a terrible measurement for
our society because with automation and
software and robots GDP can go to the
moon and more and more people who can be
completely excluded by that and left
behind so instead of GDP we should be
measuring things like childhood success
rates mental health freedom from
substance abuse engagement with work
broadly defined proportion of elderly in
quality situations what might put an
environmental quality environmental
sustainability journalism because not
everyone's here in New York you know
working for organizations that are still
vibrant journalistically I mean in small
towns around the country there's
actually no you could have a whole
discussion just about that but what
you're describing is what I've heard
CEOs that I've interviewed described as
a triple bottom line it's a version of
that it's a different way to measure but
it's really quite radical and drew what
you're suggesting because by introducing
a universal basic income you're really
talking about transforming society and
transforming the way culture views value
right where do you think we are right
now as a society and accepting that I
will say I've you know what we're very
academic discussions on the Carnegie
Council's stage about universal basic
income seem to have gotten more and more
in the mainstream oh yeah I mean are we
getting there and what's propelling that
well I'm I'm where I am because I
believe that this is inevitable and we
don't have a choice and that the sooner
we get there the better off our society
will be that if we go too late that's
actually catastrophic if we go too early
the matches gives us more time to build
the new institutions that are necessary
to complement it and
this transition and and though the the
truth is we are the richest and most
technologically advanced society in
human history and we can easily afford
$1,000 per American adult per month I've
heard that would be 10 to 12 percent of
GDP
well that's expensive well the great
thing is that every dollar goes into the
hands of an American consumer and then
the vast majority is just going to be
spent and circulated through the economy
so it would actually grow the economy
the hope the world the Roosevelt
Institute tried to model it out and you
probably saw this where they found that
universal basic income at a thousand
dollars a month which is what I'm
proposing in my campaign which we've
called the freedom dividend would grow
the economy by four point six million
jobs 2.5 trillion five I pulled the
information from the left-leaning
Roosevelt Institute who is to their
credit doing a lot of research on how
this will happen but but I want to say
it's common sense that most Americans
are struggling if they got $1,000 a
month what are they gonna do they're
gonna spend it in their town like on
their children like paying bills like
all of the money is gonna end up you can
imagine Walmart AT&amp;amp;T like every major
consumer company all of a sudden their
consumers would have more to spend like
I mean that's where the money is going
to go so it would clearly grow the
economy and I've worked with hundreds of
entrepreneurs around the country
entrepreneurs have their heads up and
are trying to solve problems they are
often not people that are desperately
trying to scramble to pay their bills
month to month if we implemented a
universal basic income it would be the
greatest catalyst for entrepreneurship
and creativity we have ever seen they
would create tens of thousands hundreds
of thousands of new businesses okay two
questions the first being the downside
some have said it's just human
psychology is is weather for a lot of
people giving them free money $1,000 a
month would take away their incentive to
work so what what's your explanation for
you know how we wouldn't end up in a
society that would be less productive
well less innovative I consider myself a
facts
driven or data-driven person and the
data just does not show a reduction in
work hours when you have income support
either here in the US or Canada or in
the developing world in the US they saw
when they ran when they ran large-scale
trials a slight reduction in work hours
for two groups young mothers and
teenagers who stayed in school longer
and if you and there's arguably a good
value for either and so a universal
basic income about thousand dollars a
month it's not enough to prosper really
it's enough to take the edge off of your
need to survive but there's virtually no
one is going to look at that and say oh
I'm all set
I'm getting $1,000 a month the
equivalent of like six dollars and I
mean there's that but I've also read
that you know that there's some evidence
that people really do would like to work
that that you know having a dignified
job is part of what makes life
meaningful for a lot of people so while
you might have this you know so that
firm that sort of again the
philosophical ones I know but certainly
I would continue to work even if I win
the lottery but but let me ask you the
other I think really important question
is in your plan how would you pay for
this because there have been different
ideas that I've seen it changes to the
Earned Income Tax Credit I mean let's
get into the brass tacks how would
Andrew yang pitch paying for something
that could be 10 to 12 percent of the
GDP that expensive of a government
program so again I just want to say it's
not a government program and that every
dollar goes into the hands of an
American citizen it's a true dividend
where if you were a company and you said
hey we're declaring a dividend we're
giving this money to shareholders then
everyone would say that's great
management in this case we the citizens
of this country are the owners and if
the dividend comes to us then it's not a
government program it's simply the
shareholders of society receiving some
of the vast wealth of the society so
it's not a government program it's
actually extraordinarily
expensive to administer because if it's
truly universal you don't have keys
managers or people trying to figure out
how much money you make like all of that
stuff goes away but at least in the
short term the funding would have to
come right so so it's actually much more
affordable than most people think so the
headline number is about two trillion
dollars our economy is about 19 trillion
so that seems like a lot but if you dig
into the numbers you find that we're
spending about five hundred billion
dollars right now on income support in
various ways in kind food stamps welfare
housing social security disability and
this would be overlapping so if
someone's receiving let's say $700 in
benefits right now then you go to them
and say hey you can keep your current
benefits or you can go to the freedom
dividend to get a thousand dollars a
month so they would have the option they
would have the option but because we're
already spending five hundred billion
this thing is 25% paid for before you
even get started because you wouldn't be
able to have both you have Medicare I
mean that was one of my questions is
what it would do to other governmental
assistance programs yes so I that we
need to transition to a medicare-for-all
program because healthcare is one of the
major stressors and costs for both
American families and individuals but
also businesses and it's 18 percent of
the economy it's a not giving us proper
value because it's not like our health
care outcomes are twice as good as other
countries even though we're spending
twice as much but my proposal to pay for
universal basic income does not touch
Medicaid Medicare or the five hundred
billion I described does not include
those programs Social Security so it
includes Social Security disability
which is when individuals you know are
receiving income support so the big
problem we're facing as a society is
that more and more work is being done by
machines robots AI software an income
tax is a terribly inefficient way of
actually harvesting that value for the
public so if you look at it who are
going to be the beneficiaries of these
this transition automation it's going to
be large tech companies who are
excellent and not paying
a lot of tax very good offshore yeah
move it over it like say it all went
through Ireland small tech companies
which are often not profitable and then
if they do get acquired it's maybe a
one-time thing and they might have to
pay on an acquisition at a certain point
but even then it's at a capital gains
rate so like there's just not a lot of
money that's gonna be coming to the
public even as more and more work is
going to be done by robots and software
so that's what we need to change and
that's the way we pay for universal
basic income the way we pay for it is we
implement a value-added tax which right
now is in practice in every other
industrialized country in the world
except for us and through a value-added
tax then so Amazon now it's 43 percent
of e-commerce like largest market cap
Jeff Bezos could be the first
trillionaire but there are periods when
they said hey we didn't even make any
money like this quarter so you know no
income tax whereas a value-added tax
then they they pay based on transaction
and that's inescapable it's one reason
why other countries use it is that it's
a much much more effective way to get
revenue and so if you're a self-driving
truck company you might not have many
humans making money and so there's not
much income tax coming coming but a
value-added tax then we get we get our
fair share and a value-added tax would
generate between seven and eight hundred
billion dollars if we were to implement
it at half the European level the
European average v80 is 20% our economy
is so vast that if we had a vat of 10%
it would generate seven to eight hundred
billion dollars so that is my my primary
mechanism to pay for the universal basic
income because you have five hundred
billion plus eight hundred billion the
VAT so then you're at about sixty five
percent of the two trillion and then the
remainder this is the beauty of
universal basic income we are already
spending hundreds of billions on health
care incarceration homelessness like all
these services for people that are
falling through the cracks that those
expenses would go down if these people
are able to stay out of the emergency
room well that's interesting right
because the Peterson Institute is
looking at some of their research
apparently in this
of Indies in Manitoba Canada I feel like
there was an experiment done with
several thousand people that looked at
universal basic income so there is some
empirical evidence that's what happens
right and and I found it interesting
that once a universal income was
provided there were better outcomes when
it came to things like health yes
education yeah so what's happening there
uh and and this is the most powerful
stuff of universe basic income it's
that's very human so men come in that
Canadian town you're describing what
they found was that right men come for
Manitoba income was that what yeah
minimum a company okay just combine the
words so they found that hospital visits
went down nine percent they found that
domestic violence went down mental
health went up and children stayed in
school longer in another study in North
Carolina they actually found that
children's personalities changed to
become more conscientious and agreeable
which are both very positive traits for
academic and professional success so
this is what we're talking about at the
human level and so if you can imagine
right now you know what's really really
expensive dysfunction people coming the
emergency room and and then like having
massive problems that we as society and
uh paying for in various ways
functionality is actually much less
expensive so we're going to get hundreds
of billions back from things we're
currently spending on health care and
incarceration and homelessness and then
as the economy grows because we're
putting money in the hands of American
consumers we get twenty five percent of
the growth back because that's the the
ratio of revenue to GDP growth in the US
so with a vat of ten percent you
essentially pay for one thousand dollars
a month per American adult per in
perpetuity and you know it sounds
slightly less far-fetched when you talk
about somehow making and the technology
companies that are implementing this
automation that's killing jobs be
responsible for this and redistributing
from there
because there's so much backlash right
now against those technology companies
and then just sort of outsized political
and economic clout they have you bring
up this this notion of improving lives
with Economic Security it reminds me
that this show is called ethics matter
and so we talked a lot about what rights
are and what human rights are
I feel like this country is not in a
place yet where there's a sense that
it's government's responsibility that
everyone has economic rights and
environmental rights and economic
security what do you think well you know
I think America has been very fortunate
for a very long time but I think our
economy and society are progressing to a
point where the absence of a government
point of view or action is actually
going to greatly diminish individual
economic rights and in our quality of
life really if we just let this thing go
you can we can all see what's gonna
happen I mean the values is gonna get
gathered up in a relatively small number
of hands of people generally at the
heads of major technology companies and
the people that work in those
organizations now I'm friends with those
people
they are generally good people what do
they think about your plan
they are generally for it because they
realize that it is good for no one if
our society degenerates and everyone
starts shaking their fist and saying
like hey you know like all the value
like all the malls closed and like
Amazon is getting all about like that's
not good for anybody and the thing that
I think is ridiculous is when people
imagine that it's somehow the innovators
responsibility to figure out all of the
downstream economic and social impacts
of their innovations I mean they have
their heads down just trying to make the
thing work yeah it is our government's
job and our leaders job to figure out
all the downstream effects and and make
appropriate policies and changes and
that's where we've fallen asleep with
the switch our government has become
very backward and dysfunctional we've
lost faith in it and over the last 50
years we've just been stuck with this
this
60s era bureaucracy having food fights
from decades ago instead of a government
that's appropriate to the challenges of
2018 and 2020
and that's why I'm running for president
so about universal basic income to
social benefits and it was a lot of fun
like reading the studies that that some
of which you cited but I go through it
in my book in detail and it's clear to
me that universal basic income would
improve the lives of millions of
Americans that we can easily afford it
the thing that most people do not
realize I didn't realize until I dug
into it we actually it we actually came
this close to passing a universal basic
income in 1971 Martin Luther King was
four it makes that was under next Nixon
was for it a thousand economists signed
a letter saying this would be great it
passed the House of Representatives and
then it stalled in the Senate because
the Democrats wanted more money for it
wasn't that conservatives tanked it it
was that it was that Senate Democrats
thought that it should be more generous
so we've it's not even very radical like
we came this close and it's been
implemented in Alaska for 25 years in
essence through the petroleum dividend
how do you change the narrative around
it being a government handout that will
lead to a lazy society because I can
just see that's what you're gonna be up
against and you said that you've met
with lawmakers and throughout your
career so you know how do you sell it
you know I'm actually very confident
that people are over the sort of welfare
handout framing in large part because
the suffering is so widespread like the
the welfare framing was often about like
the other it was like oh you're gonna
give them the money but now it's a lot
of us yeah now it's a lot it's enough
people yeah now we're so the most recent
polling shows that support for universal
basic income is about 50/50 right now
and is just gonna go up from there
people are learning more and more about
how it works well what's the other thing
I just want to say it's like like just
imagine your life with a thousand
dollars a month I mean what would you do
with it and just imagine that multiply
it over well it's interesting
when I was looking at all of the
potential outcomes again I just kept
thinking this would be very
transformative for example you know
people might do more volunteer work yes
I'm not an entrepreneur I'm not
necessarily an entrepreneur but that's
also because I've always sort of been
tied to an employment contract where I
knew I needed to do that for healthcare
yes and to get health insurance and so
there are almost endless possibilities
you know you also think about the
mothers and you think about from a
woman's perspective and what what it
would mean to be able to really take
care of your child for those first three
months and all of the ways and and if
from what I understand your plan as well
as other plans about universal basic
income there are no there's no
means-testing it's not like welfare
where there is any sort of yeah that's
one reason my wife loves universal basic
income so much is what you're describing
is we have two young children at home
and I agree with with the fact that it
could be transformative really at a
personal level the one of the challenges
we have to affair that are all tied
together is that there are a number of
things that right now the market does
not support which includes parenting
young children and the environment and
sustainability arts and creativity
volunteer work taking care of the
elderly like there there's no money
against these things and if you do them
you're often going against the grain so
in a context of universal basic income
many many more people will do these
things yeah which we we want and need
and my plan and this is where it gets a
little bit technically interesting so if
you believe that these things are very
important
using journalism as an example it's like
hey market used to support journalism in
small towns around the country now does
not but let's say we thought it was
important then you have two choices in
my opinion one is that you put money
against it which might be a good idea in
that particular case or and what I
recommend in my book is you create a new
currency and which I'm calling the
digital social credit and you put a new
currency that maps to pro-social
activities and this is one of the
that you can give the displaced truckers
and people with with more idle time
structure to find purpose and
fulfillment where you say hey your truck
drives itself now great you don't need
to sit in at eleven hours a day digital
Social Credit I think that's the first
time I've heard that how can you explain
that a little bit more sure so I was
researching because I I agree with the
fact and this is one of the things that
that I find out at least a little bit
frustrating is that people think oh like
universal basic income won't replace
work of course it won't replace work
it's not meant to replace work it's
meant to help address you know your
basic human needs so that you know you
can start thinking about what should I
be doing and now typically we have this
marketplace that pays money for
different positions but a lot of
positions that we know are good like
coaching or mentoring or parenting or
all these these very crucial roles don't
pay any money so what would me I know as
mother - and universal basic income
would be it would be so powerful for
women in particular because it would
help them get through those early years
with it with their children also make
sure they get paid for the incredible
work that gets done that right now again
the market like says being a mother zero
when you know it being a mother's most
important job in the world so what we
need to do is we need to have a new
digital Social Credit that maps to
various pro-social activities that we
know we need and then if you volunteer
if you you know like start like a book
club if you do things that we think are
positive that we think I mean your
community things are positive then we
start putting social credits against
those things and then that uh that
displaced trucker can then say okay if I
like coach Little League then I get
these credits I take care of my ailing
mother yes and that's another
frustration I have is that people say oh
you know we'll all be taking care of the
elderly as our new jobs and then I say
well if you look into it you find that
being a home health care aide pays
twenty four thousand dollars a year has
turnover of sixty percent a year it's
like it's like a barrier and there's no
money behind it right now so what we
have to do is we have to
create new currency and then map that
against post social activities to give
people more means of finding fulfilling
work more broadly to find I have two
questions that are pretty
straightforward
are you a Luddite somebody who's you
know who just doesn't think I mean that
technology should have this sort of
power in our society and second are you
a capitalist or are you a socialist um
so I started an organization called
venture for America that trains hundreds
of entrepreneurs I wrote a book called
smart people should build things so
you're a capitalist so I'm certainly
like the farthest thing from a Luddite I
love technology and innovation
I just AM pointing out what most people
already know which is that all of the
gains from from automation are going to
not necessarily be broadly disseminated
to everyone in America so I I'm Pro
innovation Pro technology I just think
we need to be real about what it's going
to mean for so that the top five job
categories in the United States are
clerical and administrative work
including call centers sales and retail
including mall workers food service and
food prep including fast-food workers
truck drivers and manufacturing and
those five categories comprise about
half of the workforce so saying hey
technology and innovation it's gonna be
great it's like yeah but great for who
precisely it's gonna be great for those
jobs that seems like it'll be safe from
automation there you said there's not
one of them yeah that's what like we can
all look at that set of jobs and think
like I can very easily see how each of
those is going to contract a lot so so
I'm the furthest thing from a Luddite
what I am is I'm Pro human catchphrase
well thank you I mean about that as a
presidential slogan
well the slogan of my campaign is
humanity first so it's not not far off
and in terms of whether I'm a capitalist
I think right now we have an outdated
form of capitalism that we must upgrade
and update to the realities of today we
need a whole new set of measure
measurement sticks
to go for to allow us to try and really
optimize for human well-being as opposed
to capital efficiency and those two
things can be aligned some of the time
but sometimes they will not be and we
need to be able to see that and make
choices so to me this next stage of
capitalism which I call in my book human
capitalism or human centered capitalism
is to me the logical next step and one
of the things that I think is uneducated
is when people think that's something
like universal basic income is socialist
the definition of socialism is when you
nationalize the means of production that
is if I were to say hey the government
should take over Google which you know I
think is a terrible idea
so so universal basic income is is
extraordinarily pro-capitalist
because it's going to support the
consumer economy at a time when that's
exactly what it's going to need because
capitalism does not function very well
when people don't have money to spend or
when society is becoming increasingly
dysfunctional Andrew yang what an
interesting and fascinating and I think
relevant perspective you bring thank you
so much for joining us thanks for having
me it's been a pleasure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
