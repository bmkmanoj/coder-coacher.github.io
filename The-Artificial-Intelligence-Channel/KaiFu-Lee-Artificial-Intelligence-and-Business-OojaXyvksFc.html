the CEO and the founder of Sai Novation
ventures he's based in Beijing he's here
in New York for this week and kindly
agreed to meet with this group I'm gonna
we're gonna dive into a discussion but
I'm gonna give you a little bit of
background about Kai food just briefly
before we do that so first of all he is
a he's post-national
like a lot of courts his readers he were
Taiwan native and you immigrated to the
u.s. in the seventh grade and lived in
Oak Ridge Tennessee he's an
undergraduate degree in computer science
from Columbia where he gave the
commencement address last evening which
was well received I understand and PhD
from Carnegie Mellon where he did some
pioneering work on machine learning and
voice recognition
Kaiko worked as a Carnegie faculty
member then went to Apple then went to
Silicon Graphics went to Microsoft in
1998 and worked both in Beijing and in
Redmond for Microsoft 2005 went to
Google made front-page headlines of
business newspapers like the Wall Street
Journal where I was at the time because
you were a sort of pawn in the Microsoft
Google corporate battle of the time and
so there were some lawsuits that went
back and forth around that so he ran
started and ran Google's China operation
and Google actually impressively
expanded its market share in China and
then 2009 you've left to found the tech
startup investment in incubator
innovation works today that's known as
sign evasion ventures and your most
recent fundraising at the end of last
year brought in about six hundred
seventy five million dollars across a
China investment fund and American
investment fund and your portfolio is
over three hundred companies like foo is
about 50 million followers on social
media 5-0 including 1.7 million on
Twitter as of last night
they're probably some Columbia
undergrads who follow
you know and so that number is higher if
you're very lucky he might one day
retweet you so so we're gonna dive in
we're gonna speak up here for about 30
minutes and then we're going to take
questions for a while both from in the
room and on Facebook live and we will
finish up by 10 to 10 or so so that you
are able to get out of here by 10
o'clock and as we promised and move on
to the the rest of your day
so among the topics were in hitter as I
said artificial intelligence for the
Chinese internet sector which I think
for many of us here is fairly opaque and
and here Caiphas views on these things
so thank you for joining us thank you
that's a long me here a long window for
you Thanks so I want to start with your
career so the research the pioneering
research on machine learning voice
recognition at Carnegie Mellon and then
then Apple Silicon Graphics Microsoft
Google and so forth is there any through
line is there any technical through line
between all of these all of all of these
things yeah there are several there
several through line I think the first
one is artificial intelligence each of
the companies that worked on
cutting-edge AI and actually worked on
VR at Apple in 1995 and an SGI the sec
VR looked like at Apple in 1990 it was
called QuickTime VR the first product to
use the name we went to the Star Trek
holodeck and did a 360 photograph they
could zoom in and out and we loosely
called it VR and it actually made some
money for Apple so that's one one
through line but the other corresponding
one is always seem to get in before
early so over time I've learned learn
the lesson and then the third one is the
connection to China yeah that's it was
starting at Apple and then SGI they kept
showing me how big the the China market
can be and then when I was in Microsoft
I jumped all in and we built Microsoft
Research which at the time was something
most people didn't believe could
possibly be successful because Chinese
had zero papers in all the top of the
kitchens
and and we basically over the two years
of my tenure and the many years that
followed ended up training 5,000 Chinese
scientists in AI and China now comprises
43% of Chinese writers comprise 43% of
all top journal publications in AI today
so we're gonna come back to that in a
minute
you just mentioned you are always too
early what do you mean by that I have
always been too early but now I'm just
on time for it okay now at age 55 right
yeah you're finally on time finally on
time yes okay excellent what we see
across that query just before we get
into AI where were you happiest actually
professionally I was happiest probably
in three times starting new things makes
me happiest doing Microsoft research
starting something with all the freedom
from Bill Gates that was very happy we
hired smart people that great Oracle
launch their careers at Google trying to
do something that seemed impossible
we're down to single digit market share
we got a team and and tripled the market
share over three years that was fun and
then of course that's a Novation
ventures at the time where no one
thought early stage investment made any
sense and no one thought Android who
could possibly take off everyone was
into Symbian a few loved iOS but
everybody was Android didn't work but we
said this is the future and we basically
bed the farm and then that worked that
was fun and of course now is the most
fun because all the like Steve Jobs said
now I can connect all the dots and help
make AI reality and that's the most fun
ever so let's let's go into AI so why do
you believe that AI is a profound
technology development as opposed to a
buzzword that will come and go because I
think it's a confluence of several
things one is the the invention of deep
learning in seven years ago that was the
single factor that made AI work
algorithmically for those of you who
don't know it's kind of a black box
think of it as a black box excel you
throw theta at it and
learns to predict and make decisions
right throw throw financial data at it
tells you what stock to buys through a
long data at it tells you if it's going
to be a bad loan you throw go data it
tells you what what what where to place
your pieces so this black box
mathematical training technology is the
number one factor but also helped
greatly by the advances in size of data
because deep learning doesn't work with
inadequate data when you've got you know
tens of millions hundreds of millions of
pieces of data it does magic when you
have is unlike people we learn now a
couple of exemplars and deep learning
needs huge amounts of data and now we
can get it because through the internet
finance we have data and then lastly we
have computing with CPU plus GPU such as
the ones from Nvidia we can process the
massive amount of data it's a confluence
of three things is what gives rise to a
lot of companies that are doing well and
give you a couple examples from our
investment we invested in in the largest
AI image processing company in China it
beautifies selfies and it has 1.3
billion users every time you take a
selfie and save it it's a positive
exemplar if you don't save it it's a
negative it simpler just keep training
it just makes all of you beautiful in
ways that in ways that you think are
beautiful ok and and this is now public
on Hong Kong Stock Exchange about a six
billion dollar valuation second company
is payday loan company but this one
makes AI makes the loan determination
zero human involvement huge data goes in
and you either get the money or not
anyone on the street can borrow money
it's not a you know a car loan or home
loan it's not nothing complex just a few
pieces of data and it gives you the
money or not so this year it will give
30 it will underwrite 30 million loans
imagine the kind of profit that that
this will yield we invested in the face
recognition company it can recognize his
faces more accurately than people but
not just 3,000 faces you know but but 3
million faces so we imagine this deploy
that all they are
in the world with a database of
terrorist and wanted criminals there
will be no more airplane hijacks if the
world were to deploy a technology like
that which so which areas do you think
will of business and society will be
most deeply and most immediately
impacted by AI we think AI will come in
three phases they will all happen today
but some will be easy and fast some will
be take its time the first phase is take
all the industries that already have big
data so internet finance hospitals
medical education and so on the second
phase will be creating new data that
didn't exist before through whether
wearable computing Amazon echo smart
cars transmitting your location and so
on and a new you know smart buy a smart
traffic smart city smart health will
happen the third phase will be when AI
starts to move our than autonomously and
smartly and that will be robotics as
well as autonomous vehicles over all
these three probably 10 to 15 years but
all of them are happening right now with
the first phase that big data happening
the fastest and the biggest impact where
the most money will get made is clearly
in a financial industry so for those of
you who would that all right in the
financial industry watch out yeah I want
to ask you about that which if
hypothetically someone owned stocks of
banks or that sort of thing but but
which areas of current traditional
activity do you think are most
vulnerable to yeah relatively violent
disruption you just mentioned the payday
loan company that's making 30 million
loans so finance is clearly one of the
areas that you would that you're bearish
on to use the wall street yeah my
knowledge original traditional finances
because numerical analysis and decision
making is never the strength of our
brain it is the most extreme case where
AI obviously and completely dominates us
so we were forced to become you know
technical stock analysts long officers
and you know insurance underwriters but
these were never things that we were
intended to do because we don't have the
capacity to process all the positive and
negative exemplars we're making
decisions based on simplistic
if-then-else rules whereas these AI
algorithms are taking a 2,000
dimensional space and making a complex
curve that separates people who are safe
to lend money or not safe or stocks that
are good to buy not good to buy so we're
absolutely no match so those people in
those industries will get replaced by
machines faster than we think unless
there are antiquated government
regulations that prevent that but but
that would just be a postponement of the
inevitability I mean and you personally
are experimenting with algorithmic
investing is that right yeah not
experimenting all the money that I made
in the last three years have not gone
into any human they are they're all
managed by machines so you have the AI
algorithms that are managing all of your
money how and are they you seem like
you're relatively happy about this yeah
the returns last year are about eight
times from my private banker so that
reminds me some when I go home I'm going
to fire my private day how do the fees
compare the fees can be very heavy
because depends on who you work with if
it's an internal technology developed by
salivation Ventures there are no fees
yeah they just they just play on my
account and we'll I I cross my fingers
and hope they will do well if it's an
external person who runs a managed
account for you their carry can be
twenty percent up to fifty percent yeah
but they may at they'll guarantee a
certain return so you so we talk about
finance are there any other industries
that you think are most challenged
profoundly you know transportation is
one that people talk about for example
sure I'll first talk about medical I'm
very very excited by medical because you
know you could argue about finances if
it's placing people cars are they safe
but medical is just saving lives and
that's phenomenal
that the barrier for medical is the way
data and privacy and walls between
hospitals and countries are erected so
they can't be aggregated in the same way
that financial data is I think
collectively as mankind we have to
figure out some way so we can accelerate
the cure to cancer and other other
diseases but cars I'm very very bullish
this will take longer but you know the
day an autonomous vehicle comes it's not
just another function in the car you buy
because you won't buy cars anymore your
cars are idle 96% of the time it's the
worst investment you could make right
your house appreciates your car
depreciates it's only useful because the
4% convenience it gives you it's not
that convenient you got to park the car
get valet pay huge parking in New York
if if uber would come in 30 seconds and
charge you two-thirds one-third the rate
it does I think most of you would let go
I think let go of your cars and that's
likely to happen because the human
driver is 2/3 of uber cost when figured
when they get rid of the human driver
the cost should come down 2/3 and then
there will be fewer cars there'll be
more intelligent know where you are come
faster pollution will be gone traffic
congestion will be gone accidents will
go way down one very key thing about AI
is it gets better with use and with data
so when I gave you example of our long
company they lost on tens of millions of
dollars earlier in bad loans but when
you make enough bad loans that becomes
negative training exemplar then your
train it gets better you're you're
you're bad loan rate drops from teens to
think low single-digit
similarly autonomous vehicles initially
they might only be as good as human
drivers but over time they'll be much
better so they'll be safer better for
our health and longevity they'll be more
efficient cars will become smaller you
can only fit one just fit one person in
it it will have better safety devices
you can have more lanes so all those
things will completely disrupt the way
of our transportation not to mention
logistics delivery you know what uber
has done with shipping beers and things
like that
you know things will be sent to your
home you know look you'll be able to
read a newspaper and drink coffee when
you're in the car when you order
delivery it won't just be Amazon Amazon
Prime Amazon fresh you know you could
have Fried Chicken that's fried in the
car that's delivered to your home and
it'll taste good when it comes out so
think of all this disruption it's not
just a function it's you know easily
2030 percent but it's five years away
ten years away 20 years away fried
chicken in the car and most interested
in I don't know 10 10 to 15 years 10 to
15 years I think technologically we
could probably say about 10 years but
they're also legal moral user acceptance
issues so I'll be conservatives and say
10 to 15 yeah so as you look at the big
technology companies a number from you
worked at how would you assess their
their strengths going forward who's
strongest in terms of AI I think whoever
has more data the magic thing about the
AI is whoever has more data is stronger
of course I'm number one measure how
many how much data you've got how
structured it is how useful it is how
accurate label it is then measure how
good are your AI team and technologies
and infrastructure if you combine and
blend these two Google comes out clearly
on top followed by Microsoft Facebook
Amazon and then in China Baidu Tencent
Alibaba I think these are the seven
Giants today and how do you as a these
are all big platforms and they have tons
of data resources they can hire the top
AI talent and for millions of dollars if
you're an investor in small companies
yeah how do you compete with these guys
well we give the people who make a
million dollars the dream that they can
make a billion right and we show that
they can do good for mankind and they
can own their destiny and rather be upon
having said that it's very difficult to
pull people out of these companies
because you know brilliant AI scientists
want to be swimming in data because they
know what that's what feeds their
intellects and these guys have more
so so I sometimes jokingly called these
seven companies the seven black holes
because the data comes in scientists
come in they don't come out but we do
occasionally pull a few over the mouth
yeah I want to ask you about shift to
the future of work a little bit this is
an area that you that you have made some
predictions and one of them one of your
predictions is that roughly 50% of jobs
will be replaced by robots over the next
10 years actually right that's faster
than the Fried Chicken in the car event
yeah so what sort of jobs will be
affected and what what will happen to
the people who otherwise would have
filled those jobs right right so this is
based on an Oxford study where they said
I think two years ago they said 50% of
the jobs in 10 to 15 years so I think
I'm a little more aggressive in the
estimates or 10 years 50 percent one
could project that the rate in which the
jobs will be replaced first is any job
that requires less than five minutes
seconds of thinking right so a
receptionist factory worker with a
middleman that would be the fastest then
it's jobs that are new American nature
where large data is available to make
objective quantitative yes/no decisions
so that would be traders research
analysts insurance agents bank officers
loan officers and and and then beyond
that things that are a little more
complex but still replace still
quantitative in nature
so basically physicians in radiology
read x-rays and MRI and CT drivers
that's actually pretty complex but in
ten year time frame they'll be replaced
and then legal assistants and some
lawyers and and we're sorry reporters
okay how long do we know you're you're I
think courts is in good shape because
you're catching up with the times you
got your AI practice and okay but but
some of your reporters who write shorter
you know put together articles yeah
those those will be done by machines but
the report you have to keep migrating
for all of these professions you have to
migrate to be the best yeah in order to
survive so if you aggregate in aggregate
you add up the types of jobs I have
that's probably close to close to half
so what are you describing there is a
dystopian scenario in here and we've
seen this in in movies and and there are
a lot of people who are you know really
concerned about this where you have the
people the seven black holes on one hand
and then you have lots of people who
don't have jobs on the other hand and it
you know the potential is to to only
exacerbate the inequality that we see
already right what what gives you come
and you said that you think that poverty
could be eliminated as a result so how
in food would that happen and what gives
you confidence that that that your
alternative scenario is is what is
likely
well it's the best of times and worst of
times it depends on what we make of it
right all these AI algorithms are gonna
run essentially for free right these are
all they take is it electricity because
networking hardware software costs are
going down so they'll be generating more
value doing all the tasks was much
higher accuracy doing tasks that weren't
done before creating a massive amount of
wealth for them for mankind so if we as
mankind which redistribute the wealth
perhaps you know using some something as
thumb as taxation and minimum monthly
stipend to the displaced workers I think
will at least minimize the number of
people who are stricken with poverty and
hunger that would be a progress if I'm
not sure eradicating is possible but at
least make the largest progress yet to
mankind that's the positive part the
downside is what happens to the 50% were
displaced it's not going to be easy to
retrain that displaced people and I
think on the one hand we have to make
sure they're taken care of
can live with their taking care of
monetarily but then I think we have to
figure out how to retrain them and and
my thoughts would be we have to study
what AI cannot do and let them do what
they I cannot do otherwise you know you
help a reporter who used to you know
write a 200 word article that's replaced
now we had a 300 word in a year that
will be replaced so that's no good yeah
so I think you know AI will create a lot
of jobs I'll use doctor as an example
right imagine for the moment this may
not happen for another 15 years but
imagine for the moment that a I can do
Diagnostics that is determined based on
your symptom what you have and what
drugs you should take with higher
accuracy than human imagine that for a
moment I believe is it will happen but
imagine that happens in 15 years well a
cold diagnostic tool will be very
negative threatening to the patient
where I imagine if you go and and hear
that oh you have fourth stage lymphoma
there's a 70% chance you'll die within
five years you know that's not good
that's not what you want to hear from a
robot doctor so that the role of a
doctor can become some someone who is
more like a social worker a knowledge of
medically knowledgeable social worker
assistant psychiatrist psychologist
oh let's see what were your symptoms
last night let me listen okay even
though they know it doesn't matter but
they'll they'll ask and so you feel
heard and every time you say oh I have a
headache
oh let tell me more about it I have
attempt you know temperature are you
sweating you know basically be very
targeted relevant caring so that they
feel cared then you can give
encouragement it's like you know I know
this guy named Chi Fuli he had fourth
stage lymphoma you know he's okay now
so you know maybe you should follow and
consider the way he's treated and really
go through the regimen if this
chemotherapy is a little bit painful but
in the end he was he's okay so you got a
chance so this will not only make people
feel better it will make them loved
cared and also kick in the placebo
effect so they have a higher chance of
surviving so this is a trance
transformation of the dr. job and there
may be more doctors in the end because
if a doctor a doctor spends ten times
ten minutes with you on each visit now
they can spend you know 50 minutes they
can come to your home and visit you they
can show love and make you feel better
so now we've increased employment so
that's just an example but you could
have a brilliant concierge your tour
guide a masseuse a sushi chef
so all those jobs become irreplaceable
by a service job and you just mentioned
this in passing but you did share
publicly in 2013 you're diagnosed with
lymphoma and and you're in remission now
and you look great so I want to I want
to acknowledge that what do you what do
you tell the would you tell the
overachieving New York parents who say
you know outside on the streets here
rushing their kids off to two lessons in
school yeah you know they may ask you
like should might well show my child
study engineering how do we prepare our
kids for this uncertain future what
would you say to them I think that let
the kids study what they really do well
in death Talent right if they have if
there are a mathematical genius and
maybe they'll be the next person will
programs the next robots and make sure
it's benevolence right but but if
they're artistically inclined actually
arts and beauty is very hard to
replicate with AI maybe stay with what
let them stay with what they do given AI
is is is more objective analytical data
driven it's perhaps time for some of us
to switch to the humanities liberal arts
and beauty and maybe it's a lot of
professions that appear to have
difficult time finding a job are good to
study because the AI opens new new
frontiers right think about philosophy
sociology it all a I changes so it could
actually sift that could shift that were
so we're gonna go to questions in a few
minutes I want to ask you be sure to ask
you about the China's place in
artificial intelligence research and
applications and you mentioned at the
very beginning that China
represents something like 40% of the
academic papers published on AI at this
point from from very little actually not
that long ago right how would you assess
the the strength of China as an AI
breeding ground a center and it is it
positioned to surpass the position of
the US well the answer is yes and no
clearly if you measure the very very top
papers US and Canada that leads the
world by far yeah okay
however AI scientists tend to be very
open and sharing in nature they
published their papers and also their
results are very easily validated and
replicable it's unlike doing Biosciences
when all the chemical agents and I know
in the medical clinical trials Lane
things to speed the time in which you
can replicate the result if you read
someone's AI paper they'll usually tell
you what data said they use what network
they use you can pretty much in a week
replicate the same thing so this so this
is actually the the edge actually isn't
as large it's actually the seven black
holes who have the edge but we don't
know what edge they have because they're
not published in that problem they're
publishing some selectively yes okay so
but what company not comparing the seven
black holes were comparing US and China
u.s. is clearly ahead in academics but
it's not as large an edge as it would be
in other basic sciences secondly in
terms of applications and data China has
more data than in the u.s. right you
know a lot of apps that we fund
initially we're not AI companies you
know the may to is the public company
which many probably don't use but maybe
you've used Beauty plus makeup plus
those are also made by made to so
they're now being used across the world
with 1.3 billion users and that amount
of data will create a virtuous cycle so
I think and also you know in the future
there will be more Chinese cars perhaps
more Chinese autonomous vehicles that's
a larger market with more data is an
advantage that I think is very important
as important as having
scientists if not more so that's a
China's advantage the other thing is the
speed at which Chinese entrepreneurs
work hard and iterate when I take
companies I invest in to come visit
Silicon Valley there in all about the
creativity in Silicon Valley but they're
also shocked how few hours people work
in the Silicon Valley
so with this work ethic and dedication
in iteration and use of big data you
know I remember when I was a grad
student I felt I had a moral obligation
to keep the 40 servers that my boss has
in his department fully occupied running
jobs every day and that's how we achieve
the breaks during speech recognition
yeah and this may be this is kind of the
Chinese obsession with maximizing
productivity and work and this is the
way that all of our entrepreneurs work
so I think these were both well for
China in terms of using the massive data
hardworking entrepreneurs creating
economic value and one last advantage
that China has is a lot of the
industries are very backward you know
the u.s. quantitative trading is very
advanced to use AI to do better is
difficult but in China quantitative is
new in US credit card fraud without AI
is pretty good to use AI to beat it is
difficult but in China the credit card
fraud is not as good so there's a lower
bar for AI to beat and and also in the
u.s. there are a lot of enterprise
companies software companies already in
Chinese is nothing so so I think of that
as a glass half half full so that we can
have an opportunity to create AI
enterprise companies that will have huge
valuation and catch up because because
because AI is fundamentally an
enterprise play not a consumer play but
and are there any specific applications
or companies that are world leading in
China that we're not seeing here well
the three I mentioned are all world
leading you know face plus plus is the
world's best face recognition system I
think smart finance probably has one of
the best payday loan did AI
determination algorithms yeah may -
certainly has the most
best beautification algorithm it doesn't
lead to money directly but sound it well
I'm gonna ask one last question and then
we're gonna go to two questions from the
folks here and it's about the Chinese
internet players and you sort of alluded
to this I think there been a lot of
questions over the last few years to
what extent will Chinese the big Chinese
internet players Baidu tents and Alibaba
be successful outside of their home
market and to what extent will US and
European companies be have an
opportunity to succeed inside China what
how would you describe the state of that
yeah so this is my informed opinion and
conjecture that over the next five years
the Chinese companies will be very
successful in moving their technologies
and products to other developing
countries in particular Southeast Asia
perhaps perhaps South America we don't
know and also interestingly Middle East
and we're seeing early signs that the
Chinese app developers are here's the
reason China is like a glad that
gladiatorial competition to the death
when it comes to the app developers they
really fight hard and they work hard and
when you've survived in China you can
survive anywhere yeah so a lot of them
are also some of our finding it hard to
survive in China because of the
competition and they're finding a
competing overseas in other developing
countries to be not that hard also India
of course that's not southeast China so
that's a lot of developed developing
countries we're seeing that trend and
that a I will give them a further
strength to do that not necessarily by
Alibaba Tencent but smaller companies
and also companies they invest in
locally that borrow their technologies
so I kind of see in five years US
continues to solidify its leadership in
us english-speaking country
Canada Australia New Zealand Western
Europe possibly Japan and maybe possibly
Japan that will continue to be
solidified but it will us will lose
ground in terms of developing countries
we'll end up with two countries
dominating kind of two parts of the
world and US firms in China no no not
not likely there will be examples of
success right I mean if Facebook oculus
is really really good right there
microsoft hololens is really really good
I think the the example based success
will happen but I think a sweeping
success like you know at a level Baidu
Alibaba intention that's very hard
unlikely because a lot of people say is
you know protectionism I think that that
is no longer the main issue the main
issue is the the Chinese software stack
and user expectation is completely
different from the US so by taking any
new app and trying to take it on the
Chinese stack is actually very difficult
to implement and this is an issue for
Apple as well right in term no Apple
actually has its own stack yeah so I
think apples is maybe an exception but
we chat and other the 26 ecosystem
operates on the Android phones just as
well as on Apple phone yes so Apple is a
relatively complete stack in terms of
its you know payment microprocessor a
closed unit developer platform so it's a
little bit immune to the external but as
you said you know we chat and Apple are
having some disputes because the number
it's kind of like Microsoft a Mac 15
years ago yeah yeah might resolve as a
Mac right why should I do your platform
and and then and then they have they
they both have the nuclear weapon on
each other yeah so they'll have to work
something out that's a that's a I think
a singular case that's interesting to
study I don't see it generalize a lot
okay all right so we're going to take
questions here but just raise your hand
we have a microphone if you could just
say your name and your organization
briefly and Erica do you want to
okay I parry you and I work for Ithaca
which is digital innovation in higher
education my question is how do you
think about the ethics of AI you've
touched on the moral implications but
when we think about for example the use
of student data we wrestle with what's
fair game and what's not how do we
advise universities so I'm curious to
see have you heard of a role of an AI
ethicist if so we're in hell thank you I
think that is a role where US will
establish leadership and show the rest
of the world III see there's a lot of
advocacy for privacy concerned for
safety and and I think that's an area
that that we can only look to us for
leadership and is is there are some
obvious things one could imagine right
that you you can't sell private data
you can't barter private data you can't
use it to do fraudulent or illegal
things those are obvious things one
could do but I think in terms of privacy
in general largely speaking all of us
are trading some degree of our privacy
for convenience and I think for most of
us there's a balancing act that's
generally acceptable so I think for the
ethicists it would be a question of how
to let us keep most if not all of the
conveniences while avoiding privacy data
to be used in illegal or hurtful ways I
don't have anything more profound than
hope if you have ideas please teach me
over here and then we'll work our way I
am Paul Steiger from repÃºblica how do
you think about elements that can
frustrate this vision for example
inequality
dystopian impulses I mean we're seeing
right now but the hacking you know not
done by a superpower maybe it was North
Korea who knows who it was but it it
hacking is become a sport that you know
more and more individual players can
engage in also frustration at at
inequality
you know we use a positive social
impulse to redistribute these this extra
value that you're creating that's
wonderful but we're seeing right now the
Republican Party in control of the US
government for now is pushing toward
more inequality with tax cuts for the
rich and and so on so one can imagine
frustration that can lead to damaging
destroying frustrating these these these
systems yeah let me list many more
frustrations and then we can work
together on the solution I'm very
concerned about the companies that have
massive amounts of this hacking is one
issue that's obviously a big issue but
I'm also worried about companies that
have massive amounts of data all under
its black box none of us know what
they're doing with it
they could be doing things that hurt our
possessions our health we just don't
know they could be extracting privacy
data selling it we it's invisible to us
how do you manage control and regulate
that I think that that's an issue I
think the inequality I worry a lot about
the 50 percent workforce I gave what I
thought was one possible solution but
this is easier this said than done
you know not every factory worker can
more of him or herself into a you know a
sushi chef or a masseuse right and and
if that doesn't happen then you know
while we on the Maslow's hierarchy we've
solved the hunger problem and
the subsistence problem we have not
solved the self-actualization problem
people would be frustrated they'll go to
the streets how and also another
worrisome scenario is another technology
VR will come along so in you know three
or five years they can put on the glass
and just go live in an alternate world
essentially live in the matrix world or
you know live in the world where they
can kill monsters or become the king or
or have three girlfriends or whatever
her and that's not healthy for the brain
development of people I also worry about
certain certain famous people like Elon
Musk
talking about the need for us to become
cyborgs and while one can't
scientifically prove whether that's
likely or plausible or not I think I
worry if all of us go in that direction
then any degree of our spiritual heart
or humanity may be eradicated so I'm
afraid there are many many things to
worry about I think the first step we
can do is to to educate people on the
practical engineering realities of AI
which is what I try to do today focus on
the real problems that will happen and
real issues that may arise and the real
capabilities and limitations of AI today
I I would prefer for the engineering
minded people like myself to saw to try
to focus on the problems that will
surely happen as opposed to the
hypothetical problems that may or may
not happen and certainly not to create
more hypothetical problems that may
become self-fulfilling prophecy so I
think we've got so many problems I would
prefer to focus on the ones that are a
certainty I think that 50% unemployment
is a certainty I think some companies
with large data doing evil is a
certainty those are the probably the two
I would personally focus on because I
think we might be able to do something
about it and and also because they're
happening with a certainty so we better
look at it education
a third one I think we got to do because
even if this generation of displaced
workers will be hard to move into a new
job there's no excuse not to let the
five-year-old have the right education
so that he or she will have the
opportunity that he or she deserves I'm
gonna take a few more questions so we're
gonna take a question from Facebook live
hi my name is Beth Hanzo I work here at
ports so we have been taking questions
from Facebook and Damon Lau who's
joining us from Utah asks about the
intersection of AI and virtual reality
and how these two technologies could be
either used together or how they also
might conflict sure I think in virtual
reality speech becomes a very viable
interface as a speech scientist I
struggle a lot on where speech can be
used speech transcription is the one
place that I use speech but speech
understanding is so so hard and and and
people using tactile interfaces seem to
beat speech every time so I think in the
virtual environment it's likely to have
interactions with other people and other
elements and and also it's kind of a
eyes and hands busy scenario so I think
speech based interfaces might be
interesting also I think the natural the
natural combination is you know while we
are I know a lot of you watch Westworld
right I think the West world as a next
step is unlikely because the robotic
expectations are too large the West
world in the virtual reality is much
more possible and and I think on the one
hand is so much fun on the other hand I
worry about the obsession that it will
create and the clearly requires AI to
build Westworld you need both VR nai and
that's probably a virtual West world in
in in in all the variances of that term
will probably be the next big killer app
that combines VR in AI and I personally
worry a lot about the degree of
addiction such a game will have and the
consequence is our society great okay
thank you my name is melody worked for
the World Economic Forum the digital
economy and society team thank you for
your sharing I also learned that lately
you have your new book out with the
artificial intelligence and today I got
to learn your insights about AI privacy
and many other new technology in the
industry my question to you is so what's
your view about the role of regulation
in enhancing and cultivating an
environment for innovation while finding
the right balance for what's directly
what's not yeah I think regulation is
clearly needed and all the way from the
privacy issues that came up earlier to
the misuse of data to what basic is
regulating the regulations largely over
large companies with lots of power I
think is needed I think we should debate
regulation on issues like you know
autonomous vehicles all the way to
autonomous weapons I think we're
entitled have different views but that
should be that's it as if that's
important I also think the speed at
which regulation will take to be vetted
and passed by the various some Congress
or a court or whatever will tend to be
too slow to have an impact as we saw the
Department of Justice in the US on
Microsoft the European Union on Google
they they worked hard but their speed
just didn't match the speed at which
technology marketplace took so I think
we can't just sound great rely on
regulation I think in the media like
courts should supervise and exposed
issues to all of us and one last point I
would raise is that I really want to
appeal to anyone on Facebook live in
here who think about open source because
you know remember when we had the Wintel
duopoly we're all so frustrated I worked
at SGI and Apple I could not begin any
innovation to happen ultimately I
interviewed that Microsoft Intel and
accept and I got two job offers and I
went to Microsoft I gave in but but I
watched with amazement that over the 10
years after I joined Microsoft the open
source movement through the the geek
spirit in the world an open community
and the spirit of sharing
through things like you know github and
also in parallel Wikipedia it shows that
wisdom the crowd and that's that
well-meaning normal people can take down
these monopolies or companies with
extraordinary power so I hope in the
space of AI there's some equivalent open
source movement that doesn't just make
the codebase open but also makes data
more open so that academia can do
advanced research so that smaller
companies can hope to compete against
the giants so we're actually just out of
just about out of time I'm gonna ask one
last question which I want to come back
to and thank you for your questions I'm
sorry we don't gonna have more time but
you're welcome to to stay after you
mentioned Elon Musk and I think a lot of
us it's very easy thanks to Hollywood to
concoct er up a scenario a very
dystopian scenario where the robots have
taken over and human beings are really
no longer in control and it's a violent
and just you know just sort of
disturbing scenario often Arnold
Schwarzenegger is in those movies yes
and so my question is can we keep Arnold
Schwarzenegger around long enough to to
save us from this actually my real
question is how like how concerned are
you you know Stephen Hawking Elon Musk a
bunch of very smart people who have
voiced pretty serious concerns about
where this is all headed I I think is
completely valid to voice concerns all
the concerns we raised were other
concerns I would prefer to focus on the
concerns with certainty than the
concerns that are hypothetical but I do
want to comment on that I think today
the engineering reality is that AI is
just a tool a tool that we control or
whoo that we program AI optimizes to an
objective function that we tell it it
doesn't come up with that function and
we have the ultimate power to pull the
plug from AI so we've got a lot of
control right now I think we should be
cautious not to give up that control but
today there is no sign no
engineering certain sign that AI is
about to gain self-consciousness all the
extrapolation about number of neurons
that could be equal singularity I would
say there is no engineering basis for
that there might be hypothetical belief
and people are entitled to that so given
that AI are just tools I think we should
focus on the problems of today and I
think the I'd like to believe that a a
eyes are just tools - the tools will get
better 3 there will displace jobs for
figuring out the job displacement
solution is what we should focus our
time on and 5 I propose that service
jobs with our hearts is something AI
cannot replace so that would be an
alternate ending to e Lamas story that's
a great wrap up to the discussion I
would add to your takeaways fried
chicken is coming on demand in 15 years
fire your private banker and hire some
algorithms neurotic New York parents
shouldn't only force their kids to study
engineering and journalists should
really keep working really hard to get
better and better to outrun the AI
that's going to inevitably replace us
and one last comment is that based on
your summary you're not going to get
replaced okay thank you very much thanks
for them thank you for doing this
really
thank you very much that was fun that
was great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
