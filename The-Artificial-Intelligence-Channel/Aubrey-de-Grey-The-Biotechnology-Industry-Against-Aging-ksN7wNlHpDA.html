okay
so why don't you kick us off are we
going about disease in entirely the
wrong way and should we be stopping
people from aging in the first place and
therefore stopping them from getting
sick all together of course we should
however this is quite complicated
question in sense of you know it's
considered for my investment point of
view so for me age in contrary to
general science this is not a theory it
is not a Skyfire movie it is not
something like who to restate for me
this business and we are considering and
analyzing all this technologists
significant breakthroughs and tangible
measurable way into a Trank
forecast and predict in in this way and
therefore we are considering these three
stages of practical implementation of
these technologies and treatments we can
be confident that for example personally
in five to ten years horizon there will
be a lot of acknowledged treatments
practical presentation of the
straightness which will be which will
give us life extension capabilities
which will be evaluated and validated
with these capabilities
meanwhile in next 1 2 3 years
I think there will be a lot of progress
on the other side on the side of digital
medicine on the side of ITT Flores
different medical devices and
specifically book chanting order and
artificial internal rotation turns not
only for health care not only for
consumer side but also for drug
discovery for indeed and the second
stage we can expect that it will be
probably in three to five years because
all these implementations of novel
technologies digital health are too
intense
they will bring us much more better
understanding how we can develop panel
of biomarkers of aging so because having
that really clear biomarkers really
tangible biomarkers of aging will give
us too
santé leverages to accelerate
development of freely well working
technologies for life extension but
don't know not only for that extension
in general but first of all for
extension of health period of life which
is much more important on like
short-term no for short-term growth
there's much more important rather than
to speak about just life extension
because extension even on average for
five to ten years health peel the wife
will bring a lot of benefits for society
and will save a lot of life so let's I
mean Joseph sorry isn't that the point
really that the you know we're quite
good at making people live for longer
already but what we're not good at doing
is from stopping them from aging can you
hear me so I'm here as a CEO of a nutri
which is a spinoff from the University
of Southern California and going back to
your question some twenty three years
ago at the universal in California we uh
we decided to launch a war against aging
and for us it was obvious that you don't
get Alzheimer's at age 22 you don't get
your first diabetes type 2 at age 20 and
aging is really the catalyst behind
these diseases and 23 years ago up to 15
years ago we wanted to understand how we
age and the cellular level so that we do
something for the aging process and this
is one of our founder professor Longo if
you're familiar with that name started
looking at the cellar pathways of Aging
how the cell goes for an aging process
versus an into aging process and this is
the age where we identified the
relationship between aging and the PK
and the RAF's pathway and since your
canyon are they in defied the Tor
pathway and after this this phase we
said okay what intervention can we apply
to slow the aging process or to enhance
the quality of the aging process and we
came across fasting and fasting is not a
new notion for you in the UK the UK
media coverage cover fasting fasting
pretty extensively and we discovered
that if you fast the body for several
days in a row as a reaction the body
starts
as a defense and this has been built
through hundreds of thousands of years
of human evolution where food was scarce
from time to time in absent actually
very frequently the body reacts in to
getting rid of the elderly cells who are
not very cost effective from a calories
than the standpoint spending the
calories and pushes the stem cells to
the places those so there's a stem cell
regeneration process which we described
we've patented and we had a preclinical
any clinical trial on we're actually
really happy to have the very first
preclinical and clinical trials
completed on Aging in house pen and
publish in cell and science and
chelation translational medicine and a
now as of last year we were able to
develop what we call that fasting
mimicking light it's difficult to fast
for five days nowadays with all the
marketing and and the food marquee were
talking about so we're able to develop a
very natural plan base fasting mimicking
via the food that you will eat over five
days mimics fasting and actually
reverses your biological age again the
only the only technology word with a
pattern or Aging in the preclinical and
clinical trial on it so it's extremely
exciting for us and the product has been
launched in the UK just two months ago
have really covered by the year so
really excited we brought it to to the
UK and the second country after the US
and for those of you who are interested
is called prologue PR Olo and so going
back to your question yes it's not only
thinking about aging we're making it a
reality and it's up for us today to
create the market for it I think what
Dimitri was relating to is we need to
invest in that market we need to make it
a to have a overcome the policy
challenges we all hear about aging but
how would you pass a drug for aging the
FDA doesn't recognize aging as a disease
and aging is not a disease as a catalyst
of diseases how to position aging as a
pre disease setting so that the FDA
helps us with that with with processing
and filing in that in that regard create
a market for it and then have additional
investments and the focus from the NIH
and the big grantees to boost that space
Alex how far away are we do you think
from the FDA and others sort of
recognizing that aging is some
thing that needs to have products and
services approved for it well I think
that we are already at the stage where
the FDA and the regulators and the
academic and your community and the
pharma is considering aging seriously
there is a study called the same study
targeting aging with metformin led by
NIR Barzilai out of the Albert Einstein
College of Medicine and it's a very
important study for everybody it's one
of the kind of oldest dogs trying to
learn the new tricks
metformin I think a lot of people maybe
in this room are taking metformin and
this study is going to show whether bit
Foreman has anti-aging properties as a
drug and set standards for clinical
trials and clinical trials and Roland
practices for a study which also
measures Aging in general I think so our
company is an artificial intelligence
company and many of the pharmaceutical
companies here know us as a service
provider for drug discovery so we were
the first to publish and the first to
validate a technology called generative
of the serial networks are the
application of this technology to
generating new molecular structures so
you give us a target and we generate a
molecule for you that you can synthesize
it has very high probability of hearing
this target and making a perfect drug
but I think that the pharmaceutical
model where you have just one target one
disease it's fundamentally wrong so by
studying aging and by looking at it as a
systemic process everybody in this room
has aging not everybody has cancer not
everybody has Alzheimer's not everybody
has diabetes but everybody has aging so
it's a set of many biological processes
that happen at the same time so you can
look at this phenomenon as a systemic
condition progressing systemic condition
so you can start training the neural
networks to recognize your age at every
level
transcriptome proteome just pictures
very many people just underestimate the
value of pictures even I think the
photograph as well is more valuable than
your genome because you can derive a lot
more information from it using deep
neural Nets and I think aging research
would drive Farman into more systemic
applications of well drug discovery
multi targeting drug discovery and it's
happening right now
so in some countries in Korea in China
people are seriously thinking about
focusing on AI and longevity from the
regulatory perspective as well OB I mean
how interested is farmer in the space of
anti-aging given the sort of potential I
supposed for it to really disrupt its
own business model I feel that Big
Pharma is kind of waiting and seeing
but it's waiting and saying and paying a
lot of attention
essentially Big Pharma appreciates that
medicine is changing and especially that
we are developing and increasingly and
eventually a decisively comprehensive
panel of ways to eliminate the ill
health associated with old age and that
those things are going to dominate the
the nature of medicine in the relatively
near future
so of course Big Pharma has to be
anticipating that but at the same time
Big Pharma has to be you know
maintaining a situation normal in the
current situation before these therapies
come along so it's a kind of you know a
slightly subtle situation I don't think
that it is fair to suggest simply the
big phone would be opposed to this
translation this transformation of
medicine I think you know like any
company or any industry big phone will
follow the money and will follow the
developments that happen insofar as
their customers follow those
developments and it's really just a
matter of being ready for it so I don't
think we should be necessarily scared of
Big Pharma slowing things down I want to
also emphasize what was already
mentioned about the time
on metformin the casing for me about
that tries not so much the fact that
it's metformin you know because you
really we have no idea whether that's
going to work in fact I would be quite
surprised personally if there were
particularly substantial benefit from
that falling but the key thing is that
the trial has been structured in such a
way as to be a trial against where the
outcome is Aging in all but name
you know FDA don't know what aging is
and so they have to so there was a long
period of you know discussion and
negotiation between the FDA and the
group of academics led by their Barzilai
who proposed the trial but eventually
they come up what came up with a rather
subtle and sophisticated combinatorial
outcome definition which is as good as a
definition of Aging without actually
using the word I think that's a huge
advance in fact I feel that you know
terminology has been a huge obstacle in
this whole field for a long time but the
idea has been terribly entrenched in
people's heads that there is some kind
of undefined phenomenon called the aging
process which is somehow distinct from
the diseases of old age and this is
terribly well first of all inaccurate
biologically but it's also terribly
damaging and kind of productive it leads
people companies were however
researchers in wrong directions with
regard to the attempt to develop
interventions so the company I'm
representing here Ajax therapeutics is
focused on the application to various
aspects of age-related ill health of
stem cells lineage committed progenitor
cells that have been developed with
unusually high purity so that first to
minimize the risk of unintended effects
like cancer from from contamination by
inadequately differentiated cells that
might do the wrong thing and this is a
major part of the panel that we're going
to need to to address the ill health of
old age properly because there are
various aspects
of virtually a little house that are
driven by cells just going away and not
being replaced by cell division obvious
ones like Parkinson's disease
you lose dopaminergic neurons in the
substantia nigra and also plenty of less
obvious ones there are lots of pacemaker
cells of the heart things like that um
these are things that need to be
addressed by technologies that are also
already being developed for the
treatment of other things that are
legitimately called diseases and if we
want to call it aging that we're
addressing then okay but ultimately what
we have to recognize is that we're doing
repair of the self inflicted damage that
the body does to itself throughout life
and therefore that we are effectively
developing comprehensive rejuvenation
but what this gets away from it's the
idea that there's some unitary concept
of the fundamental aging process and
therefore that the might in principle be
some unitary single magic bullet that
would you know in a coordinated way slow
things down number of people are
interested in trying to promote that
idea in order to make money but the fact
is that the only things that we're ever
likely to develop that are you tree in
that kind of way will be things that
have only a very modest indeed impact on
how long people can stay healthy okay
I've got a couple of questions after all
of that but before that we have a
polling question having heard what
you've all heard in that sort of opening
gambit when do you think regulators I
suppose we're talk about the US here
will approve the first anti-aging drug
and there's a bunch of different time
periods so pick the one that best suits
your opinion you talk about this sort of
an inflection point that pharma
companies are going to have to go
through surely society is as well and is
already short of cash to pay for all the
illness that affects sick people so
where is the money going to come from to
stop people from getting sick in the
first place I mean
to take take that big potato hot potato
go go ahead well I think in if you track
farmer for the last 20 years most of the
new or the innovation coming out of
farmer was shop out of farmer small
small researchers that through the three
NIH money for example you know you have
a good thirty billion dollar per year
and that comes at no risk of
shareholders pushing you for the outcome
so a lot of the real innovations coming
from different corners of different
universities trying new things and and
taking risks and and I think we could
well see the next into aging product
coming out of one of these shops and
it's not so much the investment because
now we do recognize the importance of
aging and actually it's going to be the
biggest market and health care every one
of us has aging and a fraction of us
will have each one of the chronic
diseases the problem is going to be the
FDA but it seems that there is going to
be flexible recognizing the socio
economic value of aging the problems
gonna be reimbursed Minh have an aging
product whether it's a drug whether its
food whether it's a it's a service who's
gonna pay for it every day or every week
or every month whatever that
prescription is and Pharma takes less
risk when there's no clear path to
reimbursement regulatory and there
embracement so I do believe the product
is gonna come from one of the risk takes
taking researchers with grants but then
the more we get clarity on regulatory
and reimbursement
the Morrigan to see Pharma taking risk
there or shopping for these pockets of
research and then having a market
established they're quite a sort of
variance of results there but an
optimistic room four to six years has
got the biggest Bo's that over a quarter
view so yeah I mean III agree with what
I've said I think though that there
really isn't going to be much headwind
associated with all of this so my other
affiliation is a sense Research
Foundation which is a non-profit based
in California and we created as a
nonprofit because ten years ago Oh Bob
we were working
things which were at two earlier stage
to be invested even by the more
visionary high-risk high-reward type
invested but that's no longer true
I mean somewhat true foundation still
has an essential role is the kind of
engine room of the industry but we've
been able to spin out quite a lot of
projects now into startup companies and
their other startup companies of course
it's not that's actually directly with
us but in our space and you know major
very successful very influential
investors are getting heavily involved
in this now since we're in London I
should probably mention Jim Mellon who
is of course a well-known and very
successful British investor and who has
put a lot of effort into into educating
other investors communicating to the
investor community he decided in the
past couple of years to get heavily
involved in this space what he perceived
was very much the next big thing he's
taking the trouble to write a whole book
about it called juvenescence
you know this is the kind of people who
are going to be the opinion form is the
drive of all of this and that's the
investment community grows through you
know through the influence of these
pioneers like gem I think we're going to
see all of the players in all sectors of
the industry however you know by
whatever means they are the money
they're making their money they're going
to see that it's in their interest to
adapt as rapidly as everybody else's so
I see this change happening a lot first
then it may look at this point right now
we see massive technology convergence
and also massive for funding convergence
from multiple sources so you also see or
some government funding going into aging
related areas one of my hobbies is
tracking government funds actually just
to understand where the trends are you
can go to a resource called Pharma
cognitive comm unit eek-eek keyword and
see the funding trends from the nih
european commission many countries and
if you look at the amount of government
funding going to biomedicine in general
its so increasing very very quickly so
it might seem that the government is not
doing much but if you look at China
Japan there is massive investment in
by a medicine in general and lots of
this investment goes into Aging
associated diseases age-related diseases
so many scientists they do not call
themselves aging scientists but they
contribute more to the field of
anti-aging well I don't like the term
the field of longevity research then
people who actually claim to be working
specifically in this field also large
technology giants like Google Facebook
right now there is a major revolution in
deep learning so if you are not in deep
learning right now you are already late
to the table and now again the power of
the picture just the image of the face
link to other biomarker data is
extremely valuable so soon you're gonna
use selfies for clinical trials
enrollment I hope a massive massive for
effort is being done on the part of
technology giants are to advance deep
learning so that's kind of putting many
companies like us for example at the
forefront of artificial intelligence
research when we focus on aging as a
biological process and then we train on
diseases so that gives us a lot of tools
another major effort has done within
Pharma so if you look at companies like
Novartis for example a really great
company which actually has an aging
research group inside internally they
also find new business models to go
after they just recently completed
published a study in Science
Translational Medicine giving everolimus
to healthy elderly people as a vacuum
potential and the spun off that company
fun of that as a company so it's rot
zero zero one study and they are
focusing on muscle wasting so active
receptor inhibitor inhibitors so
kapeniak classified as a disease just
recently so most likely we're gonna see
some drugs coming out of that area and
lots of efforts on the part of
pharmaceutical firm silicon industry in
age-related diseases so a lot of that is
going to overflow into the just general
NJIT revolution one of the things that
also
we're all shopping for for for aging is
how to measure in a biological age or
the age process if you know as Peter
Drucker says if you if you measure you
manage and one of the things that can
attract maybe the the investors then
reimbursement and also the FDA is how to
measure aging if if you have an
intervention for aging how can you be
sure that this is effective and and fast
because ideally you're not going to wait
until the end of the person's life to do
that in in measuring biological aging is
something we see a lot of movements and
a lot of companies Alex allude a little
bit of the phenotype and the pictures we
have other you know methylation methods
they're gonna see a lot of movements in
so that's exciting that's big exciting
news for us
once we're gonna measure biological
aging in track it I think and you see a
lot of investment a lot of movements
Iran you know finding what is the what
is what eight hba1c and glycemia for
diabetes what is that metric for aging
and biological aging regarding by Marcus
raging and the plank really strong court
official interest for this topic I'm
quite common that first of all to be in
silicon medicine for everyone because it
is in this fluid one of the strongest
comments a plank partition journals for
drug discovery but in particular for
biomarkers and particular biomarkers
aphasia which is other companies I'd
know only one another company which is
trying to do sonic a similar in this in
space now regarding to go back to
dispute as Financial Field on rarity if
to consider and rev it as a business
so I'm supporting several nonprofit
foundations in particular budget or the
Research Foundation the UK foundation so
during last year we were working on
creating mind map and of longevity
industry and the science from religion
and we created mine were absent list of
one hunt companies we should working in
the space which are working on energy
for some correlate with precision
preventive personalized medicine
regenerative medicine and aging in
general
also a graded list of 100 alla borders
and R&amp;amp;D centers and 100 number of
foundations so actually we create the
entire mind map of all this you see
including 100 top investors including in
not only so there are some let's say
ultra high-net-worth individuals who
understand can such technology earth
stage but also several venture funds and
some of them already special
specifically tuned for longevity
resource and companies which are working
in this space this this report it's
actually already 800 police report we
are considering that it will be kinda
like Wikipedia or Encyclopedia
Britannica riveting industry it will be
published in December on our very good
international website so you mentioned
ultra high-net-worth individuals there
one of the things that this field
suffers from I I think is the sense that
it's a billionaires playground and it's
going to sort of be there for rich
people and then maybe developed nations
but not for for sort of poor of people
and isn't that a big problem when you're
actually stopping people from getting
sick because then you really do have the
haves and the have-nots really totally
overblown this gets concerned the fact
is the world we have today in which we
can't basically do anything about the
ill health of old age is a world in
which we spend the most insane amount of
money trying to help people as best we
can when they're in that six state that
they get into when they were born a long
time ago and therefore if and when as
and when we develop medicines that stop
people from getting into that state
those medicines will pay for themselves
insanely rapidly insanely many times
over and governments and other you know
decision makers are going to know that
they're going to see that they're going
to be well aware of it even before the
medicines actually arrived so there is
not going to be any any you know lag
that the front-loaded invest
that's going to be required to ensure
that everybody who is old enough levy
therapies can get them their respective
ability to pay is going to be provided
even in really tax averse countries like
the USA simply because as wave for
example basic education which is also
free even in the USA right you know it's
just going to be seen to be a no-brainer
in fact not just a no-brainer but an
absolute leader no mandate that even
ignoring the humanitarian imperative the
sheer mercenary economic logic
arithmetic says that you'll go bankrupt
if you don't do this so yeah I don't
think that the faintest possibility that
any well certainly any developed country
will have any kind of stratification of
access to these therapies and any
questions from from the audience on this
topic everyone's too young to care so
one question I was going to ask is we've
heard over and over again these last
couple of days about how taking an
illness and sort of segmenting it into
lots of smaller illnesses is really the
way that you get get results and yet
here we are talking about aging which is
perhaps the biggest illness or biggest
health problem of all and as you say
affects everybody so what attempts have
there been to try to take Aging and
really split it into as many possible
fields as possible to get the kind of
results we've had in cancer and rare
diseases you have to remember is that
the fashionable thing today personalized
medicine you know all that kind of thing
this is a stopgap you we don't have
personalized polio vaccines and the
reason we don't is because the generic
polio vaccine just works the only reason
to have personalized medicine is to
optimize things that don't really work
so it's not really a dichotomy in the
way that you're describing what we're
doing now is it makes it you know in in
terms of personalizing and splitting
things up is you know it makes sense
with what we have today but it will
naturally go away and favor
a more unified Network approach so to
speak with the treats ageing is what
actually is the you know that the whole
the whole interaction of the various
damage accumulation processes that
eventually overwhelm the body and make
us not well any other source yeah I mean
I think it depends on the intervention
that's gonna end up happening so I'll
take two examples you know there's a lot
of research today on the Tor pathway an
mTOR pathway for aging and that's one
pathway within the cell that does not
mainly work on the pique or the rass
pathway fasting for example works on the
three pathways so it's going to depend
on the technology itself and what's
going to work on is it's gonna be a
systemic one which is I think what what
Audrey is referring to it will age in a
systemic level or is it going to be a
partial into aging you know intervention
is gonna work on a few pathways it's not
gonna be ideal but it could help and
this is probably what metformin is gonna
end up doing or a repla mice and product
on an mTOR pathway versus a fasting
which you know historically we all had
to go through periods of no food and the
body reacts epigenetically the same way
to save us so there are more systemic
versus more pathway dependent
intervention and we'll see which one
gets first to market and whether that's
gonna be an tailored or or systemic
intervention I think we're gonna see
both and I hope that in the very near
future we're gonna see first more
targeted approaches again we're
targeting sarcopenia diabetes
Alzheimer's both on the treatment and
prevention to establish the business
models for the pharmaceutical industry
and I'm very concerned right now about
this movement of food as medicine sorry
for kind of saying that after the
previous session because people start
thinking that they can treat cancer with
food and you know if you think about
advances like pd-1 PDL ones delay for
checkpoint inhibitors how much that
impacted cancer research it's a
completely transformed eye cancer
therapy so food is not going to make us
significantly younger or live
significantly longer or prevent diseases
and you're gonna have those anyway so I
hope that the pharmaceutical industry
will finally find new business models to
address for his diseases of aging and
then go into more systemic approach but
not with food maybe with something else
yeah we we actually have trials on food
versus versus medicine and I'm happy to
show you some of it is not published
and food can do as much or even better
actually then most medicines and and
I'll share those privately but I have
actually different been have a big faith
in food again food is something you
inject into your body at least three
times a day and that's gonna determine
mostly what's gonna end up happening to
your body and food could drive aging
faster or slower and implement
inflammation etc so I think farmers
going to come up with a more if you want
deeper arrow working on pathways but
aging is such a systemic process they
cannot solve it one or two pathways
fasting or food or medical food is gonna
have a system again adventure that can
help a lot it's gonna end up being both
but I'm a big believer in the food you
know impact on on Aging and in chronic
diseases okay well it will have to leave
it there it's a little bit longer to
lunch but I hope I see people fasting at
lunchtime and thank you very much that
was fascinating I really enjoyed it
thank you
and now back to
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
