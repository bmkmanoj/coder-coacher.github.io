thank Smithsonian associates for
inviting me back this is my second
appearance for the group the first one
was about someone who maybe a little bit
more familiar to all of you Albert
Einstein a couple years ago I gave a
talk about Albert Einstein and I think
it's fair to say that everybody knows
who Albert Einstein is so if you see
this face on a poster on a t-shirt
everybody immediately recognizes Albert
Einstein probably the most famous
physicists of the 20th century but I'm
gonna be talking about two other
physicists today Richard Fineman and
John Wheeler who some of you may not
have heard of some of you may have be
familiar with with their work but most
people today are not so familiar with
Fineman and wheeler as with Albert
Einstein
so Fineman made a name for himself in
the 1970s and 1980s he did some
television shows where he explained
science to the general public he was on
the BBC he was on some American programs
and he had a knack for explaining
science so that's why some people call
him the great explainer wheeler wasn't
as well known among the general public
but he did publish some popular science
books and he also was amazing at
explaining things to the general public
he was on some television shows as well
including a brief history of time which
was the film about Stephen Hawking but
he was also in science shows on PBS and
other channels you see him with his
favorite venue a blackboard he really
enjoyed drawing diagrams and explaining
them and that was one of his things
many people remember richard fineman
during the 1980s for the Challenger
disaster Commission called the Rogers
Commission President Reagan appointed
him along with Neil Armstrong and other
people other scientists to investigate
the space shuttle Challenger disaster
and finally made a name for himself then
because he disagreed with the panel's
conclusion he thought the panel's
conclusion was too light and he thought
that there was a direct reason for the
disaster that had to do with something
called the o-rings of the shuttle he
thought they were manufacturing properly
and we see a picture of him an image of
him with an o-ring dipping it into ice
water showing that it was brittle when
it experienced called which was he
thought the cause of the Challenger
disaster and he wrote his own report a
separate report from the Commission
explaining that and this was this was
quite a surprising to people is openness
but people who knew him knew that he was
somebody who was very blunt for his
straightforward and always investigating
science always trying to get at the
roots of things Fineman was also
well-known in the 1960s for winning the
1965 Nobel Prize so this is a Nobel
Prize he won here's a more serious
picture of him and then here is Fineman
with the queen of Sweden and we see how
happy is to be at the Nobel Prize
ceremony his favorite part was the
dancing and he wasn't so keen on being
honored
he thought that physics was an honor in
of itself but he was willing to go over
to Sweden accept the prize and it was
kind of a mixed blessing for him he
didn't really want to be known as a
noble laureate he'd rather be known as
and everyday
everyman a common person with
extraordinary gifts who could surprise
people something like a magician
who could pull tricks out of his hi and
that was richard fineman he was someone
who wanted to be one of the guys a
common person but then at the same time
somebody with extraordinary tricks that
could surprise and shock people
so phiman was known in some ways as much
for his unconventionality as for his
physics so we see some typical poses of
Fineman here is a picture of him with
his bongo drums he loved to drum he
would stay up all night with his bongos
drums or conga drums and play into the
night so people knew that he was around
because it could hear his loud drumming
here is a picture of him portrait of him
at a costume party
he went to an annual costume party that
was run by his student al Hibbs al Hibbs
was also known as the voice of JPL the
voice of the California Jet Propulsion
lab part of NASA and Al Hibbs used to
have these themed parties and this was
one of the themed parties and was
dresses your favorite religious figure
and firemen dressed as a Himalayan monk
at the party and an artist was there and
she painted him and you can see him
holding a thunderbolt which seems
appropriate for somebody who's religious
but also it's shaped like one of his
diagrams one of his scientific diagrams
so it's really a very clever painting we
see here on the right him in a Caltech
play he was involved in the annual
Caltech musicals and this one was very
special
this was South Pacific he played the
chief of Bali Hai and the story behind
this actually heard personally from
fineman's director there's a wonderful
woman named Shirley Mawr Gnaeus who ran
the plays at Caltech and some years
before this she was staging a play and
she needed somebody to play drums and a
student producer of the play said how
about Richard Fineman
and she said Who and they said Richard
Fineman and she said okay well if you if
this professor can come and play the
drums he can participate in the play and
then she found out some more about
firemen and she realized that he was a
Nobel laureate and she got all
intimidated and when she met him she
said hello dr. Fineman and he said no
just call me dick I don't want any
pretense and that's the way he was he
wanted no pretense and he also wanted in
a in a position like a drummer or a
performer he didn't want people to refer
to as physics he wanted them to think of
him as someone different because he
wanted to amaze people in so many
different ways not just through his
physics but also through acting or
drumming or music all different things
language ability he liked people to be
surprised that he knew skill and and he
knew it so well so the story behind this
particular play South Pacific is that
this happened just a few weeks after he
had surgery in which he almost lost his
life this was cancer surgery in the
early 1980s and he needed more than 100
pints of blood because a blood vessel
near his heart burst and students
donated the blood and there was an
amazing blood drive and he survived and
then a couple weeks later it was to play
and he wasn't gonna do it
Shirley Marius talked him into it and
his wife talked him into it and he had a
scar from the surgery and Shirley
Marni's said to him well actually this
part the chief of Bali Hai calls for
somebody who's heroic that would dive
into a pool to rescue some pearls from a
maid and come back up and maybe in the
process get bit by a crocodile and
that's where you got your scar dick and
fireman said oh really well I guess I
should do the play
so he got up and and did he only had
enough energy to call out some lines in
tahitian he learned something he ssin
for the play and he called out drummers
player do your thing on stage to the
drummers and when the spotlight was on
him all of a sudden everybody was
completely shocked here was a guy who
famously or you know disturbingly almost
lost his life and the blood drive saved
him
and now a few weeks later he was up on
stage so they just got up and gave him a
standing ovation and that that was
Fineman and then here's him speaking to
a commencement address in Caltech now to
John Wheeler who was a much more quiet
subdued figure John Wheeler was always
in a suit in a tie almost had the
mannerism of a preacher somebody who's
soft-spoken dry/wet tell very dry jokes
this is john wheeler being honored by
President Johnson for the Fermi award as
it's his typical pose with some papers
he taking down though it's very very
quiet and very conservative in his
outward appearance but inside he was
much more radical than Fineman he was
extraordinarily wild in his ideas he
thought about the whole universe and
tried to remake the universe
fundamentally from scratch and
throughout his life he'd go through
different phases where he would think
what is the fundamental ingredient of
the universe what is the one element
that the universe is made of and he went
through different ideas throughout his
life and he would become driven by that
to try to explore the implications of
that as much as possible and then he
would draw all these diagrams these wild
diagrams and you see he would fill up a
blackboard from left to right with his
wild diagrams including things like
black holes
wormholes and so forth and explain these
and he was revolutionary in that sense
and a lot of the ideas we see today in
physics like black holes wormholes
quantum physic physics ideas come from
John Wheeler and his students so from
his clever mind came things like
wormholes connections between different
parts of space-time the black holes have
no hair theorem saying that no matter
what you put into a black hole you see a
stool flour a television set a rock
throw all those things into a black Hall
but a black hole can only tell you three
things about itself its mass its charge
and its rate of rotation only those
three things and wheeler compare that to
something like a marine or soldier who
only could report his name rank and
serial number and imagines kind of sort
of the uniform shaped heads of such
soldiers and that's why he said black
holes have no hair so that's a quote
from him that black holes are
indistinguishable and here we see a
diagram of something called a
participatory universe if you look
backward in time that changes the past
and creates the universe which creates
us so that was another of his his wild
ideas he wrote down his ideas in a
series of notebooks which are preserved
today at the American Philosophical
Society archive so if you were scholar
you can go in there and look through his
notebooks and see all the strange ideas
that he came up with over the years and
the diagrams for them and then this is a
portrait of him one of his favorite
places which is in islands off the coast
of Maine where he would sit among the
rocks and just think and he loved the
sea and he loved the the especially the
the
the coast of Maine where even though it
would be a bit cold or a bit chilly he
he would sit there and write and think
phiman preferred in his later years he
was at Caltech so he preferred the
sunnier beaches of Southern California
but they served the same purpose he
would sit there and think so let me go
back in time now to September 1939 which
was a pivotal month in history September
1939 was the start of World War two in
Europe that's when Hitler invaded Poland
it was also a time when two pivotal
papers were published in a leading
physics journal called the Physical
Review Physical Review as the main
physics journal for American physics one
of those papers was a paper by John
Wheeler and his mentor Niels Bohr Niels
Bohr was one of the fathers of quantum
theory a Danish physicist and wheeler
had worked with Niels Bohr over in
Denmark and then worked with Niels Bohr
again in the United States to try to
unravel the secrets of nuclear fission
this was important because nuclear
fission was discovered in Germany and
there were worries about the Nazis
developing an atomic bomb so somebody
named Lisa Meitner who had worked with
some German physicists knew about the
discovery efficient and told Niels Bohr
Niels Bohr came to the United States in
January 1939 gave a talk at Princeton
and revealed to John Wheeler and others
including Albert Einstein the German
nuclear fission program that the Germans
created nuclear fission Einstein wrote a
letter to Roosevelt warning Roosevelt
about nuclear fission and suggesting
that it be developed a program be
developed in the United States to
research it well that took a couple of
years there wasn't there weren't much
funds for such a program for two years
but then around
time of the Pearl Harbor bombing that's
when the Manhattan Project got off the
ground in and December 1941 well the
other paper in the Physical Review aside
from the wheeler and Bohr nuclear fishin
paper was a paper by Robert Oppenheimer
on black holes which weren't called
black holes then was just called
collapsed ARS and Oppenheimer speculated
in September 1939 that a large star if
it was large enough would collapse down
to something that was so dense that not
even like could escape and up and timer
thought that this was possible other
physicists pretty much ignored the paper
they just thought it was kind of a quirk
or maybe he made a mistake and that
paper was forgotten from 1939 until
really the late 50s early 60s when it
was rediscovered the person who
rediscovered it was John Wheeler and
John Wheeler rediscovered it when he
started looking at his nuclear fishing
paper again he looked at the same issue
and he thought this stuff from
Oppenheimer is really interesting so he
resurrected the idea of collapsed stars
which became black holes and today there
were a very important part of physics
and astronomy so here's a here's the
young John Wheeler around the time he
started at Princeton he started at
Princeton and fall of 1938 but then 1939
his second year was when he really got
off the ground with his non-nuclear
fishing research the first year he did
the nuclear fishing research with Niels
Bohr the second year he was looking for
new opportunities to do something
different he didn't want to continue to
the nuclear fishing research he wanted
to do something where he would make his
own mark and when thinking about the
prospect of the Germans developing
nuclear fishing he didn't really think
about that too much because he didn't
think that the United States would even
get involved in World War two
he was of the opinion that
rameneh European war we wouldn't get
involved and that people like Enrico
Fermi Leo Szilard
Einstein and so forth were a little bit
too worried about nuclear fishing and
and it wasn't something to really
concern oneself with at the time later
he regretted the decision to leave
nuclear fishing and I'll explain why in
a few minutes so completely by chance
wheeler was assigned a bright young
student from MIT Fineman
so here's five men at Princeton in his
typical pose just sitting and reading a
book in for instance graduate college he
was he lived in Princeton graduate
college and he worked with wheeler as a
teaching assistant
so fireman's job was to be a teaching
assistant and he had already made a name
for himself many times as a brilliant
thinker even at the young age of 21 he
was known as a brain thinker he had
three articles already and in their
times about his work by the age of 21 so
the first one was when he was in high
school he won a mathematics competition
he was a high scorer he was brilliant at
calculations he was he could do mental
math he was great at calculus he learned
calculus at a very young age he was
always good at just churning out results
computing and then at MIT he was in the
honor roll and then he took a
competition called the Putnam
competition it was the second year of
the Putnam competition he came out the
highest individual score in the country
for the Putnam competition Harvard
offered him a full paid fellowship to go
there was a graduate student he could
have stayed at MIT but they discouraged
him because they want him to do
something different but he wanted to go
to Princeton
why because Princeton had this amazing
atom smasher in its basement the base
from the physics building where
fools will circle round circle around
many times feared by magnets and then
just at the right moment would smash
into targets producing all sorts of
other particles and fireman was
fascinated by the idea that he could
look at those results do calculations
and make predictions about particles
he loved to connect theoretical physics
with experimental physics and come up
with very specific results so if I'm in
love to calculate come up with an answer
convinced himself that the answer was
right and then see it match nature he
didn't like philosophical speculation he
didn't like to think about well how does
it fit into the bigger picture but his
meeting with wheeler would steer him
more in that direction
so wheeler needed to meet with Fineman
to discuss his teaching responsibilities
so before they did research together he
wanted five men to know his
responsibility as a greater it was for a
mechanics course so they read a book
called mechanics by Ernest Mach and this
textbook and then there be homework
assignments and Fineman was the greater
so firemen met with wheeler in his
office at a place called fine hall at
Princeton which is where Einstein used
to work too and Niels Bohr visited so a
lot of prestigious people there and
wheeler had his office at fine Hall
firemen walked in and wheeler was
thinking well as a young assistant
professor I need to manage my time he
was really interested in being the most
efficient because he had to balance
research teaching committees and all
that stuff for a young professor so he
had a pocket watch he took it out and
put it on the table just to time himself
during his meeting with his his graduate
student Fineman funding looked at it the
next time
they met phiman was a little sneaky he
went to a five-and-dime store like
Woolworths and bought his own watch a
wristwatch very cheap which watch as
soon as wheeler took out his pocket
watch and took put it on the table just
like countering wheelers chest movie
with another chest move Fineman took out
his cheap watch and put it right next to
wheelers wheeler looked at fireman
fireman look back at wheeler and they
both burst out laughing a friendship was
born at that moment and from that point
on they had a friendship based on joking
with each other but also being very
honest with each other about physics and
inspiring each other to consider the
loftiest most far-flung ideas in physics
but then to try to make something of it
to come up with the calculation that
would make sense and match reality so
that you can guess whose job was the
lofty ideas wheeler and then to do the
calculations that was fineman's job the
two made an unusual pair wheeler always
in his suits phiman would wear short
sleeves phiman had a very thick Queens
accent spoke very loudly you know
sometimes didn't use the best language
and Wheeler was very you know very
genteel always watched his words very
carefully and but the two of them got
along very well
wheeler kind of admired fineman's
ability to be a little wild and to not
really care what other people think and
Fineman admired wheelers family life and
its overall nicest to people so in a
late life interview fireman said I wish
that was as nice as wheeler inviting
students to my house you know being
really kind to people
well phiman was kind to people but he
also could be kind of Moody wheeler was
always very very straightforward
with people and very kind person
now of course Fineman also had his Bongo
playing side which got him a lot of
press and an art art side and so forth
so Fineman always like to live the wild
life and yet in terms of ideas wheeler
was much wilder now their work together
took place in a brief window of
opportunity this was between September
1939 and December 1941 which is when in
December 1941 that's exactly when a lot
of theoretical physicists were recruited
to work in the manhattan project
including wheeler and Fineman they both
took on roles in the manhattan project
at that time so when you look at this
timeframe it's pretty amazing how much
they got done in a period of less than
two and a half years phiman did all the
work he needed for his thesis his
doctoral thesis in less than two and a
half years so let me talk a little bit
about their research together so the
research together became known as the
wheeler phiman absorber theory well what
was that all about well that had to do
with how electrons interact with each
other using electricity or the
electromagnetic interaction the standard
picture at the time which is now the
picture today but modified is that when
an electron interacts with another
electron the two share another particle
an intermediate particle called a photon
which is a carrier of the
electromagnetic force so one electron
oscillates and then it gives off another
gives off a photon that hits another
electron and the two bow
the photon back and forth with each
other kind of like two volleyball
players might bounce a volleyball back
and forth between each other and that
creates the interaction between the two
so you need the intermediate particle
just like you need the volleyball in a
volleyball game to create the
interaction so a great physicist named
Paul Dirac calculated how an electron
could interact with itself to create a
kind of a ball of charge so the model
was imagining electron as a ball of
charge well if it's a ball of charge
these charges are interact with
themselves using the photons and then if
you calculate this using Dirac's theory
which was developed in the 1930s or late
1920s and early 1930s if you do this
calculation you get a very strange
answer which is like dividing one
divided by zero on a calculator it does
not compute you get an answer of
infinity well that can't be right
because the amount of energy of an
electron which if you consider it to be
a ball of charge can't be infinity also
if you compute the energy of two
electrons interacting with each other
using the direct method you also get an
answer of infinity and many many
different calculations done using
Dirac's method give you an answer of
infinity which is very unsatisfying it's
that's a crazy answer so in order to
address this Fineman thought of a
radical idea said well the problem that
you're getting infinity with these
answers could be eliminated
if you just eliminate the intermediary
you eliminate having a photon or a light
particle exchange between the two
electrons well we all know that there's
light out there the light would be
produced by the electrons themselves
through their mutual interactions which
would take place over a distance
this is known as the action at a
distance theory
well the action at a distance theory was
not new Isaac Newton when he was talking
about the planets going around the Sun
use the action at a distance theory to
explain why earth and the other planets
are gravitationally attached to the Sun
so Newton's idea was that there's
something like an invisible thread
connecting earth and the other planets
with the Sun well later Maxwell the
great Scottish physicists in the 19th
century said hey wait a minute
let's come up with an idea of
intermediaries like something called a
field which would be an intermediary
which would convey a force from one
thing to another and in the case of
electromagnetism that field was called
the electromagnetic field which would be
kind of like a wave going from one to
the other the quantum version of that is
to say in quantum physics a wave is the
same as a particle
so wave is kind of like a particle going
back and forth between the two and that
particle is known as a photon or light
particle and this is called technically
known as a wave packet kind of like
imagine a little wave like an ocean wave
but confined to a small region so it's a
little bit like a particle just like you
took part of an ocean wave and created
maybe put like a ball around it and then
that's wave packet so that's the idea
that quantum physics was considering and
this is what Fineman decided to
eliminate just to get the right answer
in a calculation so he was going back it
was a little bit retro going back to the
Newton idea of action at a distance with
one modification there needs to be a
time delay because as we knew electron
interacting with another electron must
do so at the speed of light so he built
it in a time
lay and went to wheeler with this idea
and said let's come up with the idea of
direct interactions between electrons
and maybe we can get somewhere with this
and wheeler pointed out a conundrum he
said well if you have an electron going
through space there's something called
radiation resistance which is an
interaction between electron with
radiation that's going to slow it down
which means you need light there and
fine Minh was a little bit disappointed
in himself because the very first time
he mentioned this idea of the wheeler
wheeler immediately saw the drawback and
Fineman thought well my idea must be so
bad that wheeler immediately saw the
problem with it like within five minutes
saw the problem with it but the real
answer was that Wheeler had been
thinking about the same idea
coincidentally and wheeler had worked
through the idea and saw that there was
a straw back so wheeler and Fineman were
really on the same wavelength at that
point and not like waves but these
signals so they both thought about
signals without light like that just
that I way that if you shake one
electron then some time later you shake
another electron well they try to get
this right for the this radiation
resistance their original model didn't
have it so Wheeler came up with a
suggestion suggestion what if when you
shake an electron then the other
electrons in the area send a signal back
to that electron that slows it down
through space and that as soon as you
shake an electron instantly you get
signals from all the other electrons and
that worked the only qualm the only
problem is that the other signals have
to travel backward in time so that
violates the law of cause and effect
Wheeler was like well okay let's get rid
of the law of cause and effect and
finally was like well you're the
professor
so okay let's get rid of the law of
cause and effect so that combines the
waves that go forward or the signal I
should say that goes forward in time the
signal that goes backward in time mixed
it up 50/50 and they got good answers
good calculations but they weren't done
yet because that was the classical
picture classical meaning if you didn't
have any quantum murkiness and in
quantum haziness so they both knew that
to get the full picture
you couldn't have exact paths between
between the electrons you couldn't have
a direct signal you needed to have
something that was a little hazy quantum
physics involves haziness so they needed
to kind of quantize this problem by
making it a little bit murky so that
wheeler tried that a little bit but then
it says Fineman to do it to quantize the
problem now wild fireman was working on
quantizing the problem phiman was one
time in his dorm room and he got a phone
call and it was wheeler and Wheeler said
fireman I have this great idea we know
that electrons interact directly what if
all the electrons in the universe were
one in the same and that an electron a
single electron going backward and
forward in time zigzagging backward and
forward in time
represents all the electrons in the
universe so not just signals would
travel backward in time but electrons
would travel backward in time and we
would see these backward in time
negative electrons as positive electrons
well they both knew then that there is
such a thing as positive electrons that
are called positrons and they had been
discovered a couple years earlier and
they were a result of Dirac's one of it
iraq's other theories that predicted
positive electrons
so wheelers idea was that negative
electrons backward in time is the same
thing as a positive electron forward in
time and vice-versa
so and and that's would explain why all
the electrons in the universe are here
they're the same electron well I'd like
to think of this as something like the
movie Back to the Future 2 and in Back
to the Future 2 Marnie McFly needs to
return to the same 1950s town as he was
in Back to the Future 1 the first one
and correct some problems in time well
at that point when he goes backwards in
the 1950s again and Back to the Future 2
there are two Marnie McFly's in the 50s
now if we kept going with sequels there
were only there was only one more sequel
of that movie but suppose you had
thousands of sequels that movie is so
popular and then marna McFly kept going
backward to the 50s again and again you
could have thousands of Marty McFly's or
even Millions
well that's what the electron was doing
and the one electron theory of John
Wheeler now fine men took one thing--the
on the theory the idea that electrons
going backward in time are positrons he
took the essence of one thing and got
rid of the rest of the theory he didn't
discard the rest of the theory because
of the theory can't possibly be right
because we don't see as many positrons
as we do electrons in space so that
Theory's wrong but Fineman was brilliant
enough to distill the best part of the
theory which is still used today in
representing positrons they're
represented as electrons going backward
in time much later in life at a
restaurant in Pasadena Pasadena Fineman
would meet Kip Thorne another student of
Wheeler and say after Wheeler came up
talked about some of his ideas - Kip
Thorne and they sound
zany firemen said well you think
Willard's gotten crazy in his later
years well he's always been crazy and
then mentioned the one electron universe
to thorne and said well you know the
trick is to take the essence kind of
like peeling the layers of an onion he'd
take the heart of the idea and you
forget the the skin you forget the outer
part you just take one bit of Wheeler's
ideas and they're usually on the mark so
at the time of fineman's research at
princeton he married his childhood
sweetheart he met arlene Greenbaum in
Queens she's a girl from Queens and they
met at a dance and he kept in touch with
her throughout MIT and then he stayed in
touch with through Princeton and at one
point he decided it was time to marry
her since they've been going together
for so long going steady as they said at
the time so but then unfortunately she
developed a cough and the cough turned
out to be tuberculosis which at the time
there was no medicinal cure for
tuberculosis
there was a rest cure you would go to a
place called a sanatorium he would rest
up and if you're very lucky it would
cure itself you would you would go into
remission but of course a lot of people
die from tuberculosis because there
wasn't a way to treat it aside from just
hoping for the best
so when Fineman got married his parents
were completely opposed to the marriage
they were very upset especially his
mother his mother wrote him and said you
know Richie it's not like eating spinach
it's not something you have to do just
because you've been going steady with
this girl it's not like you you have to
you know force yourself to get married
even if you don't really want to and he
wrote back to her and said like it's not
like that at all
with her and we do so much for each
other she cheers me up I learned so much
from her she's an amazing person and I
saw a doctor Princeton and he said you
know this will be fine
you just need to take some precautions
but you're fine to get married so
Fineman and arlene went to a city office
in Staten Island's they got married by a
clerk and then their honeymoon was the
Staten Island ferry ride where they got
in a car and he drove her in his car to
this to a sanatorium in New Jersey now
known as de Bourgh a hospital in New
Jersey and that was their honeymoon so
it's really very sad but phiman wasn't
that at the time he he really loved her
and she was a a very creative person she
had a great sense of humor she was an
artist
she taught piano lessons and she always
managed to cheer him up she was the one
who cheered him up he didn't have to
cheer her up she was always very upbeat
and they still hadn't held out hope for
a long life together
now she inspired him to become
interested in art which led eventually
to his Fineman diagrams which he would
show how electrons which were
represented by E would interact with
each other via light particles
represented by what looks like a V but
this is really a Greek letter gamma and
this is the light particle this is
called a Fineman diagram and if you ask
a physicist what Fineman is most famous
for this is one of the things he's most
famous for and noticed that he
eventually added the light particle back
in he would have to to get the theory to
work you know eventually for his Nobel
prize-winning work
so Fineman was very proud of his fireman
diagrams and later in life when he was
at Caltech in his later years he bought
a Dodge van had it painted with Fineman
diagrams on the side just so that people
could stop them they would park
somewhere let's say the service station
and someone would say to him like one of
those strange diagrams on the side I say
oh yeah those are the ones I invented so
he was a bit immodest like that I mean
he he liked to brag about what he
actually did he liked to talk about his
accomplishments he didn't really like
necessarily awards or honors but he
liked to go up to the average person on
the street and say like look at this
cool thing that I did and and amazed
people that way and you may have seen
the van on the TV show The Big Bang
Theory
the actual fireman van was preserved
actually fixed up and for the Big Bang
Theory and then at the final scene of an
episode of The Big Bang Theory replica
was blown up so I was happy to know it
was a replica there's there's an
entrepreneur who owns a van and he's
trying to donate it to this institution
so trying to donate it to Smithsonian so
so I don't know how how that is
progressed but he has something on on
Twitter where he talks about that a
little bit so the van has traveled
around the country and the replica van
at the end of the show was blown up so
let me go back a little bit to the
Fineman wheeler theory and talk about
the implications of it in the fireman
wheeler theory to quantize the theory to
make it hey
the Fineman came up with the brain idea
of looking at all the possible ways
electron can in Iraq possibly interact
and then adding them up you know kind of
weighted average and saying the most
probable path is the one taken in
classical physics classical meaning on a
day to day scale of mundane scale the
scale of you and me but then on a
particle level there's a quantum
haziness there's a quantum murkiness
which is due to all the other possible
paths that are less likely so let me
give you an example of how this works
and this is called wheeler dubbed it's
sum over histories so suppose you work
in DC but you live let's say in Silver
Springs and you commute every day and
somebody says well how did you come in
today you say well I took the metro and
I took a taxi and I drove in and I took
an uber and they said we did all those
things at once so those are different
possible ways of community but imagine
that somebody said they did all of them
at once well that's a life of a quantum
electron the electron has all the
interactions and the most likely one is
weighted high highly but the other ones
are somehow out there in the haze and to
do a quantum calculation you need to
take all them into account so if you're
commuting whatever is the shortest
distance or the least expensive might be
the most likely so let's say the metro
is is the most likely because that's
inexpensive and quick and let's say a
taxi will be the least likely because
it's very expensive but that would still
be weighted it would give just be given
a smaller weight in the quantum picture
so this is similar in some ways if you
read
shann to the work of somebody named
porque Luis Borgess an Argentine writer
who coincidentally at the time phiman
was coming up with some of her histories
bore case came up with this idea of fork
time in his short classic short story
called the Garden of forking paths which
imagines how people in one kind of
parallel universe can be friends but
because of warfare and another rendition
their enemies and and imagines books in
which all the possibilities happen so in
in in the books mentioned in this story
someone could die but then the next
chapter they're back again and so forth
so all the possibilities in nature
happen in a kind of a labyrinth of time
so this is a labyrinthine idea of time
which is very different from a linear
time or a cyclical time which are more
of the older models Fineman and creative
writers like Bohr Hayes suggested time
as a labyrinth a maze of possibilities
in which a bunch of things can happen at
once so as I mentioned in 1942 they had
to take a break from their work to work
in the Manhattan Project fireman's hobby
when he was in Los Alamos he went out
out there and arlene went to a
sanatorium in albuquerque and firemen
would drive out there and he would tell
her about all the crazy things he did at
los alamos which was a top-secret
military project at the time to build a
nuclear bomb and one thing firemen would
do is he would open up safes and at
first they had they had key locks but he
would figure out how to Jimmy them open
they have combination locks he would
figure out how to crack them open with
likely combinations or by listening to
them and then I would tell her one of
the leading people in the project left
classified papers in his desk drawer
and have that locked and said there's no
way you can get to that and Fineman
reached through the back of the desk and
got the papers out through a crack in
the back of the desk and showed them to
Edward Teller say you see I have your
secret papers here and he said he was
trying to show the security lapses or he
would sneak through a hole in a fence
leave the base and then come back and
sign in and they'd say where did you
sign out and say yes where did I sign
out so he liked to amaze people that way
and then he'd go drive out to
Albuquerque in the car of somebody named
Klaus Fuchs his friends and he would
tell Arlene these stories and she was
really amazed and that would kind of
cheer her up
but unfortunately 1945 Arlene died of
tuberculosis and and it was also sad
year many other ways the culmination of
the work in Los Alamos led to first a
Trinity test where they tested the bomb
and then Hiroshima and Nagasaki and also
around the same time and not late 19 to
44 john wheelers younger brother Joe
died in Italy and right before Joe died
he sent a postcard to John saying hurry
up meaning hurry up with the bomb
projects and from that point on fireman
and wheeler had different approaches to
the bomb Fineman at first it didn't
really register with him what happened
because he was so upset about Orlean
dying but then it finally hit him he was
having lunch with his mother in
Manhattan they thought about the idea of
cities being destroyed and he got very
very depressed by it and he vowed if
something like that happened again he
wouldn't get involved he knew that he
couldn't change your past but he didn't
want to get involved
wheeler thought that he should have
gotten involved earlier he should have
kept going with fishing developed a bomb
earlier and he would have perhaps saved
his brother's life and the lives of
millions of people
if the bomb was used in 1944
forty-three if it had been developed
earlier maybe World War two would have
ended earlier with millions of lives
saved so because of this wheeler got
continued to be involved with atomic
energy and later joined the h-bomb
project and one of the stimuli for the
h-bomb project was Klaus Fuchs Klaus
fuse kind of stuck around he was at Los
Alamos and then got involved in atomic
energy later and wheeler was on an
atomic energy safety commission where
they were talking about reactor designs
and wheeler remembered making an offhand
comment like well the main problem with
reactors is not necessarily how they're
designed but the idea of a saboteur and
Klaus Fuchs didn't say anything and then
a few months later they found out that
Klaus Fuchs had been associate spy and
the Soviets launched her own bomb people
who were very upset how they found out
the information so quickly and Klaus
Fuchs was arrested in England and and
served a sentence later ended up in East
Germany and you know everybody realized
that he was thus my spy in the midst in
Los Alamos and Fineman later joked that
he should have been the spy because he
was the one who violated security all
the time but it was really Fuchs it's
quiet friends who really turned out to
be the spy
so Wheeler was involved in the h-bomb
project for for a couple of years and
witnessed by air the first test of an
h-bomb and then when the project was
winding down he was given such a secret
report called the Walker Report which
investigated how much Fuchs knew about
the bomb and maybe whether Fuchs knew
about the h-bomb or not because they'd
started talking about the age
bomb in Los Alamos tell her I'd call it
the super bomb and had certain ideas for
it so the question was did the Soviets
now from Fuchs anything about the h-bomb
so that was a question in the Walker
report and Weill there was commuting or
traveling to DC and he brought the
report with him which was kind of a
no-no as a classified report and then
when the train arrived in Union Station
it arrived something like 3 a.m. and as
the convenience they lowered the lights
and said well if you want you can sleep
until 6 a.m. when most people get up and
go about their business so wheeler fell
asleep and when he got up the papers
were gone this is classified papers and
to this day we don't know what happened
to them who took these classified papers
of the Whopper report and then around
then President Eisenhower took office
found that about this and was furious
and sent a reprimand to wheeler by that
time wheeler had switched gears and was
back being a professor at Princeton and
looking into gravity and so it didn't
really affect this career that he got
this reprimand so wheeler looked back at
this issue of physical review which had
two papers the Oppenheimer paper on
black calls and the wheeler bore a paper
on fishing and that gave him the idea to
explore black holes what became known as
black holes so we delved into general
relativity and then he had a revelation
instead of everything in the universe
being electrons or a single electron
everything is geometry which is
Einstein's theory of general relativity
that things are geometry well wheeler
wanted to rebuild the whole universe
based on geometric constructions so
phiman at that time was at Cornell he
was very depressed because of his wife
and because of the atomic bomb but
and he started getting interested in
physics again too because he saw
somebody toss a plate with the Cornell
logo he calculated in his head the
rotation rate of the plate and then he
thought I can still do this
I can still do physics watch out so then
he started getting involved in physics
again and that led to his Nobel
prize-winning work and he still played
the bongo drums to let off steam and
then in the mid-1950s he he got
remarried to his second wife he met Mary
Louise Bell at a Cornell cafeteria and
they talked about art history they had a
few conversations that were memorable
phiman had a sabbatical in Brazil where
he learned how to play other kinds of
drums had a great time and then at that
time he thought well you know I really
should be married hey that that young
woman Mary Louise Bell was kind of neat
she we had a great conversation maybe
I'll write to her and she she's
interested in getting married he wrote
to her she accepted by mail postal mail
and they got married and then fine men
took a job at Caltech and they moved
together to Southern California and they
were married for four years but what she
didn't realize is that he did a couple
of things that would annoy her greatly
calculus and bongo drumming so those
were the grounds for the divorce
but they say the third time's a charm he
did marry again he met a young woman on
a lake front in Geneva during a
conference she was a nanny British nanny
and he convinced her to be his
housekeeper at Caltech but he was also
interested in her and she came over and
a housekeeper visa but then after she
was a housekeeper for a year he proposed
to her and they got married so that is
when if his third wife he's you see how
happy was to be married to her and the
best man at the Manor at the wedding was
this very cool artist and sculptor named
jeera or juries or thean who was an
armenian artists who was kind of a wild
figure and Fineman was playing bongo
drums at a party once and Zoar thien's
started dancing to the bongo drums and
finally thought I like that guy and they
taught each other their their trades
phiman tried to teach Dorothy in physics
which was sort of semi successful but
Dorothy and taught firemen how to paint
so these are actually firemen's
paintings he became quite quite an
accomplished artist amateur artists and
he would alternate between sketching and
calculating
and also while it was a Caltech he was
involved in the musicals and he went to
a student al Hibbs parties there are
annual parties with a theme each year
there be a party a question and you had
to answer the question with the costume
so as I mentioned one year whose dress
is your favorite religious figure and he
dresses the Himalayan monk another year
dresses I think I think it was your
famous famous person and he dressed his
God and then had to be a head of state
so he dressed as Queen Elizabeth and
then another year he was supposed to be
an astronomical body so he went as in a
suit and tie and he people say what
astronomical body who's supposed to be
said
hi I'm serious and he wanted people to
say surely you must be joking which was
the name of one of his famous books so
so as I mentioned wheeler became
interested in I'm sincere of general
relativity which was convenient because
Einstein was one of his neighbors so you
go over you can go few doors down a few
blocks down and see Einstein and talk to
Einstein about general relativity and he
even brought his students for the first
general relativity classes to Einstein's
house and had Einstein come over give a
talk and that's when he came up with the
idea that everything is made of geometry
and he came out the idea of jion's which
are self-gravitating objects which he
hoped to be particles there were
somewhat the wrong size to be particles
there was something like the size of a
son and he wanted to be the size of an
electron it's a little bit off and
wormholes which are connections in space
came up the idea of tiny wormholes but
his graduate student would blow these up
a little bit and come up with the idea
of wormholes for interstellar travel he
would often consult with Einstein
here's Einstein you kaua Japanese
physicist and John Wheeler walking and
talking and as I mentioned later Kip
Thorne wheeler student would take this
wormhole idea and make it into realistic
schemes for traveling through space
taking shortcuts through space which was
originally motivated by Carl Sagan's
book contact Carl Sagan one of them to
come up with a way of traveling quickly
through space and this later led to the
movie interstellar so in the 50s wheeler
had another brilliant student Hugh
Everett who questions another aspect of
quantum physics on a fundamental level
when you take a measurement in quantum
physics the observer affects the
measurement because as soon as the
observation is taken if there are two
different possibilities the system is
said to collapse into one of the two
possibilities and Hugh Everett thought
that was ridiculous how could a human
observer affect the quantum measurement
and this may have been inspired by a
talk Einstein gave to Everett and others
where he joked that well if a human can
make an observation why not a mouse why
do you need to have a human and Everett
thought deeply about this
and when Niels Bohr visited Princeton he
brought this up but Bohr wouldn't hear
of it Bohr thought that the idea of
human observers affecting things was
fine Bohr thought the theory works why
tamper with it well Everett came up with
an idea that instead of involved in the
observer when you take a measurement the
universe would split into one of the two
possibilities and the observer would
split two so there'll be two clones of
the observer one would be in one version
and then there being another version so
to take the famous Schrodinger's cat
power
we have a cat in a box and you take a
measurement and you open up the box and
one version the cat is alive and the
other version the cat is dead the
universe would split so one observer
would be happy to see that the cat is
alive the other would be sad to see that
the cat is dead and they wouldn't know
about each other they wouldn't know
about the replicas now wheeler is advice
to Everett was tone this down this is
never gonna fly with Bohr just try to
just use the math but don't say parallel
universes don't talk about people
splitting so Everett really really toned
it down but later the ideas were
rediscovered in the 70s by another
physicist named Bryce towei and they've
become popular since then so there's a
branch of physicists a group of
physicists who are really interested in
this many-worlds interpretation of
quantum mechanics it's by no means a
majority but it's a significant minority
of physicists still believe in this idea
so this is Everett here and this is
Niels Bohr so the difference between sum
over histories and Everett's
idea is that reality itself splits
instead of reality sort of blending
together and fireman's idea fireman's
ideas you have these paths but they're
kind of blended together into one
reality Everett's idea is that reality
splits just like in the Schrodinger's
cat paradox you have one in which a
cat's not alive in the one which the cat
is alive so probably wheelers greatest
contribution is the idea of black holes
which he didn't come up with a name for
he heard that in a conference but he
promoted it so he's famous for black
holes here's a picture of him with a
shirt that says I've experienced black
hole nova scotia he went to the town of
black hole nova scotia and got a t-shirt
from it and a student of his solved the
great conundrum with black holes about
what happens if you toss
disordered information until Blackhall
which is technically known as entropy
and the black hole will expand and the
area of a black hole represents its
amount of disorder and information so
wheelers probably a strangest idea is
called the participatory universe and
it's basically saying when an astronomer
measures the past he's taking he or she
is taking a quantum measurement and then
therefore that person can collapse the
state of the past and change the past
and perhaps the net result of
astronomers taking measurements today is
to create changes that creates the
conditions eventually for life and if it
weren't for these measurements you
wouldn't have the universe the way it is
today in a very special state that could
produce earth which produces life which
produces astronomers who take the
measurement so you have this closed
circle of time so then the only thing
remaining is - is the question how come
existence why do we exist
and wheeler called this idea a self
excited circuit that you look back in
the past and that creates the present
and this was popularized in a 1986
Reader's Digest article which got him a
lot of attention he got a whole sack of
fan mail and he only looked at a bit of
it because he didn't really want to be
known as like a New Age guru which
people were looking at ms and he spent
the rest of his life considering the
question how come existence that was his
final question and when I personally had
the opportunity to meet wheeler in 2002
he said that he was spending his time
exploring that question which he never
found an answer to and no wonder it was
a very vague philosophical question but
he thought that perhaps he could solve
in a way the meaning of life by thinking
about
and that was John wheel are always
thinking about the big picture and
firemen's reaction to these ideas was
well you know let's focus on the here
and now rather than the big picture
let's try to do calculations and
progress forward rather than looking at
everything so in the 80s fireman was ill
with cancer he did participate in the
Challenger Commission but by that time
he was very ill in 87 he witnessed a
supernova of 87 and it was very special
to him because he said that Kepler had a
supernova and now I have mine and I
think he knew at that time that he
didn't really have long to live he died
in 1988 of cancer
wheeler outlived him by 20 more years
and died at the age of 96 we see Willer
at LIGO which is the gravitational wave
observatory for which the student Kip
Thorne would win the Nobel Prize this
year for the discovery of gravitational
waves so Kip Thorne is the second Nobel
Prize winning student of John Wheeler
and Thorne was has always been grateful
to wheeler for his his mentorship so
when Wheeler died Freeman Dyson said he
was kind of like a prophet looking out
over the promised land that his people
will one day inherit the promised land
is in new ideas and physics and those
inheriting the wheeler legacy are modern
theoretical physicists who owe a great
debt to wheeler so all of this and more
is in my book which as mentioned I'll be
happy to to sign for anybody who's
interested and you can learn more about
Fineman and wheeler but now I'd be glad
to take some questions from the audience
about fireman wheeler and the physics
they were they were
involved with
we have a microphone back here in the
middle aisle so if you'd like to ask a
question we ask that you come to the
microphone so we can all hear it I'm
right over here
hello microphone is right here
so even me hello Oh about what about
tomonaga and Schwinger they shared the
prize with Fineman but you haven't
mentioned them and maybe they were in
there in your in a book and also I was
glad to see Freeman Dyson mentioned but
I believe he was very involved with a
lot of time these things together also
well that's an excellent question and I
do go into that more in my book there's
a lot more in my book than I can cover
and in our talk as you can imagine but
what happened was there was somebody
named Willis lamb who came up with a
quirk in quantum physics that couldn't
be predicted and he presented his
results at a conference in Shelter
Island which is which is off the coast
of Long Island and Fineman and another
physicist named Schwinger were there
heard about this and they set out to
come up with a reason for what was
called the lamb shift explaining the
slight shift in energy that that
electrons undergo that couldn't be
explained by ordinary quantum physics so
schweger did all these calculations came
up with this whole involved mathematical
theory presented it at the next
conference of the series which was in
the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania of
the Pocono conference at the same
conference Fineman was there and had his
own theory involving basically sum over
histories not the wheeler phiman version
but a modified version which had light
particles where he made the same
prediction for the lamb shift so both
Schwinger and firemen came up with
successful predictions for lamb shift
with two different methods fireman's
method was more intuitive with diagrams
shrinkers method was very methodical
involving a lot of mathematical
calculations then around that time they
heard about tomonaga
who during World War two had come up
with a third equivalent method in Japan
that was published in the Japanese
journal but wasn't really well
in the United States so all three
methods were reasonable approaches and
it took Freeman Dyson who knew five men
and took a workshop with Schwinger to be
able to pierce these together and pieces
together and to come up with a unified
version of the three-feet theories which
he published in a paper that showed how
all three theories were equivalent so
that's why phiman Schwinger until
managua all shared the 1965 nobel prize
and if there had been a fourth person it
would have been Freeman Dyson and
interestingly Freeman Dyson came up with
his theory on a Greyhound bus trip back
from his workshop with Schwinger he he
came up with this whole scheme and he's
he's a really a brilliant person he's
still active today in his 90s and about
a year ago had a pleasant pleasure of
meeting him at the Institute for
Advanced Study and got to chat with him
about his work with fireman which was
very interesting but this is driver yeah
this is sort of a story the my brother's
a theoretical physicists two guys PhD
from Chicago so he now believes there is
a four-fold universe yes and no forward
and backward so there's four gods and
they make it they make a decision they
vote together that's his idea of God
okay now I find after talking in for
twenty years I finally understand that
yeah I think I've you know I'm not going
into theological questions
so in fact pardon okay so uh so Fineman
was well known as an educator and as
well known for those lectures of
fundamental physics back in what 63 64
at Caltech I was wondering to what
extent he's looked upon as as a mentor
and a great influence on upcoming
physicists and whether he had any famous
students so he did have some graduate
students he worked with someone named
George Zweig at Caltech who developed an
alternative to the quark model and as a
famous theoretical physicist how Hibbs
the one who had the party annual parties
was quite active at the Jet Propulsion
lab is mentioned and was involved in
different space missions so he was in
other refinements well-known students
there's a one of hymens first students
Lori brown is well known in the history
of physics community it's written a
number of history of physics books but
not quite the same caliber as wheeler
students wheeler had more students in
phiman and more famous students in
Fineman particularly two Nobel Prize
winners but also students like you
Everett or jacob bekenstein who made a
real mark in the theoretical physics
community I began with a bit of a story
about Hugh Everett also he became a
business partner of mine after he went
to software he got frustrated with
physics and wrote the first models to
prove that nobody could win a nuclear
war and in an event so but I got very
interested in following
people's attention to his physics later
on mostly after he died
but Kip Thorne was in town recently
because he got the Nobel Prize there
were some events and I was fortunate
enough to have a chance to ask him what
he thought about Everett's theories and
he said well you know I'm not a quantum
mechanics guy so I don't really know he
says but I asked I asked Fineman about
it once and Fineman said you know I
think Everett was probably right so
therefore as far as I'm concerned ever
was right so okay so the question to you
is what do you really think about this
and do you have any comments about where
you think this this debate might go well
that that's that's very interesting and
that's the first I've heard about
firemen praising Everett's work I think
in public forums he was pretty neutral
about far flung ideas and he saw that as
too is a little bit too theoretical but
then Fineman surprisingly as I found
that in my research did have a bit of a
philosophical two side even though he
always said no no no I'm a hard-nosed
physicist I don't want to speculate but
for example he went to a conference held
in 1963 at Cornell called the nature of
time and he didn't want to embarrass
himself by philosophizing in a
conference because it was a very
philosophical conference so he asked the
organizer Tommie gold an astronomer to
not list him in the program not list
them in the conference proceedings and
to refer to him as mr. X throughout the
proceedings so if you look at the
proceedings those have wheeler Tommie
gold fred hoyle
mr. X but then if you look at what mr. X
said there's a lot of philosophy there
so I think Fineman sometimes you know
did kind of praise wild ideas or thought
about these wild ideas but I don't think
he really was completely comfortable
with that side of himself because
he knew that physics needed to be
testable and I think you know public for
me would have said Hugh Everett's ideas
let's not look at them because we need
to look at testable ideas instead but he
would go back and forth on things just
like wheeler did he he went through a
lot of phases he went through a late
life phase in looking at information
theory that just like wheeler did
looking at quantum computers and the
idea that everything is made of
information now whoever you mentioned
left physics part of it was just his
disappointment at how his PhD thesis was
received bored just completely ignored
it and the physics community just
completely ignored it but then later
when Bryce to way and other physicists
who were known about the theory started
popularizing the theory and say hey
maybe this is right and then they held a
conference in which he was one of the
honored guests at text in Texas in the
now in the 1970s Everett was really
excited that people were relooking at
his theories
I always said Caltech and was in physics
X in the 50s about when Everett was
getting started and what you've told me
makes me think about the fact that in
that Saturday course Fineman kept coming
back and back and back to the split slit
the experiment and he kept it was clear
he was trying to get something out of
the audience and we never really came
through for him I think but the split
slit experiment means you know when the
electron lands on the on the photo thing
the universe splits
according to Everett right and he may
have been thinking that way I don't know
he was trying to figure that out well I
think I think it's even if you don't
believe in the Averett theory of the
universe splitting and still
kind of a mystery how if you observe
this double slit experiment one way you
get a wave-like behavior and another way
you get a particle like behavior which
is which is kind of the standard quantum
interpretation that depending on the
type of observation you get one kind of
behavior or another kind of behavior and
wheeler later played with that idea and
what's called a delayed choice
experiment saying what if the observer
says I'm going to do an experiment to
produce something like a particle like a
blip and then changes his mind and says
well I want to do an experiment to
produce something like a wave what
happens if the change takes place in the
middle of the experiment well he showed
that that that would also produce a
quantum effect and by the way physics
acts for those of you don't know was was
a course that firemen started at Caltech
which the only rule was asked me
anything and he would answer any student
questions it was a fun course I think
particularly for freshmen that it
firemen started and it was very
innovative and you know he would you
know answer any questions and students
would come up with and he ran it for
many for many years so if there are no
more questions thank you again to dr.
Halpern
thank you all for coming and we'll be
signing books outside thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
