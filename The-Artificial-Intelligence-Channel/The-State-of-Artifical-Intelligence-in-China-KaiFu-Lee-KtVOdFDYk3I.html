I hope you're enjoying your lunch I
would like to interrupt your
conversations briefly I hope you've been
enjoying the morning as much as I have
and now I would like to introduce our
intellectual dessert for lunch it is my
real my great honor and privilege to
introduce Chi Fuli chairman and CEO of
sin Ovation ventures now Chi few fufu
has a very long history of contributions
in AI starting with his PhD a degree
which was the first speaker independent
continuous speech recognition system
ever and so after he got his ph.d chi
foo was a professor at Carnegie Mellon
and held various executive positions at
Apple Microsoft Google and eventually
started off he started his venture fund
which is currently named sin evasion
ventures kai foo is a beloved AI
researcher in China and beyond please
welcome him
Thank You Daniela this morning when I
came to the conference the uber driver
asked me what kind of event I was going
to and I said ai in the future of work
so he said so how long before these
autonomous vehicles replace my job and
then I look and I said well this is the
u.s. some so I thought maybe 15 to 20
years he breathe decided relief and said
well I'll be retired by that it was good
that I wasn't asked that question in
China because I would probably be forced
to say more like 10 years so this talk
will give you some reasons as to why I
have such optimism about the future of
AI in China as well as some concerns so
I will try to cover a technology market
rather capital and policy around the eye
it's not a technology talk but we always
have to begin with technology because
many of you are probably thinking of all
the Turing Award recipients in AI of all
the deep learning inventors of all the
triple AI fellows while there aren't
that many Chinese it's a very clearly
American and some would say American and
Canadian lead group of elite top super
AI researchers and we had the privilege
of hearing from one of them this morning
but I want to tell you that while the
very very top certainly is still
dominated by American researchers when
you start to look at China the numbers
are growing unbelievably fast and I get
a little bit of credit for that for
having started Microsoft Research Asia
which was that for me Thank You Jennifer
you remember those days when we're at
Microsoft and there are now five
thousand people trained by that
organization and and the core work that
we did was AI and you can see the nine
people listed are sent basically CTOs
at Baidu Alibaba Tencent toteal and hire
Lenovo basically all the big names some
our CTO some are you know heads of AI
basically the
College has spread to help the Chinese
companies move into the age of AI and
there's a lot of new people in their 30s
and 40s and I show some of them here who
are quite well known there's you know
committee chairs on cvpr and comfort
conferences like that and and also the
young people actually are jumping into
AI at a speed that would be hard to
believe a short story about ten years
ago the Dean of Chinua School of
Management
economics and management told me well
this year the top super tarp smart
people more of them picked Business
School than computer science he said it
quite proudly and that was I think 2005
and I asked him what was the reason and
he said well goldman sachs started
paying global salaries in China so that
single small insignificant and important
basically irrelevant information was
enough to move half of the jong-un those
of you were Chinese notice the
provincial number one scorer at the
National entrance exam went to the
School of Economics and business and of
course they've all come back and now the
age of AI all the jong-un pretty much
select computer science as their area
and I recently talked to a bunch of
graduates and I said hey how many why do
you want to work on AI and they said
well it pays more I said how much more
does it pay and they said about 50
percent so these guys know their numbers
and I'm not saying all Chinese students
are economically motivated but it is an
important element so if you take it and
this is an example there are many such
examples one of the companies I talked
about we fund probably fund this morning
is called face plus plus this year
actually one week ago there were the
three category winner of the Microsoft
Coco and places image competition
beating some of the top industrial teams
in the world their chief scientists
sangeun is was the inventor one of the
inventors of rest nets which is one of
the technologies used in alphago zero
and this company is valued well over a
billion dollars and they're recognizing
three million faces at any given time
deployed everywhere used commercially in
security applications as well as since I
I phone acts has come out with
capability a number of Chinese pop phone
manufacturers are rushing to match
iPhone I can't name who they are but
they're basically all of them and most
of them have chosen face plus plus
technology they don't have the fancy 3d
technology that iPhone has but for ID
hey you don't need it so this is an
example where face recognition is
legitimately won by the Chinese
companies there are a few other
companies who are really at the top and
they win because they focus on it it's
hard work it's not necessarily you know
brilliant paper publishing but is really
getting that paper to work pragmatically
in real applications with huge amounts
of data and laborious labeling that were
initially manual and eventually
automatic so that kind of dedication is
very like Chinese companies and here is
an example while in face recognition in
my old field speech recognition Baidu
and I fly tech both claim to have nuance
Google level of capabilities for for the
respective languages so that Chinese
industrial companies in applications are
really catching up in the technologies
but really what about the papers so if
you were looking as like 10 or 12 years
ago there are there are a small number
of Chinese authors but now the citations
are up to sorry see misspelled citations
are up to 53% of all papers published
were ethnically Chinese authors and for
the three percent of the authors way
more than the Chinese percentage as a
percentage of a world population so the
top top ones are not yet Chinese but the
medium ones are quickly emerging and
this is selecting from the top
publications not any publication so
technology is definitely behind but
catching up and huge numbers are
jumping in and what about the market as
we heard this morning the size of the
data set is incredibly important to the
AI algorithms AI algorithms most of them
are open source and well-known you do
need a few smart people to tweak them
but to apply them this network effect
virtuous cycle effect happens by having
first you have more if you have more
data you have a product that's better
trained with AI which will get you more
users that will make you more money and
then you'll hire more scientists buy
more machines and get ya more data this
cycle is has been the success factor of
Facebook Google and Microsoft and in
China Baidu Tencent Alibaba and many
many others there we had a saying speech
that's Victor and Jim would remember
well there's no data like more data I
think this is attributed to Fred Jelinek
and and more data really makes things
better the graph on the Left basically
shows the contents not that important
but what it shows is when you increase
the data the horizontal axis each of the
algorithms dramatically improve in
accuracy whichever algorithm you pick as
long as they're reasonable choices so
believing that a super scientist can do
magic on a particular given AI problem
that just isn't the case a very good
scientist with a ton of data will beat a
super scientist with a small amount of
data any day so with that how much data
does China have we all know China has
the world the has the most users in
mobile and Internet so you would
probably think oh that's 3x that's
significant that means China has an edge
because some mobile users for the you
know Baidu will have more than Google
queries and Alibaba will have more than
Amazon transactions but maybe a factor
of three for us in China just
considering for now the respective
countries not worried about the global
expansion and so on you think the gap is
a factor of three it is absolutely not
a gap of three it is dramatically larger
than that here I'll give you two
examples one is the China
for mobile payments the Chinese people
use the phone to pay for the goods 50
times more often than Americans that is
by passing when you when you whip out
your phone rather than your credit card
or cash to pay
that's phone payment 50 times more all
of that is data that goes back to
trained AI models Chinese food delivery
10 times more than the US I don't have
time to go into the specifics as to why
but is I'm just saying the proliferation
of mobile as an as a point to life
online and offline is happening much
faster than in the u.s. if you actually
go to China spend the day I mean spend a
day with a Chinese person you will be
amazed at what people do they carry the
Chinese people carry no cash that is
take a phone and you pay all your
utilities with your phone you buy
everything with your phone you get you
you don't go to restaurants you just
order out it gets delivered you go off
work open your phone app order food by
the time you're home food is that right
there hot off of the electrical motor
motorbike with free delivery so these
are examples where it's China is
dramatically changing and leapfrogging
the way that mobile is and should be
used and here is another example shared
bicycles most of what you read in the US
about shared bicycles is simply wrong
shared bicycle is a phenomenal product
that is bringing value to the user it's
making the environment better and it's
going to have a business model that will
make a lot of money it does create a
mess in the streets that needs to be
fixed but this graph shows you five of
the apps and how long they took to get
to 20 million orders per day this is not
a daily active user this is not a page
view this is dollars being spent imagine
20 million per day how many US apps get
that many orders and how long does it
take for a new app to get to that speed
mobike the shared bicycle company we
invested in took 10 months to get to go
from nothing to
20 million orders payments per day so
all of that is data so when we talked
about the three wave for waves in the
morning this is the third wave you've
got 22 million bicycles transmitting
their GPS and other sensor information
up to the server
creating 20 terabytes of data that can
be mined for all kinds of things
dd also transmits 20 million shared I
mean it's like uber rides per day and DD
has been recently connected to the
traffic lights and it's dramatically
reducing that the amount of time it
takes to go from place a to be by
synchronizing the traffic lights in
accordance with how many people are
going into which way so all of these
things will be data that will drive that
will make existing efficient products
applications more efficient and they
will enable new applications we've never
thought of so a moment on mobile payment
just just because this is so important
even though it's not directly on the AI
topic when you're phone is able to make
mobile payments here are the things that
happens first understand why the mobile
payment is first it's not like a credit
card there's no three percent charged by
the bank it's basically frictionless
basically free secondly it's
peer-to-peer any of us can pay anyone
else you don't have to be a merchant or
customer and and and it's and thirdly
it's instantaneous so there's no wait
for the credit card verification
approval when this happens this will
make huge changes it will make
previously Chinese Chinese and China are
a savings economy it will become a
spending economy because it's so easy to
spend so basically just there's
something you want to buy you'll buy it
and also so easy to take a loan and
that's why we were able to fund this
company that does smart loans they're
doing 30 million loans per year this is
just one company and there are 10 of
them right 30 million loans because
they're no credit cards so by China was
behind because US had the world's best
Peyman infrastructure called credit
cards but china being behind got a
chance to leapfrog and that's happened
over the past time just two or three
years now it's um it's it's basically
used everywhere and what will happen
next is you're probably thinking a lot
about amazon acquiring whole food but we
think that is a rather primitive
activity in china online and offline are
merged completely there are companies
that are basically able to track offline
users and transmit their behavior online
to be fully integrated with online
activities so to make that clear
you know when you browse on amazon
amazon knows what page you're on what
you click what you bought but you didn't
buy and who you are what you've bought
in the past but imagine that happened in
real life right if the stores and
shopping malls used video cameras and
other sensors and really knew what you
did and transmitted it up up up to the
data servers it will be able to online
and offline make stronger predictions on
what you want it will submit that
through the store so they buy the right
inventory and then the stores will cause
the right supply chain to happen and new
products will be designed based on users
so all the loop will be connected and
that will happen in not just consumption
but also in in education in in many many
other areas so this is something that's
happening in China I just wrote a piece
for The Economist on this topic I think
this will be a phenomenal change that
while Amazon go is the most advanced
technologically advanced example in
China autonomous stores are really
coming up everywhere and I would guess
in another year when you go to China the
chances are half your shopping will be
going through semi autonomous or
autonomous stores so this is a speed at
which Chinese companies implement things
so what about product can Chinese people
build good products or good AI products
many of you probably still remember the
days when China was nothing but copycats
and that is something that definitely
was the case 15 years ago everything was
a copycat every single good startup was
a copycat but by
copying I don't mean IP theft I just
mean copy the look and feel and the
functionality from you know Yahoo to
Cena from Google to Baidu and so on but
that copying taught entrepreneurs how to
build products to suit users they became
good product managers and then they very
quickly they went to the next stage
where they were inspired by American
innovation still but then they built
features on top of that so Weibo was a
better product and is a better product
than Twitter today and Juhu is a better
profit than Cora Cora
today and Thabo is a better profit than
eBay
today and we Chad is a better product
than Facebook messengers today
not that they were original but they
evolve quickly based on a large market
and feedback so that's the second column
the third column is now that a fortified
with all that knowledge building new
products the Chinese companies are
coming out with brand new innovations
products not seen in America shared
bicycle is example total is a customized
news when I was at Google we tried for
years to target news but total managed
to do it before Google right so will be
too hard to explain so I won't bother
VIP kid is a distance learning
connecting the underpaid American
teacher to the desiring to learn English
Chinese students mobike has just shared
bicycle and our sponsor and financial I
didn't put it here because they're the
sponsor came up with a lot of financial
products including helping you to gain a
higher interest rate than the bank
because you use them for the
transactions and of course naturally
what comes next is copy from China
becomes sorry copy a to China becomes
copy from China and other products are
using Chinese features and inspiration
so the Chinese products at least for
mobile are every bit as good and
generally better than the American
counterpart so it's not surprising to
see the Chinese company valuations are
at u.s. levels so add these up together
and they'll be roughly comparable
they're obviously cases where Google is
more expensive than Baidu but there are
also cases where maytime is much more
expensive thing
so Chinese companies are matching
American valuations so what about and
their products have to be good for that
so let's come back to our four waves and
evaluate product to product product wise
our Chinese air products going to
leapfrog American ones and I will make
some predictions in the first wave using
Internet data I think generally speaking
Chinese Internet companies will leapfrog
the American ones not not every single
case and the reason is when you have
mobile and payment when everyone new
innovations will come up because
everyone can pay there will be so many
ways to make money using the loan as an
example and also p80 Baidu Alibaba in
ten cents unlike Facebook Microsoft and
Google are less restricted by antitrust
laws and are tenacious in terms of
territory expansions so every one of
them is going to have a bank an
insurance company and so on and so forth
much faster than they the American
counterparts so I'm I feel that value of
data value of higher quality AI will
help the Internet companies grow second
wave commercial data that's China lags
the u.s. largely because large
traditional Chinese companies never
bothered to data warehouse their
important content or if they did they
did a very poor job so for them to turn
that into value is extremely difficult
whereas companies like you know element
that they I IBM Watson Palantir are able
to sell AI software on top of structured
data stored by the American companies
the Chinese companies have yet to
structure eyes their data and that will
take time but the government is pushing
them policies are pushing them forward
and there's chance to catch up in the
future but not not for now the third
wave digitizing the real world I think
China will leapfrog the US I gave this
shared bicycle example so much more GPS
and data is being transmitted there's
less concerned about privacy and also
it's about hardware right about building
all these sensors and in China
everything is a lot cheaper so timid
jingling essentially is a proud
like the Amazon echo and it's now
selling at $15 in China the cameras
there's a company called hike on which
HK vision they sell six billion dollars
of surveillance cameras in China six
billion US dollars of Revenue and you
figure out how many cameras they are and
those cameras all capturing high quality
video on which you can do recognition
and metadata gathering and AI
predictions and face recognition so
those reasons I think generally speaking
will cause China to leap ahead and the
lastly full automation in terms of in
terms of autonomous vehicles and robots
u.s. is way ahead in technology and by
way ahead we mean two years that's
really a long time however the Chinese
companies are faster moving with
government support and also hardware
production is lower costs so we will see
who ends up being ahead I would say it's
a 50/50 at this point so how about
capital I'll go quickly on this on
capital lots of money going in lots of
AI companies on the left but very
notable to see is the Chinese government
matching fund has dramatically been
increased to three hundred fifty three
billion in in last year and what's a
matching fund the matching fund is the
government becomes an LP in a VC fund
with and willingness to take a lower
return than other LPS that is an
encouragement for the top DC's to take
government money and spend less time
raising money and more time building
great companies and it's a inspired by
Israeli and Singaporean practices which
are very smart practices and Chinese
secondary market somewhat similar to the
US market but much more with much more
how shall we say this irrational
exuberance I guess then even the
American market whenever a company's
branded AI even when it's not the price
goes crazy so here are give an example
of a company that actually has AI is the
only one I know all the other ones I
think are fake but
but this one is a speech recognition
company every bit arguably comparable to
nuance but look at the gap of the
private market capitalization is now
value at ten billion dollars relative to
nuance four billion compared to just a
few years ago it was two to one the
other way and of course HK vision the
company that makes the the cameras is
now market cap fifty billion and then a
company that makes dancing toy robots is
valued at five billion and so on so
forth
so a lot of capital flowing in obviously
creating some bubble but also lots of
fuel and lots of motivation for young
smart people to go into AI so lastly
what about the government programs the
government program probably the most
significant report came out July of this
year and contrasted with Obama's report
one year ago you'll see that Obama's
report was very rational and very recent
reasoned about long term resources about
regulations about thinking about ethics
and things like that
the Chinese report was very
straightforward by 2020 catch up on AI
technology and applications by 2030
become a global AI innovation hub okay
and and more recently and it's typical
of the five year planning approach China
has taken and more recently in the
nineteenth Congress speech President Xi
Jinping in his speech and quoted among
probably among the top five quotes of
that entire 200 minute speech okay there
may be five quotes repeated them but
this is like the State of the Union
address in the US the one of the five
quotes was that develop advanced
manufacturing promote further
integration of the internet Big Data
artificial intelligence with the real
world economy so he guess what we're
talking about in terms of AI and the
virtual world and real world combining
and if you're wondering a white paper
this it actually have any teeth well the
Chinese policies generally are very well
executed in 2010 China claimed it will
be the world's leader in high-speed rail
many people were skeptical in six years
60 percent of the worldwide high-speed
Rail trains are in China and then in
2015
a Premier Lee kichan declared a program
called Xiang Xiang and Zhang Zhang in
English is mass entrepreneurial
entrepreneurship and innovation movement
it's about making everybody should be an
entrepreneur
it's rather how should we say strong
maybe in pushing everyone to do that but
let's just look at the result the result
is in China there are now 8,000
incubators accelerators up from 1700 in
just one and a half years and they're
156 hi-tech science parks so we can
expect that the AI steps will turn into
real there are several companies talking
to us and some of it is quoted on
Financial Times and generally speaking I
think it wouldn't be an exaggeration to
say that municipal governments of second
and third tier cities are prepared to
put in a hundred two hundred million
dollars to an incent AI companies from
setting up in that city so that's going
to end up with results in the last point
I'll make is that Chinese government in
general is protec right when Alibaba
came out there were questions about you
know how to deal with taxes how to deal
with them can can Alibaba go into
banking and licenses and things like
that Chinese government has proven that
when new technology comes out they'll
give it benefited out let it grow for a
while if it takes off then come back and
look at it as opposed to use policies to
forbid things and then on the right the
Chinese environment is more conducive
for fast launch fast iteration I'm not
making a comment that this is good or
bad I'm just stating a fact
this morning we heard a lot about
ethical considerations bias issues I
think in China the general belief is
just launch something get it iterated
their problems will fix it and we'll get
data and get better over time and that
spirit I think will launch China forward
and again not commenting on whether it's
the right thing or the wrong thing but
launched China forward to become a very
strong AI power so in conclusion I think
in this age of AI the us-china duopoly
is just
not and in I wouldn't say it's
inevitable it is it has already arrived
thank you energizing talk I am so
energized and I hope so are you and this
and in this age of accelerated
everything I would like to ask you to
accelerate your way back to the other
auditorium we are already half an hour
behind programs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
