all began with genetically modified
Tomatoes then came genetically modified
chickens and now genetically modified
human embryos earlier this year a team
of American researchers successfully
corrected a gene mutation responsible
for a heart disease in humans it was the
first known case of gene editing
performed on human embryos in the US and
scientists did it using the gene editing
tool CRISPR the groundbreaking
experiment raised many questions like
how safe was the procedure and what are
the ethics of manipulating the human
genome joining us from Portland Oregon
to answer these questions is dr. schukat
Matali pause dr. Matali pause played a
senior role in this game-changing
research
he's also the principal investigator at
the center for embryonic cell and gene
therapy of Oregon Health and Science
University dr. Metallica welcome to
quarks and quarks thank you why were you
interested in applying CRISPR gene
editing technology to human embryos in
it my Center we interested in in ways of
changing mutant genes back to the normal
and we actually interested in genes that
the human population carry and then
often transmit to next generation
so-called germline mutations so these
inheritable mutations actually are there
are thousands of them and cause variety
of conditions in this case this mutation
that encodes the heart muscle would
cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy it's a
heart disease so idea was always that to
prevent in the recurrence of these
diseases we could you know develop
approaches but we could change this
mutant gene back to normal and we have
to do it you know in either sperm and
eggs so those are cells that usually
parents will pass to children then
that's how embryo is formed all right
after sperm fertilized egg so we used
CRISPR because it's actually just recent
development that allows us to really
access to that very specific mutant gene
and induce the change that we want
what's the advantage of doing this gene
therapy at the embryonic stage so
basically once the mutant gene is
transmitted and child is born very
little sometimes we can do because it's
already made a damage to organ tissue
and most the time it's multiplied so
we're dealing with billions of cells in
in organs and we have now a task of you
know getting and accessing every edge
this mutant Keenan changing back to
normal which is almost impossible to do
so idea is that we we do it much much
earlier right before fertilization know
that the time of fertilization so we
could you know the child or embryo
already formed would be with normal gene
well briefly take me through what you
did in your experiment so first we would
have to identify the disease that had
passed from generation to generation and
sometimes as we know about them because
family already have a children with this
mutation and probably they have a family
history and that's how we we have many
families that have this hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy so once we identify this
mutation we would ask for example in
this case a mail carrier of this
mutation to donate his his sperm so it's
a reproductive cells so we could try to
develop this CRISPR tool that would kind
of recognize and flag this mutant gene
the only mutant gene and once it does
it's it's actually induces cut in that
gene so it's a kind of damage so it
would disrupt the chain of that in a
code and then this one sperm with that
disrupted gene enters into the egg after
fertilization what happens is that there
is a the eggs
have DNA repair mechanism so basically
they're always looking for this kind of
the disrupted genes in this case
immediately recognized that there is
damage in in one of the genes and they
recruit all the machinery that normally
they have to repair it so basically to
glue back that broken piece and by doing
that I actually would repair any
abnormalities that came with that sperm
so this is the actually yes the CRISPR
kind of initially flags the mutant gene
but eggs and then embryo later corrects
by itself oh I see so the CRISPR doesn't
fix the gene is the it's the egg that
fixes that damaged gene so based on what
you've done so far how safe is this
procedure so far I think seems like it's
safe since we didn't detect any
abnormality you know any of target
mutations even though we say you know
it's it's been done with with most you
know modern sequencing technologies but
there is still possibility so we missed
something but again I think it's we we
need to probably develop much much
thorough and maybe some alternative ways
of looking at this off target mutation
using maybe some completely different
assays and before we say it's it's
completely safe now since your
experiment there has been some criticism
renowned biologist George church at
Harvard University thinks that the heart
disease causing mutation could have been
just deleted and not repaired as your
results suggested what do you think
about that approach yeah I think the so
basically this is because of you know
this type of self repair believed to be
occurs very very rarely in our case as I
said it's 50% cases so this was pretty
unusual and of course they did the most
of the community wants to reproduce
these results and and to see if there
was maybe something that we missed so we
actually done quite a extensive work to
retesting many of our samples and we
we're now quite sure that it was
actually repair but it wasn't wasn't any
any removing the
gene well your work was looking at a
form of heart disease could this
approach be used to treat other genetic
diseases in humans absolutely so we were
talking about the genetic code and how
how embryos would repair the you know
mutations you know using this approach
and since you know DNA is pretty much
you know it's the same just different
code and it could be used for a variety
of different mutations there are also
you know as I said about several
thousand gene mutations that we know for
sure cause human disease and and ideas
that we could develop this type of
CRISPR that would target all these known
human mutations and and hopefully in the
future we could develop the whole
library of the CRISPR that would that
would be specific for these mutations
and and hopefully if procedures shown to
be safe we could clearly you know move
forward to to clinical trial sometimes
in future well sounds like it could be a
very powerful tool for treating disease
now some people might take it to the
extreme and say that well this is
opening the floodgate to human eugenics
and designer babies what do you respond
to those ethical concerns I think it's a
legitimate concern of course and so the
guests because it can be used for some
unintended you know the non
disease-causing experiments I think we
need to regulate it dr. Mutulu Paul
