Union when the president used the speech
to bake a short section to talk about
his desire for research on the brain now
if we want to make the best products we
also haven't have to invest in the best
ideas every dollar we invested to map
the human genome returned $140 to our
economy every dollar today our
scientists are mapping the human brain
to unlock the answers to Alzheimer's
joining us from Boston is George church
he's with Harvard Medical School he's a
genetics professor also has experience
with the human genome project
dr. Church thanks for joining us hi it's
great to be here
so dr. Church what was the president
talking about what's what is he
proposing well I think he's speaking in
broad strokes there and I think a number
of people have weighed in since since
that time I you know I can address the
the science of the the brain activity
map which is aimed at ultimately a
project to develop technology that could
bring down the cost and improve our
ultimately our clinical applications of
measuring and stimulating large number
of neurons and complex circuits that are
important for human and animal behavior
so could you first tell us where the
federal government comes in as far as
their ability to map the human brain
learn more about it that's not already
done at medical research facilities
across the United States well I think we
are very much talking about research
that is already done but the opportunity
exists for from making it much more
cost-effective for all the research that
is done there's on the order of half a
billion dollars of research that's done
and if our experience from genomics
holds true we've brought the cost down
about a million fold in the last decade
for genomics if we could do the same
thing here it would be a huge impact on
both research and clinical applications
so
on the science side what does it mean to
map the human brain so it's very
important to think of this differently
as a kind of a static map that you might
use like a street map this is a this is
a dynamic one and something that that
could be personalized from person to
person and taught and moment-to-moment
it's it's really technology that enables
us to look not at a course level but at
a very fine level of individual neurons
which is the unit of activity for the
brain so that the the mapping is to
provide us a way of looking at how our
brain act works in normal activity and
in pathological States and to fix it
real time potentially so give us an
example of what faces researches
especially if the federal government
gets involved
what faces them as they go forward on
this project and what difficulty are we
talking about well the opportunities
here are we have some examples of brain
monitoring and stimulation like cochlear
implants and retinal implants and brain
stem injury where you can get a
tetraplegic to be able to move objects
these are great challenges we have a
little bit of activity clinically where
you might be able to put in a dozen
electrodes maybe even 100 but to get the
fine structure you need something
between the hundreds that we can do and
the hundred billion that they exist in
the brain and that's such a gigantic
challenge that can be addressed by
nanotechnology synthetic biology new
optical fiber methods is on so
essentially what will happen on the
research side is that you'll find I
guess test subjects to help you with
this and what does it mean for them or
how does that work well we already have
clinical applications such as the ones I
just just mentioned that did involve
research subjects that have a lot to
gain that some experiments will be done
in in in animals to develop the
technology and make sure that it's safe
you know I think that this could go well
beyond the the applications that we
already have in place for electrodes and
become become much less invasive and
apply to neurodegenerative and nervous
psychiatric disorders as well as well as
normal behavior so we you because you
were involved in the human genome
project once a brain gets mapped what
does it do for fields like those going
through degenerative diseases what does
it do for how we handle our emotions
what does it do for you know how we you
know have memory especially if you've
survived an accident things like that
will those areas be improved or the
ability to understand those areas
improve because of what we're doing or
what's being proposed I think those and
many others what's important is for us
not to over promise on a particular
disease and a particular date but what
we what we can do is make strong efforts
to bring down the costs improve the
quality lower the invasiveness of the
methods and increase the
comprehensiveness so if a neural circuit
requires a very large number of neurons
to be simultaneously monitored and
stimulated we can improve the technology
for that and this will be a benefit for
researchers and clinicians worldwide a
proposal though it's also not oh go
ahead it's also an opportunity for the
United States to continue technology
leadership a proposal to map the human
brain as it were coming from the
president our guests here to talk about
the science side of it and what the
government can do technology that's
being used and what could happen because
of it if you want to ask them questions
here's how you can do so for our
Democrat for Republicans it's two oh two
five eight five three eight eight one
four Democrats two oh two five eight
five three eight eight zero for
independence two oh two five eight five
three eighty two you can tweet us at
c-span w-j email us at journal at c-span
org professor Church we have an E more a
tweet that says professor much it must
there's much misunderstanding so discuss
what the map of the human genome is and
is not and then expand it to project for
mapping the brain
right so the the the original project
for the human genome was to simply
sequence that is determine a C's GS and
T's that compose our genome but we all
knew from the beginning that we would
also have to compare many human genomes
and the in their traits and many other
organisms and and really the payoff for
the genome project which has been quite
large is the technology that we can now
apply in in clinical settings for
measuring microorganisms for measuring
carrier status for various inherited
diseases cancer and so forth this is
just really be playing out quite
amazingly in in the marketplace and in
research labs all over the world our
first call is from James Clifton Springs
New York Republican line you're on with
Professor George Church of Harvard
Medical School go ahead mr. George
Church Harvard Medical School I think
it's great because I had an MRI on my
brain for supposedly dementia and I
almost got a kick out of it because I do
not have dementia at all and I also give
you credit for working with Teddy
Roosevelt Teddy Roosevelt Ted Kennedy's
issue of his brain which could be
wonderful the other issue is through
time we have become involved with
improving and hope they like you said
the cost the other issue that stands
real tall the equipment that we use and
the equalization over Yahoo where people
with dementia or Alzheimer's and I know
that Alzheimer's is generally for CPA's
bookkeeping strong in a very
close friend of mine has Alzheimer's one
and some people make a lot of fun of
them and I think that needs to be
stopped
thank professor Church go ahead right so
I mean I think that you've raised a
number of important questions like how
are we going to get Diagnostics that
that are accurate certainly that's going
to require approval process such as many
of the Diagnostics we have today and
that a lot of that's already in place
that cost is is important and you'll see
that as a continuing refrain that we
have here and hopefully there'll be many
diseases that are impacted it this will
not be a cure-all or a one-size-fits-all
the idea is to stimulate out-of-the-box
thinking have our young people
especially feel enabled by this and and
to encourage small science in various
forms
professor Church I guess it is it over
you how does the brain work and then be
with that in mind what's being
investigated or at least proposed by
this mapping project right well I think
the the general architecture of the
brain and the general operations at the
cellular level are understood that
what's what's missing are the things in
between that is the same the things
between the sort of low resolution
structure and and activity that you can
see say in MRI that the caller mentioned
and and the very fine-grain things that
we can do at amazing levels of
microscopy and an electrode measurements
that needs to be connected there's this
whole interesting realm where you're the
hundred billion neurons various subsets
interact and in it being able to monitor
them many at once is now possible but
not just because of our increased
computational ability to measure model
and then feedback and stimulate but but
these new nano technologies and
and finer optical technologies and and
so forth max is from College Station
Texas Democrats line hi hey you're on
sir I've got my questions
dr. church is do you think any spin-off
industries will come from brain activity
mapping well oh the beauty of this
project maybe even more than the genome
project is that this that there's
already a number of relevant in
industries which include imaging which
is diagnostic deep brain stimulation for
epilepsy and various relatively crude
treatments that can get be greatly
improved so so that infrastructure is in
place and we hope to to improve it by
factors of 10 on a regular basis there
are other industries less obvious so for
example artificial intelligence and big
data and so forth they can learn about
how the human brain works or they could
be involved in managing the the gigantic
tsunami of data that will flow out of
the sort of project both research and
clinical doctor Church the Financial
Times had a write-up about that the
president's proposal and some other
related matters it talked about an
effort in Switzerland called the Blue
Brain Project it goes a little technical
but it says in stimulating neural
circuitry it's involved in the process
as an IBM Blue Gene supercomputer
feeding data from the studies of real
brains to build a virtual brain can you
expand on that sure we we do hope as we
did in genome project to have an
internationally coordinated project what
we're doing in the United States already
and will in the brain activity map
include computational modeling much of
in but the emphasis will be on on
measurement and stimulation which allows
you to test the models that that that
are developed in computers I think
that's critical to to coordinate them
the mod
with the measurements and with the tests
of them Vicki from Fort Lauderdale
Florida
good morning honor independent life good
morning
I was just wondering with regard to the
gene we found that the absence to the
presence of a certain gene would
indicate possible criminal behavior how
would this possibly assist when you're
talking about children who come with
disorders that may be bipolar or ADHD or
schizophrenia that could be detected
earlier I would hope that that kind of
mapping would be it would be something
that would be a priority for for those
people and especially a doctor Church as
far as Alzheimer's we know that about
five million Americans living with
Alzheimer's as it stands and it impacts
about one in eight older Americans the
sixth leading cause of death in the u.s.
so can this I know you referred to it
before but you know this research kind
of helped those conditions later on or
at least alleviate those right so so the
caller correctly reminds us that
genetics and stem cell therapies and so
forth are are extremely important parts
of the of the research and and future
clinical aspects of brain technology and
science and we need to emphasize those
along with this brain activity map and I
think there's going to be some
tremendous opportunities for synergy the
brain activity map certainly is using
synthetic biology as one of the
methodologies and we need to but back to
the question of predisposition to
certain genetic disorders this is in
some cases highly accurate meaning
highly predictable in other cases less
so at our current knowledge it's
important to consider the environmental
components and that's just really still
in the future for many of these diseases
is integrating the genetics and
environment and being able to measure
brain activity in a highly
a high fine granularity will help us
connect the genetics the environment the
the day-to-day activity of the brain and
the final outcomes of many years later
and I think it's important to try to be
as encouraged these technologies allow
us to be more accurate in our diagnosis
Miami Beach peoples Miami deep Beach
Florida Prachi on a Democrat sign hello
hi you're on hi dr. Church I have a
question in terms of the technology that
you're going to use we know that with
functional MRI and with pet we are able
to look at cortical activation patterns
but I want to understand more you know
with reference to the high resolution
imaging you just talked about microscopy
and optics and the laser if we are able
to utilize that a during tests and
resting state in the light human brain
and how good are those technologies
right so we're talking about a broad
range of technologies any improvement in
the current imaging methods whether it's
fMRI or
D MRI or various other methodology would
be welcomed and integrated with with
electrodes and and optical fiber methods
which are for the most part that the
optical methods used in animals so far I
think they look very promising and they
and the opportunity here is to get the
increase the technology rapidly dr.
Church a couple of things the Washington
Post when they wrote about this proposal
wrote this they said it's easy to see
how a company such as Google could build
on findings from the brain activity map
project and build new brain assistance
for our computing devices that mimic the
activity of the human brain at the same
time entirely new companies may emerge
offering futuristic services such as
cosmic brain surgery or Total Recall off
of Twitter we have viewer who asked you
know on with that in mind does
mapping a precursor to digitizing
memories personalities etc I think it's
a little hard to predict where this is
going I think we need we need a ethical
legal social oversight at every stage
it's never too early to start those
discussions I think we need to also
avoid over-promising if these are
considered desirable but but certainly
if any of those are to happen then we'll
need projects like this to get us close
enough so that we can do this in a safe
and highly predictive manner can you
expand about expand on your statement we
need ethical legal oversight on these
kind of matters well I think that just
as we have sort of asked ourselves in
the in the genome project and in
synthetic biology and in many other
recent fields there's a there's a need
to think of all the different ways that
this can the risks and the benefits the
ways that can go right and wrong and
anticipate those years in advance at a
time where it doesn't seem urgent so
some of the ones that were just listed
on that that sheet just the tip of the
iceberg and we have such conversations
going on already and we hope to have
more as this project ramps up Sarah from
Olympia Washington independent line good
morning I am I'm curious whether or not
there's been a Bayes theorem app applied
to try to estimate the pretest
probability that will find anything
that's worth worth the cost and so you
know if you use a Bayes theorem you have
to have a pretest probability test
you'll have a positive or negative
outcome and you also have to have a
post-test results and using those two
you can then determine whether or not
the pretest probability was close enough
the post-test reality to justify the
cost of such a huge project and if it
doesn't match with the Bayes theorem
then how do you justify spending all
this money mapping random things on
random people that may not necessarily
correlate between person to person and
or if you mistakenly correlate two
things or more between one individual
and another well then correlation is not
related to causality so you end up with
more information than you want to deal
with it seems like caller thank you
right I think you raised some
interesting points things that we are
definitely aren't on our frontal front
lines of inquiry so the hope is to bring
down the cost of ongoing research there
it there will be some investment
required to do that but as but and it is
hard to just apply something theoretical
like Bayes theorem in advance but I
think we can see precedence maybe as the
is the term rather than something highly
theoretical where a small investment has
in the case of genome project a million
times lower costs and higher quality
have have resulted in this particular
case we want to be attentive to the the
cost-effectiveness as you would for any
diagnostic and therapeutic going forward
what was the cost of the genome project
and can you relate those to how much
this or at least the federal money that
might be required to make this thing
happen
right well so the the cost of the genome
project was originally estimated and
delivered at about three billion dollars
I think that the the costs have come
down consider
as a consequence of that and as
activities since then the Patel report
which Obama referred to in the clip that
you showed at the beginning estimated
one hundred forty fold return on
investment I think that that and that
report said that that could grow over
time I think this is true of many
effective technologies is not
necessarily exceptional but it it is
quite remarkable to see it happening so
quickly what just one last point on the
previous caller is a question about
getting information that that applying
to one person and not to another the
intention is to have this personalizes
so technology that we can use on a
day-to-day on individuals and the
question about correlation versus
causation if we can not only measure but
stimulate neurons us as occurs in
certain clinical procedures already for
epilepsy and so on then we can test
hypotheses from the beginning of the
project and I think that's one of the
the hopes is not to just collect a
one-size-fits-all data set for one
person and assume it applies other
people but to test causality as we go
along and on a and develop technology
this is low and evasive misses possible
and applicable to many people real-time
how long does this type of research kind
of take do you think well you know it's
it's it's it's something that that may
be better off without a a strict
deadline that is to say that the Human
Genome Project assertiveness continues
and get in grows now into Personal
Genome Project and other that where
we're now doing hundreds of thousands of
human genomes already we hope that there
will be a moment or two along the vein
activity map where we can say okay we
this is we now have technology that's
capable of what we set out to do and now
let's apply it a more broadly to a
variety of interesting problems both
research and clinical this is Donald
Killeen Texas Republican line
you're on hey thank you good good
morning basically I have a cleft lip and
palate a lot of doctors have told me
hello you're on go ahead yes I have a
closing palette a lot of doctors have
told me it's not genetic but I can tell
you throughout my family I have four
five in my family over several
generations that have this so but
regardless of that I mean I'm for
anything that if if you can find out for
any reason things that basically cause
certain things certain disorders or
whatever I'm all for that
I mean thanks color yeah I get again I
think this raises the important point
that this that the brain activity map
should be one that's highly integrated
with other neuroscience efforts
including neurogenetics and neuronal
stem cells and other pluripotent stem
cell projects
professor Church we've been talking here
about budget cuts that go or plan to go
into effect next week does the National
Institutes of Health get affected if
they get budget cuts overall to the
larger part of what's going on with the
the brain mapping project could could
that prove to be a difficulty well
really I can only address the science
with any expertise but I can offer my
personal opinion which is we need
projects like this to inspire the
American public to get back to its
leadership position and to bring down
costs and improve productivity hopefully
that they will see this as a reason to
to get our act together financially and
and start funding some of the things
that that actually keep our country
going
from Twitter Jodi asked is it true that
the human brain is hardwired when you
are young so probably the simplest maybe
oversimplified is no it is not hardwired
there's a the hole all the way up into
very old age where we're learning and a
lot and the wiring is is changing the
these so called synaptic weights are
changing we can we can learn to our
whole life but there is a lot that is
that is wired up by your genetics and a
lot that is wired up during your early
experiences so it's a continuum that we
will learn a great deal more about if we
go forward Cyril is from Lincoln
California he's on our Democrats line
hello good morning
Pedro thanks for taking my call thank
you for c-span my question goes to the
and I guess it kind of relates to an
earlier question but how do you how
would you incorporate in your project
either in your assumptions or your
structure the fact that different parts
of the brain can be used for different
things than different individuals for
example people who are blind from birth
use their visual cortex for other senses
and other things so there's a there's it
seems to be a huge variability from
individual to individual how do you
incorporate that into your project and
in in your structure assumption yeah
that's a that's a beautiful question and
and I think it it reflects our effort to
make technology so inexpensive that it
can be used for personalized medicine in
the same sense that now the genomics is
cheap enough that we can have
personalized genetic diagnosis and and
personalized therapies in in this case
it's wonderful how how plastic the brain
is how adaptable it can be as the as the
examples you gave in it we hope that
this will
allow us to leverage that when we get to
therapies so that we can now report
parts of the brain to compensate for the
either genetic environmental or a damage
related pathologies David Eagleman
writes in the New York Times this
morning he's a professor of neuroscience
at Baylor College he goes on to say that
it's the barrenness composed of a
hundred billion electrically active
cells called neurons each connected to
many thousands of its neighbors each
neuron relays information in the form of
miniature voltage spikes which are then
converted to chemical signals that
bridge the gap to other neurons most
neurons signal these semi signals many
times per second it's each signaling
event where make a sound as loud as a
pin dropping the cacophony from a single
human head would blow out by all the
windows the complexity of such a system
bankrupt our language observes our
observing our brain with our current
technologies we mostly detect an
enigmatic uproar any response to that
professor I think that's that's right on
target it's a very poetic and accurate
representation of the challenge in front
of us what's what what's terrific about
our new science weather ranging from you
know astrophysics particle physics
genome project and so forth is we are
capable of handling big data coming up
with models that that coalesce the data
into into something that's coherent and
then most importantly we be able to test
it and then I think in this case that's
one of our top priorities is being able
to take this cacophony of pin dropping
from hundreds of millions billions of
neurons and and turned them into models
that that can guide stimulation patterns
and ultimately therapies Rhonda from
Arlington Virginia thanks for waiting
independent line
thank you so much for this conversation
I just wanted to ask the guest I'm sure
he's aware that there are patents that
go back for advanced technology dealing
with brain research
to the 50s and 60s and there really is
no national dialogue about the research
that already exists there are support
groups and victims that are coming out
in droves on the internet and just do
Google searches on targeted individuals
organized stalking synthetic telepathy
and they are begging for help because
there is a misuse I'll give it a broad
category of directed-energy weapon REE
and whether it's rogue elements a
government or research at researchers at
universities they're using this
technology already and experimenting and
testing on United meets United States
citizens illegally now the NBC affiliate
in Palm Springs California just did a
story recently on hundreds of people
hearing voices and this was on the NBC
affiliate and through voices called
technology synthetic telepathy
Jesse Ventura just did an hour-long
program on mind control technology and I
just right now Senator Ron Wyden and
Richard Burr and are taller what's the
quiet what's the question for our guest
caller the question is how do you
address this technology that's already
out there that thanks caller right well
I think that I'm I think the sort of
technology you're talking about is still
mostly in the future and and as we
mentioned earlier in the program there's
incredible important to have these
discussions about the ethical legal
social components of that as we've done
on on other projects we need as each of
these technologies could have
incorporated into them monitoring so
that so that we know how they're how the
instruments are being used there could
be laws that that do for surveillance of
all such instruments
I think it's relatively difficult to -
it will be it will be difficult to work
on communicating with the human brain
without the full participation
of and close proximity to the person in
question that certainly our our this
project is not aimed it at affecting
brains at a distance but but having very
intimate contact probably requiring
currently requiring electrodes to be
implanted and hooked up to computers and
other devices
professor Church Haggadah well go ahead
I'm sorry no that's that's fine
yeah how did you get involved in brain
research so I I'm a technologist from
from all the way back to my early
education the technology for reading and
writing biological systems that is to
say input an output at many different
levels
we've I've had a long-term interest in
in genetics and genomics and we've
recently been developing technologies as
applicable to this brain activity map
George church joins us he's with Harvard
Medical School talking about brain
mapping proposal from the White House to
kind of enhance what's going on already
a walled in New York rep Republican line
Tom good morning good morning thank you
for uh c-span
my wife and I've been doing our dog for
four years plus now on a viral infection
what we thought is the cause of her
sleep disorder and I'd go to the
technology in like Pandora's Box once
it's open good luck trying to change it
I agree with his ethics concern but uh
we're thankful for the technology
because start off an MRI which wasn't
conclusive but now we just saw went down
in New York City and had a SPECT scan
that shows some promising things to get
the root cause of her disorder so I just
wanted to make that if he's in league
with the private sector also or just the
government thank you right yes I think
that there are some definite
opportunities here for integrating with
instrumentation and and the even
microbial influences on our general
health but also
specifically on on behavior and and
neural pathology so I as always that it
would be terrific if this is a well
integrated project integrated with
ongoing research which is amazing as
well as multiple fields that are
adjacent to brain activity Arthur joins
us from Livingston Manor New York
Democrats line Arthur were just about
finished so if you go ahead straight to
your question or comment please oh yeah
good morning I was wondering if you had
any timeframe with as far as this
mapping of what it would do to help
brain disease like Alzheimer's and maybe
even criminology professor Church yes
right so we hope the project as a whole
will make major strides may be factors
of 10 improvement and cost-effectiveness
and accuracy over the next decade
Alzheimers of criminology may not be the
the top priorities nor the top payoffs
for this project
possibly in collaboration with in the
case Alzheimers with work on genetics
and and stem cell technology we can make
a small contribution with criminology I
mean I said it's a very tall order and
and we'll have to wait and see how that
what we can do to contribute to the
genetic environmental and brain activity
components of that so another viewer on
Twitter said ask if you would list
several of the major hoped for outcomes
if brain mapping proceeds quickly and
successfully I think certainly the the
the variations on what's currently
progressing having to do a vision
hearing spinal cord injuries these are
all could be improved by orders of
magnitude I think we could get at
activity things that affect activity
over large parts of the brain where the
genetics is is less clear environment or
components more important
possibly such things as or other
neuropsychiatric disorders bypassing
parts of the brain has occurred in
traumatic brain injury there are a
number of possibilities that that we
will be pursuing Oh final question what
was your reaction to the president even
proposing this and their interest in
this topic I think the president was
speaking in fairly broad strokes it's a
I think fairly evidence in many people
that that there's a lot of interesting
research important of clinically for in
neuroscience broadly and we we hope that
this gains momentum it seems to be
