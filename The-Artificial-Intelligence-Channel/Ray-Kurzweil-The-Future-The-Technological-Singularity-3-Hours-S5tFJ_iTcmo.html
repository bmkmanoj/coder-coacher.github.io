participate in a discussion with one of
today's leading inventors join us as
booked TVs in depth welcomes Ray
Kurzweil author of the best-selling book
the age of spiritual machines his latest
is the singularity is near when humans
transcend biology
first of all would you tell the folks
your name and the size of the curtain
that's moving in your name my name is
Raymond Kurzweil and I'm from Queens New
York
Queens New York well Pamela Raymond and
I just happened to have brought along
this little piano here as you see and
Raymond in addition also happens to have
the old saying goes happens to have a
piece of music with them and before we
show the audience what his secret is we
have just a few seconds for Raymond to
play this piece of music Raymond pianos
are you feeling
nicely played and now your performance
of course leads into your secret so if
you'll whisper it to me will everybody
Raymond secret concerns something that
he did and will start the game this time
with Mars no I didn't did you
however use what is some kind of
formulas or letters or something unusual
used to compose to make up the notes of
this piece ah you couldn't say that
again well Kappa would the note spell
out a name or would they be a matter
anything like that not still haven't
named nothing like that $20 down 60 to
go Henry where's that thing written by a
computer
is there writing music at this moment
understand this issue well but perhaps
you can explain how it works first of
all I want the folks to see sort of some
of this this nest of spaghetti-like wire
here is united to a bunch of little
watts what are these two black things
over here really that's right
I see the relays right the music they
feed it into this white cheese box here
whatever that is and there are three
little are these wires or just pieces of
string Hopkins hanger wire
I mean this is a message go through
there is important what music I see and
then the typewriter does the final part
of the process
Ray Kurzweil what were you thinking as
you were watching that I haven't seen
that for a while I looked pretty relaxed
there that's at age 17 so what made you
want to create a computer that could
write music that was actually my first
pattern-recognition project I mean
that's been my field of interest I've
been fascinated with how the human brain
is able to recognize patterns and we
actually realize now that that is the
heart of human intelligence I mean that
is that is what humans are good at
that's what we're we still excel in
comparison to machines and that we can
recognize patterns only a certain type
of patterns but machines are getting
better and I've been studying that field
and trying to teach computers to
recognize patterns and and that's I
think it's really the heart of you
intelligence when we figure that out
we'll be able to create machines that
have the full range of human
intelligence and why is it important to
have machines do that because it's an
expansion of our own intelligence I mean
we already expand our own intelligence
with our machines and we were routinely
doing intellectual feats it would be
impossible without a computers whether
it's math or science or if in fact few
professionals could do their jobs today
without our machines we have an
exponentially expanding knowledge base
we're the only species it has knowledge
and that doubles in size every year and
we need our technology to keep track of
it and we need pattern recognition to
actually find the information that we
want to
fine and so this is really part of the
manifest destiny if you will of our
civilization to expand knowledge and
pattern recognition is really the key to
both creating knowledge and finding it
and applying it and could you boil that
down to a practical application if a
computer does and is able to do that
what computers do with that kind of
information and knowledge well one thing
that's I've found exciting I mean it
what's exciting for an inventor is is
not just an abstract theory but that
sort of leap from formulas on a
blackboard to actually changing people's
lives and for people that have sensory
disabilities for example blindness and
I've worked in that field for thirty
years we can use pattern recognition to
overcome those problems so actually the
first major project they worked on was a
printer speech reading machine for the
blind worked with the National
Federation of the blind on that the
nation's leading organization blind
people and created a machine that could
read printed books out loud to people by
recognizing the print in any type style
character recognition at that time was
not really intelligent it would just
match pixel for pixel it was called
template template matching and so prints
had to be in one type style and it had
to be perfectly printed so couldn't read
think ordinary books and magazines and
newspapers so my team and I created the
first omni font any type font character
recognition and we created a princess
between machine for the blind and I've
stayed involved with that field for 30
years we just introduced a pocket-sized
reading machine that Kurzweil National
Federation of the blind readers a blind
person can stick it out of their pocket
and reprint as they go through the day
sign on a wall back of a cereal box
ATM displaying a Manian restaurant
handout at a meeting and really
overcomes the principle handicap
associated with visual impairment what
our today's computer is able to do as
far as your ideas for how they can
accommodate that technology and what do
the future of computers hold as far as
what they'll be able to do well a lot of
people who ask whatever happened to
artificial intelligence and can reminds
me people are going the rainforest and
say we're all the species that are
supposed to be here when
50 species of ants with him you know 10
yards of them AI artificial intelligence
machines doing tasks that used to
require human intelligence is deeply
integrated into our infrastructure I
mean every time you send an email or
connect the cell phone call or you buy a
product it was designed with computers
it's design software this intelligence
just-in-time inventory levels are
controlled by intelligent algorithms
manufactured robotic factories
intelligent algorithms flying land
airplanes guide intelligent weapons
systems make billions of dollars of
financial decisions and I could give you
a long list so we are I mean our whole
economic infrastructure is amplified we
are far more productive and in fact far
wealthier because of of this type of
intelligent technology and these were
actually research projects 15 years ago
and the thrust of my books is that we
will actually achieve the full range of
human intelligence both because
computers are growing exponentially in
capability they're doubling every year
for the same price that's multiplying by
a billion in 30 years it's actually 25
years to be exactly if you imagine how
influential they are already imagine
multiplying their capability by a
billion in the next quarter century you
get some idea of what will be feasible
and the software is also improving one
of the sources of that is to actually
figure out how the human brain works and
we're making exponential progress in
that the spatial resolution of
brain-scanning is doubling every year
the amount of data we're collecting on
the brain is doubling every year the
latest generation of brain scanners can
actually see now for the first time
individual interneural connections we
can see our brain create our thoughts
you can actually see our thoughts create
our brain because we actually create new
brain matter as we think about things
and we're also showing that we can turn
this information into working models and
simulations of brain regions this is
already 20 regions of the brain out of
several hundred that exist that we have
actually modeled and simulated in
computers and then we can apply a
sophisticated test of the simulation get
similar results as applying those same
tests to to human capability includes
the cerebellum where we do our skill
formation which important region
comprises more than half the neurons in
the brain
and I make the case in my latest book of
singularity is near fact chapter 4 is
devoted to this that within 20 years we
will actually have models and
simulations of all several hundred
regions of the brain including the
cerebral cortex where we do our abstract
reasoning and there's already a
simulation of that being developed by
IBM and we will have then the tool that
well we'll have the secrets of human
intelligence we'll have more insight
into ourselves and the toolkit that we
use in artificial intelligence to create
intelligent machines will be greatly
expanded to incorporate the methods that
our own brains use and then and then
machines will operate at human levels
but it won't be an alien invasion of
intelligent machines to compete with us
I mean it really is amplifying our own
civilization and we're gonna literally
enhance our own intellectual
capabilities by ultimately merging with
this technology and that's what you mean
by the term singularity well this leads
up to the singularity and we can talk
more about how we get there but a really
key threshold is achieving you 'men
levels of intelligence the full range
particularly our powers of pattern
recognition which as I say this is the
core of human intelligence in a machine
and I and I've been consistent for
decades now that 2029 we will achieve
that threshold but that won't
automatically profoundly transform human
civilization we already have human
intelligence we've got billions of
people walking around with human
intelligence but the biological
intelligence of our civilization is
fixed we have 10 to the 26 power
calculations per second in all the 6 7
billion humans on this planet that's not
gonna grow 50 years from now it will
still be 10 to the 26 power
non-biological intelligence it's
multiplying by a thousand every decade
and even that speed is speeding up
so non-biological intelligence will
ultimately exceed biological
intelligence we will merge with this
technology and we can describe how that
will happen
but if you go out to the 2040s the
non-biological portion of the
intelligence of our civilization will be
about a billion times greater than the
biological portion now that's a profound
transformation and we used the metaphor
borrowed from physics of a singularity
really referring to the event horizon in
physics as an event horizon around a
singularity around a black hole it's
very hard to see past it because the
gravity inside the event horizon keeps
all the information in there's some
quantum ways that you can get the
information out but basically it's hard
to see past the event horizon but we can
use our intellect to talk about what
life would be like past the event
horizon so following that metaphor to
human history there will be this
profound transformation we're going to
amplify our own intelligence a
billion-fold
by the middle of this century and it's
hard to see past that event horizon
because it's so transformative on the
other hand we can use our intellect such
as it is to talk about what life will be
like 20 and 20 45 20 50 and that's what
I try to do in my book because it
basically refers to a profound
transformation as we multiply our own
intelligence through this exponentially
growing you know non-biological
intelligence that we're creating why not
leave human intelligence as it is and
let it progress as it as it should on
its own well there's a few reasons I'm
gonna mention too I mean one is we have
a lot of suffering in the world that we
want to overcome and technology's
already greatly amplified our ability to
solve problems human life expectancy was
25 post infant mortality a thousand
years ago it was 37 in 1800 I mean
Schubert and Mozart died in the thirties
it was pretty tragic but that was
typical there was no sanitation no
antibiotics life was short brutish
disaster prone disease failed poverty
failed I mean Thomas Hobbes describes it
quite well and we've come a long way
because of technology and we're now
going to be reprogramming the
information processes underlying biology
biology basically is a set of
information processes but we didn't have
the genome until three years ago but
then we're now actually gaining the
means to reprogram our biology we can
turn
with RNA interference discovers of that
just got the Nobel Prize a couple weeks
ago we can add new genes with gene
therapy we can turn on and off enzymes
we can reprogram biology and we can go
beyond biology by merging it with
nanotechnology that's something that
will be feasible in 20 years but if you
look at where we've come this is not a
new story we are the species it goes
beyond our limitations we didn't stay in
the ground we didn't stay in the planet
and we haven't stayed with the
limitations of our biology human life is
very very hard I mean extremely high
levels of struggle just a hundred years
ago human life expectancy was 45 in 1900
when Social Security was put in place in
the 30s 65 was considered quite old
I mean I'm pushing 60 and I don't
consider I mean I can collect Social
Security a few years I don't really I
mean I feel that the nature of Aging has
changed and this but there's still a lot
of suffering I mean you don't have to
look far to find people who what's they
got a diagnosis of cancer or struggling
with some other disease or profound
problem of one kind or another poverty
we're making progress because of
Technology World Bank reported that
poverty in Asia it's been cut by half of
the last decade because of information
technology but we still have a long way
to go and only technology really has the
scale to really solve the problems that
that we're facing and we can talk later
for example I believe we will solve the
energy and global warming problem within
about 20 years using nanotechnology and
there's really no other way to do it
so these technologies enable us to solve
problems and overcome suffering and
basically I see that it's the grand goal
purpose of human civilization to go
beyond our limitations and fundamentally
to expand human knowledge no other
species has knowledge and our knowledge
base is literally doubling every year
with this you know 50 different ways to
measure it but no matter how you measure
we find the doubling time is 11 months
12 months 13 months depending on what
you're measuring and we need our
technology just to hold it and keep
track of it
and search through it and we're going to
need more intelligent search engines to
really find it knowledge based on
concepts and so on so expanding our
intelligence which which we've already
done I mean even though most of the
computers are not yet inside our bodies
and brains they will make their way into
our bodies and brain so most of them are
not although if you're a Parkinson's
patient you can have a computer put
inside your brain that replaces the
biological neurons either destroyed by
that disease and the latest generation
actually allows you to download new
software to your computer inside your
brain from outside the patient so that's
for Parkinson's patients but ultimately
when we can send computers inside our
brain through the capillaries
non-invasively which will be feasible in
the 2020s we'll be amplifying quite
directly our own intelligence but we
routinely do it now with the tools that
we that we have at our fingertips I mean
just take how quickly you find knowledge
about a professor or some product that
you hear about with search engines and
think back five years ago
people didn't use search engines now
that sounds like ancient history I'm
gonna mention life without search
engines but that was five years ago
three years ago we didn't have blogs at
least people didn't talk about them
there was no social networks no podcast
a lot of things have changed in just a
few years time so we are expanding at an
accelerating pace our own frontiers and
our own capability and fundamentally we
need to get smarter by amplifying our
intelligence with this mental amplifier
which is our technology in order to
continue this grand quest to expand
human knowledge and I've defined
knowledge quite broadly to include music
art as well as science technology and so
on our guest is going to be with us for
the next two hours and forty-five
minutes if you want to ask him your
questions about his writings or his
thoughts on the future of technology
here are the numbers for those of you in
the eastern and central time zones it is
202 seven three seven zero zero zero one
and for those of you who live in the
mountain and Pacific time zones 202
seven three seven zero zero zero two you
can also email your thoughts to him that
email book TV at sea - span dot org
essentially man and machine will become
one in the
well let me describe how that will
happen we're gonna send blood cell size
devices inside our bloodstream inside
our bodies and also inside our brains
through the capillaries to do two things
want to keep it's healthier to reverse
efforts Gross's destroy pathogens remove
debris correct DNA errors if that sounds
very futuristic I point out we are doing
at least the first generation of that
already
in animals one scientist cured type 1
diabetes with a blood cell size device
that lets insulin out in a controlled
fashion scientists at MIT have a blood
cell size device it actually destroys
cancer cells by detecting the antigens
on their surface borrowing inside
releasing toxins and destroying the cell
and this is today and take this billion
fold magnification or expansion that I
talked about in a quarter-century of the
capabilities of information technology
computers and communication and apply
that to what we can already do and in 25
years we'll have these nanobots blood
cell size devices will be very
sophisticated they'll be a they'll be
capable of keeping us healthy from
inside and also interacting directly
with their biological neurons we've
already shown that that's feasible and
expanding human intelligence how smaller
nanobots
well blood Southside's nano refers to a
billionth of a meter but that means the
key features are measured in some modest
number of nanometers a nanometer is that
the width of five carbon atoms but it
doesn't mean that the nanobot is one
nano that the nanobot is one nanometer
it means that the features are measured
in a modest number 5 10 20 nanometers
the whole device is actually microns
millionths of a meter which is the size
of a blood cell and a blood cell is
basically a nano robot and it's can be
quite sophisticated a white blood cell
is actually intelligent can detect
friend from foe and devise strategies to
destroy it but there's one actually
deficient that's a couple of
deficiencies but there's one significant
deficiency of our white blood cells I've
actually watched my own white blood
cells in the microscope they're very
slow biology is actually quite sluggish
took my white blood-cell an hour and a
half to destroy this bacteria on the
slide and I think your words operating
at full speed ultimately these nano
robots will be able to do that in
seconds there won't be subject to
autoimmune disorders they can download
software from the internet to combat
specific pathogens if that sounds very
future is to get pointed there's lots of
devices we're putting inside the body
and brain now today the download
software from outside the body like like
this implant for Parkinson's patients so
as these devices get smaller according
to my models were shrinking technology
at an exponential rate a rate of 100 per
to the 3d volume per decade so in 25
years these devices will be a hundred
thousand times smaller in terms of key
features and there'll be a billion times
more capable and they're already pretty
impressive if that plays out where does
human and and machine begin and how I
guess is there a moral question when you
combine those two not in my mind I mean
where the species that goes beyond our
limitations and so expanding our
horizons with our tools is really what
human civilization is all about I mean
we have a cerebral cortex it can do
abstract reasoning so we can look at
that stone and say hey you know I could
combine that stone with that stick and
creates up a tool that extends my
leverage we have an opposable appendage
that actually works other chimpanzees
hands look similar but it's actually not
very well designed they don't have a
power grip they don't have fine motor
coordination they just aren't quite at
that level to create technology and they
use tools but the tools never evolved so
we've been able to actually create tools
and technology and then we always use
the latest technology to create the next
that's why the process accelerates and
that has been its own evolutionary
process and that that has enabled us to
expand our horizons so if you ask a
Parkinson's patient whether that neural
implant is part of him or her you know
maybe different people would answer
differently but it's very much actually
part of their their sense of identity
because they used to be able to do
things then they had the disease and
they found they develop certain
disabilities and then this implants when
it's successful which it often is
allows them again to to do what they
used to do they could they're delighted
to consider that part of themselves if
machines as you say will become more
human in their reasoning is they're
going to change our relationship that we
have to computers and machines right now
typically they're typically impersonal
things that sit in our desk is that
going to change absolutely I mean
machines and that's a grand trend that's
underway I mean machines used to be very
remote I mean you couldn't deal with
them at all unless you were technician
and you know when I went to MIT in 1965
there was one big computer and in their
condition Rome and you couldn't get
close to it you have to be pretty much
of an expert to have any interaction
with it and then we had the personal
computing revolution and now these
devices are family friendly there are no
pockets carried them under our arms
they're really extensions of ourselves
search engines really enable us to find
information quite easily the next
revolution is going to be a certain
amount of natural language understanding
these machines will be able to deal with
normal conversation not at human levels
but enough to actually find information
and do routine transactions so they're
getting friendlier and friendlier so
they're moving more towards us rather
than us having to move towards a
classical concept of what a machine is
which is kind of a 19th century concept
of something that's not very warm and
fuzzy but machines are getting more
complex I mean we have trillions of
moving parts in the human being and a
19th century machine had maybe hundreds
of thousands of parts now they have
billions of parts still not at human
levels but they're moving in that
direction because of this exponential
expansion and it's worth making another
point which is people say you can't
predict the future and that and that's
kind of the common wisdom and it it is
in fact not possible to predict specific
projects specific people but the overall
impact of information technology turns
out to be very predictable for example
the price performance of computing would
say the cost of a MIPS of computing
Mitsos million instructions per second I
have a graph in the book that goes back
to 1890 a very smooth exponential
progression
despite
Wars and peace and war and depressions
and boom times and the cold war and
through all those vagaries of human
history a very smooth very predictable
exponential progressions and you have
there the age of intelligent machines
which was my first book I wrote 20 years
ago that has hundreds of predictions
about the 1990s nearly 2000 years based
on these models based on this very
predictable exponential progression of
information technology and they've
tracked quite accurately many of those
predictions were quite controversial at
the time and you might wonder well how
could this be I mean how can we make
reliable predictions about the overall
impact of information technology when
each specific project each company each
person is unpredictable and we see other
examples in science of them I mean
thermodynamics you have a gas made up of
a lot of unpredictable particles each
particle is in fact modeled by a random
walk you can't predict where one
molecule will be 10 seconds from now but
the overall gas is very predictable
according to the laws of thermodynamics
it's a very high degree of precision so
if you have a large dynamic chaotic
system with where each element is
unpredictable the overall system can
have some very predictable properties
and that's really the and technology
evolution is just such a dynamic system
where we can make these reliable
predictions despite the fact that every
specific project and every specific
individual is unpredictable and that's
really the basis of of the predictions
I've made and I've been using these
models for for three decades as you look
at the future what are important dates
then for us to consider about your
thoughts on the future of Technology
well about 2020 $1,000 of computation
will equal the 10 of the 16 10 million
billion calculations per second that I
used to made is required to simulate the
whole human brain but that actually
won't by itself achieve human levels of
intelligence we'll need the software of
human intelligence and we're gonna get
that in a number of ways but one of the
important ways is actually by reverse
engineering the human brain and that'll
take a bit longer so I've been very
consistent saying 2029 will have a
computer that
can pass the Turing test this was a test
devised by Alan Turing to ascertain
whether a computer was actually
achieving human levels of intelligence
and in the Turing test you have a human
judge interviews a computer and a human
using a basically instant messaging so
the judge can't see the human and the
computer and just chats with him you
know what movie did you see what do you
think of the principal character and and
if after a few hours of this dialogue
the the human judge can't tell the
difference between the the two you know
can't tell which one is the computer and
which one is the human we say the
computer has passed the Turing test and
I believe that will happen in 2029 and
it's actually a good test there's no
simple trick with language or simple you
know computational trick you could
deploy to enable a computer to pass that
test without actually giving it the
equivalent of human intelligence San
Diego California good morning thank you
see spent this is an Albert Taurus and I
want to know two questions basically the
ones gonna be answered really quick you
could just give me like an arbitrary
percentage and the second one you can
just expand on basically I want to know
how much do you think at the technology
that's currently being created is used
for military use and secondly are you
aware of any connections between some of
the research that's been going on
between quantum mechanics and
spirituality about like movies like what
the bleep basically things that are
trying to prove the existence of God
okay well let's see if we can make some
estimates I mean here in the United
States our military budget order
magnitude is maybe half a trillion and a
gross national product order magazines
about ten trillion but let's say three
or four trillion of that is technology
related so maybe one-sixth of our
technology efforts go into military
applications in this country and that's
probably a high percentage compared to
other countries because
such a large military establishment so
that's an off-the-cuff estimate you
bring up actually a pretty rich issue
quantum mechanics these some
interpretations of quantum mechanics
bears some relationship to Eastern or
Buddhist thoughts where the principal
reality is actually human awareness and
that we actually create the world with
our awareness because at least according
to certain interpretations of quantum
mechanics a particle actually doesn't
decide where it is it can be in many
different places but when we observe it
we resolve that quantum ambiguity in it
it reality actually becomes manifest as
a result of observation by a conscious
observer there are other interpretations
of quantum mechanics but it's
interesting that there actually is a
meeting of the minds between certain
schools of Eastern thoughts with certain
interpretations of quantum mechanics and
there's also there's been speculation by
scientists such as Roger Penrose that
human consciousness arises from quantum
interactions that take place in our
brain people went it out to Penrose well
the brain is actually pretty messy place
and the neurons are not really at the
right scale for quantum events to take
place or for there to be quantum
ambiguity or quantum entanglement so he
came up with a theory that the two
wheels which are very fine structures
within the neurons do quantum computing
that remains controversial we've never
actually detected quantum computing
inside the human brain my own feeling is
if we look at what human beings are
capable of we don't see evidence that
we're doing quantum computing because
chronic computing would be able to
simultaneously consider every possible
combination of solutions to a problem
simultaneously and the kinds of things
that humans do seem to be explained
by more classical computing but this
means both a technical and controversial
area I would approach spirituality a
little differently I mean I'm quite
enamored with the powers of evolution in
fact we can use evolution in a computer
and actually simulate evolution and the
computer will actually evolve an
intelligent solution to a problem it's
really quite amazing we let millions of
solutions compete in a simulated
environment and it comes after hundreds
of generations it actually evolves in a
surprising an intelligent solution to a
problem so a biological evolution gave
rise to a technology creating species
which and evolution is actually capable
of creating more complex more
intelligent entities than you started
with and then the technology creating
species has ushered in this whole
evolutionary process of technology and
that has enabled us to and that is
actually the cutting edge of evolution
right now on earth I mean biological
evolution is continuing but we are
making you know a thousand times faster
progress with technological evolution
and ultimately that is the way which
we're going to lift ourselves up and
what happens in an evolutionary process
well things get more complicated the
entities actually get more knowledgeable
they get more creative they actually get
more beautiful to get more capable of
higher-level
emotions like love so they become you
know more more knowledgeable more
creative more beautiful all the things
that have been attributed to God in our
religious traditions without limit and
an evolutionary process action never
reaches infinite levels but it gets but
it explodes exponentially and so it
seems to becoming infinite literally
stays finite but it explodes in a
capability moving closer to that ideal
of infinite knowledge infinite
intelligence so you could say that
evolution is a spiritual process and I I
believe that's the case I mean you asked
before what what is the purpose of all
this and I really see it as a spiritual
process to expand knowledge but
knowledge it's not just it's not just
information it's not just dry facts now
is expressions of a loving sentiment art
music science the grant expressions of
human civilization and and that is a
spiritual quest in my view one of your
titles of your books is called the age
of spiritual machines what do you mean
by a spiritual machine well I was making
two allusions one is to this concept of
spirituality that I just articulated
that an evolutionary process starting
with biology now with technology is
actually moving towards greater levels
of intelligence and therefore becoming
more like God at least moving in that -
in that spiritual direction of greater
intelligence so we could say it's a
spiritual process but there was another
illusion I mean what do we mean when
people say well a person has a soul
they're really referring to
consciousness the fact that I'm aware of
my own existence I'm not just aware of
it I feel it and I feel the emotions
associated with it
and he's a these emotions are not just
technical states there's some there
they're rich in meaning and that is that
so human beings I mean are a machine I
mean a neuron this is a collection of
molecules and ion channels and you can
describe and we are in fact describing
those in very precise terms and you put
a hundred billion of them together in a
very specific way and you create a human
being and a lot of people would consider
you and being to be a spiritual machine
well we're gonna be able to recreate the
powers of human intelligence all of the
subtlety and supplements of your
intelligence in the machine and
therefore those machines
I mean if human beings in fact they're
spiritual machines and those machines
that emulate human intelligence and have
the same complexity and a based on the
design of human intelligence will share
in that property and then you ask the
question okay well if is a machine like
that conscious well how can you tell
well let's ask the Machine are you
conscious of machines yeah I'm conscious
well a machine could say that today do
you believe it well today you don't
believe it when a character in a
videogame says I'm very jealous or I'm
very angry at you
you don't really take it serious
because we can see the edges of its
intelligence and not fully convincing
they don't have all the subtle cues that
go along with that emotion so we don't
really believe that they're really
conscious we think they're just a
software program but the point of my
thesis is that as we get out to the late
2020s early 2030s these machines will be
so complex and so rich in their
emotional reactions and so realistic in
their recreations of you intelligence
that when they talk about their feelings
they will have all the subtle cues and
we will and we will be convinced by them
and but ultimately this is not a
philosophical proof that they are
consciousness consciousness is a synonym
for subjectivity in science is really
objectivity and rational deductions from
our from our objective observation and
there's a gap between science
objectivity and subjectivity and there's
really no scientific tests we can
postulate said we could slide an entity
in and a green light comes on okay this
one's conscious no this one's not
conscious we could build a machine like
that but it would have philosophical
assumptions built into him so john Sarla
would make sure that it's squirting
neurotransmitters and roger penrose
would make sure that it had something
equivalent to the tubules during quantum
computing and other other scientists or
philosophers would make other
assumptions but there's really no
objective way to absolutely answer that
question and we don't even know that
other people are conscious but we assume
that but actually when we go outside of
shared human experience talk about for
example animals we we're not sure and or
at least we disagree and we'll have
disagreements about these machines
someone who disagrees with you is on the
line from Knoxville Tennessee hello I am
a material scientist I work at Oak Ridge
National Laboratory I'm a big fan of
book TV and the reason I'm calling today
is to express my disappointment that you
have invited this highly sophisticated
crackpot and given him a national forum
to express his pseudo religious
predictions that have no basis and
objective reality and I'll just point
out two big problems with what he says
the first is that he believes evolution
is
aggressive but he offers no evidence for
this claim he says that it's getting
more complex but he doesn't offer an
objective measurement of complexity that
he can show is following some trend and
even if there is a trend random
phenomena can produce things that look
like trends it doesn't mean that there
is one there you have to show that we
were produced our species was produced
not from random mutations which we know
this is how natural selection works he
presents a plot in his book where he
shows it exponentially accelerating he
uses species and genus and family and
group that that our species came from
but you can produce the exact same plot
for any species they'll all show
exponentially accelerating trends if you
just use their taxonomic branching
points I'm sorry to get technical here
it does not prove that we were the
products of an exponential trend it
actually arises out of the statistics of
natural selection the second point is
that small is almost always more
expensive imagine if you were asked to
reproduce a replica of the chair that
you're sitting on you could probably go
to Home Depot and get the tools to do
this and it wouldn't be that expensive
now imagine if I asked you to produce a
replica of the same chair except that is
the size of a grain of salt how would
you do this what tools would you would
you buy you maybe use a couple lasers to
polymerize a liquid but it would be much
more expensive and this is the trend the
corollary to Moore's law is Moore's
second law which is that these
production facilities are getting
exponentially more expensive it doesn't
matter what you do just from the second
law of thermodynamics small is going to
be more expensive
I have also problems with mr. Kurzweil
estimation of the computational power of
the human brain he doesn't consider
process like phosphorylation where
individual proteins can act as molecular
switches okay caller thank you well you
bring up a number of interesting issues
if we look at biological evolution go
back billions of years and bacteria
single-celled organisms were the cutting
edge were the most complex and most
intelligent entities we then went to
multicellular organisms we then went to
more and more complex ones like lizards
and then finally mammals and then
primates that actually had
and that and then there was the
evolution of cognitive functions and
then the evolution of Homo sapiens
there's been a continual acceleration at
every pace it took evolution works
through indirection it creates a
capability and then it uses that and
that's why the process accelerates so it
took a billion years to evolve DNA
actually RNA came first then the
Cambrian but then evolution used DNA so
the Cambrian explosion and all the body
plans that the animals evolved only took
about ten million years and then higher
cognitive functions evolved in only a
few million years and then Homo sapiens
evolved in only a few hundred thousand
years and then we moved to technology
evolution with the first state stages
like stone tools fire the wheel took
only tens of thousands of years and that
has continued to accelerate cuz we
always use the latest technology to
create the next 50 years ago computers
were designed pen on paper wired with
screwdrivers it took years to design the
first computers we now use computers in
tenth generation computer assisted
design software to design computers and
you can design a new computer system in
days and there's been a continual
acceleration and I review that in in a
number of different ways and in terms of
your points on nanotechnology the key
the key features of technology have been
getting smaller and smaller we don't
have the tools now to create full-scale
massively parallel molecular
nanotechnology today but we're moving in
that direction the key features of
technology are getting smaller declining
by about a hundred per 3d volume per
decade and they make that case in the
book at that rate we will get to
full-scale molecular nanotechnology in
about twenty years so at that point
we'll be able to create macro objects
designing them at the molecular level
and these will be self-organizing the
the counter trend to the second Moore's
Law where these fabrication facilities
get more and more expensive
it's that chips will be self-organizing
and that was actually controversial
notion when my book age of spiritual
machines came out 99 there's been so
much progress in that that's very much a
mainstream view you can talk to the
Intel scientists in fact I was just at
IBM recently and they showed me some
self organ
in molecular circuits that are beginning
to work in three dimensions a nanotube
based memory is actually going to hit
the market next year which uses
self-organizing features so we are
actually moving in the direction of
being able to create in very small
facilities desktop facilities that can
actually create three-dimensional
circuits that are not chips but are
actually self-organizing that
self-diagnosing work the the latest
generation chips actually has
self-healing and self-diagnostic
capabilities because they're so
massively so massive that they don't
want to throw the whole chip away
because one transistor is broken so
they're actually able to route
information around that information the
Internet is based on that the Internet
hasn't gone down for one second in ten
years because information routes around
damaged portions so I mean I the whole
book makes this these the case for these
two exponential trends quite extensively
through 600 pages I can't summarize all
of it so going back to the concept of
what he brought up with nanotechnology
is it fair to say it's a little robot is
that we're talking about when we're
talking about a nano bot or whatever
then a technology it's being able to
design technology where the key features
are a few nanometers or at least less
than a hundred nanometers in scaled so
electronics has already actually passed
that threshold right now the key
features in chips are 65 nanometers
there's already chips working under 50
nanometers if you look at the Intel's
and the semiconductor industries roadmap
by 2020 the chips will have four Anatomy
two features it's about 20 carbon atoms
so and another key step is that we'll go
from the second dimension into the third
dimension chips today are flat we live
in a three-dimensional world we might as
well use a third dimension and that is
kind of we will ultimately run out of
speed or steam with Moore's law of
shrinking the key features on a flat
circuit we'll need to go into the third
dimension that's gonna be the next
paradigm actually the sixth paradigm in
electronics and chip designers we talk
to the Intel scientists as I have
they're very confident
that the crossover point between two
dimensions and three will be in the teen
years well before we run out of steam
with Moore's law
so Electronics is going to be
revolutionized by being able to build
electronic circuits as well as
communication devices in three
dimensions at the molecular level using
self-organizing circuits we'll also be
able to create small devices that have
mechanical capabilities that have
computers and communications built in
and these can go inside the UN body keep
us healthy from inside there's going to
be one major application and there's
already significant harbingers of that
that we can see there's four major
conferences on something called bio MEMS
biological micro electronic mechanical
systems dozens of experiments are
placing blood cell size devices in the
bloodstream of animals to produce in
some cases very sophisticated
therapeutic effects and that's today and
if you apply this billion fold increase
in the price performance and capability
and bandwidth of electronics
communication and hundred thousand fold
shrinking of mechanical technology over
the next quarter century you get some
idea of what will be feasible
San Francisco is next with a question
about voice technology hi I have a
question I'm a retired retired court
reporter and I'm very interested in what
the status is of verbatim real-time
voice recognition technology
specifically translation into text and
that could be purchased by the consumer
and if you could address the leaf legal
and privacy issues that might restrict
use of the technology such as you know
recording recording conversations for
instance in California it's illegal
without the consent of both parties and
the second part of my question is will
this technology do you see it playing
some role in transparency of government
and politicians perhaps on the internet
too
provide the consumer and the citizenry a
better line into what's going on with
government thank you well you bring up
some interesting issues in fact speech
recognition is widely used today for
surveillance by intelligence agencies
because they do listen in one way or
another to millions of conversations
around the world we don't have enough
people detection listen to them so we
use speech recognition they use to beat
recognition to try to actually interpret
what people are saying and you'll run it
to speech recognition on the phone there
are millions of people that use speech
recognition to create their written
documents I've put together a prototype
with my company in the 80s created the
first larger camera with speech
recognition we took a contemporary
version of that combined it with speech
synthesis and language translation to
create a translating telephone and
actually we have a demonstration of that
that available for viewers one of my
companies we developed the first Texas
speech synthesis there was the company
that developed the first reading machine
this was in the 70s and another company
that I started developed the first
launch vocabulary speech recognition
there was actually commercially marketed
and I put those two together with some
contemporary language translation
software and created a translating
telephone and I've actually use this to
communicate with people in other
countries and this will be a routine
service of your cell phone in a few
years early in the next decade
this is a typical structure of a coal
translating in telephone theory from any
prototype
- telephones we will be able to talk to
anyone we've been freezing
- even mentally the translations aren't
perfect but some of them are actually
quite good human translators are better
but because human translators are no
it's available now for important UN
discussions they use human translators
but this would be a routine way to
communicate around the world
thank you for your attention and what
year will that become commonplace do you
think I think early in the next decade
this will be a routine service of your
cellphone and communicators of course we
have language translation software
already on the Internet
it varies in quality the better systems
are actually quite good I was out of
Google and they showed me in English to
Arabic in Arabic to English translator
they had put together because they have
these very large rosetta stone texts
where they have the same text translated
in English and in the other language in
this case Arabic and they and we and
they can use pattern recognition
software to automatically find the
translation rules they didn't actually
tell it how to translate that they said
they let the software find its own rules
and the system actually compared well to
human translators and nobody on the team
that created it spoke a word of Arabic
so the system actually found its own
rules and so language translations
getting is getting better we have a
email and I don't have the email but he
says what kind of technology do you use
personally well I use remote desktop to
actually always be on my computer work
because I don't want to have multiple
copies of my files so I take around a
little notebook and connect through a
high-speed connection whether I'm in a
town car and or in a hotel room and I'm
on my computer at work I used search
engines I use both Google and Microsoft
and I use pretty routine technologies
different databases nothing too exotic
but actually finds well actually have
one interesting technology that a label
that's a virtual reality technology
enables me to be at another venue in 3d
and a third of my speeches actually give
using this virtual reality technology
it's called teleport tech and I appear
at the venue in three dimensions
life-size I can move around as I move
around the audience sees the local
background behind me so it looks like
I'm there and it's pretty convincing one
guy actually walk up to me to give me a
question on a piece of paper and I'm
actually the only speaker in the world
that has one in my office because I get
invited to good speeches in Asia and
Europe and Australia and I can't always
go there so I and this is expensive
technology today we have
to send a technician with the other half
of the equipment to the venue instead of
communication lines this will actually
be routine ubiquitous technology early
the next decade will have images written
directly to a retina from our eyeglasses
they'll be able to create virtual
reality environments either overlaying
real reality so I'll have pop-up
displays when I see you there'll be a
little pop-up saying riding me it's your
birthday next Tuesday or riding me what
your name is or reminding me where you
know where a building is that I'm
looking for or completely overtake
vision the visual field of view and
create a virtual reality environment so
you and I could meet in a virtual Cancun
beach even if for hundreds of miles
apart and will feel just like we're
there this will actually be routine
technology in the in the second decade
of this as it gets more complex though
if you give speeches about thousands of
miles away doesn't it take out the
personal element of human communication
it isn't that one of the key components
of being human I guess being able to
completely it's doing the opposite
enhancing human communication because I
can communicate I mean they see me in
real-time it's not recorded it's like
it's real-time I see the audience I can
establish eye contact like I'm doing now
I can point at people and and all the
technology actually works correctly and
this is how this feature of virtual
reality technology will work also where
we have early versions of that already I
mean the telephone what's the first
virtual reality technology that enabled
you to be with someone else just as if
you were together even if you were
hundreds of miles apart and that has
never happened before in human history
and that's actually how they saw it I
mean before that you actually get
together to talk to someone and that
those are not virtual the word virtual
is unfortunate as if it these aren't
real conversations you can't say well
that wasn't a real agreement I made that
was in the virtual reality environment
called the telephone no I mean those are
real conversations between real people
communicating and the internet now
because of its decentralized nature and
the fact that it's everywhere allows us
to create communities based on common
interests so if someone hasn't se a
chronic disease they can create
communities of other people and gather
information and stay abreast of that
condition around the world
or any subject whether it's you know
collecting cat figurines which I do I
can be in touch with all the other cat
figurine lovers around the world and
create a community so we're not stuck
with the communities of Geographic
accidents the people that happen to be
near us we can create communities with
people around the world and you go
around you see people on their cell
phones and on their communicators and on
their notebooks and they are
communicating not just with the people
in their vicinity but with groups around
the world and also enhances work
environments I mean I have work groups
that are that are spread out
geographically and we work very
effectively together and that wasn't
feasible ten years ago you brought up
virtual reality real reality with that
mine who is Ramona well this is a
project that started a number of years
ago she's a female
she's my female alter ego and I wanted
to demonstrate at this conference called
Ted Technology Entertainment Design at
the 2001 TED conference a feature of
virtual reality that you can be someone
else because I mentioned that's you know
you and I could go into a virtual
reality environment and take a walk on a
virtual Cancun Beach in in virtual
reality environments and we'll have
virtual bodies in these virtual reality
environments particularly when it's
through the nervous system when we have
nanobots in our brains they can shut
down the signals coming from a real
senses replace them with the signals
that your brain would be receiving if
you were in the virtual environment then
it'll feel like you're in that virtual
environment and design of new virtual
environments will be a new art form and
as I go to move my hand it'll move my
virtual hand and so I could be an actor
in this virtual environment and we could
shake hands and we give each other hug
or we can take we can run on the beach
or sit down at a desk and have
experiences in these virtual reality
environments but your your body doesn't
have to be the same body that you have
in real reality a couple could become
each other for example and there's okay
and so I wanted to demonstrate how you
could do that so I had magnetic sensors
in my clothing as I moved a life-size
realistic real-time animation pretty
photo-realistic of Ramona
moved exactly the way I did my voice was
changed into her voice using some other
computer technology and that drove her
lips and so it looked like she was
giving the presentation but I was
actually being transformed into her and
the audience could see me and her and
ten actually we have a demonstration to
show the folks at home but virtual
reality you can be who you want to be
and you can even try to express what's
most deeply on virtual reality with your
bodies real reality so basically most
people just some people don't actually
keep any of their personalities which
reminds me some of my old boyfriends but
that's another story mr. Kurzweil so
this is actually a serious project that
I intend to continue with and actually
make Ramona more realistic and actually
more independent I have this bet with
Mitch kapor that a computer will pass
the Turing test with 2029 and I intend
that to be Ramona actually in an
independent version of Ramona who would
because some and then a computer that
passes chanc test is not some so dry
lifeless box it'll have a personality
and an appearance and will be just like
just like a human and so this is
actually a project that I intend to
continue with to make Ramon a more
lifelike and more realistic over time if
you're interested in finding out more a
sample of Ramona's available on the
website that is Kurzweil AI dot net if
you want to go to that website and check
it out for yourself Terre Haute Indiana
good morning or good afternoon hi
just want to say my big fan of yours and
I appreciate what you're doing thank you
um I was curious I know that you your
ideas have been met with a lot of
skepticism from those and the scientific
community as well as various scholars
I'm wondering if you're noticing more of
an absurdist in the acceptance of your
ideas such as particularly the law of
accelerating returns if it's being more
accepted overall since they just when
you publish the spiritual machines in 99
just the past six or seven years have
you noticed more more of an acceptance
overall of ideas you're trying to get
out there yes definitely and I think the
acceleration of the pace of paradigm
shift is becoming quite noticeable we
now see dramatic changes in just a few
years time and that wasn't so noticeable
ten years ago and this exponential
explosion of electronics and information
technology is now apparent to the common
person because we're all using these
devices from digital cameras to iPods to
social networks and so and people see
how their capabilities change and
today's limitations become again
overcome and short period of time and
also the various predictions or I made
in in Aegis virtual machines which was
1999 have really tracked quite
accurately in terms of the power of
computation that the power of the
internet the power of communication
technology progress are making
nanotechnology and I've had the
opportunity to share these ideas with
leadership scientific communities I was
recently invited to give a keynote at
the off-site meeting of the directors of
National Institutes of Health and their
chief scientists and we were able to
talk for actually a couple hours about
these kinds of ideas and I would say
they're very much on the same page
because they are experiencing this
exponential growth for example the first
genome cost a billion dollars they're
not talking about collecting a million
genomes at $1,000 each cost $10 for base
fare 19
it's a penny today's I mean they're
experiencing this exponential
progression in price performance and
capacity and every other aspect of
information technology and it's not just
electronics it's every aspect of
information whether it's brain data or
the resolution of brain scanners or the
general project was controversial in
1990 it was not a mainstream project the
mainstream skeptics said this isn't
gonna work
we collected 110 thousands of the genome
in 1989 and where we doubled the amount
of genetic data we've sequence every
year that's continued past the end of
the genome project we're gonna be able
to collect everyone's genome so I mean
things that were unheard of just a few
years ago and now becoming commonplace
when you say the law of accelerating
returns does that mean in essence that
technology is getting smaller and
cheaper more efficient to operate the
law of accelerating returns deals with
measurable attributes of information
technology basically says that the power
of information technology measured in
many different ways price performance
capacity bandwidth of information
technology not just in computers but in
all these different fields doubles every
year now depending on what you're
measuring the doubling time every 12
months or 11 months or 13 months but
it's exponential and people think in
linear terms they think that the current
pace will we'll just continue at the at
the rate that it's going now and they
don't take into consideration this
exponential explosion exponential growth
is seductive but when you start doubling
big numbers it becomes quite explosive
we have two hours with our guests with
you're more of your calls to talk with
Ray Kurzweil we're going to take a look
at some of the technology that he
employs in his lap when he comes back
more of your calls and questions for him
so what is kurtzweil technologies well
my field is pattern recognition teaching
computers to recognize patterns and
that's actually in my opinion the bulk
of human intelligence that's what humans
do well but computers are mastering that
as well so my first project was
character recognition teaching computer
recognize any type style that was
actually the first time that was done
then I did knowledge vocabulary speech
recognition and we've applied pattern
recognition to other types of patterns
eat EKG heart signals financial data we
have a company that looks at that and
that's really I think the most important
area of artificial intelligence and
ultimately when we create a machine that
will be at human levels it'll be because
computers have mastered human levels of
pattern recognition but that's been my
interest so I've started about 10
companies commercializing and developing
different aspects of pattern recognition
right behind you we can see over your
shoulder is is a screen that is doing
artwork as you talk what is that well
that was actually created by another
computer scientist Harold Cohen who's
worked for 30 years I'm actually
mastering at least one style of human an
art is thousands of rules about how to
create a painting and this is a
technology we've sponsored and you can
download it it Kurzweil cyber art comm
for free every painting is different and
it's actually won awards and in museums
but every few every two minutes it's
creating a different picture in the
corner you have an Edison voice writer
yes well Edison is actually a good model
for what we're trying to do because he
was continually coming up with creative
ideas thinking about what technology
could do in the future and working on
lots of different inventions really to
recreate sound and visual
visual world using the technology at
that time and created the first motion
picture and first phonograph record this
is actually an early phonograph record
where you could actually record and play
both music and it was also used for
business correspondence you could do
dictation on it and over here there's a
something that looks like a human being
but is not a human being well it's sort
of symbolic
of what we ultimately are trying to do
which is to recreate human performance
so it's by looking somewhat realistic is
a symbol of that and so we've worked on
trying to recreate human speech
recognition different aspects of human
vision and our reading machines were
actually going to be adding not just
ability to read print but actually
recognize objects to our reading machine
so a blind person can just hold the
camera until pointed at a room and it'll
actually tell him or her what's in the
room identify the objects and the people
so we're trying to recreate human skills
there's a metal down on a table here in
a picture of you with President Clinton
you tell that story well it's not much
of a story it's that's when I got the
National Medal of Technology from from
the president but that was that was a
nice experience this is actually a
cartoon I commissioned in 1965 40 years
ago and I had an interest in artificial
intelligence at that time and so this is
a cartoon I designed it was implemented
by an artist friend of mine and it pokes
fun at or at least it comments on the
nature of human experience that brain is
obviously having experiences in a
virtual reality environment it doesn't
look like he's having much fun but we
live inside our brains and ultimately we
will it will actually be able to have
our brain feel like it's in some other
environment rather
were in for example the not about
nanobots could shut down the signals
coming from our real senses replace them
with the signals that we would be
receiving if we were in a virtual
environment and then our brain will
actually feel like it's not in the
environment there it's really in but it
would be in some virtual world and will
be just as convincing it's real reality
and we'll have a virtual body you've got
to move your hand it'll move your
virtual hand and it will feel very real
so that's actually enough that'll be
feasible in 20 years or so and that'll
actually be a realization of this
cartoon which I designed 40 years ago
it Kurzweil on those stills was listed
your junior high and high school
teachers is anything that they taught
you back when you were in school
relevant to what you do today is
something that you remember that that
still sticks with you I think they were
encouraging me to pursue my own ideas I
mean that's why I put them down there
and they gave me the idea that I could
they empowered me to just go off and
spend most of my time doing my own
projects which I did on my spare time
and while I was in school I mean under
my textbook which would be open I'd be
actually working on some some project in
junior high school in high school my
parents think we're very encouraging
well my father was a musician my mother
is an artist but they very much
encouraged me to pursue my own ideas in
computers and I decided I'd be an
inventor when I was five and how did you
know that well that's a good question
maybe a few more years of analysis will
reveal that I just had this fascination
that you could put things together and
create some kind of transcendence I
didn't have that word back then but that
you could create some kind of powerful
effect I've started building a rocket
ship and but actually quickly got into
virtual reality when I was seven or
eight I created a mechanical virtual
reality a puppet theater and I had this
command station where I could control
the world and move scenery and bring the
moon down or bring a character on stage
from from this one command station so
that was kind of my first virtual
reality project but I had this conceit I
knew what I was going to be other kids
are wondering well should they be a
fireman or nurse and I said well I know
what I'm gonna be and I never wavered in
that confidence and your parents were
once they knew were they are okay with
that they were more than okay they were
very enthusiastic and there was this
idea that science was important I was
just emerging back then but this was
actually before
is charged the nation with science but
and you know they were struggling
artists but they always provided me the
resources to create my own inventions
which actually got to be somewhat
expensive one of the openings of the
books you said that you were influenced
by Tom Swift books who's Tom Swift yeah
well I read all the Tom's have junior
books when I was 8 9 and 10
I just recently discovered there was
actually Tom Swift senior books are
written around 1900 but the plots were
always the same Tom Swift would get into
trouble and usually the future of the
human race hung in the balance also and
he would retire to his lair his basement
and come up with some invention some
idea that would save the day and the the
moral was that no matter what kind of
problem you face there's an idea that
can overcome it and you can find that
idea and that was actually very much
almost a religion in my household I
remember my grandfather coming back from
Europe talking about how he had had the
opportunity to handle some documents by
Leonardo da Vinci
with his own hands and he talked about
it with reverence that really the power
of human ideas to change the world was
very much a mantra in my family and then
and that that has impressed me and that
that is my view that if you encounter
problems any kind of problems you can
find the idea to overcome that problem
and and that's really our mission here
as part of the human civilization to to
address the problems that we face and
find the ideas to overcome them and it's
really as I mentioned earlier only
technology that has the scale to
overcome problems if we find the right
set of ideas we looked a little bit your
company during the break but part of the
history of your company includes the
artist Stevie Wonder right well my first
major invention was a Princess Peach
reading machine for the blind he was
actually our first customer he caught me
on The Today Show and actually called
called us up said he wanted to drop over
and get one we were just finishing one
up so he came over we saw
today showing him how to use it and he
left with it in his taxi it was pretty
big was almost as big as he was but he
was our first customer and so I became
friends with him this was 1976 so this
was 30 years ago and in 1982 we had a
conversation about the world of music
you show me around his new studio
Wonderland and lamenting that there were
these two disconnected worlds of musical
instruments it was the acoustic world
with these beautiful sounds like piano
and guitar and violin but you couldn't
control those sounds in fact most
musicians couldn't even play them at all
and if you could play a violin you can
only play one note at a time and so on
and then there was this electronic world
where you could play polyphonic Li and
you could have the computer remember
what you played and play it back and
play another line over it you could
modify the sounds but the sounds you had
to work with a very thin electrical
sounding sounds back in 82 there
wouldn't it be great if we can combine
these powerful computer control methods
with these beautiful sounds of choice of
acoustic instruments and so that was the
goal of Kurzweil music I felt using
pattern recognition signal processing
that was feasible and with Stevie Wonder
as our musical adviser we created
crystal music in 84 we introduced the
Kurzweil 250 which has been recognized
as the first electronic musical
instrument that could realistically
recreate the grand piano and other
acoustic instruments because we really
modeled the ability of those instruments
to create sounds Cary North Carolina hi
this great program I'm very interested
in the concept of calendar reform and I
wonder if mr. Kurzweil has studied that
we use a very antiquated a model of
calendar on the internet there are many
very good scientific proposals to
replace it and the the Catholic Church
has approved this innovation if it's
ever passed by the world what do you
think well we are actually stuck with a
lot of antiquated ideas like the layout
of typewriter keys the QWERTY keyboard
that was actually designed to prevent
keys from interlocking because of the
specific limitations of mechanical
typewriters
not because it's an efficient way to
type and there's been lots of proposals
to change that these ideas gather
momentum I mean that's why certain
companies or technical standards
continue because people learn how to use
them and then it's very hard to to
change those things so what does he mean
by calendar reform I think he's talking
about like January and February that
February is 28 days except when it
doesn't and is that what you mean he's
he's no longer house I assume that's
what he means so we have certain
traditions for measuring things or for
laying out information like on a
typewriter keyboard they that go back
and are based on realities that are no
longer with us but we're stuck with
those those traditions and very hard to
change those traditions but we have
technology that can keep track of our
calendar pretty well and we're used to
it so I don't see it changing very
quickly Baltimore Maryland go ahead hi
mr. Kurzweil my name is Darryl Nazareth
and I'm a physicist doing research in
radiation oncology I'm a fan of yours
and I look at your website every day now
my question is when I talk to people
about the upcoming technological
revolution then they typically have the
same question which is if machines are
going to perform more and more human
tasks than won't that result in massive
human unemployment so my thoughts are
that as the need for human labor goes
down then the cost of living will also
decrease and therefore humans multi need
to work as hard in order to maintain a
high standard of living I'd like to know
what your thoughts are on that
well suppose we were sitting here a
hundred years ago let's say around 1900
and let's say I were a prescient
futurist and I told you well today 30%
of the population work in factories and
30% work on farms but I I predict that
within a century around the year 2030
that thing
we'll be 3% in factories and 3% on farms
and the casual observer would say my god
it's gonna lead to massive unemployment
and I probably wouldn't be able to say
well don't worry they'll get jobs as web
designers and Internet technicians
because we didn't understand those
professions like most jobs today didn't
exist those job categories didn't exist
a hundred years ago we actually have a
higher percentage of the population
working today
there's about 30% of the population
working in 1870 that figure has it's
gone up to about 50% and jobs pay six
times as much in constant dollars as
they did 120 years ago so so what what
has happened we've been eliminating jobs
at the bottom of the skill ladder both
physical and mental and creating new
jobs at the top of the skill ladder so
the skill ladder has moved up and in
fact a lot of the new employments in
education we had 50,000 college students
in 1870 the six or seven million today
we spend far more per capita in constant
dollars on K through 12 education to
provide this higher level of skills and
that that process is going to continue
and we're actually going to make
ourselves smarter now you could say
we're doing that already in fact if
people weren't if we didn't have this
sort of mind amplifier in terms of our
technology and search engines and the
internet most people couldn't do their
jobs today so we're very much already
extending our intellectual reach with
our technology which enables us to keep
up with this ever higher skill ladder
and we're gonna literally make ourselves
smarter as these machines you know move
from our pockets into our clothing into
our bodies and brains and actually
extend human intellectual reach further
we have been an email or who asked and
he asked that I embrace the progress of
technology wholeheartedly but at some
point don't we run the risk of
technology becoming too human and
realizing that they are modern slaves
and face a possible revolt well he
brings up an interesting issue regarding
the legal rights of machines and nobody
worries that about that much today but
it's not going to be a clear distinction
between human and machine
we get to the 2030 and 2040 in fact even
a biological human that was born in the
in the ordinary chorus will have their
brains enhanced with non-biological
intelligence and ultimately that
non-biological component our portion of
intelligence will be far more capable
than the biological portion and so you
know is that a machine is that a human
will have machines where there's no
biological component but they're very
precise copies of biological people and
they're gonna act in exactly the same
way it's gonna be all mixed up you're
not gonna be able to walk in the room
and say okay humans on the left side of
room machines on the right it's it's
gonna be very much an integration of non
biological and non-biological telogen
just as it is today except that the
non-biological portion is going to get a
lot more capable and ultimately they're
gonna press for their own legal rights
and there's already a lot of interesting
discussion about that and you know I
think that that will happen you know
particularly when you can have an entity
that's completely non-biological that's
just as convincing in terms of their
sophistication complexity of their
emotions as humans and emotional
intelligence is not some little sideshow
to our intelligence it's actually the
cutting edge because in terms of the
logical analytical things we do machines
can already do a pretty good job of that
very few mathematicians could hold up to
its let's say Mathematica and recently
mathematical theorems have been done as
a collaboration between the human
mathematician and the machine but
emotion is actually the most complicated
and sophisticated thing we do but
ultimately we will understand that as
well these future machines will have
emotional intelligence one of the
arguments or things you bring out in
your books the fact that the ability for
a brain to be downloaded into a
synthetic body or a version2 body as you
call it what do you mean by that well as
I mentioned we're going to be merging
with non-biological intelligence we will
have nanobots go inside our bodies and
brains and ultimately we'll have
billions of nanobots in other ways in
which we're gonna be in very direct
touch with non-biological intelligence
so then my intelligence is a combination
of both my biological Intel
jinsol the ion channels and
neurotransmitters in my brain and all of
this non-biological machine intelligence
now the machine part of the intelligence
can clearly doubt we can clearly
download the contents of that easily we
do that all the time with our machines
machines can share their knowledge that
their states at electronic speeds which
is actually a million times faster than
human brains can can share knowledge but
ultimately we will be able to tap into
the biological patterns as well we'll be
able to have these nanobots can the
state of our ion channels
neurotransmitter concentrations into the
neuronal connection patterns and extract
that information but principally I don't
see that as the the real quintessential
scenario I see us becoming essentially
more and more non-biological and that
non-biological intelligence can download
knowledge and skills as we saw in the
matrix we do that all the time with our
with our computers I'm we spent years
training one research computer to
understand human speech we trained it
like a child we patiently corrected its
errors we exposed to thousands of hours
of speech and over years it did a better
and better job and finally it was
commercially viable now if you want your
computer to understand human speech you
don't have to go through those years of
training like we do have to do with
every human child you can just don't
load the evolved patterns of this one
research computer that learned it's
lessons it's called loading the software
machines can take their learning their
scales and share them in electronic
speeds which is a million times faster
than we can share our knowledge with
language although the fact that we can
share it at all it gives us one up gives
us a leg up on other species when you
consider the future of how manna machine
will be together and and theatrical
dilemmas where does the U the government
come in because do you see more
oversight for these technologies as they
progress well it's a complex issue
sometimes people say well look at the
stem cell issue and there isn't the
government's going to stop progress and
for example biotechnology but we
actually see that issues like that and
stem cells is a good example are really
just a stone in the river that the
progress flows around it and even within
stem cells there's this very active stem
cell research I mean I support stem cell
research I don't thing
we should have restrictions on it but
even with the restrictions the real holy
grail of stem cell therapies which is be
able to take my own skin cells and
create an adult stem cell that's
pluripotent is making substantial
progress and it's certainly not slowing
down
working biotechnology but there is
actually a role for government in in
containing the dangers of these
technologies because we haven't really
touched on that yet but these
technologies is a double-edged sword and
you don't have to look very far to see
that in 20th century there are 180
million people killed in wars the words
weren't necessarily created by
technology but certainly the destructive
impact was exacerbated and we see now we
have this asymmetric warfare where an
individual can be empowered to be
destructive and the quintessential
threat we face right now is in
biotechnology you know on the one hand
biotechnology is empowering us to
reprogram biology to overcome disease
like cancer and heart disease and
there's already in the pipeline very
dramatic new tools new drugs that really
reprogram biology away from disease you
know positive things but it could also
empower bioterrorist to reprogram the
biological virus to be more deadly or
more communicable or more stealthy and
the tools to do that and then I'll to do
that is pretty widespread and so how do
we deal with that well some people say
well let's just not go down this path
it's too dangerous let's relinquish the
whole field that's a bad idea for three
reasons number one it would deprive us
of these profound benefits like
overcoming suffering and eliminating
disease and so on secondly it would
require two talent Arian government I
mean that's that was the the moral and
brave in the world and thirdly it
wouldn't work it would just drive these
technologies underground where they'd be
less stable and the responsible
scientists who are trying to defend us
from these dangers wouldn't have easy
access to the tools to do that and
that's really the moral or the that is
really the strategy that we need to
follow which is to develop these
defenses and the good news is we
actually have the
tools and the knowledge to create
defenses against for example new
biological viruses RNA interference
which I mentioned earlier can turn genes
off while viruses are genes and RNA
interference can turn off viruses and I
proposed in fact Bill joy and I had an
op-ed piece in New York Times awhile
back calling for a Manhattan style
project to create a rapid response
system that could in a week sequence a
new virus and that's accelerating it
took us five years to sequence HIV 31
days for SARS we can sequence a virus
now in one or two days develop an RNAi
eye medication and gear up manufacturing
you could do that very quickly and
that's really the strategy we need to
deploy and I'll give you an example
where we've actually done that and we
have a new danger which emerged 30 years
ago the software virus and they've
actually become very sophisticated and
actually quite dangerous because we have
a lot of important systems that run on
computers like 911 response systems and
we fly airplanes by software and and
we've actually contained this danger
quite well if a new software virus is
identified it is reverse-engineered an
antidote is created spread virally on
the internet and in 24 hours we have an
automatic response to a new software
virus and nobody has taken the internet
down or even a portion of it for even a
second in ten years it's been a very
successful track record now it's not our
software protection is not perfect by
any means but that's really the model we
need to follow to develop a rapid
response system to combat these
particular dangers and that's where the
government comes in in terms of
enforcing certain ethical guidelines for
example we shouldn't put particularly
dangerous information on the web like
you wouldn't want to put the design of
let's say the 1918 flu virus on the web
because that's dangerous information but
actually the US government has done that
exactly that you can download the design
of the 1918 flu virus from the US
government's website and they'll join I
in the south end piece criticized that
so that's a role I mean in fact just
recently there was some information how
to build an atomic bomb
from these Iraqi papers on the web and
everybody and that was inadvertent I
guess and everyone agreed that was not a
good idea there's no controversy about
that but for some reason in the
biological realm there's controversy
about it because this in this dangerous
information is still up there
so we need to actually have some
guidelines to prevent clearly dangerous
information from being widely
disseminated some people do need that
that information they could be given to
given to the information in confidence
with classified
you know agreements and so on
Jacksonville Florida my question deals
with technology and behavior I would
define physical technological versus
behavioral being emotional let me give
you a quick example all the cars here in
Jacksonville seem to be equipped with
turn signals which are technological yet
only one in three people seem to use
them which to me is behavioral they have
the technology but they don't behave
with the technology we pass laws give
them driving tests you know pretty much
do everything we do and yet can't get
people to behave with the technology now
you've had a good lead-in to my question
here
speaking about destructive technology
which is to say technology is a
two-edged sword can be used for good or
bad my question for you is when you've
got six billion people on the planet or
six-and-a-half billion people on the
planet that already have this ability to
do what these machines are going to be
able to do that you're talking about and
yet all these people are the vast
majority of them don't seem to be
behaving as well with the technology
that the boss truth all night he's
already given I'm kind of like one in
three or two other three drivers in
Jacksonville not using their turn signal
where do you see that this technology is
going I don't quite understand how this
technology is going to be that that boom
to humanity when we already don't behave
with the technology that we're given
which let me put it in Mesa
we're not being it doesn't seem we're
being faithful with a little bit that
we're already being given so why are we
going to be any more faithful with even
more developing it from a technological
pimp caller thank you well it's a good
question and actually to reinforce your
question give you another example which
is people don't take advantage of all
the health knowledge we have there's
actually a lot of knowledge we have
already to dramatically reduce the
likelihood of disease you can reduce
your likelihood of getting cancer or
heart disease by or diabetes by more
than 90% we can slow down the aging
process and many people I'd say most
people don't take full advantage of this
knowledge
some people are health conscious but
even people consider themselves health
conscious don't take advantage of all
the knowledge that is out there the the
thrust though of the technology is to
make this easier and actually overcome
this tendency that you articulated quite
well of humans not to take advantage of
all the knowledge in their vicinity I
mean we know that you shouldn't tailgate
but you know most people do that and we
should take care of ourselves and most a
lot of people don't do that these future
technologies will take that into account
I mean for example in car in the case of
cars which you mentioned their collision
avoidance systems that are gonna
actually take over the car if it senses
that you're getting too close to another
vehicle and maybe not perfectly prevent
accidents but substantially to reduce
them even if you're not doing all the
things that you should do as a safe
driver
similarly in health while there's a lot
that you should do to stay healthy we're
gonna have drugs that actually turn off
athletes Gross's I mean Pfizer store
satrapy which is going through the
approval mechanism turns off one enzyme
that destroys HDL in the blood by
inhibiting that enzyme HDL levels soar
and the Phase two trials showed that
this dramatically reduced ethis kosis
and Pfizer spending a record 1 billion
dollars on the Phase three trials that
will actually if it meets its promise
and if not that drug there'll be many
others will actually compensate for bad
behavior and keep people healthy and
reverse south of sclerosis at least
eventually we'll be able to actually do
that overcome cancer even if people are
you know not taking the steps to
and cancer so these technologies
ultimately will step in to compensate
for sort of you know the inability of
humans to you know be perfect in their
behavior our guest is also written a few
books on dealing with health issues this
is the 10% solution for a healthy life
and Fantastic Voyage the science behind
radical life extension why are you
interested in this topic it used to be a
separate interest I had this interest
being an inventor principally with
information technology and pattern
recognition as we discussed and it had
the separate interest in health it
started with the untimely death of my
father when I was 22 he was 58 I'm
actually 58 now and then in my mid-30s I
was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and
tried the conventional approach that
actually made things worse so I wrote
the 10% solution which was a successful
health book really sharing the program I
developed it overcame my own diabetes
and have had no type-2 diabetes for the
last 20 years what kind of program was
that basically a nutrition exercise some
supplements but mostly lifestyle and
natural means although there's some good
drugs like metformin I believe is
actually an anti-aging drug but also
combats type-2 diabetes then I
confronted another health challenge
which was middle-aged and actually been
addressing the aging process and do a
lot to slow down aging and I believe we
can do that according to biological
aging tests I was about thirty eight
biologically when I was 40 and going to
these tests I'm come out at 40 even
though I'm 58 and these tests this
controversy about to miss that whether
they're perfect I think they're just you
know one piece of information but terms
of the way I feel I feel that I have
slowed down the aging process and
there's really a lot of knowledge to do
that in this latest book which came out
two years ago which I co-authored with
dr. Terry Grossman the leading longevity
expert in Denver articulates three
bridges to radical life extension and
it's really a wake-up call for baby
boomers because bridge one is what you
can do right now to slow
the aging process and disease process so
that and that that by itself will not
enable us to live hundreds of years that
will just keep us in good shape for
another 10 15 20 years until we get to
bridge 2 and bridge 2 is the full
flowering this biotechnology revolution
we've been talking about which is
proceeding exponentially because we're
doubling the amount of genetic data we
sequence each year and the amount of
proteomic data and now all these
different aspects of biology are
progressing exponentially in 15 years
from now it's gonna be a very different
world where we can really reprogram the
information processes underlying biology
and they fundamentally are information
processes and we're getting the tools to
reprogram our bodies just like we would
program our computers and that will
bring us to the third revolution say 25
years from now the nanotechnology
revolution the nanobots we talked about
earlier which can go inside our bodies
and keep us healthy from inside I
mentioned there's already very
interesting experiments along those
lines and animals but 25 years from now
we'll have very powerful nanobots that
can go inside our bodies and keep us
healthy at the cellular level so it's a
bridge to a bridge to a bridge and you
can get on bridge one now and and
therefore be healthy and in good shape
when bridge 2 comes around that'll keep
us - bridge 3 so even baby boomers
people in there
if these 60s and even 70s and if you're
really diligent 80s can stay in good
shape for another 10 years 15 years when
it's really will be a different world
that's why the subtitle is live long
enough to live forever
now I mentioned these have been two
separate interests and I got interested
in this because of my own health
challenges and having had the experience
of my father and realizing that as an
inventor I can find the ideas to
overcome challenges even if they're
outside of my computer interest but
actually now these two areas have merged
they're now the same field because
biology medicine health is undergoing a
grand transformation from what used to
not be an information technology was hit
or miss we just find something oh here's
something lowers blood pressure we don't
know why this works - we're biology and
medicine is becoming in
information technology where we can
actually understand it as information
processes and reprogram those
information processes and the exciting
thing about that is now that we can do
that we can actually it's actually
subject to this law of accelerating
returns this doubling of the power of
these technologies every year that
didn't used to be the case before
medicine was an information technology
but now that it is it's subject to this
inherent acceleration San Francisco
California
we've had Sherwin Nuland on this program
and when he talks about what you're
talking about as far as extension of
life and things he was quoted as saying
this he says people like Ray Kurzweil
have forgotten their acting on the basic
biological fear of death and extinction
and it distorts their rational approach
to the human condition are you afraid of
death I think we should be I think death
is a great tragedy and I think that's a
very common view we really haven't had
much we could do about death and aging
up until recently so the response of the
human civilization has been to
rationalize Oh death which is obviously
a tragedy it's a profound loss of
knowledge and skill and personality and
relationships and love and all kinds of
things oh that's really a good thing
that's really ennobling in some abstract
sense not that that these people
actually want to die in fact people
don't want to die unless they're in some
profound pain is what we've found
but we've rationalized it as a good
thing and a lot of our philosophies and
religions have been been geared towards
that and in my view what's it what's
ennobling of this you know grand human
project is his expansion of knowledge
and not as dusty information but as
music and art and all the things that
that enrich our lives relationships and
all of that is robbed by by disease by
aging by death and we're gaining the
tools to overcome that it'll be a very
different world according to my models
in 15 years we'll be adding more than a
year every year to your remaining life
expectancy not just infant life
expectancy so as you go forward by phix
pregnancy we'll move on away from you
that's not a guarantee but that does
give us the ability then to live forever
and/or live indefinitely because people
say well these changes how many more
years will it provide us well a
particular change may add five years or
ten years but then you go another five
ten years and there's more changes that
come and you get to a point where
there's a positive slope to the equation
and as you go forward in time this it's
more progress enables you to go even
further and I think that's a positive
thing I think death is a great robber of
what's what's meaningful to us but this
philosophy the death is a noble thing
and the death gives meaning to life and
death is the purpose of life is a very
deeply rooted philosophy that that we
really had no choice but to adopt
because we had no alternative do you
think it's an underlying Drive of what
you do the reason you created
technologies you read and you think
about the technology in the future of it
and life extension well a life extension
is one interest I mean you know I
started this forecasting of technology
trends for a practical reason because I
realized that timing was key to being in
it successful as inventor and most
inventions are most inventors fail not
because they can't get the thing to work
but because the timing is wrong and the
market isn't ready that not not all the
enabling factors are in place when they
need to be and realizing that 30 years
ago I began as an engineer to collect a
lot of data and build mathematical
models and I saw they were tracking
quite accurately and I developed this
whole theory and it's I'm not just
saying this now looking backwards and
overfitting to past day and I've been
making these forward-looking predictions
for a long time and what Falls and I use
this actually time my inventions this
pocket-sized reading machine for the
blind I had a conversation with the
National Federation of blind four years
ago and projected that this would be
feasible in four years and would take
four years to develop and therefore we
should get started back then whereas
other companies are starting now because
I realized it's feasible so anticipating
where technology will be is it's
important to being successful as an
inventor but it does enable us to look
out 10 years or 20 years
and see what the world will be like and
what I see is actually quite attractive
we'll be able to greatly expand our
appreciation and creation of knowledge
and overcome profound problems and it's
a future I want to see so that actually
motivates me to want to stay in good
shape to get there so I'm not just
interested in hanging on I'm not just
interested in radical life extension I'm
also interested in radical life
expansion as we continue to expand our
physical and mental capabilities by
enhancing them with our creations before
we leave this about your program you
talked about I read about the number of
supplements you take on a daily basis
how many are those running right now
about 250 and that's the current state
of the technology I mean I'm really
reprogramming my biochemistry and I'm
not flying without an instrument panel I
mean I take 5060 different blood tests
periodically to see you know aside from
just things like cholesterol and
homocysteine and triglycerides I mean I
measure a lot of different things and
constantly adjusting the program but you
know according to every possible way we
can measure these things I'm staying
quite healthy and and not aging
significantly in all these different
ways hormone levels and nutrient levels
and and so on but we have to be
aggressive today to reprogram a
biochemistry this is the state of the
art right now I mean we weren't evolved
to live at our ages I mean human life
expectancy was 25 a thousand years ago
it was not in the interest of species
for people to live past childbearing and
that meant like age 25 was as I
mentioned was 37 and 1800 so we really
need to reprogram our biochemistry to
slow down and turn off these aging
disease processes and this is the way we
can do it today
it's an individualized program you see
what your issues are and how aggressive
you want to be and how many different
types of body systems you want to
enhance and and keep it peak performance
and so I'm trying to do that for myself
it will get easier 15 years from now we
really will have much more powerful
drugs that can reprogram biology
at a fundamental level and so relatively
easily we'll be able to slow down these
aging disease processes but bridge 1 if
you want to apply it aggressively it's
not a one-trick pony first ray kurzweil
san diego yes i have a traumatic brain
injury that severely affects short-term
memory and frontal lobe executive
functions which speak to your pattern
recognition I had a thought I agree I
sort of ennoble the rationalization that
it's character-building for me to you
know learn from suffering and I've
personally gotten over suffering from
suffering from but I thought with your
work with Stevie Wonder and I look at
movies like Forrest Gump and Rain Man
where the people around the supposedly
disabled person are transformed out of
their relationship with someone and like
with stem cells and stuff you can see
the temptation for genetic engineering
to eliminate abnormalities out of
society and I wonder is it a total
rationalization that something we call
being human would be lost if we use nano
technology and that stuff to perfect
humans and to eliminate all suffering
color Thanks
well I think you make for a good point
its distinguishing between a defect and
a quote abnormality that route might
really be a different way of relating to
the world that is profound and creative
in its own way and we do find for
example in autism that
people have limitations in certain types
of communication but these individuals
can pursue knowledge and have skills and
other people can't have and are really
relating through the world in a
different way I agree that there are
different ways to relate to the world
and we're not all the same and you know
there's no such thing as normal human
behavior what's normally human musical
ability was the guy in my hotel room
this morning who was whistling a song or
is it Beethoven or the Beatles there's a
broad range and as we get to the higher
ranges of human capability to become
quite unique perhaps kind of classic as
you point out I actually think as we
enhance our our minds by getting closer
to our technology we're not going to
become all the same we could actually
become more different we're actually
fairly similar today there's less
genetic diversity among all humans and
in one troop of baboons we all have a
brain that's organized the same way with
the same regions and the same kinds of
basic architecture and it's constrained
by a skull and we can change our brain
in certain ways and certain lot of
plasticity but there's limitations on
how far we can go with it
when we can actually break out of our
skulls conceptually by enhancing our
tech our thinking beyond a hundred
billion slow neurons will actually be
able to pursue different ways of
thinking different ways of creating that
are very unique and someone could really
pursue you know profound new forms of
music in ways that wouldn't be feasible
before and someone else might you know
pursue history and get new insights it
would be impossible today because they
could master a lot more knowledge and
will actually become more different and
I think that actually would be a good
thing an email ask if our technology
keeps advancing isn't the real problem
in distributing it effectively and
making it cost reasonable ok another
good question and one implication of the
law of accelerating returns is a 50
percent deflation rate and you can see
that clearly in electronics you can get
the same capability for half the money a
year later and
generally technology particularly the
kinds of technology that individuals use
follow it's a certain path and when it
comes out it's unaffordable only their
wealthy can afford it but at that point
it actually doesn't work very well and a
few years later it works a little bit
and it's merely expensive and then it
becomes inexpensive and actually it's
perfected and has a lot of new features
and is very capable and then ultimately
it's almost free and it's very
ubiquitous and you can see that with the
cell phone you know take societies in
Asia where 15 years ago their primitive
agrarian economies and most people
pushing a plough and today they have
thriving information economies that lag
from early adoption of extremely
expensive technologies to a version
that's very inexpensive from very
ubiquitous and very almost free is 10
years but that's going to accelerate
there's a paradigm shift rate that
doubles every decade so 10 years from
now that'll be a five year lag and 20
years from now that'll be a two or three
year lag so these technologies
ultimately become very ubiquitous when
we have full scale nanotechnology
molecular nanotechnology assembly in
tabletop replicators that can use
massively parallel information processes
to create macro objects but building
them at the molecular level by
reorganizing very inexpensive input
materials will be able to create really
from just information and very
inexpensive input materials most of the
things we need from clothing and food to
computers and basically information will
be the only thing that has value we're
moving you know gradually to where the
information component of the value of
products and services is asymptoting to
100% so the point is that these
technologies ultimately become very
widespread
I mean think back 15 years ago someone
took out a mobile phone and a movie that
was your signal from the director that
this was a very important person because
only the wealthy and powerful could have
a mobile phone and they didn't work very
well and you don't have to be a powerful
person now to have a mobile phone
consider the consider making
intellectual creations you just used to
have to be a big Hollywood studio to
create a movie well now with your $500
camera and your PC you can actually
create a full quality Hollywood motion
picture and six
motion pictures have been done that way
or recorded album you don't have to be a
big recording label or a couple of kids
at Stanford they were just with their
thousand dollar pcs or a piece of
software today it's worth a hundred
billion dollars and you use it to search
the internet so that tools of creativity
are now widely now very widespread they
cost hundreds of dollars or thousands of
dollars not millions of dollars you
don't have to be a big you know
organization to to make these
intellectual creations anymore Scranton
Pennsylvania yeah doctor a few years
back I asked you in a radio show whether
there was a device that you could hook
up to a synthesizer and where you could
whistle or hum or a melody and have that
device transferred to the synthesizer to
have it play it out through the
synthesis synthesizer
and you put me onto a device called a
pitch tracker now I wonder is there any
this was a few years back I wonder is
there anything out there that may be
beyond the pitch tracker that you're
aware of her is the pitch pitch cracker
is still the way to go well a pitch
tracker is a way to go if you're trying
to do what you described of sync turning
your own voice and singing into another
type of instrument although that'll just
track the pitch in this little clip that
was played about 45 minutes ago of my
Ramona project we transferred my voice
into another voice in to Ramona's voice
and that was more than just changing the
pitch because a woman's voice has
completely different characteristics and
if you just change the pitch it would I
would you know would have the Munchkin
effect it sound like a little chipmunk
and not like a woman so that actually
was more complex of breaking that down
into its components and changing each
one of the components separately and
that gets into multi pitch trackers
where let's say somebody's playing a
piano or a guitar which has many notes
at the same time being able to track all
of those at the same time and that's a
more complicated problem and they're
making advances on that hi unday the
big Korean car company just sport
Kerswell music systems and I'll be
working with them on a new generation of
musical instruments they will use some
new advanced synthesis techniques so
that we can create if we want to just
greet create the piano or the violin or
kecil instruments we can do that but
that's already well established but it
will be able to create instruments that
are just as satisfying and complex and
rich and deep as these acoustic
instruments but that have no related but
are things that we've never heard before
so there's many different ways in which
we can use our understanding of the
psychology of music and our our pattern
recognition is applied to musical sound
to create a whole new world of very
musically satisfying sounds and sound
responses but that are our synthetic and
and things that we've never heard before
email ask who are your favorite
songwriters and composers and what do
you consider the best piece of music
ever written well my favorite classical
composers made joven actually if you
listen to his late sonatas like 31st and
32nd Sonata which is well past the point
when he was deaf
they're very jazzy and they really
reminded me of contemporary jazz they're
not played that often but I suggest
people listen to them so he really went
off in his mind in a very futuristic way
and anticipated a lot of trends in music
it really has a modern 20th century
after American sound to it it's um it's
pretty remarkable contemporary music the
groups that are still popular or popular
when I was a college student so these
these sixties groups like the Beatles
and Rolling Stones are are still quite
remarkable the Rolling Stones are
remarkable because they've stayed
together for 40 years the Beatles are
interesting and that now usually
creativity is one person maybe there's
other people supporting them but here
you actually have a group that was
brilliant as a foursome and not even a
twosome but a foursome and all those
individuals when they went off on their
own made interesting music but nothing
like the brilliance of of that
collaboration
so there's a lot about creativity we
don't yet understand particularly when
you have a collaborative process where
it wasn't just one person's brilliance
that created the music I also like
female artists like Alanis Morissette
that's why I wanted to be a successful
female singer and I do plan it for a
motive to continue her career how do you
see as the future of man and machine
progresses how we entertain ourselves
well actually computer games has been a
cutting edge of computer technology in
fact game machines are actually more
powerful than PCs and their little super
computers in their own right and we are
creating virtual reality in these game
worlds and ultimately they were actually
will put us in a full immersion
3-dimensional world they're getting very
realistic but they're still on this
two-dimensional screen with defined
edges eventually they'll actually take
over our whole visual field of view
that's actually feasible one of the
reasons and one of the things they're
struggling with because I've talked to
some of the people in the game industry
is the liability issue we've got a
ten-year-old kid who's lost in a virtual
world and is in this three-dimensional
world that's in the game it's gonna lose
track of real reality and it's gonna be
knocking down lamps and starting fires
and so exactly how to deal with that is
something that's under discussion but
the technology is actually becoming
available to do that our next call from
Detroit Michigan Detroit go ahead please
hello Thank You c-span and thank you mr.
Kurtz well for your obvious
contributions I have a question and in
regard to the virtual reality and
whether or not you see a capability for
perhaps some sort of 3d projection via
satellite
without to necessarily have a hardware
so there could be a function for
diplomacy or just an people to express
ideas in that function whether it would
be a one-way dictation or even
potentially some some way of having a
two-way conversation
well I think the Internet is becoming
our global nervous system and
communication backbone and does it does
allow virtual worlds or you already have
things like Second Life and so on where
you can enter a virtual reality world
with other people and you might say well
the Second Life isn't it's realistic
it's real reality that's true today but
I mean look at how video games went from
you know pong which was a you know very
unrealistic representation of ping pong
or tennis to the very highly realistic
you know animations and virtual reality
you have now in games and that will take
the leap to full immersion
three-dimensional virtual reality so
these virtual reality environments that
exist on our computers empowered by the
internet where we can communicate with
anyone is ultimately gonna become full
immersion we're virtual reality we don't
actually have to go inside the nervous
system to do that we can have images
written directly to our retina from our
eyeglasses the systems will detect our
head motion and will actually put us
into a full immersion virtual reality
environment this technology already
exists it's expensive today but it will
be ubiquitous and inexpensive in the
future and so then even if you and I be
hundreds of miles apart we could enter a
virtual reality environment and it would
seem just like we're there we can look
around each other at least visually and
auditorily which is how most of our
meetings are conducted we can be in a
virtual reality environment if so if you
want have a diplomatic conversation we
could create a virtual Hall of
Versailles and and have a meeting just
like we're together and of course we use
the current state of the technology to
create virtual communication all the
time this will be very realistic got 10
years this is you know how most meetings
will take place you know the whole
technology of buildings classrooms
lecture halls cities is really for
aggregating people so we could get
together and communicate we're gonna be
increasingly doing that in virtual
environments as these virtual
environments get more and more realistic
to the point where they're
indistinguishable from real reality and
when we can go inside the nervous system
and do that from inside the nervous
system and also include the tactile and
other senses and really be just like me
together we have one more hour with our
guests very kurzweil as we go to break
we're going to look at one of the
machines that he has developed
especially one that helps them or helps
blind people help them to read we'll see
that and then we'll come right back so
this is actually the original Curzon
reading machine and it was actually the
first CCD flatbed scanner the imaging
device can only see about an inch so it
actually scans each line individually
but this is the first scanner flatbed
scanner which is now ubiquitous and I
developed the first Omni fire character
recognition the first packet recognition
that could recognize any type style and
that was sort of a solution in search of
a problem
and I happened to sit next to a blind
guy in a play and have said he can do
anything it's quite independent but he
can't read ordinary printed material so
that really from that point on I devoted
the character recognition software to
the blind reading problem when we
developed the scanner we actually
developed the first Texas speech
synthesis those are three distinct
technologies and we put them together in
the first parenthesis reading machine
yes this is from the 70s ok Matt in the
night in 1976 but you can see it's the
size of a dishwasher and it's looking
for the first page of print
four score and seven years ago our
fathers brought forth upon this
continent a new nation conceived in
Liberty and dedicated to the proposition
that all men are created equal now we
are engaged in a great Civil War testing
whether that nation or any nation so
conceived and so dedicated can long
endure when this came out character
recognition at that time could only deal
in a single type style
it had to be units spaced letters could
not touch one another it couldn't deal
with any kind of printing errors if
people actually read type documents
using a special type all but the
Selective typewriter before they would
scan them in using character recognition
so this is the first really intelligent
character recognition and a version of
this was actually used to create the
these big databases in the 1970's and
early 80's like Lexus and Nexus so that
was a commercial application but this
was the first parenthesis between a
machine for the blind and since it was
expensive and large it was used in
institutions like libraries and schools
and over the years it's come down in
size up until recently the Kurzweil 1000
was a small desk based system a little
scanner with a with your personal
computer but it was still a desk based
system you had to bring material back to
your desk and this long material you
can't bring back to your desk like sign
on a wall or Bank ATM display you could
bring a menu back to your desk but you'd
rather read it in the restaurant labels
in your clothing remainders that a book
sale and outs in a meeting so the Holy
Grail has always been device that a
blind person can take in their pocket
and just take out a read material as you
go through the day so it took 30 years
because this was 1976 and actually this
year 2006 30 years later we introduced
the first pocket-sized machine so this
is the curse of all National Federation
of the blind reader we developed it with
the National Federation of the blind
actually worked with them on the first
reading machine in 1976 this is a
thousand times smaller than that first
reading machine a thousand times lighter
and the computer is actually a thousand
times as powerful so it gives you some
idea that's a million to one ratio
in terms of the power of computation
black person could just hold it up to a
wall and it'll tell them where the print
is if it's cutting off the right or left
edges so it sees most of the edges we
take a picture here and it's going to
give us progress reports this page could
be rotated any amount in fact it agrees
with three different degrees of freedom
of tilts and rotation and so you can
really hold the camera any which way and
it'll actually correct the image I got
it right on page 189 the a is long since
over we are well into the strain of
narrow AI most of the examples above the
research projects just 10 to 15 years
ago
in all the AI systems in the world
suddenly stopped functioning economic
infrastructure with running to a halt
pages can be curved in a book and thus
often here actually straightens out the
image cleans it up and enhances it and
then does the recognition of the letters
and then figures out the pronunciation
and so although that's being done in the
computer inside this device it's
actually a good example of my models of
predicting technology trends because in
2002 four years ago I had a conversation
with the National Federation of the
blind they said well when do you think
these portable reading machines would be
feasible and I said according to our
models the requisite digital camera and
pocket computer technology will be
feasible in four years by 2006 and that
actually turned out to be exactly
correct and I also felt it would take
four years to develop the software so we
started 2002 and the software got done
the hardware became available right on
schedule and we introduced in 2006 other
people are not waking up the fact though
you the cameras and oxygen Peters are
powerful enough to do this and they're
starting the research now it's going to
take them a few years to develop the
software so we have a jump on the market
because of our
to predict where technology will be in
the future and this is something I've
been doing for thirty years and my books
are based on the same technology models
so we can forecast where technology will
be in four years or 10 years or 20 years

visit the New York Times website at
nytimes.com IR we are back with our
guest ray kurzweil who was written
amongst many books the singularity is
near when humans transcend biology he
has also written the age of spiritual
machines and could you tell us a little
about how you write books what goes into
how you do it
well I actually start by writing an
essay what I want to accomplish in the
book and it'll be maybe a chapter length
essay and then I expand that rather than
just writing the book from start to
finish I'll expand the essay make you
know developing this part and that part
and develop it into a book I get
feedback from my research group and
advisers as to ideas about you know what
should be expanded and questions it
should be a
rest I have a research team that gathers
data for me so if I want to cover
certain area they'll send me books and
articles and on our website for example
on singularity dot-com we have all the
lists of actually all the books and
articles I read to write the book and
then as I write the material actually
write the citations with it there's
about 2000 scientific citations in
singularities NIR and also Fantastic
Voyage that I co-authored with Terry
Grossman because I'm making claims that
run counter to some conventional wisdom
and so they need to be backed up by
strong evidence and then I go through a
rewriting process like any other author
of getting feedback from my editor at
the publisher and and other people I
list all the people that gave me advice
good or bad actually like criticism
because that's the way to improve
something and finally when I feel I
can't improve it anymore
ship it out the door but actually I
never get to that point at some point
you have to declare it a moment in time
and this is the best I can do for the
moment until the next book now because
you have technology that distinguishes
human voice do you dictate books or do
you type well actually I dictated most
of the age of spiritual machines really
is an exercise to show use of that
technology
I can dictate at 50 or 60 words a minute
that that is actually what you can do
with speech recognition I happen to take
typing in high school there was one
useful course I took so I have very good
typing skills I can type ninety or a
hundred words a minute
so speech recognition actually slows me
down but most people type 15 or 20 words
a minute so speech recognition actually
would speed up most people but actually
type pretty fast in the age of spiritual
machines and your acknowledgments you
amongst many lists a gentleman named
David hi for actually devising a
spiritual machine for the cover what did
you mean by that well it's kind of a
holographic image there and so we were
trying to figure out
you know what would be a symbol for
something so abstract is to be a
spiritual machine we're gonna just put a
picture of a machine of some
conventional high-tech image so he
created this just silver but holographic
image that reflects the light in
different ways depending on what visual
can condition you're in so I thought it
was kind of a cool way to symbolize a
very abstract notion how long does it
take you to write a book typically well
singularity is near and Fantastic Voyage
I really wrote at the same time the
latter co-authored with Terry Grossman
although that didn't save time because
we both really poured over every
sentence and we both feel passionately
about every idea in there and if we
weren't already 99% on the same page it
would have been impossible because it
wasn't like okay you do this and I'll do
that and we don't really care about the
other sections were you really cared
about every sentence we would have 50
emails about one of the citations back
and forth but it came out a much better
book because we really if we had it came
out initially with a different
perspective on an issue we would run it
down and look at all the research until
we really had enough in-depth knowledge
to come to a better position that we
both felt comfortable with so it's a
much better book for that process but it
definitely took as long as either one of
writing it ourselves but I wrote both of
these books over two year period tell us
about your family my wife is a
psychologist she's whenever interest
actually is is reading but also just
child development both intellectually
and emotionally we have a lot of
interesting discussions because she's
understanding human development in the
psychological realm and I'm trying to
study the same topic but to understand
it in quantifiable terms so that we can
recreate aspects of human intelligence
but she's a wonderful child therapist
and has done a number of creative
projects in that area she my daughter
actually wrote a book together which you
holding my daughter's avid dancer
choreographer a sophomore at Stanford
and writer and she my daughter my wife
and my daughter wrote this book forever
poems for now and then together and then
my son is a student at Harvard Business
School
he went to Stanford also worked in
McKinsey for a few years and it's quite
passionate about technology business do
they share your beliefs about the future
technology I would say yes Mike my kids
definitely have their outlook shaped by
this perspective you commonly run into
this very common paradigm of well human
life is only you know threescore and 20
and we're gonna slow down at 65 and the
there's a common conception of the life
cycle of humans and I would say that's
not my kids perspective at all so that
my wife and my kids definitely are
immersed in my ideas my wife is
fortunately very healthy but she's also
conscious about her health Manhattan
Beach California good morning good
afternoon good morning good afternoon
thank you c-span and thank you dr.
Kurzweil I have several questions I'll
read them off quickly do you believe in
God
or do you think man is God and if man is
God what happened before the Big Bang or
possibly is man part of God and beyond
that what do you think is string theory
and do you think what do you think of
parallel universes that'll do it for now
okay actually talk about those topics
quite a bit in chapter 6 and 7 of my
book 6 on string theory and parallel
universes in Chapter 7 on philosophy
spirituality God and so on I mentioned
earlier a conception of evolution as a
spiritual process at least that's what
we see in in evolution as entities
evolve as they evolve through biological
evolution and we see this not continuing
and technological evolution they become
more complicated more complex more
more creative and actually more
beautiful more capable of expressing
higher-level emotions we don't see that
for example and lower animals so
expressions like love and or even being
funny and things that are uniquely human
are things that happen more and more as
as entities evolve and we're gonna
actually expand that through this
expansion of human intelligence with our
technology so through evolution we're
becoming more godlike never really
reaching that ideal because God is
expressed as infinite all-knowing
infinitely intelligent well we're not
going to become infinite evolution stays
finite but it explodes exponentially so
it's moving in that direction that's as
close as I can get to to this conception
I think though that we will saturate the
matter and energy in our in our part of
the universe our solar system actually
not it won't take that long and take
about a century for us to saturate the
ability of matter and energy to support
computation and communication in our
little part of the universe and then
spread out to the rest of the universe
and I see ultimately the universe being
transformed into an intelligent
civilization that spans a galaxy and and
multiple galaxies and ultimately the
whole universe and this actually and so
the whole universe will wake up that'll
seem pretty godlike from our very
limited perspective today so you could
say that the universe will wake up will
become conscious there will be a god at
least that satisfies my need for God to
have the entire universe wake up I'd
like to be around to see that that's one
reason I'm interested in bridge one on
this road to radical life extension and
this does get to the parallel universes
because you might ask how did our
universe be so bio-friendly I just wrote
a foreword to Jim Gardner's new book
intelligent universes where he spends a
whole book addressing this and I talked
about it in chapter 6 of singularity is
near if you look at the standard model
of physics is about 50 different
constants and values
that is percept very precisely two
values to allow atoms to exist in
molecules and therefore stars and
planets and that allowed biological
evolution to take place and if certain
constants the Planck constant and other
constants in the standard model of
physics were set just slightly
differently there would have been no
evolution and no biology and no
intelligence so how did that happen
that's an interesting question some
people say well it's an intelligent
design the must of an intelligent
designer that may be the case the
intelligent designer though could be an
intelligent entity in some other
universe
string theory does allow multiple
universes because there are multiple
solutions to the formulas of string
theory that that does allow for multiple
universes each actually with different
laws of physics and it maybe have been
an evolutionary process that the
universes get better and better designed
as one universe baguettes another and it
could have been just a been a national
evolutionary process or it could
actually be an intelligent entity some
evolved intelligence in another universe
actually creates using some of our
advanced technology a new universe and
perhaps it created our universe I
speculated in the foreword to this book
that maybe our universe is a junior high
school science experiment of some
adolescent super intelligence in another
universe but we are left with the fact
that our universe has a set of physical
laws which are remarkably fine-tuned to
allow this evolution of complexity that
we saw in biological and technological
evolution we have our emailer who ask
could you speak to the political and
religious anti reactions to science well
there is this accelerating pace of
change I mean I mentioned that
information technology is growing
exponentially doubling in his power
every year the paradigm shift rate the
rate of progress is also accelerating
basically doubling every decade and you
can really feel that now you go back
five years and there was no social
networks no blogs no podcasts
people were just starting to use search
engines that sounds like ancient history
and that's only five years ago and so
things are happening fast and fast and
by the way that's not intuitive when I
gave a presentation at Time Magazine's
future of Life conference on the 50th
anniversary of the discovery of
structure of DNA all of us speakers are
asked well the next 50 years bring and
all the speakers there except actually
for Bill join myself use the last 50
years as a model for the next 50 years
but that's not accurate because we'll
see 32 times more progress in the next
50 years because of this acceleration
and this backlash actually I think is
from the increased anxiety that this
accelerating pace of change Fosters I
think this rise of fundamentalism is a
reaction to this accelerating pace of
change and it is a fundamentally a
fundamental problem because of the
increasing potential for asymmetric
warfare this empowerment of the
individual which can empower an
individual to be creative so one you
know kid at Stanford can create
something that's worth billions of
dollars and you know a couple of kids
can create a movie that rivals Hollywood
studios a bioterrorist can also create a
very dangerous you know buy a weapon
with these same tools and same knowledge
and if you have a rise of fundamentalism
defining humans the way they were in the
7th century the 3rd centuries 13th
century and having a you know violent
reaction to trying to continue the
advance of progress combined with these
potential phases of metric warfare that
that's a serious challenge and I think
that's actually the fundamental the
primary challenge that we face as we go
forward what do you think about the
president's approach to science funding
well I mean I I said before that I
support unrestricted pursuit of
stem-cell research and I think that's a
very unfortunate that we have these
restrictions I don't think however it's
having a huge effect because stem cell
research is is progressing quite
rapidly and in fact we really want to do
is take my skin cells and turn them into
pluripotent cells that could create any
organ or type of cell with my own DNA
it's called transdifferentiation that's
really the holy grail of cell
engineering these opposition's tend to
be stones in the river but they're
unfortunate stones and and it does slow
certain things down which I think
overall science funding has not gone
down I mean if you look at the
statistics funding of science through
the government and and through the
corporate sectors it's you know
continued its historical growth rates we
don't and and it's doing remarkable
things but that's not a really a policy
of a democratic or republican
administration I mean has kind of a life
of its own and when I was at any
National Institutes of Health a few
weeks ago and Shang ideas with the
directors and their chief scientists
there's some very remarkable things
happening now that we have these you
know increasingly powerful tools
remarkable databases very powerful tools
to be able to reverse engineer genes and
see their impact as proteins and be able
to relate gene States to disease states
with this million genome project that's
coming and many other things so I'm not
dissatisfied over all the science
funding I think we should keep politics
out of it
however I'm not alarmed that it's
significantly distorting progress and
progress isn't just from the government
I mean we have many billions of dollars
of corporate funding and we get from
here to there not with some grand leap
to let's say create human level
intelligence we get there actually a
hundred steps through a hundred steps
each one is small market driven the
market wants a little bit more
intelligent search engine more flexible
operating system and all these little
steps if you add them all up and they
can they get to be faster and faster end
up getting us to very remarkable places
and fairly short order Idaho Falls Idaho
good go ahead
cartoon shown a couple segments ago
about the brain and the tank is presaged
by John her C's book the child buyer
back in the sixties sometime if you're
familiar with that book I'd like you to
comment about it and I'd like you also
to comment about the chances of the
folks who want to bring back the eighth
century of actually succeeding and I
chose the eighth century because the
Battle of Tours was actually a pretty
close run thing and I'd like to listen
on the air if you please thank you very
much
actually missed the beginning of your
question but I'll content comment on the
eighth century
I don't think fundamentalist views
particularly ones I want to turn the
clock back are likely to succeed our
belief in progress in technology and
finding solutions to problems is pretty
deeply rooted and the world has actually
moved very much in this direction if you
go back fifty years ago there were
actually were there many democracies
they weren't there many countries that
practice free enterprise and so we've
actually moved quite a bit even though
there are notable handout holdouts if
you look at the sweep of human history
so I don't think that the clock is gonna
be turned back I am concerned though
about the potential for individuals who
have certain ideas to translate those
into destructive impact because of the
empowerment of the individual both
creatively and destructively I'm also
concerned about fundamentalist humanism
people that feel that humans should not
be enhanced not eighth-century but take
you know our current state I think it's
actually not a new idea we've been
enhancing humanity for for a long time
as I mentioned life expectancy was
twenty five thousand years ago thirty
seven two hundred years ago so we
weren't you know it's unnatural to take
antibiotics why not that's a natural
course of things you'd get it back to
your affection why not just why
intervene in an unnatural way well so
but there is this idea that we should
not
go beyond quote normal human ability but
what's normal I mean look at the range
of quote normal human ability in music
or science or anything else it's a vast
range and I think really going beyond
our limitations enhancing ourselves is
really the story of humanity that's what
we do uniquely and we should continue
that we see the same thing in terms of
not changing biology at all that we
shouldn't enhance biology but you know
care we have to be mindful of dangers
and downsides and we have to test things
to make sure they're safe but going
beyond the natural abilities of biology
whether it's in a tomato or a human I
think it's something that we do well and
biology is not perfect it's very
intricate it's very clever but as we
actually learn how it works we find that
it's very suboptimal this is a design
for example for robotic red blood cells
by Rob Freitas analysis of those
indicates if you replace 10% of your red
blood cells with these robotic wrestler
sites you could do an Olympic sprint for
15 minutes without taking a breath or
sit at the bottom of your pool for four
hours but aside from those interesting
things it actually would be dramatically
beneficial for your health I would keep
it going if your heart stopped with
better oxygenate your tissues we can
actually do a good job of extending
human biology and biology in general as
we learn its secrets reverse-engineer it
simulate it and then extend it by
merging it with our technology what
companies are at the forefront of your
future as you see it what companies
should we be looking to her - as far as
current experimentation going on well I
think an interesting phenomena is that
individuals are very small teams can do
quite revolutionary work we do a certain
amount of mentoring in the early stage
investing and I'm very impressed with
the very exciting technology that comes
from little teams and there's just
thousands of these entrepreneurs and
they're not just in Silicon Valley and
Massachusetts and they're cropping up in
the middle of the United States and
South America
Africa Asia I mean the internet now is
everywhere and the tools for creation
are everywhere and very creative people
are are making contributions for example
well just I mean a company that recently
got involved in has created some
molecules that actually controlled gene
expression
because we're actually learning that
short RNA
strands and other molecules controlled
where the genes are expressed or not
expressed whether they're enhanced or
suppressed and so you can take these
molecules and actually turn genes off or
turn genes on they have one product that
turns on the genes that create some
super antioxidants superoxide dismutase
and catalase which are very our
anti-aging molecule so I mean this
there's a lot of interesting ways of
reprogramming biology that are emerging
from a lot of little companies Microsoft
and Google are very creative companies
they actually believe in fostering this
kind of innovation from inside their
their companies and Google has a
well-publicized model of having actually
all their people spend a fraction of
their time just inventing on their own
so that ideas can bubble up and
Microsoft has a different approach to it
but it similarly has a way of creating
ideas from the sort of ferment of many
individuals we really have a a period
now where the individual is empowered
with the tools to create very
revolutionary ideas and Google is a good
example and there's two kids students at
Stanford and they created a revolution
in search engines and the opportunity to
do that is even in search engines is
becoming more and more possible do you
think that as we look to the future
Microsoft and Google will still be at
the forefront of what you see yeah well
I think those companies will be
successful 10-15 years from now
it it's very hard to predict individual
companies and I can give you predictions
about the course of computation of
communication if you ask me that you
know the cost of a MIPS of computing in
2014 I can give you a figure and it's
likely to be accurate I can just give
you an educated guess when it comes to
an individual company but I know
Microsoft and Google quite well and the
the key competitive advantage they have
is they have a very good way of
attracting really creative and brilliant
people and ultimately that's you know
it's not some lock on the market or some
monopoly on something or some very
clever technology all of that will be
worthless you know in a fairly short
period of time it's really the ability
of the people there to keep reinventing
and be creative and those those two
companies are have shown the ability to
reinvent themselves
well Google hasn't had to reinvent
itself yet but although they've come up
with some very creative new things
beyond search and of course Microsoft
has reinvented itself already several
times and it's working on doing that
again so I have a lot of confidence in
those two companies for Ray Kurzweil
Dayton Ohio of computer and aviation I
had gifted hundreds of hundreds of your
books really five books to friends and
customers and loved the book TV I'm 58 a
technologist my name is sue Harris and
I'm founder of founder and CEO of a
software company and jet engine
component business anyway I have
followed your regime of nutrients from
Fantastic Voyage for last year a month
and have seen tangible great results
like high-energy creative crisp use of
mind and also my sweetheart is thrilled
however I had a follower dr. Linus
Pauling's regime several decades ago on
vitamin C and found that it did not give
me such pleasant results in the past my
question to you sir is doctor is that do
you have any concern or sense of
potentially adverse impact of your daily
regime and also do you have broader base
good sample number of your regime
followers and
what is their consensus incidentally I
consider you a great gift to human well
thanks for your comments my program the
program that dr. Grossman and I devised
it's not one size fits all and it's not
okay do these five things and just
follow it and everybody should do the
same thing and and and that's it
the most important part of the program
is actually to quote the Bible know
thyself and learn about your own body
take take a lot of tests we describe
that in the book to find out you know
how's your atherosclerosis going how's
your insulin resistance how's your
detoxification system there's many
different ways to measure this do you
have early detectable forms of cancer
and and that it's a fair amount of
effort but it really is worthwhile to
know your own health situation many
people when they do this discover they
have some chronic conditions maybe they
have metabolic syndrome a third of the
adult population has that it's kind of
precursor to type-2 diabetes insulin
resistance that really speeds up aging
and can lead to full-blown diabetes and
so on so I can't describe all the issues
but it's important to really test
yourself and then as you adopt you find
out well maybe your insulin resistance
so you take some supplements for that
you don't you know just adopted and
that's the end you keep testing yourself
seeing if it actually works see if there
are adverse reactions because people
sometimes people have reactions to
certain supplements so it is it's really
a period of exploration we give a lot of
ideas in the book originally the
publisher said well where's the sort of
one-trick pony here but then they
actually got on our bandwagon and
appreciated the fact that we give a lot
of ideas because our bodies are complex
we don't have some system yet they can
just do it all for you you have to learn
about yourself and adopt a personalized
program and keep tracking your own
health but if you do that and armed with
the kind of knowledge we provide in
Fantastic Voyage you really can
dramatically slow down disease and aging
processes so that even people I think
you said you were 58 I'm 58 we baby
boomers can in 10-15 years when we have
the full flowering of this
biotechnology revolution where we'll
have very powerful tools to reprogram
biology can still be in good shape so
you know I'm delighted to hear that
you've had a good experience and you
know keep keep it up keep testing
yourself keep you know keep assessing
how how are you reacting you know I
spend a lot of my time keeping abreast
of new health information about new
therapies or new research about old
therapies or even information about my
own body I didn't realize before it's a
constant period of exploration and
refinement
well pharmacy companies move from medic
medic reading medicine to creating
nanobots if that's the way that you see
as far as the human body being
re-engineered well one one trend that we
will see is personalized medicine we're
learning for example cancer is very
personalized and this idea of just okay
you get this kind of cancer you take
these chemotherapy drugs it's not a good
approach and we actually find that
certain chemotherapy drugs worked very
well for certain people and not for
other people and we need to figure that
out before we give the treatment or
actually create a treatment that's
actually designed and works just for the
antigens on your cancer cells and those
kinds of therapies are coming and in
fact we're gonna have to redesign FDA
approval mechanisms because they're not
well designed for this kind of
personalized medicine but that's
actually a very powerful development but
yes I mean there's already lots of
medical devices and systems where we put
computerized devices in your body you
can swallow a little tiny little pill
that actually takes all kinds of
measurements and photographs as it goes
through your digestive system and
Bluetooth that information to a computer
you're carrying your belt and then
disintegrates and I mean I can give you
20 other examples of where we have
already maybe you're not yet blood cell
size devices but tiny devices that are
computerized and programmable this
implant this computer you can put inside
your brain or place the biological
neurons destroyed by Parkinson's disease
it's programmable you can download new
software to the computer in your brain
from outside of the patient so there's
many exciting examples already and as
these devices get smaller as I said
we're shrinking them by a factor of 100
per decade and 3d volume and
more powerful multiplying their power by
a thousand every decade that's gonna
become more and more ubiquitous we have
an email who's asking from some career
advice he's an aircraft pilot and he
read your book and he said that until
reading your book I assumed that I was
in a good career but and I'm not so sure
now am i in a dead-end job well our
aircraft fly themselves can you discuss
some of the impacts of the singularity
on transportation I think the way to
approach careers is to not worry that
much about whether particular types of
jobs are gonna become obsolete but be
open to learning and keeping abreast of
the world and and following your passion
and if you're passionate about flying I
think by all means do it I think the
world would be a different place and you
know most jobs that exist today will at
least be significantly transformed in
the years ahead
so this model where you go to school and
then you learn a trade and that's your
ticket to employment and productivity
for the rest of your life until you
retire I mean that model already doesn't
exist by and large people really have to
change what they're doing and I think
people should have the attitude to keep
learning and to follow your passion
because it's not you don't have to be it
even though we're talking about a
technological future you don't have to
be a technologist or an engineer to
thrive because it's really knowledge and
information that'll have value but that
includes music and art and I mean look
at how artists have been empowered I
mean artists used to you know have a
difficult time making a living unless
they were very well known but now
there's an explosion of need for art and
graphics on the web and artists are
doing very well particularly if they
have computer skills and same thing for
music musicians and so any kind of
knowledge if you have a passion for it
that's what you should pursue and keep
abreast of how different type of
different professions change I think
ultimately transportation will become
more automated you know certainly if you
go out 15 20 years flying devices will
be personalized using nanotechnology and
they'll fly themselves but
flying devices cars or something along
that line as we as we know it yeah I
think in 20 years we'll have
nanotechnology-based flying devices an
Arbor Michigan high biological
components are replaced by technological
ones and the rift between humanity and
technology becomes more narrow what do
you think the possible effects will be
on the human psyche especially the way
in which we define humanity and
differentiate between it and technology
well I think I think it's gonna change
and you can see already you know
movements like body modification tattoos
and piercings and so on which go back in
our 15 years there was a pretty fringe
phenomena is now very mainstream and
people walk around with devices on their
eyeglasses and in their ears and even
five years ago if you had a little
microphone in your ear with an antenna
that would seem pretty weird
now we routinely accept that so
conventions actually change pretty
quickly particularly when technologies
become viable and we we adjust quite
rapidly I mean look at how rapidly we've
become wired and online you walk around
a college campus and everybody is online
with their computers and their things in
their hands and in their ears and
they're in some virtual environment
while they're walking across campus and
that that didn't look like that even
five years ago so as these technologies
become perfected I think we we accept
them more and more and I think we will
accept the idea of enhancing human
ability with our technology because it's
the slippery slope from just correcting
problems that occur from disease or
disability to actually being able to go
beyond quote normal and one reason this
would be slope is there's no such thing
as normal human beings have a broad
range of abilities but really it's a
thrust of technology in general that's
why we started creating tools was to
extend our reach and we started out with
the Industrial Revolution extending our
physical
and we've already you know have a
half-century of extending our mental
reach and our ability to do that it's
gonna become more more powerful as these
tools become more intelligent lansing
michigan afternoon so a pleasure to talk
to you sir i do it one-man show about
thomas jefferson that i take to school
and in my research I came across a quote
that our third president would supports
you and I wondered if I could have told
you for a second to read that say it's
the quote goes like this I am NOT an
advocate for frequent changes in laws
and constitutions but laws and
institutions must go hand in hand with
the progress of a human mind as they
become more developed more enlightened
and as new discoveries are made new
truths discovered and manners and
opinions change with a change of
circumstance institutions must advance
also to keep pace with the time thank
you very much well thanks for that I
think I will actually use that in a
future book and actually if we can get
your name outside you in a footnote
that's a very modern quote that could
have been said today and it's
interesting that the the pace of change
and technical progress was noticed back
then most people did not notice in I
mean 200 years ago people's grandparents
by enlarge lived the same lives they did
and they expected their grandchildren to
do the same it was perhaps 200 years ago
that we just started or at least
thoughtful prescient people like Thomas
Jefferson noticed that things were
changing and that there was such a thing
as progress because you go back hundreds
of years the idea of progress people
never heard of it
they just thought things stayed the same
there was progress but it was at such a
slow pace it was not noticeable now
you'd have to be you know pretty asleep
not to notice the rapid pace of change
but that's a very up-to-date quote
appreciated is there any form of a
modern day Luddite still in the world oh
absolutely I mean there's very strong
Luddite movements I may take the
anti-gmo movement genetically modified
now I'm not saying that GMOs are
inherently safe I think they need to be
tested like any other new food or or you
know invention that affects our
biosphere but it's been just a reflexive
anti GMO movement that if something is
generally modified it's absolutely wrong
which i think it's just a inherently
anti-technology stance golden rice it's
now been approved but it was held up for
five or six years it could have saved
hundreds of thousands of kids from going
blind in Africa because of a genetic
modification that would provide the
right vitamins for these kids in in
their foods to stave off this type of
blindness African countries have been
lobbied not to accept certain grains
certain seeds that would overcome the
natural blights that wipe out their
their livelihood that's changing now but
that that was an example of I think a
reflexive anti technology movement and
there there's a strong anti technology
movement
Bill McKibben who who I respect has
actually brought global warming to our
attention or the book called enough
where he says we have enough technology
at least enough advanced technology now
it's his position is actually more
sophisticated
he said certain types of advancements we
should continue and it's a complex
discussion as to exactly what we should
do and what we shouldn't do
but it's an example of an opposition to
a certain type of advancement that we
shouldn't for example it's a radically
extend human longevity which I think
we've been in the process of doing for a
thousand years but now we're getting to
a point where we can do it much more
rapidly but there's definitely strong
anti technology movements they claim
some academic circles Los Angeles
California I'm extremely impressed and
have not had much exposure to you aside
from your phenomenal keyboards and music
programs
I'm actually a nutritionist myself and
also I'm extremely impressed with your
knowledge of my field and I actually
have a question more about the
implications of nanos in the human brain
and the basically tendency of
governments especially democracies to
lean towards and eventually turn into
what becomes almost monarchy and the
likelihood of nanos being used to
control the populace and how we would
avoid that in the future well you know
when we have software running in our
bodies and brains all kinds of issues
that we now actually struggle with
already even though most of the
computers are not yet inside our bodies
and brains will become even more
important privacy well we already do
very private things and in our computers
and and we realize that people can
easily put a spy program on our computer
and report back to somebody we don't
know everything they were doing so this
is already a concern software viruses
and other type of malware is an issue
given all the important things to do in
our personal computers for when those
computers are inside our bodies and
brains that's going to be more of an
issue we're concerned about security and
privacy of health data well if we've got
all these computers with that health
data inside our bodies and brains and
people hack into it put spyware there
that's going to be a big concern and
potentially people could send software
viruses into the into the nanobots
inside our brain and actually influence
our thoughts I mean that that potential
is there that's one of the downsides of
these technologies software security
therefore becomes more and more
important an issue technical issues like
encryption which get very technical but
are actually pretty fundamental I think
to the future of humanity being able to
maintain privacy is very important and
actually a lot of advances being made in
encryption encryption actually tends to
stay ahead of the decription technology
to the dismay of intelligence agencies
but
to the delight of privacy people are
concerned about privacy so yes this will
be an issue I think you know overall we
get a lot more benefit from our personal
computers in the internet today then we
are harmed by this kind of malware and
software viruses and we actually have a
pretty good system for protecting
ourselves from software viruses that
we've invested in new sort of virus is
discovered and it's reverse engineered
and a protection that's created and
distributed virally to the Internet
generally within 24 hours so we've done
a pretty good job of actually defending
ourselves from software viruses we
actually should learn from that as to
how we should deal with biological
viruses but this is a whole area that
actually will be getting more and more
concerned as the technology gets more
and more intimate and it's already
pretty intimate as far as the advances
are concerned is that the United States
that's leading those advances are there
other countries involved I think we're
already very close to a worldwide system
of worldwide economy you know you buy a
product and you know might have software
done in Silicon Valley and certain
mathematical problems were solved in
India and it was constructed in China
and with just-in-time inventory systems
designed in New York I mean it we're
typical products which have
sophisticated software and hardware
already quite complex and involve people
all over the world and most products are
intellectual and that the intellectual
part of products like product designs
can just circulate the globe in seconds
on the internet and this is actually
empowered China and India to become
successful but I don't see it's not a
global race as if there's a fixed size
pie and if China and India get more
we're gonna get a smaller slice it's
really a positive sum game that Chinese
engineer is creating value for his or
her company but also for us because we
all benefit from all of these products
and this is actually leading in my
opinion to to the economic growth we see
the information you might expect that
the information
detector would shrink because it's 50
percent deflation factor and some
economist actually worried about that
that if you can get the same stuff for
half the money a year later that the
size of the economy as it has to do with
information would shrink but we actually
see that this the opposite the case we
more than double our consumption when
price performance reaches certain levels
whole new applications explode on the
landscape and we have had 18 percent
growth in information technology in
every area in constant dollars for the
last 50 years despite the fact that we
have a 50 percent deflation rate and in
fact that is what is driving economic
growth there's more the economy is
comprised of this information technology
which is growing 18 percent a year and
less of it is comprised of these non
information the industries which are
shrinking the growth rates are
increasing and we see that with these
fantastic growth rates in China and
India and even sub-saharan Africa
because of technology at a 5% growth
rate last year about eight more minutes
with our guests Miami Florida
hi am I on yes go ahead
hi Bri I have to say that I'm a great
fan of yours but that being said I have
a question about one time you talked
about you your utopian future that the
future would not be in utopian despite
the fact of a growth of Technology and
I'd like you to explain that for me
please well I learned earlier to
technology being a double-edged sword
so take biotechnology I mean that's I
think actually a great revolution that's
happening now they were going from a pre
information error where we just happen
to find something and we don't really
know why it works to where we can
actually reprogram biology as an
information technology and that's a
great that's a grand transformation but
it has positive and negative
consequences a positive is that I
believe we will be able to reprogram
biology away from cancer and heart
disease and and these other diseases
that kill us 15-20 years from now I
think we will really overcome these
diseases at least make them manageable
chronic conditions if not eliminate them
altogether through the power of
biotechnology but the downside is that
also empowers a bioterrorist occur to
program a biological virus to make it
more deadly or stealthy or communicable
and that's an existential specter that
we face right now and we really need to
be doing more about it but these
technologies can be used for creativity
or destruction I think the problems that
we've been focused on that humanity has
struggled with for eons we will
ultimately over the next several decades
get the tools to overcome those problems
but we will still be struggling then
with new problems that these
technologies introduce well the
companies that develop them themselves
be able to give proper oversight well I
mean we have a regulatory system I think
it needs to be reformed in in many ways
both to protect ourselves more from
these types of dangers on the one hand
and on the other hand accelerate the
approval of life-saving protocols and
medications that take too long to be
developed and this is actually an issue
in defending ourselves against the
dangers because I mentioned how well
we're doing with software viruses and we
can in one day capture a virus a
software virus reverse-engineered
created an antidote and spread it
virally around the internet and that
system actually works extremely well not
perfect but one of reasons we can't do
that in bio in biology is because of
this regulatory system we have you can't
create something let's say in RN ain't I
medication and put it out in a day I
mean a typical approval time is measured
in years not days and this is actually
concerned with with bioterrorism how do
you how do you test these things all
together when nobody has these diseases
it would be unethical to actually test
them because you can't give people these
diseases in order to test them so we
need to do some more creative thinking
I've written about how to approach this
problem but yes we I mean regulations
gonna be very important we're gonna have
to reform it in light of these new
opportunities and dangers Kingsport
Tennessee go ahead please Ron with Ray
Kurzweil demonstration mr. Kurzweil
concerning the handheld scanner to
convert print speech
does that work on most print fonts where
can we get more information and what's
its approximate cost yes that we just
introduced the Kurzweil National
Federation of the blind reader in July
it's on the order of a thousand blind
guys and gals going around reading
everything from the labels and their
clothing to signs on the wall in the
back of cereal boxes and menus and
handouts of meetings and so on it cost
$3500 it does reads all common fonts
it's it won't read on work on
handwriting yet but it works on all
fonts different sizes it's really quite
flexible if you if there's print in its
field of view which generally does a
good job reading it and you can get
information that's knfbreader.com knfb
reader comm we have about two minutes
left but this final email should we fear
computers and machines as they begin to
equal us in intelligence well we do fear
other humans right and you know we have
one human civilization but it's not been
free from conflict and we had 180
million people die in wars in the 20th
century maybe as we reverse engineer the
human brain we'll have more insight as
to the sources of human conflict but I'm
not predicting that that was gonna lead
us to eliminate human conflict and I
think it's still going to be one
integrated human civilization even more
integrated because of this pervasive
internet that we have and that's gonna
grow in power but but we're not gonna
lymon eight human conflict in fact we're
empowering individuals to be more
destructive with the same technology
they were empowering individuals to be
creative so I would fear the aspects of
humanity that we don't understand that
allow us to be destructive and deploy
technologies in ways that are inimicable
to who I think are better values I'm
hopeful we can do a better job in the
21st century than we did in the 20th
century I buy old feeling as we will but
that's the optimist in me
talking but we fear human hatred and
that unfortunately is also amplified by
these technologies and hopefully we can
take that into account I've written a
lot about how we might do that but that
is that is something to be feared do you
have a new book that you're working on
well my next book is tentatively titled
how the human brain works and how to
build one but that's a number of years
off I've got a number of other irons in
the fire before I get to that but I am
cut I'm doing now what I do in the early
stages which is gathering information so
as I see interesting articles and books
that pertain to this topic I'm gathering
them and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
