speaker who's jurgen schmidhuber jörgen
is an AI researcher who is director of
the swiss AI lab in Lugano very well
known for his work over the years on on
deep neural networks recurrent neural
networks deep neural networks of all
kinds there's been a pioneer since I
guess the the early 90s he's also done
some really interesting work on
universal AI including designing the
wonderful gödel machines which are you
know provably more powerful than all
kinds of other AI systems and
unfortunately not fully implemented just
yet but oh thanks so much David I had no
idea what I'm going to talk about but
now I can just respond to Susan let me
briefly explain how we already have
little conscious artificial systems in
our lab and have had them for a couple
of years and and in those systems
consciousness is just a natural
side-effect a by-product of data
compression during problem solving why
that so to build a general problem
solver that is what we have been working
on for many decades and we are getting
closer and closer you need something
like a general purpose computer which in
our case usually is a is a recurrent
neural network because in this universe
you want to have a computational default
device which exploits the physical
constraints as much as possible so that
you want to have lots of processors and
in a small volume connected through many
short wires and few long wires to
minimize communication costs so you have
a problem solver where video streams in
and pain signals and and auditory
signals and whatever and it translates
that somehow into movements action
sequences and it gets rewards positive
signals feedback signals for achieving
goals so there's some utility function
it wants to maximize that why you give
it one goal after another and then over
time it becomes a
more general problem solver now this guy
has a little helper which is another
recon you on a track which there's a
model of the world and what does it do
it takes all the data ever observed all
the inputs that ever were observed in
response to the actions that were
generated by the control module the
controller and the model they interact
in a certain sense and the control is
shaping the history of inputs coming in
which which then the model tries to
predict to compress sort of predictive
coding why does it want to do that
because it wants to figure out a few
regular things in the world now you have
a very friendly environment and lots of
things are repetitive and repeat
themselves and so you can this means
always that you can you can more
compactly describe them in by devising a
little program a little recurrent sub
Network which can encode these things so
predictive coding for example so you for
example have videos or falling apples a
hundred apples fall down like this and
then the raw data is like that but if
you understand gravity you have a little
recon network which implements the
predictions according to gravity then
you can predict how these apples come
down and you can greatly greatly
compress the video and all of physics
and all of science and all of chemistry
is really about compression progress
about finding short descriptions of the
data which is an often can be used
through the controller to solve problems
better now
what is this unsupervised module doing
which is doing the compression of all
the data ever observed in response to
all your actions ever execute it so you
you better store them all we don't know
whether humans store them all but robot
should store them all it becomes storage
is cheap and you can easily store 100
years of high resolution video and
current devices and then you you want to
find the regularities during sleep for
example you work on all this data and
you try to compress basically which
means that all the things that
frequently occur in your environment
such as faces for example efficiently
encoded in some sort of prototype phase
so a new face comes along such that you
have to encode only the deviations from
the prototype face that you already have
same for glasses same for everything
that
happening in your world the words the
repet repetitive signals that are coming
out of the mouths of other people and so
on and and there's one thing which is
always present as you as the actor are
interacting with the world which is the
actor itself so it's really really
useful to set aside a couple of neurons
and synapses which encode this
representation of yourself of yourself
as you are interacting in many different
ways with with the world so as the data
compression of the entire history of
your life is progressing you are
inventing all these little neural
symbols which stand for the stuff that
frequently occurs which helps you to
better compress including yourself
symbols so you have symbols that stand
for yourself now whenever the controller
is trying to solve a new problem by by
finding a weight matrix a program
essentially that that leads to an action
sequence that solves that problem it has
a search space and it can reduce that
search space by looking at this model
which already knows a lot about the
world and has with me information about
how the world works and you can reuse
that in a good way
to come up with new solutions more
quickly and as it is doing that
sometimes it's wacky waking up these
self symbols for example then you are
thinking of yourself and our robots are
thinking of themselves they have self
symbols which wake up just as a natural
byproduct of data compression through
during problem solving and and then of
course what is happening as you work
correctly stated some of the things that
you some of the skills and the
observation sequences and the pattern
recognition techniques that you have
developed all the time they become
automatic so they become kind of
unconscious and only the new things
where you're still working on how to
improve the performance of the
controller the problem solver they are
still undergoing a search process where
you want to find a good combination of
weights that solve the solves the new
problem without destroying the previous
skills that you have learned and so our
first system of that type we really I
had
in 1991 there was a recon your network
it just learned to compress the data
unsupervised learning network which
learned to compress the observations and
and everything that this guy didn't
understand it sent up to her to a high
level game unpredictable stuff went up
to a high level guy which then tried to
find higher level irregularities and
then maybe found additional compress
abilities and developed internal
representations which the lower level
guys the automatize err as opposed to
the conscious conscious chunker could
learn to imitate such that he previously
conscious stuff during problem solving
and sarge became unconscious by
imitating just the problems that the
high-level guy found and so we have all
of these things going on and have them
had going up and they have been going on
for for many years so I would say from a
technical and practical perspective the
issues of unsupervised learning and
consciousness are solved and we already
have them in our artificial beings</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
