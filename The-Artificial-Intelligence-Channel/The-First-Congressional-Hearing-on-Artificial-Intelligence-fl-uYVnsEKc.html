good afternoon welcome to each of the
witnesses thank you for joining us thank
you for everyone for attending this
hearing throughout history mankind has
refused to accept the complacency of the
status quo and has instead looked to
harness creativity and imagination to
reshape the world through innovation and
disruption the Industrial Revolution
Henry Ford's moving assembly line the
invention of flight and commercial
aviation and more recently the creation
of the Internet have all acted as
disruptive forces that have not only
changed the way we live but had been
engines for commerce that have offered
consumers enormous freedom today we're
on the verge of a new technological
revolution thanks to the rapid advances
in processing power the rise of big data
cloud computing mobility due to wireless
capability and advanced algorithms many
believe that there may not be a single
technology that will shape our world
more in the next 50 years than
artificial intelligence in fact some of
observed that is powerful and
transformative as the Internet has been
it may be best remembered as the
predicate for artificial intelligence
and machine learning artificial
intelligence is at an inflection point
while the concept of artificial
intelligence has been around for at
least 60 years more recent breakthroughs
such as IBM's chess-playing deep blue
victory over world champion Garry
Kasparov advancements in speech
recognition the emergence of
self-driving cars and IBM's computer
Watson's victory in the TV game show
Jeopardy have brought artificial
intelligence from mere concept to
reality whether we recognize it or not
artificial intelligence is already
seeping into our daily life
in the healthcare sector artificial
intelligence is increasingly being used
to predict diseases at an earlier stage
thereby allowing the use of preventative
treatment which can help lead to better
patient outcomes faster healing and
lower costs in transportation artificial
intelligence is not only being used in
smarter traffic management applications
to reduce traffic but is also set to
disrupt the automotive industry through
the emergence of self-driving vehicles
consumers can harness the power of
artificial intelligence through online
search engines and virtual personal
assistants via smart devices such as
Microsoft's Cortana Apple's Siri
Amazon's Alexa and Google home
artificial intelligence also has the
potential to contribute to economic
growth in both the near and long term a
2016 Accenture report predicted that
artificial intelligence could double
annual economic growth rates by 2035 and
boost labour productivity by up to 40%
furthermore market research firm
Forrester recently predicted that there
will be a greater than 300% increase in
investment in artificial intelligence in
2017 compared to 2016 while the
emergence of artificial intelligence has
the opportunity to improve our lives it
will also have vast implications for our
country and the American people that
Congress will need to consider moving
forward workplaces will encounter new
opportunities thanks to productivity
enhancements as artificial intelligence
becomes more pervasive Congress will
need to consider its privacy
implications there is also a growing
interest in this technology from foreign
governments who are looking to harness
this technology to give their countries
a competitive advantage on the world
stage today the United States is the
preeminent leader in developing
artificial
but that could soon change according to
The Wall Street Journal quote the
biggest buzz in China's internet
industry isn't about vesting global tech
giants by better adapting existing
business models for the Chinese market
rather it's about competing head-to-head
with the US and other tech powerhouses
in the hottest area of technological
innovation artificial intelligence
seeding leadership in developing
artificial intelligence - China Russia
and other foreign governments will not
only place the United States at a
technological disadvantage but it could
have grave implications for national
security we are living in the dawn of
artificial intelligence and it is
incumbent that Congress and this
subcommittee begin to learn about the
vast implications of this emerging
technology to ensure that the United
States remains a global leader
throughout the 21st century this is the
first congressional hearing on
artificial intelligence and I am
confident it will not be the last
as this growing technology raises
opportunities and potential threats at
the same time I look forward to hearing
from our distinguished panel of experts
today and at this point I'll yield to
our subcommittees ranking member senator
Peters to give an opening statement well
thank you chairman Cruz for calling this
very important meeting and I'd like to
thank the witnesses for taking the time
as well and look forward to hearing your
expertise on this exciting area
certainly our nation's history has
always been defined in my mind by our
ongoing search for the next innovation
the next big thing that's going to
advance our economy in our society our
mastery of manufacturing and automation
helped the United States establish its
industrial and military might looking to
the future we must continue to harness
this American drive to discover to
create the next big advancement to keep
our nation on the cutting edge over the
last few decades technology has changed
the way we
make and how we make it today we boast
an ever-evolving innovation ecosystem
that's rooted in robotics machine
learning and the subject of today's
hearing artificial intelligence AI
products like our smoke smart phones
intelligent personal assistant or our
banks fraud detection technology are
already improving the day-to-day lives
of Americans new advances in computer
processing and cloud computing and are
driving rapid expansion in AI
development and industries as diverse as
healthcare transportation education and
security and they've all gone through
enormous change as all of you know we as
a society need to help foster this
broader ecosystem so we can capitalize
on its benefits including cleaner energy
new economic growth improved safety and
health and greater accessibility for the
elderly and disabled populations being
from Michigan I've had the opportunity
experience firsthand the development of
self-driving cars that are made possible
by a combination of advanced automatic
braking and lane changing systems
cameras sensors high-performance
computing deep learning systems 3d
high-definition maps and artificial
intelligence just last year over 35,000
people died in motor vehicle crashes but
research suggests that about 94% of
those accidents were the result of human
error with safe deployment AI fuelled
automated vehicles could significantly
decrease this number saving countless
thousands of lives in addition the World
Economic Forum estimates that the
digital transformation of the automotive
industry alone just the automotive
industry alone will generate sixty seven
billion dollars in value for the sector
and yield three point one trillion
dollars in societal benefits before 2025
that's billions injected into our
economy to boost our competitiveness and
billions save due to major reductions in
auto accident injuries and deaths
environmental degradation caused by
traffic congestion and air pollution
more broadly US technology companies
spent 8 and 1/2 billion dollars on AI in
2015 more than four times the amount
spent
in 2010 and experts predict incredible
growth in the coming years in healthcare
marketing and Finance sectors akin
criminal a critical component of this
subcommittee's work is promoting and
preserving American competitiveness and
while the US leads the world in
investment and discoveries in AI as we
all know and as chairman mentioned China
is quickly catching up in 2014 Chinese
scientist overtook u.s. scientist in
terms of new papers published and
citations of published papers in the
area of deep learning a cutting edge of
AI research by computer processing
nanotechnology and biotechnology AI has
the power to dramatically change and
grow the economy but we must invest in
research and in STEM education to
maintain our competitive advantage
analysts by the Council of Economic
Advisers shows that doubling or tripling
all research investment something that I
fully support will allow us to continue
to grow
however targeting increases in areas of
high economic productivity like AI may
offer benefits with much smaller
budgetary impact in fact a recent report
from the White House recommends that
current government spending on AI
research should be doubled or even
quadrupled to achieve optimal economic
growth certainly look forward to hearing
your comments on that we've already seen
enormous gains from federal investment
in this area through NASA's work to
develop AI applications for use in
robotic spacecraft missions these
applications include planning spacecraft
autonomy image processing and rover
autonomy NASA also utilizes AI and Earth
observing satellites to observe eyes
observations of natural disasters like
volcanic eruptions and I look forward to
hearing more about this pioneering work
by NASA and the ways in which other
industries have benefited from day and
finally while we must strive to optimize
the full economic potential of AI we
must also address its potential impacts
on the work force that we know that we
know today while new jobs will be
created because of AI we also have to
think critically about the steps we can
take today and in coming years to make
sure that America
workers are not left behind the
subcommittee plays a unique role in
studying emerging technologies and
examining ways to promote and harness
scientific advancement for the greater
good and I appreciate the Chairman's
interest in this important issue I look
forward to working with him and
continuing to advance development at AI
for the greater good
and that's why I look with great
anticipation to the testimony from each
of you thank you
Thank You senator Peters would now
recognize the ranking member of the full
committee senator Nelson for an opening
statement Thank You mr. chairman
indeed has helped the space program
quite a bit I'm delighted that a
representative from JPL was here
JPL are the whiz kids the rock stars and
in fact they are rocket scientists and
so that's apart I want to pick up
there's another part about AI and that
is the replacement of jobs and we've got
to prepare for that
for example the Elon Musk recently said
that a dilemma recently in an interview
with CNBC he predicted predicted robots
could eventually take over many jobs
away from folks that they would have to
depend on the government in order to
have a living Elon used the example of
truck drivers who could be displaced in
the future by autonomous vehicles and
those kind of advancements that would
allow trucks to drive themselves and yet
if if a whole occupation is suddenly
displaced what do we do we just came
through an election where the loss of
jobs was a big topic and maybe truck
drivers don't want to be trained to go
on a computer so what are we going to do
for the future and so this is just
another challenge that we faced as
technology advances and that's why we're
here today
so thanks I'm looking forward to it
thank you senator Nelson I'd now like to
introduce our witnesses the first
witness is dr. Eric Horvitz who is the
interim co-chair of the partnership on
artificial intelligence and serves as
the managing director of the Microsoft
Research Redman lab dr. Horvath's has

and practical challenges with computing
systems that learn from data and that
can perceive reason and decide his
efforts have helped to bring multiple
systems and services into the world
including innovations in transportation
healthcare aerospace ecommerce online
services and operating systems dr.
Andrew Moore is the Dean of the school
of computer science at Carnegie Mellon
University dr. Moore's background is in
statistical machine learning artificial
intelligence robotics and statistical
computation of large volumes of data
including decision and control
algorithms mr. Gary Brockman is the
co-founder and chief technology officer

intelligence research company prior to
open AI mr. Brockman was the CTO of
stipe a financial technology company
that builds tools enabling web commerce
and dr. Steve Chen is the Technical
Group supervisor of the artificial
intelligence group and the senior
research scientist in the mission
planning and execution section at NASA's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory I would also
note that dr. Andrew futuro
was set to testify in our hearing today
but unfortunately due to weather issues
he was unable to travel to DC today dr.

of genomic medicine at the University of
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in
my hometown of Houston we thank him for
his previously submitted written
testimony and if there are no objections
I would like to submit dr. Fiat rolls
testimony into the hearing record with
that we will move to the testimony
although I will note for each of you
that that your experience and and wisdom
in this topic will be welcomed and
sorely needed and intelligence
artificial or otherwise is not something
we deal with often because this is the
United States Congress and with that dr.
Horvath's you may give your testimony
Thank You chairman Cruz member of Peters
and members of the subcommittee and good
afternoon and thank you for hosting this
discussion on AI it's fabulous to start
a is not one thing
AI is a constellation of disciplines
including computer vision machine
learning language understanding
reasoning and planning and robotics but
they're all aimed at a shared aspiration
the scientific understanding of thought
and intelligent behavior and in
developing computing systems based on
these understandings now many advances
over the 60-year history of AI have are
now actually part of our daily lives
just consider the AI route planning
algorithms we use daily in our GPS
systems and while we've seen many
advances over time it's clear that we're
now at an inflection point we're seeing
an acceleration of AI competencies in
many areas and the inflection is given
by a confluence of several factors and
these include the unprecedented
quantities of data that have come
available with the widespread
digitization of our lives increases in
computing power over time and the recent
jumps in the prowess of our algorithms
the methods we use particularly machine
learning methods that that learn to
predict and to diagnose from data the
advances are putting unprecedented
technologies in the hands of people
including real-time speech to speech
translation among languages now
available from Microsoft Skype services
and computer vision for assisting
drivers AI technology that is already
available today could save thousands of
lives many billions of dollars if
properly translated into
practice and these key and the key
opportunities before us include health
care transportation education as well as
agriculture manufacturing and increasing
accessibility for those those are
special needs other directions that are
critical include using AI advances to
enhance the resilience and capacity of
critical infrastructure like our
electrical power grid and road network
so let's take as an example healthcare
to started a I is a veritable sleeping
giant for healthcare ai technologies
will be extremely valuable for handling
acute as well as chronic illnesses and
for making our hospitals safer here's an
example we've built systems that can
predict patient outcomes and that make
patient specific recommendations to
allocate scarce resources and these port
halves have been applied to address such
challenges as chronic diseases hospital
readmissions hospital-associated
infections and catching preventable
errors in hospitals responsible for over
a quarter of a million deaths per year
in the United States and while on the
topic of saving lives advances in
pattern recognition systems enable us to
develop effective automated braking and
control systems that will keep us safer
we could take a big cut out of those
30,000 deaths that we've become
accustomed to tolerating every year in
our country and we don't often think
about the 300,000 incapacitating
injuries on our roads every year
numerous other AI innovations can help
with safe driving this week we just
published our team just published
results that show how we can leverage
data from Minneapolis to build a routing
system that identifies the safest routes
to take considering a multitude of
factors at any moment even how the sun
is shining and the glare that it
produces moving forward key research
directions in AI include focusing on
human AI collaboration ensuring the
robustness safety and security of AI
systems and identifying and addressing
the ethical legal economic and broader
societal influences of AI as an example
of important research we need to endow
systems with the ability to explain
their reasoning to people people need to
trust systems to use them effectively
and such trust requires transparency
there's also important work to be done
with developing robust and resilient AI
systems especially when these systems
are used for high stakes safety critical
applications admits the complexities of
the open world we must also be aware
that AI systems can't present new kinds
of attack surfaces that can be disrupted
by cyberattacks so it's important to
address rising cyber vulnerabilities as
we develop and field these more capable
AI systems another area of importance is
the influence of AI on our nation's
workforce and economy and while
estimates vary the economic influence of
AI will likely be in multiples of
trillions of dollars however along with
the expected benefits come concerns
without AI will affect jobs and income
disparities and these are important
issues we must closely reflect monitor
and plan to ensure smooth transition to
a world where AI plays a more important
role one thing for sure is that we
urgently need to prioritize the training
and retraining of the US workforce so
that our workforce skills are aligned
with needs we also need to double down
on investments in STEM education and
training now moving forward continued
strong and and public and private sector
support of research and studies on the
scientific and socio-economic challenges
of AI will be critical to ensuring that
people in society get the most out of AI
advances so in summary we expect AI
advances to raise our quality of life to
empower citizens in new ways but with as
with any technical advance we need to
invest efforts to study and address
potential challenges concerns inequities
that may come along with the benefits
that we expect from AI thanks very much
thank you dr. Horvath's dr. Moore Thank
You chairman Cruz ranking member Peters
and members of the subcommittee for
convening this really important meeting
what I want to do with this testimony is
three takeaways first what AI is and
what it isn't right now there's the
artificial in artificial intelligence is
there for a reason
secondly why things are changing so
quickly
right now and thirdly the thing that
keeps me awake at night regarding US
competitiveness in AI so what is AI when
one of my students decides to build an
AI they always end up doing two things
one they make sure the computer can
perceive and understand the world
through computer vision and through big
data second they do massive search which
means in all these examples such as a
car finding a route the computer
searches them to find the best of
billions and sometimes quintillions of
possibilities and does that very quickly
and efficiently and that's happening all
the time when you ask Siri a question
what's happening up there in the cloud
is it is essentially trying out about 10
billion possible answers to your
question and searching over them to
score each one as to how likely is it is
it to make you satisfied if a car
autonomous car is about to hit a deer
and it's about 0.2 of a second to impact
it can spend the first 20th of a second
gaming out millions of possibilities of
what it can do or the deer is going to
do to maximize the chance that some that
people are going to survive so that's
what's going on in AI it is perception
through big data and search what's
really changed in the last couple of
years is through the efforts of the
United States in big data
we now have computers which can perceive
enough for this to be useful and this
means there's now a big land grab going
on for researchers and entrepreneurs and
students for finding all the places
where we can use this for example this
picture here is one of of Sebastian
LePage who is VP of operations at Canova
a robotics arm arm company working with
Carnegie Mellon faculty on the question
of if you are unable to use anything
below your neck
you want to indicate by nodding at
something that you'd like to pick it up
perhaps not again to say you want to
bring it to your mouth searching over
the billions of possible things the arm
can do safely to find the one which is
most likely to make you as the user
happy this is an unambiguously good use
of technology applicable to tens of
thousands of our veterans for example
but what's what excites me and the
reason I'm in this business right now is
that there's thousands of stories like
this happening and my students and
faculty and folks all across the country
who know who have the skills are
exploring the ways of doing this for
example one of our undergraduate
students working by herself using open
AI tools managed to quickly come up with
a system for checking open Internet
records to detect sex traffickers and
her algorithm has saved you know a
couple of hundred young women from sex
trafficking that's one person who had
the skills able to do this another
example this wasn't possible 12 months
ago now we have drones zooming quickly
through forests able to dodge trees as
they're going because they can now
afford to plan so fast to avoid trees in
in sub-second time many other examples
so many that I could keep us going for
half an hour they all just make me so
excited but the thing that keeps me
awake at night on all of this is the
talent war I really really beseech that
together we can get a million of the
current middle school students in the
country to become AI experts over the
next five to ten years at the moment we
have a tiny fraction I would say less
than 1% of the people available to work
in this area who could work in this area
if you duplicated these four panel
members a hundred times each we still
would have too much to do when it comes
to taking advantage of all these
opportunities I estimate that when an
internet company hires one of our
students
they're making five to ten million
dollars per student just by having that
person on their payroll and so the
bidding wars for this talents are huge
and our students instead of necessarily
moving to work on AI for the Veterans
Administration or AI for helping protect
our warfighter the majority of them are
simply going off to internet companies
which is fine but I want them in all the
other sections of our economy as well
similarly if you look at every one of
the big advances in artificial
intelligence that are now active they
came from university professors the
majority of them from US university
professors we are beginning to lose many
of our university professors to industry
and that is damaging our seed corn our
university professors really are looking
the AI experts among them are looking
for sustained stable funding not
necessarily lots of funding so that they
can realize their dreams of doing things
like this so I'm very excited I'm very
grateful for for this subcommittee for
shining a light on this important issue
and I think the future is bright but it
really is an AI race at the moment
thank you dr. Moore mr. Brockman thank
you
Thank You chairman Cruz ranking member
Peters distinguished members of the
subcommittee as well as their staff this
is a really important session and I'm
honored to be giving this testimony
today
I'm Greg Brockman co-founder and chief
technology officer of open a I open AI
is a non-profit AI research company with
a billion dollars in funding our mission
is to build safe advanced AI technology
and to ensure that its benefits are
distributed to everyone
we're chaired by technology executives
Sam Altman and Elon Musk
the US has led essentially all
technological breakthroughs of the past
100 years and they've consistently
created new companies new jobs and
increased American competitiveness in
the world
AI has the potential to be our biggest
advance yet today we have a lead but we
don't
have monopoly when it comes to AI this
year Chinese teams won the top
categories in a Stanford annual image
recognition contest South Korea declared
a billion dollar AI fund Canada actually
produced a lot of the technologies that
have kicked off the current boom and
they've recently announced their own
renewed investment into AI so right now
I would like to share three key points
for how the US can lead in AI the first
of these is that we need to compete on
applications but when it comes to basic
research that should be open and
collaborative todayI applications are
broadening they're helping farmers
decide which fields to seed they're
helping doctors identify cancers but the
surprising thing is that industry is not
just capitalizing on the advances that
have been made to date companies like
Facebook Google Microsoft they're all
performing the basic scientific research
the kind of work that you would expect
to see just in academia and they're
trying to create the new AI building box
that can then be assembled into products
and even more surprisingly these
industrial labs they're publishing
everything that they discover they are
not holding back any secrets and the
reason they do this is because
publication allows them to pool their
resources to make faster breakthroughs
and to attract world-class scientists
now these companies they stay
competitive by they publish the basic
research but they don't talk about how
they put this stuff together to actually
make products to actually make the
things that are going to make dollars
for the company for example IBM Watson
Microsoft Cortana there aren't papers on
how those are built and the thing that's
happened is that this openness has
concentrated the world's AI research and
corresponding commercial value all
around the United States this includes
attracting many of the Canadian
scientist who really kicked off this AI
boom they're here now in fact one of
them is one of my co-founders at open AI
and importantly this has allowed us to
define the cultures they're the values
and the standards of the global AI
community now this field is moving so
quickly the basic research advances tend
to find their way into products in
months not years and so the government
can directly invest in American
innovation and economic value
funding basic AI research the second
thing that we need to do is that we need
public measurement and contests there's
really a long history of contests
causing major advances in the field for
example the DARPA Grand Challenge really
led directly to the self-driving
technology that's being commercialized
today but really importantly as well
measures in contests help distinguish
hype from substance and they allow for
better forecasting and so good policy
responses and a healthy public debate
are really going to depend on people
having clear data about how the
technology is progressing what can we do
what still remains science fiction how
fast are things moving so we really
support OSD P's recommendation that the
government keep a close watch on AI
advancement and that it work with
industry to measure it the third thing
that we need is that we need industry
government and academia to start
coordinating on safety security and
ethics the internet was really built
with security as an afterthought and
we're still paying the cost for that
today
with AI we should consider safety
security and ethics as early as possible
and that means today and start baking
these into the technologies into the
fundamental building blocks that are
being created today academic and
industrial participants are already
starting to coordinate on responsible
development of AI for example we
recently published a paper together with
Stanford Berkeley and Google laying out
a roadmap for AI safety research now
what would help is feedback from the
government about what issues are most
concerning to it so that we can start
addressing those from as early a date as
possible as as the chairman said in his
opening statement
Accenture recently reported that AI has
the potential to double economic growth
rates by 2035 which would really make it
into the engine for our future economy
the best way to create a good future is
to invent it and we have that
opportunity with AI by investing an open
basic research by creating competitions
and measurement and by coordinating on
safety security and ethics thank you for
your time and I look forward to the Q&amp;amp;A
thank you mr. Brockman I was encouraged
by your testimony about the Canadian
scientists coming
to this country and I will say is
someone born in Calgary that that I
think they're colleagues of mine on both
sides of the aisle who have concerns
about Canadians coming to this country
dr. chan chairman Cruz ranking member
Peters and members of the committee
thank you for this great opportunity to
speak to you on this topic of artificial
intelligence and specifically its
relationship to space exploration for
the record I'm here as an employee of
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory which
is a federally funded research and
development center managed by the
California Institute of Technology for
NASA as a senior research scientist
autonomous systems at JPL I work on the
development and application of
artificial intelligence to NASA's
missions I've had the privilege to lead
the deployment of AI software to NASA's
Earth observing one mission NASA's Mars
exploration Rovers mission and also the
European European Space Agency's Rosetta
mission we focus on using AI to improve
the effectiveness of conducting science
and observation activities to in in
NASA's missions I know of no better
introduction to this topic than to point
out that as we speak right now there's a
spacecraft called Earth observing one
that's flying about 700 kilometers
overhead weighs about 500 500 kilograms
and is flying at seven and a half
kilometers per second that is fully
under the control of AI software this
spacecraft has been under the control of
this AI software for over a dozen years
in a successfully acquired over 60,000
images under the control of this
software and issued over 2.6 million
commands the AI software that's used in
the operation of this mission includes
constraint based scheduling software to
enable the spacecraft to be operated by
end-users scientists and people who
monitor natural hazards such as
volcanoes and flooding onboard software
including machine learning classifiers
enables the spacecraft to more
effectively monitor these science events
again flooding volcanism as well as
cryosphere the freeze and thaw of the
Earth's environment furthermore in a
range of collaborations all around the
world this spacecraft has been
integrated into a net
work with other space systems as well as
ground sensor networks and these the
extent of this multi agent AI system
goes as far as thailand iceland sicily
Namibia and even Antarctica what this
system enables us to do is enable data
from one part of the system such as a
seismographic sensor at a volcano in
Antarctica to trigger the observation of
the system via space assets going even
further afield on Mars autonomous
navigation software is at the heart of
all of the Mars rover exploration
missions and this is at its core AI
based search software AI in computer
vision software form the core of the
aegis system which is now operational on
both the Mars Exploration Rover missions
and the Mars Science Laboratory Rovers
Aegis enables the Rovers to
automatically target science
measurements based on general science
criteria such as texture size shape in
color without the ground in the loop
dramatically enhancing the science that
the Rovers can conduct machine learning
has also had significant impact in
dealing with the enormous datasets that
space missions produce just two examples
in the very long baseline array radio
science is being enhanced by machine
learning machine learning is used to
identify millisecond duration radio
transients in reject radio frequency
interference events here machine
learning allows the automatic triage
from thousands of candidates down to
tens of candidates for manual review by
highly expert scientists in visual
astronomy in the intermediate Palomar
transient facility machine learning is
applied to identifying transits point
transits point source transients are
basically supernova and streaking
transients are near-earth objects here
machine learning has been used to
perform fast daily triage of millions of
candidate events down to tens of events
again allowing the human experts to
focus on the most likely candidates and
enhance the science while these examples
may give you the impression that AI is
commonplace in space exploration I
this is not the case the velvet samples
are a sampling of AI success stories on
a small fraction of the overall space
missions because of the high-stakes
nature of space exploration the adoption
of disruptive technologies like AI
requires an extensive track record of
success as well as continuous contact
with the key stakeholders of science
operations in engineering
however AI has made tremendous progress
in recent years instruments on the Mars
2020 Rover will have unprecedented
ability to recognize features in
retarget themselves to enhance science
the Mars 2020 Rover mission is also
investigating the use of onboard
scheduling technologies to best use
available rover resources in the Europa
multi flyby mission is also
investigating the use of on onboard
autonomy capabilities to achieve science
despite Jupiter radiation the Jupiter
radiation environment which causes
processor resets in the future AI will
also have applications in the manned
program in order to best use scarce
astronaut time resources past efforts
have placed AI in a critical position
for future space exploration to
increasingly hostile and distant
destinations what we need is sustained
resources and a commitment support
envision for AI to fulfill its vast
potential to revolutionize space
exploration thank you very much for your
time thank you dr. chan and thank you to
each of you for your testimony let me
start with just a a broad question to
the panel which which is what are the
greatest challenges and opportunities
you see for the continued development of
AI I do think it's very important that
we grow our AI workforce quickly and
it's interesting that in a world where
we're actually all concerned about
making sure there are more jobs
available that there's such a gap here
where we're so short of experts here
frankly I look at some of the other
major
players around the world in this area
and a China India other countries are
really pumping out the computer
scientists who can form conform this
cohort so for me I would feel much more
comfortable if we were graduating
hundreds of thousands of AI experts
every year from our universities instead
of just thousands so let me also a
compliment that worked by talking about
some technical directions I mentioned
human computer or human AI collaboration
and we don't think enough about the
human factor angle in in AI it's not all
about automation of course to be some
interesting automation we can have
people on Mars for example looking at
those stones and doing the digging but
in general there's incredible
opportunities ahead with Co designing
systems so they work really well they're
human aware they understand human
attention they understand how they can
complement human intellect and what
people do uniquely and do well
understanding how to to negotiate to do
a give and take a fluid dialogue and
contributions between humans and
machines lots to be done there and that
includes this piece with explanation
transparency many of these the answers
we get today out of AI systems the best
systems we can build our blackbox
systems they're opaque to human beings
who need to understand to learn how to
justify those decisions and and how the
thinking is done and to understand the
reasoning process itself but that's what
to do there there's another critical
direction with thinking through
opportunities to take some of the
software we've done in the intellectual
cognitive space and enter into the real
world of physical innovation to teach
systems to work in physical spaces our
robotics today are very very limited
even our best practices on Mars don't do
the kinds of things that people can do
easily and there's a coming Renaissance
in taking some of our advances in AI and
bringing them into the physical space so
I'm so I believe that the biggest
opportunity we have is to continue to
move very quickly on the fundamental
building blocks on the fund
mental technology and it really feels
like today we're kind of in the vacuum
tube era and that the transistors out
there and that we're building very
impressive technologies but that in the
future we're going to be this is really
just the tip of the iceberg and I think
that the the biggest thing to watch out
for I think one of the biggest risks is
that we lose the openness that we have
today we can have these conversations we
can measure how the technology is
progressing and we can plan for the
future and I think that we can continue
to attract the world's best talent by
keeping it open so in the early 2000s I
chaired a series of hearings at the
Federal Trade Commission on on barriers
to e-commerce and I'd be interested in
in the panel's opinion are there
particular legal or regulatory barriers
or other barriers to entry that that are
slowing down or impeding the development
of a AI one comment is on I'll make
mention is on data with the growth of AI
and the importance of data now there's
been a growth of a genuine need for
innovation with privacy to secure the
privacy for individuals at the same time
there are massive data assets that
aren't easily available we had to
negotiate at Microsoft Research to gain
access to FAA data to help us build new
weather maps for the country based on
thousands of planes in flight as we
speak we were helped by the OSTP and
getting access to that but it was not
necessarily a simple task but there are
many data sets like this and we'd love
to see public sector datasets especially
with privacy protected made more
available for innovation at the same
time we why the NIH requires on NIH
funded projects for data to be released
as part of the the the contracts that
are made with researchers it's very
difficult to to have medical data shared
and as a part of the fulcrum of
innovation and so we need to think
through HIPAA altruistic data approaches
where patients donate data new kinds of
programs that let us really maintain
patient privacy while gaining access to
large amounts of biomedical data
the other what one of the things which I
think we are really looking for at the
moment is there are some areas such as
intelligent braking in cars where the
there are some legislative questions
which might slow us down for example it
would be tragic if some life-saving
technology which would make cars safer
couldn't be released because the legal
questions about who is responsible got
in the way what I'm talking about here
is if I as a software developer invent a
new collision avoidance system which
unambiguously reduces fatalities by a
factor of three but occasionally
unfortunately one in a thousand times
maybe there's a disaster there is a
difficult question as to how
legislatively we make sure we're ready
for this so I can imagine that potential
danger of an impasse with between
insurance companies policy makers
drivers and car manufacturers where no
one is willing to put life-saving
technology into these systems because
they're not its it still being left
ambiguous who has the responsibility for
what so one final question general AI
has generated some significant fears and
concerns from scientists and innovate
innovators such as Stephen Hawking Bill
Gates in Elon Musk Stephen Hawking's has
stated once humans develop artificial
intelligence it would take off on its
own and redesign itself at an
ever-increasing rate
humans who are limited by slow
biological evolution couldn't compete
and would be superseded and Elon Musk
has referred to it as quote summoning
the demon how concerned should we be
about the the prospects of general AI or
to ask the question differently in a non
determinate er does anyone know when
Skynet goes online
so I mean my answer that is that I think
that with artificial intelligence
generally that there are a lot of things
that we should be careful about and
concerned about it and think about
security safety and ethics today and so
I think that the the the the kind of
general intelligence that the people
talk about I think that you know my 90%
confidence interval and when that kind
of technology could arrive is between 10
to 100 years it's it's it's it's not
something that we're at all capable of
building today and today we know that
there are concrete safety problems that
can be working on and so I think that we
should be investing in those kinds of
questions and I think that that will
help us answer the figure out the right
answers for the short medium and long
term so there's been a lot of hyperbole
as you know stimulated you know no small
part by by Hollywood great these are
great themes and they keep us enamored
with interesting possibilities at the
same time we hope Scott but those kinds
of long-term outcomes and want to
seriously reflect and review
possibilities push to the limit some of
these proposals about what's possible
and in advance proactively work to
thwart them to stay on a healthy secure
path my my own sentence these are very
very long-term issues but that the
things we're doing today are actually
relevant and interesting in terms of
thinking about how AI systems can
grapple with unknown unknowns how it
could secure systems from for example
modifying themselves their own objective
functions which is one of the concerns
that comes up at times in some ways I
I'm happy to see the the growth of
interest in the long term future
questions because it raises my
confidence that we will track closely
and do the best we can when it comes to
harnessing AI for the greatest benefits
if I could just that at the moment
everything that's going on in the
current air evolution is using a eyes
which are like idiot savants they're
able to search a space that we've
prescribed really efficiently and it is
a matter of future researchers not
something immediate to
these kinds of self-aware self reasoning
systems those would be really really
important to get right at the moment the
heirs we're building all to do with
immediately answering questions about
agriculture safety people's health and
the students are being drawn into it are
being drawn into it for these idealistic
reasons one thing you will notice and
this is actually under the influence of
some of the institutions my colleagues
are put into place is many places such
as Carnegie Mellon are actively making
ethics and and responsibilities a
central part of the curriculum for these
AI experts because these kids their kids
today they're building the 21st century
we need them to actually understand the
human condition while they're doing it
just to get a sense for the kinds of
things that are going on this coming
spring there's going to be an event
where we're inviting or a group is
inviting out people who are who are
imagining them the most fearful feared
long-term AI scenarios call them the red
team and we're and then we're fighting
out the blue team to disrupt them in
advance and they're going to come
together and battle it out so I would
like to take this chance to circle back
to one of your earlier questions and tie
that in you asked what are the areas
that we need to work in I would say that
one of the key areas that we need to
work in is better characterization and
understanding the performance of AI
systems and this is something that we
have a lot of interest in at NASA
because in our space missions we need to
if not prove that they were going to
actually perform within certain bounds
we need to have very strong confidence
that they will perform in those bounds
because these are very high stakes
missions a lot of the applications that
people have talked about healthcare
self-driving cars these also are high
stakes missions before before AI can
control our critical infrastructure we
need to be confident that it will
perform as we want it to perform and I
think this has been identified before in
the OSTP study as a key area of research
thank you very much senator Peters Thank
You mr. chairman again thank you to our
witnesses
right Doug John we have to make sure
this performs I've been very involved in
autonomous vehicles and research that's
going on there and it is my concern is
that we have to make sure the technology
gets it right with as few errors as
possible because there's already limited
consumer acceptance for letting some
some machine drive your automobile
through through a city street now there
are all sorts of benefits that we've
talked about but limited acceptance now
and if you had some sort of catastrophic
event and a crash and there will be some
crashes certainly but it could very well
setback the industry dramatically
because of the consumer pushback in the
public pushback so we have to do this
some thoughtful ways which is why dr.
more some of the regulatory aspects of
this before you put vehicles on the road
to make sure there's proper safety in
place or we've thought through how we
ensure that is incredibly important my
concern with all of this has always been
that there's a disconnect between the
speed we're on with public policy versus
technology right now we are at an
exponential rate when it comes to
technology and even though we have
estimates of AI reaching a thinking
maybe that was a rock witness
singularity of some sort from ten to a
hundred years you know we don't know
when that is although things seem to
operate a lot quicker than we anticipate
and I believe that we didn't think we
could beat the expert player and go for
at least a decade and I think that just
occurred a few months ago so you know we
just don't it can't fully anticipate
what's happening so I don't know the
speed it will go at but it'll probably
be quicker than we anticipate the one
constant and all this is that when it
comes to public policy that operates at
a constant speed it's called snail speed
so it is very slow cumbersome and if we
are not doing it now we have no chance
of trying to catch up to what's
happening with the policies going
forward so I certainly appreciate the
comments from several of you that we
have to be thinking about this stuff now
in a very thoughtful comprehensive way
because if we wait it's going to be too
late to do that but now I switch gears
to the positive aspects that we want to
continue to move a eye forward you've
mentioned some of the challenges that we
have
the gaps that we have to fill and I like
your perspective on where the federal
government's role is in terms of
research mr. bruckman you mentioned in
your testimony you talked about some I
think you referred it to some subfields
that need work in it in some other areas
but I'd like to ask each of you
obviously private industries are already
invested in my opening comments I
mentioned eight and a half billion
dollars in 2015 that number is going to
continue to go up
so private industry is doing an awful
lot of this work including basic
research which traditionally has been an
area where the federal government has
supported academic research through
grants but some of that basic research
is being done by private industry as
well so that's occurring not necessarily
in other areas but are there gaps where
you believe the federal government there
isn't going to be a private industry
group out there investing in some of
these gaps that we need to figure out
and the federal involvement will be
critical to investing in those kinds of
research programs for us to make sure
that AI moves forward in a societal
beneficial way but also understanding
the time constraints associated with the
competition that we face from the
Chinese and Koreans and and other folks
so one comment I'll make is that beyond
industry looking at private sector and
public sector academia there are groups
coming together so I'll just make a few
comments about the new partnership and I
I the file name is partnership on air
and III to benefit people in society and
this is a nonprofit organization that
was formed by Facebook and Amazon Google
IBM and Microsoft coming together
working with nonprofit teams with
balance board and so on focused around
sets of these long-term challenges and
shorter term challenges with safety
critical systems ethics and society
notions of how people and machines work
together and even working to stimulate
new kinds of challenges and catalyzing
new efforts in AI that might not be done
naturally by industry but that's that's
one direction I'm happy to answer
questions about that effort which is
ongoing another
couple comments is that there are there
are places and opportunities where we
don't necessarily see industry making
deep investments I would call these
application areas that are rich and ripe
for AI innovation how can we solve
homelessness or address homelessness
addiction related problems at in the
social science sphere and social
challenges sphere there are some teams
in academia right now working hard at
applications in this space recently at
USC the engineering department joined
with the Social Work Department Social
Work Department looking at innovative
applications of AI and optimization and
decision making two new kinds of
policies that can adjust these these
these long term hard insidious problems
very good I could not agree more with
what you're describing another example
of this phenomenon is I have two
brilliant faculty in the human-computer
interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon
who are looking at AI to help people
make prosthetic hands easily for folks
who've lost their limbs and you know
they're struggling to find 50,000 or
$100,000 here here or there to build
these things at the same time frankly
and my friends from industry will be
offering these same faculty two or three
million dollar startup packages to move
into industry anyway so I do want to
make sure that the folks building these
things get successful another example is
in the defense world tools for helping
our war fighters or other folks
domestically who are putting themselves
into danger to save other people there
is so much opportunity to use sensing
robotics and artificial intelligence
planning to save lives there that's an
area which it will take a very long time
to grow naturally in the private sector
and we have faculty and especially
students champing at the bit to work on
these kinds of problems there's another
area which may sounds too theoretical
but I got to tell you about it because
it's so exciting
the big internet companies are working
their big search engines powered by
things called knowledge graphs the
underlying set of facts about the world
which you can chain together to make
inferences a large group of us from
academia and Industry and from some
government agencies want to work to
create a public open large knowledge
graph which will permit small AI
entrepreneurs to tap into the same kind
of knowledge of the world that the big
Internet companies have at the moment so
we see in a little in a manner
equivalent to how lots of individual
networking systems came together to form
the tcp/ip protocol for the internet
there's something we can do there
finally this one is going to sound
really abstract the really good ideas at
the moment in machine learning and deep
learning came out of mathematics and
statistics without the fundamental work
going on by them mathematicians and
statisticians around the world we
wouldn't be where we are
so statisticians who are often the
heroes in AI need need help to progress
their field forward as well hi sorry
three suggestions the first of these is
basic research and you mentioned that
basic research is happening in industry
but I think that we just cannot do too
much of it in that we really are at the
tip of the iceberg here and I think that
we're just going to find so much value
and that's why the big companies are
investing because they realize that that
as many dollars are being made today
that there's 100 X or maybe more
increase in the future and I think that
it's really important that the
technologies not owned by just one or a
few big companies I think it's really
important that the benefits and that the
technology are owned by by us all as
Americans and as the world and so I
think that the government can really
help to ensure that this technology is
democratized and we move faster the
second is measurement and contests I
think that for the reasons I mentioned
earlier that it's really important that
we track how it's progressing so we can
have a good good debate I think that the
government has actually been extremely
successful in the past with investing in
in contest and so I think you
creating new measurements or supporting
people in industry and academia who are
doing the same and the third is safety
security ethics I think that's going to
take everyone and I think that we all
need to work together I think that
that's gonna require making sure that
that there is funding available for
people who want to be thinking about
these issues and I think that's going to
feed back into all of the questions of
that everyone's been raising here today
it was directly I think I saw that you
thought philosophers should be part of
that so in addition to technologists so
I appreciated that some one of the
masters in philosophy that's good so I
appreciate that it's gonna take everyone
dr. Chen yes so I would echo some of the
statements that the other panelists made
they've identified a lot of great topics
for the that really require government a
government role a one that I would
emphasize is very basic science
questions that relate to NASA's mission
so how how did the universe form how did
the solar system form how did life come
into existence on this planet and other
planets these are actually fundamental
questions of science and exploration
that we really need to leverage AI
to go and explore all these nooks and
crannies in the solar system and if you
really want to think far out in order to
embark on an interstellar mission to see
if there's extant life at other solar
systems these are different questions
that there's no clear financial motives
so there's a clear role for the
government to be able to answer these
kinds of basic science questions and if
I could just add one last thing so I
believe that that the statistic for the
amount of government unclassified
dollars that went into our DNA I was 1
billion dollars I believe is in over the
past year and the as been mentioned
several times that industry investment
is eight billion dollars and if this is
a technology that's really going to be
affecting every American and such a
fundamental way I think that it's
actually that disparity I think is going
to uh is something that we should act to
correct all right Thank You ppreciate
thank you senator Schatz thank you dr.
more you talked about the mostly the
unambiguously positive potential
applications of AI and
sort of briefly touched upon the
terrifying science-fiction possibilities
which I think we're you know joking
aside keeping an eyeball on but that is
from 10 to 100 years from now what I'm
interested in is what are the center
Peters mentioned what are the tough
thorny short-term public policy and
ethical challenges that we're facing
right now not the possibility that
machines will overtake us not even the
sort of question of long-term
unemployment but I think about doctrine
of war I think I think about black box
algorithms that help with help with
policing or social work or healthcare
and I'm wondering if you could maybe
just going down the line starting with
dr. Horvath's give me an example of a
short-term ethical moral public policy
quandary that that is upon us now well
for one I think that we'll be seeing
interesting legal tests and precedents
set up that to find new kinds of
frameworks for dealing with things like
liability who or what is responsible
manufacturers the drivers of cars the
people who sign various documents when
cars were purchased I think that we
haven't things are unsettled in that
space and we'll be seeing lots of
interesting work there and there are
some very interesting a focused
workshops and conferences where people
ask these questions when it comes to
using various AI technologies going from
machine learning for building
classifiers that do predictions and that
that are used to reason about
interesting problems like criminal
justice challenges should this person
charged with a crime have to stay in
jail in advance of their court date or
can they get out early if they can't pay
pay their bail there the systems out
there that have been used and critiqued
and it's pretty clear that there is
opportunity for looking very carefully
at systems that are used in high-stakes
situations like this to ensure that
there are not implicit biases in those
systems to ensure that there's
accountability in fairness
and so long as it's not
government contract where you're working
with a subcontractor which says you know
our algorithm is proprietary you're not
allowed to we just spit out our
recommendation that's what you pay us
well that's exactly where I'm going
that's exactly where I'm going so the so
what question would be what are best
practices for example and do we need
them when it comes to these kinds of
applications for example potentially
with protecting privacy should datasets
used in these applications be disclosed
and disclosable for study and
investigation and interrogation by
people who want to make sure that
they're fair and that there can be trust
in these systems the basic idea here is
that many of our data sets have been
collected in advance with assumptions we
may not deeply understand and we don't
want our machine learned applications
used in high-stakes applications to be
amplifying cultural biases or any kind
of biases that was that was part of the
collection process why don't we go very
quickly because I have one final
question but if I'd be interested to
hear each one of you quickly answer this
question very very briefly this AI
technology is available to the bad guys
too it is possible to cheaply set up
homemade drones in a bad way a
repressive regime can now use face
recognition in a way that they couldn't
use last year we need to actually stay
ahead we can't just sit where we are so
so I'd like to actually build on the
bias answer and just say that one thing
that concerns me is the lack of
diversity in the field especially as we
try to think about how can we ensure
that these systems are going to do the
right things for all of us and if you
look at this panel that we're actually I
think pretty representative of what the
current field of AI looks like and I
think that we the government and and
industry and academia need to work
together in order to correct that I
would echo Eric's comments on we need to
further understand how to characterize
the performance of systems oddly enough
there's analogs from social science to
space science where we work very heavily
we need to show that the the datasets
collected by our autonomous systems are
representative samplings of what you
would get if you were not smartly
collecting the data otherwise you'll
actually come up with different side
different scientific theories and
mechanisms for explaining things these
same kinds of techniques applied to
making sure that your algorithms are
biased and performing are not biased in
performing as you wish so let me just
wrap up with this and I'll ask a
question for the record my question is
sort of mechanical dr. Horvath's and and
many of the other testifiers have have
made at least a brief reference to the
to the ethical quandaries that we are
faced you know blue team red team
I know mr. Brockman you-you-you made a
reference to safety security and an
ethics and it's it occurs to me that as
this accelerates so fast that as you do
your conferences have you have as you
have your conversations you may not be
you may not have fully articulated what
kind of system among the AI community
you really want to wrestle with these
questions whether it's a public-private
partnership whether it's led by the
federal government or convened by the
federal government but primarily driven
by private sector actors I don't know
but it occurs to me lots of good
thinking is occurring it also occurs to
me that maybe it hasn't been fleshed out
from a process standpoint and we can't
take it for granted that that it's all
going to happen organically but I will
take that question for the record in the
interest of time thank you
Thank You chairman Thune Thank You mr.
chairman
for convening today's subcommittee
hearing on artificial intelligence this
topic complements our last full
committee hearing which explored another
nascent technological field augmented
reality I'm excited by this topic
because AI has the potential to catapult
the United States economy and
competitiveness in both the near and the
long term future
AI presents promising applications in
the areas of health care transportation
and agriculture among others and I want
to thank our witnesses today for for
sharing and highlighting some of those
applications today the recent report and
strategy on AI released by the White
House Office of Science and Technology
Policy provide Congress with important
considerations to weigh as we think
about what the appropriate role of
government
in this promising field so that we
ensure that the United States remains
the preeminent place for AI in the
global economy and so I appreciate again
the witnesses sharing your insights
about what the state of the art is today
and where the nation's leading experts
see the applications moving forward I
wanted to direct a question dr.
Horvath's to to you you mentioned your
testimony that new kinds of automation
present new attack surface surfaces for
cyberattacks and I wonder if maybe you
could elaborate on what some of those
new cyber security vulnerabilities might
be yes thanks for the interesting
question and framing since the systems
we build that are doing sophisticated
tasks in the world often are assembled
out of multiple modules or components
that have to talk to one another ending
often in cyber physical or actual
physical activity or effectors like like
car steering wheels and braking and so
on every single one of those interfaces
presents an opportunity to an attacker
to to intervene and influence the
behavior of a system
there are also whole new categories of
attack I would be surprised to learn 15
years ago that we were that the
community was talking now about machine
learning attacks what's a machine
learning attack the careful injection
into a learning system in a sleuthy
manner potentially of data that will
tend to build a classifier that will do
the wrong thing in certain cases so that
just gives you a sense or a taste for
the very different kinds of
opportunities that are being presented
by the systems we're building now we
often think about security in classical
ways with verification models and
encryption and so on and these
techniques often will blow up will apply
but we have to be very careful as we
build these systems that were taking
that we're covering all ground and we're
thinking through possibilities and and
on the flip side of that how can the use
of machine learning enhance security
analysts ability to catch malicious
hackers yeah it's a great follow-on
question because it's a it's a yes yes I
mean that this
look I mean I they we have to be
cautious because the human beings and
humans plus machines can be very
creative and how they attack so there's
a long tail of possibilities we have to
sort of account for but there are some
very very promising angles with the use
of artificial intelligence machine
learning to detect anomalous patterns of
various kinds with low false positive
rates that's one of the goals is to do
this well well you don't call everything
strange because people are always doing
different things that are safe but that
seem to be different over time and might
seem like a fraudulent event for example
so I think there's lots of promise I
know that I'm very excited about some
recent projects that I reviewed at
Microsoft Research in this space so I
think it's an exciting direction indeed
speaking of someone who before I was at
Carnegie Mellon I was at a internet
search engine this is an area where I
would claim that internet search
companies a well ahead of what you're
seeing at me and the public says the
sector there are some very good
technologies out there for doing machine
learning versus machine learning warfare
if you like so it's an exciting area
which I would like to see grow in this
area on the bright side
in a recent DARPA challenge that
challenge was about us using artificial
intelligence to discover vulnerabilities
autonomously and using machine learning
in other systems which sounds like a
kind of frightening thing but a it is
actually important for our national
defense that we have these capabilities
be that is one of the ways in which we
keep ourselves safe is by having our own
ai's trying to break into our own
systems so this is another area which
just wasn't there two years ago Carnegie
Mellon University of Michigan and plenty
other major computer science
universities are heavily involved now
in using a eyes to both try to break and
warned us about breakages in our own
computer security systems is very
quickly here because I'm out of time but
could you build a little bit on your
written testimony about how the United
States can win the AI talent war in
other words what are the best ways to
sustain enough AI talent at universities
conduct to conduct basic research and
drive innovation
also filling what is a growing demand
for AI jobs in the private sector so I
think this begins in middle school and
even the US government can really help
here if we just help kids in middle
school understand that one of the most
important and interesting things they
can be doing with their lives right now
is to learn mathematics so that they can
be building these kinds of robots and
systems in the future this is something
which needs training it's not that you
need to be a genius you need to be
trained in math from about the age of
thirteen or fourteen onwards understand
that that is even cooler is a career
move than going to work in Hollywood
once once we've got the kids minds in
the right place we can bring them
through the university system scale that
up and then we'll be in good shape what
I don't want to do is keep us in our
current situation where the talent
crunch is being dealt with by this
massive bidding war for this small
amount of talent because that's not
sustainable when the other continents
are doing such a good job of producing
experts and I think one thing that's
really important is that we can continue
to attract the best AI researchers in
the world by having an open basic
research community that just draws
everyone in it's been working and I
think that we can grow that and
strengthen that community thank you
thank you mr. chairman Thank You
chairman Thune senator days Thank You
mr. chairman thank you for holding this
hearing today very timely before I came
to the Senate I used to have a
legitimate day job in the technology
sector for about a dozen years and our
company had several patents for AI
design we want a national war for AI
innovation that was back in the early
2000 so we're not talking about
something that's new it's been around
for quite some time in the Senate we
often talk about what we need to do to
ensure the u.s. maintains leadership
looking at global competitiveness and
innovation technology whether it's
broadband smart cities medical research
so I'd like to start a question with mr.
Brockman could you expand in your
testimony about
other countries are doing in terms of
encouraging AI and follow on their
review what what do you see some of the
competitive disadvantages that we face
right now in our country as relates to
ensuring that we B maintain leadership
in this important area so so in other
countries I think there's there's a mix
and so that for example you see
companies like China's Baidu
who I you know want to scale up their
investment in this field and the way
that they've been doing it is that
they've actually opened a us-based
research institution and have joined our
research community our publishing and
kind of following our lead with South
Korea I think that I you know sort of
around the same time as the as the
alphago match that they announced that
they were going to make this
billion-dollar investment into AI and in
Canada recently has has been talking
about that they're starting to increase
their their national funding and so that
that's the flavor that you're seeing
both companies and the government's
stepping up their investments in trying
to find because I think everyone sees
there's so much activity happening and I
I'm sorry actually missed the second
part of the question well just look at
what what do you see some of the
headwinds relates to create competitive
disadvantage for our country so I mean I
think that the thing we should be aware
of and so there's a stat mentioned about
the number of papers that are published
and I think that that's actually um it's
it's a true fact but it's not
necessarily the most important fact the
most important fact is where do the
fundamental breakthroughs come from
because the thing that happens is if you
are the one who creates the sort of
underlying technology it's like it's
like discovering electricity you're the
one who understands everything that went
into that that the papers that get
published that those are in your
language and that you really get to set
the culture for help people build on top
of it that you control it you sort of
you know you're probably the one who
publish the underlying code that people
are using and so I think that the thing
that we need to watch is the question of
for the paper for the actual fundamental
advances the the capabilities that we
just did not have before but that we
have now where do those come from and I
and as long as that's us then I think
we're in really good shape and so I
think that we need to continue to make
sure that that's the case I want to go
back to the point that was brought up
earlier on the cyber threat in 28 years
in the private sector I never received a
letter from the human resource
department
that said that my information been
hacked until I became a federal employee
selected the US Congress and I like
millions of other federal employees got
a letter from OPM talking about the fact
that my information been hacked I spent
a lot of time working and chatting with
some of these very innovative smaller
tech companies they're doing some
amazing things it relates to advancing
at the speed of business relates to
protecting our assets I am concerned you
mentioned the fact that that the federal
government can can lag is not always
leading in that area and I know it's
frustrating because we have solutions
here we can't sometimes penetrate our
own firewall figuratively speaking
relates to trying to get you stood in
front here to get our government to move
at the speed of business because I know
when we when I was in the cloud
computing business we always wanted to
make sure you were never on the front
page The Wall Street Journal because of
a hack what that does to valuation
companies it's been very obviously the
last few years
so what do we need to do to ensure that
the the best technology is it's moving
so fast right now is in the hands of our
best people in the federal government
this is not a critique on the people
working federal government this is
oftentimes the barriers we look up here
to ensure that we're protecting our
national assets we'd like to answer that
one so if I may so I've actually been
extremely impressed with the work that
the USDA and OSTP have been doing to to
solve problems like this to start
injecting some of I think it really
starts with getting the best
technologists in the door and then
secondly giving them the power and
empowering them to to make changes
within within the federal government and
so I think that it really starts with
the people making sure that we're
attracting them and making sure that the
structures within government exist and
and I think that as long as there's an
attitude that's receptive within the
agencies or wherever you want to upgrade
I think that that's the the best way to
get to get this to happen I'd like to
jump in there also I think one of the
key things is for the government to be
at the forefront or at least
participating in the forefront of
technology there has to be an active
interchange in what I would call a
vibrant ecosystem that includes multiple
kinds of institutions and I'm very happy
to say in the AI and space arena there's
a large amount of interplay between the
commercial sector between the government
sector between small companies it seems
every week there's another company being
started up to do real-time space imaging
of the earth for business intelligence I
think that all of this is indicative
that there's a good structure with this
interchange of information and I think
that's the key to making sure that the
government stays in the right location
and able to understand and be smart and
how it uses this technology all right
thank you I'm out of time Thank You mr.
chairman Thank You senator Danes I'd
like to thank each of our wedding
witnesses for coming to this hearing
which I think was informative and
productive and and will be just the
beginning of what I expect to be an
ongoing conversation about how to deal
with both the challenges and
opportunities that artificial
intelligence presents the hearing record
will remain open for two weeks during
this time senators are asked to submit
any questions they might have for the
record and upon receipt the witnesses
are requested to submit their written
answers to the committee as soon as
possible thank you again to the
witnesses and this hearing is adjourned
thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
