everybody that there's also plenty of
room for seating in hall C so if you're
struggling to find a seat there's plenty
of room there okay so I'm delighted to
introduce Brennan Frei Brennan is a
professor at the University of Toronto
with appointments in both engineering
and medicine he's made fundamental
contributions in both machine learning
and genomics so during his PhD with
geoff hinton he co invented the
wake-sleep algorithm which is a
precursor to the variational
autoencoders and Gans that we know and
love today he's also made seminal
contributions to message passing in
factor graphs and he's also the inventor
of affinity propagation which is a
clustering algorithm widely used in the
sciences for data analysis for the last
ten years or so Brendon has turn his
attention to biology and has pioneered
the use of deep learning to understand
the genome he has had a series of plain
papers in science in nature and recently
he founded the company G deep genomics
with the goal of turning these
breakthroughs into practical healthcare
solutions please welcome Brennan
good morning everyone and thanks to the
organizers for inviting me and right off
the bat I'd like to say thank you to all
my colleagues and collaborators and my
team at deep genomics which has made all
of this work that I'll be talking about
today possible so what I'm going to talk
about is the future of medicine and what
I believe is that AI is going to
completely change medicine and also
without artificial intelligence medicine
is going to completely fail and I'll
present some results to show you kind of
what's going on and why I believe this
is the case so first of all I'm going to
show a picture of myself because people
at the back probably can't see me so for
those of you at the back that's what I
look like and now I'm going to tell you
a personal story about 15 years ago my
wife at the time and I found out that
the she was pregnant and we found out
the baby she was carrying had a genetic
problem we went to see a genetic
counselor and the genetic counselor said
essentially it could be nothing
don't worry or it could be a disaster
and as you can imagine a very difficult
time for us emotionally and and also in
terms of trying to make decisions and
what I took out of that experience was
really two things first of all this
wonderful appreciation for machine
learning and deep learning I had learned
by working with Jeff Hinson I should put
those skills to to use to solve a bigger
problem than to talk detecting cats and
YouTube videos and obviously the problem
in front of me was medicine the second
thing I learned is is the the potential
for machine learning and deep learning
to really make a difference the human
genome had just been sequenced at a cost
of about a billion dollars but that cost
has come down and and so here was this
data file that you could download and
look
and people really didn't understand what
it meant or how it works but I thought
that was a good idea for a research
problem to apply machine learning to so
I'm gonna tell you another story this is
a personal story about a little girl
called Nora
her name's Nora and she has a disease
called spinal muscular atrophy she's
three years old she's very fortunate to
be alive most children with spinal
muscular atrophy died was in the first
year or two of life it's the leading
cause of infant mortality in North
America what's interesting about this
disease is it has a very simple genetic
basis it's also interesting that it took
so long to try to figure out a cure and
I'm gonna talk about that later on it's
a really nice end to that story so some
statistics sixty-five percent of the
people in this room or if you think
about your loved ones and friends 65
percent of you in your lifetime will
have a genetic a disease with a genetic
basis so it doesn't mean it's just a
simple genetic disease could be complex
like diabetes but there's a genetic
basis to that disease 65 percent if we
look at babies eight million births per
year will have a serious the baby will
have a serious genetic defect serious
one and if we just look at the US
healthcare system for lifetime cost of
such a baby on average is five million
dollars per baby so these are some of
the numbers letting you slide out the
obvious emotional component to this
these are some of the numbers that give
you a sense of the weight of what's
going on here let's compare this to
other markets if we look at just the US
and Europe the health care budget last
year was seven trillion dollars the
global are comparing that to the global
IT market that's three point seven
trillion and if you combine Apple Amazon
Google and Microsoft their revenue last
year was 0.53 trillion so it puts these
costs in perspective when comparing them
with some of these other companies I
mentioned pharmaceuticals before so this
is a very important story
these are recent results and on your on
the x-axis here you're seeing here so
1990 to 2020 on the y-axis you're seeing
the internal rate of return the way to
interpret that number is if you're going
to invest money in a pharmaceutical
company so this we're looking at the
pharmaceutical companies here versus put
your money in the bank and think about
getting interest you can compare the
internal rate of return to how much
you'd get if you just put money in the
bank and you can see how the plot looks
it's pretty devastating going from a
high value of around 30% in 1990 and
around 2012 it actually dropped below
the bank rate so it retrospectively it
looks like in 2012 you would have been
better off to put your money into the
into a bank into the bank then put into
a pharmaceutical company and in 2020
it's expected to drop to zero it's
better to stuff your money on your
mattress and put it into a
pharmaceutical company alright so what's
the problem and this is the problem I
confronted in 2002 when I decided to
switch into this area of genomics than
genome biology it was nicely captured by
Eric Lander who's a senior
well-respected researcher in the area of
genome biology who quits in 2004 genome
bought the book hard to read so sure you
can sequence the three billion letters
three billion from your mother three
billion from your father you get the
text but but what does it mean what do
we do with that text and that's the main
problem confronting genome biology and
confronting medicine today I would argue
that's why that curve is dropping to
zero all right so here's here's what
I've been working on for the last 15
years and a whole bunch of other
researchers many of which are in the
audience here today I've been working on
as well just figuring out how to convert
the genome to actionable information so
first of all just a little bit of
information about how the genome works
just a quick very quick one-minute
tutorial on the genome three billion
letters from your mom three billion
letters from your dad the sequence
of ACG and tea essentially each gene
consists of a promoter region which
basically activates the gene there's
patterns in the promoter region signals
or words if you like that lead that gene
to be activated or expressed and then
following that promoter region there's
alternating exons and introns so the
exons Gare is shown in orange the
introns are shown in light gray so these
patterns alternate the introns are quite
long a thousand or ten thousand
nucleotides long the exons are
relatively short around a hundred
nucleotides long you can think of the
exons of the print statements if you
want to think of this as software the
exons are the print statements the exons
are the parts that end up in the protein
the introns get cut out they get removed
however the introns contain crucial
control logic so there are words
embedded in the introns that direct the
cells tell the cells how to cut and
paste these pieces so as to put these
exons together and make the gene a
little bit more biology this is a
picture that depicts the central dogma
of genome biology we go from DNA to the
sequences AC GS and T's the gene is
transcribed into RNA and then the RNA is
processed in various ways for example
those introns are cut out that's a step
that a step of processing that occurs on
the RNA and then the RNA is translated
into protein now the picture is much
more complicated than this as you might
guess biology is complicated and
multi-layered and so proteins go back
and interact with DNA in fact the
protein is what causes gene expression
to occur a protein binds to the promoter
of the DNA of the gene proteins also
interact with RNA RNA interacts with RNA
RNA interacts with proteins so you have
all of these arrows going back and forth
relating these different entities so
biology is complex and I think something
that we need to appreciate going forward
is that really biology is too complex
for any one researcher or any group of
researchers to understand
so that has implications for how we're
going to go forward and another way to
view this is that really in the last few
years our ability to measure our biology
whether it's with a Fitbit or different
technologies that allow you to measure
metabolites or your genome different
sorts of things going on inside of your
body our ability to measure our biology
and our ability to alter our biology
using things like DNA editing has far
surpassed our ability to understand
their biology so humans are kind of out
of the loop going forward all right so
let's think let's think about how we
this community here and the many
research is already working in this area
can have an impact so first of all I
want to talk about data sets right
machine learning researchers AI
researchers they like data sets so here
are a few examples of different kinds of
data in this community so in the x-axis
here was plotted the average gigabytes
for data set so how big the data set is
on the y axis the number of data sets
that you can download from the internet
of that size so targeted RNA that's the
that intermediate molecule DNA RNA
protein targeted RNA there have been
there's been a technology around for 30
years that allows you to read up a
sequence of that RNA molecule and so
people have looked at very narrowly
focused examples a particular gene or
they look at a few genes that's called a
gene panel and you can see here that
those data sets are small was a very
large number of such data sets over just
under a million data sets of that size
in the far upper right those are the
genome sequencing data sets the DNA so
that's where the entire sequence of 3
billion letters is produced that's the
data file you download and there's only
there's over a million of those data
sets you can also see RNA data sets
those are data sets where people
researchers take samples of your cells
and then look at all of the RNA
molecules
and yourselves so these are big datasets
you can download them Oh another
interesting one is over there in the
lower right 3d DNA I might have time to
talk about that later so what I'm going
to do next is tell you a little bit
about a few examples of things that
people have worked on in the community
and a couple examples from my group and
deep genomics one of the examples goes
back to 2010 this is where we use
machine learning to understand how words
embedded in introns control those print
statements splicing which puts exons
into the proteins and we were able to
use machine learning to reverse-engineer
if you like infer those code words and
how that works that that regulatory code
using datasets another recent example
and this is work by Jeff films and Bill
Nobel is this is this is a near Friedman
and the read Jeb's work is something
really neat called a Giga parallel
reporter assay so about five years ago
there was something called a mega or a
massively parallel reporting acetate
which allowed us to synthesize a hundred
thousand genes this is a nice but now
just just recently this paper was
published where over 100 million
synthetic genes were produced and so
instead of instead of trying to
understand the natural system which is
what we did in that in that nature paper
what they're doing here is just
generating artificial genes a huge
number of artificial genes and then
trying to again figure out how the
biology works another example is if you
think back to that diagram I showed you
where proteins can interact with RNA and
proteins can interact with DNA there are
data sets that allow you to measure
interactions between proteins and DNA
and understand how that works so this is
some work that my group recently
recently did where we took a data set
from Ray at Al there's two
40,000 designed sequences okay so this
is our an air DNA sequences that are
artificially designed and then for a
given protein you can see where the
protein sticks which of those sequences
is that protein liked to bind to and so
this gives you a big data matrix of
240,000 design sequences by 200 proteins
and the machine learning task here is to
learn how to take a sequence and from
the sequence predict whether the protein
will bind or not so what do we do with
that data so this is work that we
publish to Nature Biotechnology in 2015
this is a convolutional net the way it
works is we take the mini batches which
contain these these sequences that were
designed so those are fed in a
convolutional Network just sweeps
patterns or filters across those
different sequences and so for each of
the sequences we get some intermediate
representation just as in a standard
called convolutional network that would
you that you would use for computer
vision that intermediate representation
is then fed into different layers of
convolution and pooling also of course
fully connected layers which which which
produce the output and then the output
is compared to the measurement the stuff
I just showed you there and that big
matrix and then back propagation is used
to update the parameters so why why I'm
showing you this is to show you that
really it's a fairly simple machine
learning problem given the data sets
given properly processed data sets and
organized data sets you can have a big
impact in this field one of the
challenges is figuring out the right
metric and so here we're comparing the
measured binding affinity how much that
protein actually sticks to the sequence
to the output of the neural network and
what is the right cost function for
producing a neural network that is
useful in practice and that's one of the
things that my colleagues here explored
is different kinds of cost functions so
what would we do with this neural net
right if you downloaded one of these
data sets and trained in neural network
what would you do with it
so here's an example that shows you how
you can use that model that I just
showed you to identify pathological
mutations and even figure out how to
possibly fix them so down on the lower
left what you're seeing is a sequence
from the cholesterol gene ldlr this is
it from the promoter of that gene and
the sequence was fed into that model I
just showed you that it was trained to
predict binding affinity of proteins so
the sequence was fed into that model and
then the output of the neural network
which tells you its prediction for how
strongly the protein will bind to the
sequence is shown using the heights of
these of these letters okay so you see
the letters atcg and the height of the
letter corresponds to the output of the
neural network so then what we did is we
artificially in silico looked at every
possible mutation in the promoter so for
each nucleotide say the nucleotide had a
value of a we would switch it to G C and
T and for each of those possibilities
we'd run the entire promoter through our
neural network and look at the output of
the neural network so now we can see for
each of those possible mutations how
much the mutation changes the output
that is how much our neural network
predicts that that mutation will disrupt
protein binding and turns out protein
binding correctly or incorrectly is
crucial for health so that's what the
white box down below shows you alright
so for each of the letters a C G and T
there's a color code where pink or
bright red in the case of positive
mutation so that's a mutation that will
cause the protein to bind more strongly
and the blue indicates a negative
mutation where the protein will will
bind more weakly alright and the rows
are or you can see the key on the far
left the rows are organized as a cg or t
so if the if this sequence has a G in it
and then you look at the row
corresponding to G it's just white
that's because you have made a mutation
you change the G to a G so there's no
change in the output of the neural
network
on the other hand if you look at an
example where the the the original
promoter has a tea and look at that
column you'll see switching it from tea
two different letters house it has a big
impact there we go so if we look at this
example here this letter T this is in
the in the naturally occurring promoter
there's a tea at this location if it's
mutated to a see there's a large drop in
the binding affinity of that protein if
it's mutated to a G there's a strong
increase in the binding affinity of that
protein so now what do we do with this
map we can compare it to no one results
and these are mutations that are in a
database of carefully curated mutations
corresponding to diseases involving
cholesterol levels and you can see first
of all there's good agreement if you
compare the yellow dots which is the
known disease mutations to our map
mutation map if you like of these
mutations there's good agreement and
then you also see that in some cases our
model makes predictions that have not
been seen before in the clinic and so if
we look for example in this column here
where the naturally occurring letter is
a see our model predicts if it's mutated
to an A we'll see a big drop in the
level of protein binding another example
this is the example from from films and
and Noble and this one is for figuring
out the 3d structure or the contact the
chromatin interaction structure I should
say of DNA so DNA is wrapped up into
chromatin and what's important for
transcription in this process of gene
expression is a structure of this
chromatin for example the chromatin can
touch itself and that can help enhance
gene expression and so the data which is
shown at the bottom here can be viewed
as they they it's sort of a matrix form
so if you look over here different
locations here are different nucleotides
in the DNA sequence wrapped up in the
chromatin and then what this map tells
you is if you compare two locations how
strongly they like to interact so if two
parts of the
they are brought together like that then
you get a bright a bright dot here
indicating this contact okay so that's
how the data is expressed and this is
experimentally measured and then what
these researchers did is they trained a
multi layer convolutional network to
take as input the raw DNA sequence and
also a signal called chromatin
accessibility which just basically tells
you how available the DNA is and so is
it unwrapped or does it tend to be
bundled up into the chromatin and not
available
so they took those two tracks one is
just the raw sequence of DNA the other
one is this exposure or DNA
accessibility track and they've they fed
in you get two pieces of information one
piece of information for this part of
the DNA another ones for this part to
get the two sequences the two chromatin
accessibility tracks those are fed into
the convolutional neural net needs two
different two different channels here
the upper channel and the lower channel
there's different layers of convolution
and pooling and then they're brought
together in the final few stages which
involve fully connected or dense layers
deep or dense here and then the output
of that system is predicting the
probability of contact and so again
since bringing these two pieces of DNA
together and having them touch is
crucial for gene expression if a
mutation disrupts this process on the
neural network and predict that the
mutation will disrupt this process we
can use it to identify pathological
mutations so those are just a few
examples and now what I want to do is
spend the rest of the of my talk
discussing what I'm most excited about
right now which is my spin-out company
deep genomics and what we're doing at
deep genomics so the the story I gave
you before about my personal situation
really is what inspired me to work in
this field and over the past 15 years
from 2002 until 2017 we published a
bunch of papers and nature and science
and cells so all the basic research went
well but in 2015 my colleagues and I
realized that the machine learning
systems that we'd come up with were
accurate enough that we could actually
analyzed clinical mutations and identify
mechanisms that had never had never been
seen before so we realized there's an
opportunity to really change the lives
of patients and so at that point in time
we decided to spin out deep genomics so
the goal of deep genomics is to build an
AI platform for detecting and treating
genetic disease so this picture here
kind of shows you the different steps
and going from patient mutations to
helping people and for the first year or
two we spent a lot of time on developing
genome processing tools so these will be
tools that allow you these will be tools
that allow you for example to identify
mutations there's just an announcement I
think yesterday or today Google
announced the release of deep variant so
that's a deep learning technique that
allows you to identify mutations very
accurately start with an example of a
genome processing tool deep genomics we
produce our own toolkit we call it
genome kit and it's about twenty to
eight hundred times faster than some of
the publicly available tools like Hale
and Sam tools things like that however
that's really just the first step right
being able to read out of Persons
mutations that's great but we're back to
that old problem that Eric Lander posed
which is okay so what do we do with that
so really that's two bigger elephants in
the room or the middle one which is
taking those mutations and figuring out
what is the mechanism what's the disease
mechanism is it pathological or is it a
mutation that just simply changes hair
color or eye color and then the third
one of course is actually helping
patients so how do we make a difference
to patients we need therapies or we need
to change behavior so you lead healthier
lives and that's the toughest one of
course for a variety of reasons so we're
going to come back to that spin route or
the spinal muscular atrophy example and
so the really exciting and good news is
that
researchers believe we may have a cure
for spinal muscular atrophy a clinical
trial was run just over a year ago and
was terminated early last December
December of 2016 because the efficacy of
the drug was so high for the children in
the trial that have determined it would
be unethical to continue to give the
other children placebo the ones that
were receiving placebo so was terminated
early and the the FDA approved the drug
very rapidly within within a couple
months and again within a couple months
of that Europe approved the drug which
is unusual you don't see drugs approved
so quickly in Europe compared to the
United States for various reasons so
this is exceptional within two months is
approved in Europe so I'm actually going
to show you some of the details of how
this drug works it's a really exciting
example to look at and it's an example
of what I call a digital medicine so
that's what's really cool for this
audience so we have the genome right
it's digital you can download it and it
turns out there's this whole world of
digital medicines okay so it's not like
squishy cartoon diagrams showing this
interacting with this the medicine is
specified digitally it's synthesized
digitally so we've got like a digital
genome of digital mutations we've got to
fix this digital it's a really good
opportunity for people who like to think
about information that way so coming
back to to spinal muscular atrophy the
cause of this disease is a bit
complicated but you can boil it down to
a mutation in one of the exons so I told
you before about introns and exons
they're alternating so one of the exons
in a gene called SMA spinal muscular
atrophy has a mutation shown here so a C
is mutated to a T and that mutation
causes splicing to go wrong that is this
exelon which was supposed to be put into
the protein is skipped it's not included
in the protein that's what this mutation
causes to happen how does the medicine
work well you might think that the
medicine would target that particular
mutation I'm sure a lot
you have heard of gene editing CRISPR
cast nine and the thing that pops into
your mind right away is oh yeah we can
just edit the mutation but not so CRISPR
cast nine has been referred to by some
of the senior researchers in the field
as something that's more of a DNA damage
repair type of process rather than
thinking about it as a process where you
can pinpoint a mutation and fix it it's
a lot more loosey-goosey than that first
of all it's hard to pinpoint a mutation
and fix it and second of all it has off
target effect so that means it'll make
all sorts of changes all over the place
and Jennifer Liz Garden is a leader in
this field has been working on
techniques for for predicting those off
target effects alright so so we can't
just fix the mutation and in fact this
pin R as a drug doesn't doesn't just fix
the mutation what it does is it
modulates the DNA way down here so on
the other side of the exon the next
intron in fact so again this is not even
the protein coding part this is the
intron the medicine binds matches up to
that sequence binds to it and causes
that exon to be included that's how the
medicine works now it's also neat about
this medicine so there's really two
interesting things apart about it first
of all it's digital so the way it works
is there's a reverse complement sequence
here so G's and C's get paired t's and
a's get paired and so literally the
medicine is a nucleotide sequence it's
synthesized nucleotide by the nucleotide
you get a vial with a whole bunch of
those molecules in the vial and those
get inducted into the spinal cord of the
the cerebrospinal fluid of the patient
and it's just a reverse complement
sequence to that intronic sequence
that's that's the that's the way you
design the the drug the other
interesting aspect to this drug is its
binding in the intron so it's not
directly changing that mutation it's
altering the control logic but I
mentioned before these words if you like
that are embedded in the introns that
control whether the exon will be
included or not so that's a great
opportunity for us this this digital
aspect of of what's going on so let's
look at the timeline for the development
of screen
it's been razza this drug is very
effective that saved hundreds of lives
already and it costs $750,000 per baby
per year so this is a problem right this
is this is a big a big issue the cost of
the drug we can't keep making drugs that
cost this much so let's see why I cost
that much and if you look at the
timeline for the development of spin
razza it was first started around 2000
there were there were several failed
compounds and initial drugs that were
tested over the next eight years until
around 2008 the drug that turned out to
work well we've been tested for the next
few years and then in 2012 clinical
trials were started and so the goal of
deep genomics is to use these machine
learning models we talked about earlier
to accelerate that first piece of
research from eight years down to a
couple years and then furthermore we're
also going to use artificial
intelligence to accelerate clinical
trials toxicity studies and other
aspects of drug development so the whole
idea is reduce the amount of time needed
to develop the drug so how are we going
to do that I can't tell you that the the
minut details but I can give you a high
level picture and it turns out the drug
development is not that complex to
understand you've got patient genetic
data that's what you start with clinical
mutations then you need to find what is
the disease mechanism so in the case of
spinal muscular atrophy the mechanism is
that the exon is skips then the next
thing you need to do is figure out a
mechanism of action how are you going to
remediate that problem so in the case of
spinal muscular atrophy we want the axon
to be included sometimes it's not that
simple
sometimes the mutation will cause the
protein to to go wrong and the way to
fix it is to not try to correct that
protein but to introduce some other
protein that can compensate for it so
increase the expression level for
example of another protein so the
mechanism of the disease
and the mechanism of action of a
potential drug may not be the inverse of
one another
so that's your mechanism of action for
your compound the next step is to design
a drug now that's really cool the idea
of designing a drug small molecule drugs
which is bulk of pharmaceutical industry
today essentially consists of a giant
library of compounds a hundred thousand
or a million compounds and when you have
what's called a target which is crudely
speaking a protein or a pathway or
something you're trying to change you
just screen those compounds against that
protein or that pathway until you find
one that works with digital medicines we
can take a very different approach if we
know what the the mechanism of action is
that we're trying to achieve and we have
machine learning systems like the ones I
just talked about that allow us to
simulate the effects of modifying DNA or
modifying RNA we can in silico
essentially design the compound that
we'd like to test
so that's figuring out compounds now the
machine learnings not going work
perfectly of course and in the case of
spin razza for example a deep genomics
we retrospectively looked at spin rasa
we in silico evaluated 200 compounds 200
of these genetic medicines I showed you
randoms to our machine learning systems
and scored score these 200 compounds and
the actual spin rouser drug was the
third from the top so we were pretty
close so a purely experimental technique
would require experimentally testing all
200 compounds ours put the actual drug
in the top three and it could be that
the top two are actually more effective
than the spin rouser drug so now what so
I talked about starting with the patient
data identifying the disease mechanism
identifying how you're going to
remediate that mechanism the next thing
you need to do is test it in the wet lab
to experiment the work to see if it
actually alters cells in the way and the
way that you predict that it will alter
cells and I'll talk more about that in
just a moment the next thing is is
what's called toxicity or off-target
effects so does that compound going to
cause something else nasty to occur
right is going to change some other part
of the genome have some unintended
consequence so that's the next step in
this drug development process is
toxicity and then the next step is
clinical trials and in the case of
clinical trials one of the biggest
problems facing pharmaceutical companies
today is patient stratification which
just means that an intended patient
group for a particular indication
actually consists of a whole bunch of
patient subgroups each of which is going
to respond quite differently to the drug
and so if you can more precisely
pinpoint those facials those patient
subgroups and evaluate them separately
you may be able to achieve higher
efficacy and that sort of gets into the
area of personalized medicine the next
thing you do is is after running these
clinical trials of course marketing and
distribution and all that now all of
that costs a heck of a lot of money if
you're making drugs that don't really
work very well and have a lot of nasty
side effects you need to do a lot of
marketing to convince people that they
should buy these drugs or significance
insurance companies to pay for them and
you need to have large legal teams to
deal with all the litigation that's
going to to follow let's come back to
spinal muscular atrophy and spin razza
they don't need any marketing at all
it's it was highly effective an 82 out
of 120 kids in the clinical trial we
don't normally see that kind of efficacy
I'll say for a cholesterol drug so so if
we can do a really good job of designing
medicines that work very well then we
also can save a whole bunch of money on
marketing things that don't work and
also on on litigation all right so
that's basically it so those are the
steps and the question is how can we use
AI and machine learning to accelerate
each and every one of those steps reduce
costs make them make it faster make it
more accurate so a deep genomics we're
using our machine learning systems to
design compounds as I mentioned before
and we're also testing them in our wet
lab so this is not just an AI company
we're synthesizing compounds we're
testing them and cell in human cells
seeing if they work and we'll be going
further with them as well one thing I
wanted to mention is an exciting
opportunity just as cloud computing has
rapidly accelerated our ability to build
and train machine learning models among
other things there's something called a
cloud laboratory which we've used at
deep genomics a cloud lab what happens
is we upload a Python script
I'm not kidding it's literally a Python
script we upload the Python script to
say transcript to transcript tick or
emerald this is a picture of emerald and
once that Python script is uploaded it
specifies the experimental protocol and
then robots go and conduct the
experiments that's the interface the
Python script so these labs are just
come into existence in the last few
years there's a lot of kinks that need
to be worked out but they offer the
opportunity to rapidly scale up our
ability to do experimental work test
compounds and of course solve other
problems so in the next five minutes or
so I just want to talk about a few
issues that pertain to this community
people working in the area of artificial
intelligence and machine learning one of
the things that's very important in
medicine is earning the trust of the
stakeholders stakeholders are the
patient the physician treating the
patient the insurance company who may be
paying for the treatment different
technology providers and the hospitals
and in machine learning we're often
criticized for producing black boxes
right that aren't open to interpretation
and that's considered to be an issue
with respect to gaining the trust of
stakeholders I actually think that's a
red herring I think that yes we need to
get the trust of the stakeholders but
the way to do that is to figure out
exactly what it is they need in order to
gain the trust so for example if we have
an automated system that's just a heck
of a lot more accurate than humans then
over time maybe it'll just be a few
years we will gain trust if we come back
to detecting disease mutations that are
pathogenic for example the deep genomic
system for a certain class of mutations
achieves 95 percent accuracy when
compared to lead
pathologist's in the field whereas a few
send your sample your genetic sample to
two different clinics they will agree
only between 50% and 75% of the time
so human accuracy is maybe not what many
people think it is so that's one aspect
is with accuracy but there is something
to explaining how the system works right
and there are different ways they can do
that one way of coming up with
explanations for the conclusion that the
system comes to say recommending a
double mastectomy is to have a system
that actually pinpoints the biology of
what's going on so instead of just
outputting double mastectomy the system
says you have a mutation in bracket1 and
that mutation is going to cause splicing
to go wrong that's going to lead to a
malfunctioning protein and that
malfunctioning protein has been shown to
lead to breast cancer with a certain
probability so having those intermediate
steps is important and that's the whole
approach that I'm a proponent of another
one is to have machine learning systems
of literally output an explanation in
the form of English language so that's
relevant to things that people have been
working on in this community on capture
generation here's an image generate a a
caption that corresponds to that image
and and I guess the idea there is if
you're trying to convince a particular
stakeholder so a medical doctor is
something why not output an explanation
that's perfectly suited to that
stakeholder another deep dreams this is
mentioned last night
and there was a display last night of
deep deep art so the idea there is you
have a supervisor neural network that
takes an image as the input and then
outputs a class label for dog or
something like that and then you take
any image and then you just modify the
image like iteratively update the pixels
so look it gets more it's classified
more likely to be a dog and so I gives
you these wild psychedelic images the
reason I'm showing you this is this is
exactly what we do not want in medicine
so this this would be a disaster right
you modify the DNA until you get some
sort of horrendous
and implausible actually a sequence of
genetic code and so the answer here is
probably generative models models that
are able to also tell you what's not
plausible right what you don't want in
the input so a model the actual
distribution of the input not just that
the class label the other thing I wanted
to comment on is the the recent exciting
results from deep mind on game playing
different kinds of game playing so
alphago that kind of thing so what's
different between that and biology well
first of all in biology we don't know
the rules
whereas in go you do know the rules yeah
the universe is not fully observed in
ecology it's mostly not observed unlike
the game of Go where you see the board
and the universe is fully observed and
the other interesting aspect that
confronts us in working for working on
machine learning for genomics and
medicine is that humans are good at
things like playing games we invented
them humans are good at computer vision
we evolved to solve vision problems over
millions of years humans are good at
language we invented it but medicine
biology we're not good at it so we need
some kind of a superhuman AI to deal
with that problem and the last thing
I'll say before we move to two questions
is I just want to tell you what we're
working on now at deep genomics and what
we're going to figure out in the next
few years so the primary thing we're
working on is project Saturn the idea is
to use our machine learning systems to
scan a vast space above 69 billion
molecules all in silico identify about a
thousand compounds as we call active
compounds these are compounds that allow
us to manipulate cell biology think
about it as a thousand control knobs
that we can turn and twist to adjust
what's going inside on inside of cells a
toolkit for therapeutic development and
we'll have three compounds and clinical
trials within the next three years thank
you
okay so we have plenty of time for
questions so please come up to the
microphones Brendan thank you very much
it was absolutely fascinating talk so I
know nothing about genomics but I would
like to ask equation as a information
theorist and machine learning scientist
so you mentioned there are six billion
elements or symbols from the alphabet of
four which makes it 12 Giga bits which
is about 1.5 gigabytes of data so the
nips 2017 total proceedings in PDFs
about 800 800 megabytes odds so genome
is just twice the size of the niche 2017
proceedings and it encodes like
everything about human body were you
know brain and ever it's really hard to
believe that that's information content
is enough to encode so much so my
question is more about coverage like you
were addressing the issues of kind of
accuracy so I would ask a question about
coverage like can we address all the
diseases by modifying genome or there is
something besides genome like RNA is
proteins which also have to be kind of
treated in some way in order to address
the other diseases yeah so that's a good
question
so one thing I would say about the
proceedings as well as the genome is of
course you shouldn't just look at the
length you should compress so the
questions you take the gene the nips
receives you can press it how big is
that file and then the same thing with
genomes yeah
so the what we're assuming is that
really the the DNA the genome the text
of the genome is the primary determinant
and that's not true there are obviously
environmental factors what you eat or
different kinds of environmental factors
are important however my experience is
that a lot of people who try to account
for everything all at once
come up with kind of a tangled web of
correlations and it's really hard to
figure out what action to take we
definitely know that the DNA sequence is
a primary determinant of many of your
characteristics it's the cause is the
cause of many of your characteristics so
from my perspective it's a really good
thing to start with and for now we're
just kind of ignoring the other things
and just in saying well the first order
the genome is going to be the primary
determinant thank you yeah so this
question actually follows up with a
previous one
obviously genetics is one major part of
someone's disease profile there's also
nurture as well as nature there's
factors that come from one's environment
they just mentioned a moment ago
are you planning to incorporate
something like metabolomics as a way to
look at the environmental factors as
well as the gut microbiome so the
questions about the microbiome
for instance or about the whole
environmental issues so one would be out
with have a little mix to look at the
invite
so so genomics is one kind of data I
mentioned RNAi day at a protein data
metabolomics is another great source of
data and all sorts of just personal
information even things you can measure
from your Fitbit right all of that is
really good information I think the
challenge for us though is to come up
with causal models so correlative models
can it can this assess risk but they
don't allow intervention to figure out
what you should change to change the
consequences right so so I think coming
up with causal models is really really
important so you described on very large
data steps of genomics and proteins and
such and also the explain things in
natural language to explain to humans
where do you get the data or the
training methods for that aspect of it
you have ideas where do we get the
training methods for that for natcher if
you're planning to do natural language
explanation in the end oh yeah yeah a
good question so at this point in time I
don't know so the approach we're taking
right now is more to think about what a
what kind of data
pathologist or a physician would look at
to be convinced and then train the
machine learning systems to output that
kind of data and they're interesting
questions like online learning right so
the system can have some data get
trained up and then make a prediction
that can be compared against some new
data and then fed back into the machine
learning system yeah at this point of
time we're not actually a de phenomics
generating natural language
interpretation but I think that is a
good area to work on yeah so would you
agree that machine learning the wave you
are applying is really a shortcut to
scientific simulations based on some
scientific models and do you see
yourselves eventually as you gain more
insights coming up with those scientific
models and simulations to ultimately
question so so when I showed that
diagram but biology and I said biology
is really complicated what's the right
solution and I said machine learning
thanks for asking that question because
historically two other approaches have
been tried one of them is rule-based
systems that did not work out well and
the other one is molecular simulation or
where you simulate stochastic
differential equations to try to predict
what's going to happen the problem with
molecular simulation or stochastic
differential equations is that they only
work when you know exactly what's in
your test tube so there are three
molecules and you can measure or
quantify the three concentrations and
then you can write down a mathematical
model of how they're going to interact
with one another but biology is much
more complicated than that most of the
molecules we don't even know about and
we and there's a lot of biological noise
as well and so those models molecular
simulation and stochastic differential
equations break down when there are
those unknowns so I think machine
learning will will continue to be the
technology that moves like forward you
know see that as a goal worth pursuing
that you eventually want scientific
models and real scientific simulations
because machine learning all said and
done still I mean feels like
pseudoscience the machine learning can
pinpoint predictions that can be then
verified experimentally to satisfy the
curiosity of a scientist yeah
it's the last question a great dog thank
you I had one more question related to
that which is there's a big difference
between computational biology and NLP or
vision which is that you're particularly
interested in causal models which are
later to however inferring causal models
from purely observational data for
example you show a lot of DNA RNA data
sets which are purely observational and
how do you propose that we can
potentially exploit those to come up
with causal models
how do we how can we exploit what the
large amount of data which is purely
observational to come up with oh cause
the mouse right how do we go from
observational data to causal models yeah
I think sort of the same way humans do
so so we we can make inferences about
causality based on observational data
sometimes the right and sometimes
they're wrong but they at least give us
a way of exploring a hypothesis space
right so so once you've kind of narrowed
down for example if there's absolutely
no correlation except in unusual
circumstances is unlikely to be
causation so so correlation can be used
to identify some subset of hypotheses
and now the question is how do you
Whittle that down and that comes back to
this sort of online type of process I
was talking about where the machine
learning system based on observational
data to make predictions for what new
data should be gathered which would be
like causal intervention and then new
data gathered but even a call even an
experiment that's meant to identify a
causal mechanism is not guaranteed to do
so it's still actually obviously just a
new experiment with some new data and
correlation and you know major
correlation again but it's an iterative
process that if eventually whittles the
space down until you find a mechanism
that's very likely to be causal and if
you can develop a drug based on that
that works and that's enough yep okay
well thanks very much so we'll have to
just move on to the next talk so it's
thank Brendan again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
