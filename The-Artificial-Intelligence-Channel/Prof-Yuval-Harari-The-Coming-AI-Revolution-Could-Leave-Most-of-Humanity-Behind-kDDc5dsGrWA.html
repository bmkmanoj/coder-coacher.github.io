revolution estimates nearly 42 percent
of jobs are at a high risk of being
affected by automation in the next
decade or two we're gonna see more and
more things that look like science
fiction and fewer and fewer things that
look like jobs welcome to the fourth and
final installment of our series automate
this all about the future of work in an
artificially intelligent world over the
past three weeks we've explored how
machine learning technologies are
already transforming the way we live and
work from driverless trucks in Alberta
if I had to give it one word Automation
worries me to life-saving medical tools
my treatment was considerably changed as
a result of these technologies even
computer programs that can edit videos
in real time you could take ten minutes
of audio from someone put it into this
machine and then you can type words and
it will speak them in a way that you
literally cannot tell if that person did
not say those things the programs in
development today are already learning
how to perform tasks that once seemed
like the exclusive domain of humans we
made experiments to try to answer the
question can people make the difference
between an original peacefulness SEO
panel prompts and a piece generated by a
machine and then we find that people
can't really make the difference and
there's no reason to believe the
technology will stop there the advances
in the last even five years have been
startling if the technology continues to
progress at its current rate artificial
intelligence has the potential to
radically change not just our careers
but our entire way of life and we are
already starting to feel the political
implications of those changes counties
that had more routine work were more
likely to vote for Trump than they had
been to vote for Mitt Romney you look at
Vladimir Putin who just a couple of
weeks ago put out probably the most
honest thing I think I've ever heard him
say which was whoever controls
artificial intelligence in the future
controls the world and the reason he
knows that is because once you control
that when you control what it is capable
of doing you can control anything it is
hard to fully imagine what an
artificially intelligent world would
actually look like let alone to plan for
one but my next
has laid out one possible blueprint of
what's ahead doctor you've all NOAA
Harare is a lecturer in history at the
hebrew university of jerusalem and the
author of the acclaimed books sapiens
and Homo deus a brief history of
tomorrow
he's documented the many ways that the
technologies of the 21st century could
fundamentally transform human society
and how those projects could lead us or
I dr. Harare is in Tel Aviv dr. Ari good
morning welcome to day 6 good morning
pleasure to be here you're predicting
the possible rise of what you call the
useless class who are they well just as
the Industrial Revolution in the 19th
century created the urban working class
so in the 21st century we might see the
creation of the un-- working class of
the useless class people who just have
no economic value because they can't do
anything better than an AI or a robot
and therefore also they don't have much
political power can you imagine what the
lives would be like for the people you
described as the useless class for the
people who are left behind by the
revolution there are many different
possibilities and scenarios what we need
to realize is that technology is never
deterministic the same technology can be
used to create very different kinds of
societies so like in the 20th century
you could use the technology of the
Industrial Revolution
to create a communist dictatorship or a
fascist regime or a liberal democracy
and the same is true with the rise of
artificial intelligence and robotics and
machine learning some people envision a
wonderful situation in which all the
dreary jobs are taken care of by the
machines and humans are supported
through some kind of universal basic
income scheme yes and they can devote
themselves to hobbies and out and
meditation and religion or whatever and
then there are of course the more
dystopian scenarios in which humankind
is split into a tiny all-powerful elite
and the vast underclass who is got no I
can
mcpaul no political power and whose life
is totally at the mercy of the elite so
what happens to that class won't that
class eventually turn against the elite
that controls everything the question is
whether they'll have the power we are
used to the age of the masses in which
if the lower classes are unhappy about
the political and social situation they
can stage a revolution yes but in the
age of the masses the masters could
stage a revolution because ultimately
they were vital for the economy and for
the political system even in a
dictatorship you needed millions of
people to serve as common soldiers in
the army and as common workers in the
factories and offices right so they had
real power the upper classes that the
high caste which dominates all the new
technology they won't exploit the poor
they just won't need them and it's much
more difficult to rebel against
irrelevance then against exploitation
because you're expendable I mean some
people say I'm not sure if it's drones
it's it's too early to say but some
people argue that what we saw in the
last few years with the rise of Donald
Trump and Rex it is the first new types
of revolt revolts of people who still
have some political power but of losing
their economic power and they try to do
something before it's too late and so
they're completely cut off from the
sources of power not everyone is
convinced though that computers will
overtake humans in certain tasks leading
to this dystopian idea that you're
describing creativity jobs that require
empathy and these people may still be
vital in a kind of post technological
revolution world
why are you convinced that technology is
going to make so many different fields
obsolete I'm not completely convinced
it's only a possibility nobody knows for
sure I do think that there will be new
jobs for humans I'm just not convinced
they'll be enough so you could have a I
don't know a 40 percent of the
population being employed in wonderful
and very productive new human jobs
but you still have 60% without any job
at all and that's a catastrophic yes the
other problem is that it's not enough to
just create new jobs for humans you need
to retrain people to fulfill these jobs
so let's say that you don't need taxi
drivers and you don't need textile
workers but you have amazing new jobs
creative jobs in say the arts or in
designing new wonderful computer games
the problem is that if you think about a
40 year old unemployed textile worker in
Bangladesh he or she just don't have the
skills to design virtual worlds and the
problem is worse because the AI
revolution will not be a simple
watershed event so even the new jobs
within 10 or 20 years might be automated
yes so you have to do it again and again
and this opens also a philosophical
question like because work does provide
people with the source of community and
identity with more than an income so if
we don't have work anymore will we find
purpose in our day-to-day lives will
there be a kind of existential crisis or
does that even matter I think these are
really that the biggest questions about
meaning and purpose and I'm totally
pessimistic jobs is just one way of
providing humans with meaning and
purpose children seem to live a very
fulfilled life without having any jobs
at all and humans often find meaning in
purpose you know in in games in hobbies
it's a question of how we educated you
have said that the powers of
biotechnology and computer algorithms
are far more potent than steam and the
Telegraph so so what sets these new
technologies apart from the advances of
say the Industrial Revolution which you
know was negotiated before by a
workforce well previously almost all the
technological advance was about
controlling the world outside now the
next revolution which consists of a
merger between
Infotech and biotech will enable
humankind to gain control of the world
inside us we have not seen anything like
it
for thousands of years the second big
difference is that until today the
technology always remained a tool in the
hands of humans and humans were making
the ultimate decisions what to do with
the trains what to do with the radio and
solar but now what we are going to see
is a shift in authority from humans to
algorithms more and more decisions about
what to do in the world for questions
like whom to hire even what to do in my
personal life when a person asks himself
or ourselves what should I study in
college or what should I work you will
not ask yourself or your friends or your
parents you will ask Google or Facebook
who knows you far better than anybody so
that's interesting to me because we also
are looking at Google and Facebook and
tech giant companies as being almost a
replacement for government or perhaps
even religion in that case what what is
the role that they will play how much
power will they exercise how many levers
will they pull and what will the role of
government be in the dystopia that
you're imagining first of all it's not
necessarily sopia and also it's not Mia
where the line will pass between
government and the tech giant it could
go either way either the tech giant's
actually become the government or the
government are monopolizes these kinds
of technologies and it could go in
different ways in different countries in
a place like China for example I could
imagine that the government will fulfill
the role that the big tech giants are
fulfilling in North America you have
said that figuring out how to use future
technologies wisely is the most
important question facing humanity today
do you think that the average worker in
2017 or the government's that regulate
and oversee them do you think that
they're prepared for the changes that
are coming
absolutely not what I see at least is
that the political system is loud name
ignoring this problem the AI revolution
is still hardly a blip on our political
radar and if you think for example about
it the last election in the u.s. so
there was a lot of talk about the job
market with Trump frightening voters
that
Mexicans and Chinese will take their
jobs but nobody even mentioned the idea
that actually it's the robots and
computers that will take the jobs so at
least today there is no serious
discussion in the political system about
the AI revolution and I find it very
very disconcerting
because if we don't take decisions the
free market will take the decisions on
our behalf and I don't trust the free
market to make the best decisions for
humankind doctor Harare thank you for
having this discussion with us today my
pleasure doctor you've all Hari is a
