post-launch news conference for the
spacex falcon heavy test flight I'm John
Taylor director of communications for
SpaceX joining us to provide a status on
the mission Elon Musk's SpaceX CEO and
lead designer anyone pyro so yeah really
excited about today incredibly proud of
the SpaceX team
it's an incredible job of creating
wealth it really the most advanced
rocket in the world and biggest rock in
the world
I'm still trying to blow up everything
that happened because it seems surreal
to me yeah I had this image of just a
giant explosion on the pad with you know
a tuile bouncing down the road and like
Tesla logo landing something with a thud
but fortunately that's not what happened
the mission sinks are gone really as
well as one could have hoped with the
exceptional center core yeah I was the
two side boosters if you guys are here
you saw them land that was epic that's
probably the most exciting thing I've
ever seen literally ever and and then
the the center core I obviously didn't
land on the friendship over sharing that
and I mean we really can't the issue but
I think it's it's a it didn't have
enough propellant to relight the boat
all three engines and it's right enough
force difficulty to have triethyl
aluminum for boron that's used to light
the engines so it believed that the
center one lit I believe in the outer
two did not and that was not enough to
slow the stage down apparently it hit
the water at 300 miles now and took out
two of the engines on the corner so I
forgot the footage like that sounds like
some pretty fun footage
so if if the cameras didn't get blown up
as well then we'll put that out for you
know just the blooper reel but that
that's neither yeah we weren't gonna
reuse the scent that centric or anyway
or the two side versus the side boosters
we'll figure out some place to put them
but since they're not blocked viable
version five we weren't planning on
reusing any of the course the upper
stage teams have worked perfectly so far
the two bones were executed correctly
and they will see if the upper stage
avionics survived quite an arduous trip
through the Van Allen belts normally a
stage will pass very quickly through the
Van Allen belts here it's essentially
dwelling they're forced for several
hours and then it's gonna do a restart
deplete is propellant and go to
transpose injection and the propellant
levels all look good the propellant
effortless after the second burn of the
upper stage we were only 0.3 Sigma away
from predictions so which is basically
very minor so it has plenty of
propellant to complete the transpose
injection assuming that the fuel doesn't
freeze that and the oxygen oxygen isn't
boil off and the electronics don't get
fright though those the issues we'll
find out in a few hours if that Zeppelin
is successful I think it was anything
else I know that's worth worth
mentioning um we're not I went out to
the landing zone took a look at the side
boosters they looking a really good
condition so they're they're both
reliable although as I said they're
combination of version 3 and version 4
so we will we're only gonna be reflowing
really version 5 at this point that that
launches shortly and that that'll be our
mainstay will will stick to version 5
for the Falcon
we don't expect to have a version 6 all
right any questions that I haven't
answered I'll do my best to answer them
but I'm not sure if I have information
yet but I'll try and the first question
goes to David Kerley from ABC News Ilan
spectacular what did you learn
what did Falcon Heavy teach you
I guess told me like crazy things can
come true because I could say like I
didn't really think this would work like
when I see the rocket liftoff I see like
a thousand things that that not work and
it's amazing when they do and I was
really that seeing the two boosters land
the synchronize really just like the
simulation I mean makes you think like
you they're really that could be quite a
scalable approach you know if you could
imagine large numbers of those just
coming in landing taking off landing
doing many flights per day um so I think
gives me a lot of faith for our next
architecture the sort of the
interplanetary spaceship you have
different names for it but VFR is kind
of codename and it gives me confidence
that VFR is really quite workable I
might actually look at the side boosters
and like they're pretty big in a 16
stories tall 60 foot leg span but you
really we need to be way bigger than
that so so I think it's giving me a lot
of confidence that we can make the VFR
design work
yeah it's I have tremendous confidence
obviously the SpaceX team so I think I
think we can really do this a lot you
know and keep advancing that the keep
advancing the technology to achieve full
and rapid reusability whichever whatever
profound effect on the future and when
they're saying things about say Falcon
Heavy vs Falcon 9 is the Falcon Heavy
has the same level of expandability as
Falcon 9 so if I could say the price of
 nine is sixty million dollars
Falcon heavies ninety even though it's
got three times as much capability
because in both cases the only thing
that's expanded is the upper stage we're
gonna start recovering the the fairings
the big nose cone we're gonna recover
the fat recover the boosters and so
that's really the cost of was really
between a Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy D's
minor of the next question from Marsha
Don an Associated Press March 10 EP what
were your what was going through your
mind how how amazed were you to see your
roadster up there with Starman just
cruising along with the blue planet and
how long will we be getting life use do
you think from the car well I think it
looks so ridiculous and impossible and
you can tell it's real because it looks
so fake
honestly we'd have way better CGI if it
was fake and you know the colors all
look kind of weird in space there's no
atmospheric occlusion you know you know
like everything was too crisp and but we
know we didn't really test any of those
materials for you know is its space
hardened or whatever you know so it just
has the same seats that like normal car
has it's just literally a normal car in
space which I kind of like the absurdity
of that and you feel closely there's on
the dashboard there's a tiny roadster
with a tiny spaceman
[Laughter]
Hot Wheels made a Hot Wheels roadster
and a friend a friend of mine suggested
hey when you put that Hot Wheels roads
so with a tiny spaceman on it you know
in the car too like that'd be cool sure
this image that I mean it's kind of
silly and fun but I I think I think
that's you know silly fun things are
important and normally for a new rocket
you know they'd launched like a block of
concrete or something like that I mean
that's so boring and I think that's just
the imagery of it is something that's
gonna get people excited around the
world and I still tripping me out you
know tripping balls here congratulations
Elan great launch today where do you see
the Falcon Heavy fitting into this
launch industry is this something that
is going to be for more national
security you see that's for
interplanetary missions what's the
future of Falcon Heavy yeah the great
thing is like so Falcon Heavy opens up a
new class of payload so it can launch
more than twice as much payload as any
other rock in the world so it's kind of
up to customers what they might want to
launch but it can launch things direct
to Pluto and beyond you know no stop
needed you don't even need like a
gravity assist or anything and it won't
strain satellites you can do anything
you want you go back to you could send
people back to the moon with a bunch of
all you know if you did a bunch of
motion to Falcon Heavy ended an orbital
reef refilling the two or three Falcon
Heavy Z you know would equal the payload
of a Saturn 5 but I wouldn't recommend
doing that cuz I think the new architect
should be a for architecture is the way
to go but I think it's gonna open up a
sense of possibility I think it's gonna
encourage other companies and countries
to say hey if SpaceX which is a
commercial company can do this
and nobody paid for Falcon Heavy is paid
forward and with internal funds then
then they they could go to so I think is
gonna encourage other countries and
companies to raise their sights and say
hey we can do bigger and better which is
great we want any space race races are
exciting mister most kind of talk us
through your your thought process as you
were watching the launch II you said you
were incredibly concerned about it just
you know you just wanted to clear the
pad because it kind of I said
expectations low so talk me through as
you were watching it yeah I think this
is true of anyone who's involved and
they're close to the design of something
you just you know all the ways they can
fail and and that's like the sort of
mental checklist that's scrolling
through your mind because all the things
that can can can break I mean there's
thousands of things that can go wrong
and everything has to go right once look
once the rocket lifts off there's no
there's no opportunity to do a recall or
upload a software fix or anything like
that it's like you see the passing
reason Harper sent at least for the
ascent phase yeah I've seen Rockets
Bluff so many different ways so you know
it's a big relief when it it actually
works at the first you know when they
first whoever it is like whoever's like
you know when they're like first
launched like a 747 or or dc-3 or
something like that I bet the chief
engineer was like I can't believe that
things flying
one more in the room then we'll go to
the phone
how about Irene Klotz from Aviation Week
hurry we need to have you on mic first
for the folks on the phone to hear
thanks ok um thanks Irene Klotz with
Aviation Week congratulations
the can you talk us a little bit about
what needs to happen to certify Falcon
Heavy for the national security missions
how far along you are in that process
and how many flights you might need to
do and also if you're able to say
anything about how much your SpaceX is
investment to get to the rocket to this
point
thanks I think we only need I think
there's a chance on which NASA's
national security mission that we'd need
to yeah you know how many flights
depends on which mission but we have a
number of commercial customers for
Falcon Heavy so I think I don't think
it's gonna be in any way an impediment
to acceptance of national security
missions we'll be doing several Falcon
Heavy missions flights per year so let's
say if there's a big national security
satellite that's due for launch in three
or four years and we probably have like
it doesn't or four more launches done by
then so what it won't really I don't
think there'll be a launch number that's
that's an inhibitor or national security
stuff and yeah so and then we've got the
STP mission that that's coming up which
is another test mission that'll go on
full on a where everything is on black 5
version 5 of the rocket and then we'll
be launching version 5 o´clock 5 single
stick in a couple couple months so I
think it's hopefully smooth sailing or
qualification for national security
missions our investment to date
probably a lot more than I'd like to
admit you know that we try to cancel the
Falcon Heavy program three times at
SpaceX because it's like man this is way
harder than we thought because the
initial idea was just like ah you know
you stick on to two first stages of side
boosters how I canopy
it's like way hard we had to redesign
the center core completely we have to
redesign the the grid fins because the
way it's a lot long story but if you've
got a nose cone on the end of at the end
of the booster instead of a cylinder you
lose control Authority because if you've
if you've got a cylinder you can kind of
bounce the air off of the rocket and you
get like a 30% or more increased control
Authority if you've got a cylindrical
section instead of a an ogive section at
the end of the booster so we have to
redesign the Griffons reason to control
the control system massively redesigned
the thrust structure at the base to take
way more load let's enter boosters got a
deal with over a million pounds of load
coming in combined from the side
boosters so it's as of being heavier so
that the center course basically
completely redesigning and and even the
side boosters there's a pretty large
number of parts that change and then the
launch site itself needs to change a lot
I'm guessing our total investment is
over half a billion probably more I'd
like to take some questions from the
phone I think the first one up is Dan
Fergana from BuzzFeed news is that right
that's right dan McGann with BuzzFeed
nude news could you talk a little bit
about the decision to have the two side
cores come down at the same time is that
just the way it falls out from the
physics or was that actual decision you
made we did offset them slightly but but
really they they pretty much just come
down that
that there's no we want them to offset
slightly just so the radars didn't
interfere and we actually wanted no
communication between the two stages
they've both going to point absolute
space and we're just worried that the
radar reflection of one would be seen by
the radar receiver of the other but not
just that's just kind of how it happened
it's actually meant to happen just like
that the next question on the phone
comes from Keith cowling and that's a
lot first of all congratulations you've
launched a rather unconventional payload
into space one that's generated a lot of
buzz and there's a lot of people some of
them citizen scientists some of them
they're just newbies when it comes to
tracking things and space are going to
try and track the the Tesla and
understand what's happening to it you
know like that movie dude where's my car
and other than the live webcam today
what does SpaceX going to do to interact
with this community of Tesla trackers
once the car leaves orbit do you have a
plan are you just going to kind of wait
and see what bubbles up on the internet
and react to it
um we don't have a plan no plan the
battery's gonna last about 12 hours from
launch roughly and after that it's just
gonna be out there in deep space for
maybe millions or billions of years who
knows and yeah maybe just covered by
some future alien race thinking what the
heck what what were these guys doing did
they worship with this car why do they
have a little car in the car don't
really confuse them not sure what's
gonna happen but I think you know it's
kind of a fun thing and I sure hope that
next burn works by the way yeah well
known a few hours we're gonna go back to
the room if that's okay so if he's how
about Chris Davenport from the
Washington Post wait till we got you
might
Thanks so now that you're focusing more
on the VFR I wonder if you could talk a
little bit about the timeline I know you
said it's coming along faster and then
what that means for your plans for Mars
and the moon well I don't get too
off-topic but I think we might if we get
lucky we'll be able to do short hop our
flights with the the spaceship part of
VFR maybe next year all right let's see
how about bill Harwood from CBS
thanks Ellen two really quick ones you
mentioned the the drone ship a couple of
thrusters got did the thing land on the
shipper nearby so again I want to take
like any a fish I get regarded this with
a bit of a grain of salt because I I'll
tell you the information that I have
with that interest I have may be
incorrect so
it could be whale wolf
so the the information I received was
that we hit the water at about 300 miles
an hour why Mary killed isn't it roughly
500 kilometres an hour this hard and
about a hundred metres away from the
ship so at which was enough to take out
two thrusters and shower the deck with
shrapnel well and you mentioned the burn
coming up can you give us any sense of
you know you're burning to depletion I
mean how long a burn are we talking
about and when you hope to have some
confirmation to be able to tell us that
it did or didn't work
Thanks actually I'm not I don't have to
know the number of length of burn off
hand I was just looking at the profound
residual segment which is like the key
number it's it's a decent decently long
bone maybe a minute or so and yeah
that'll be in a few hours
hopefully I actually don't have the
latest climate reform because I was just
added actually that out at the landing
zone and
have been back to launch control since
direct landing zone so I don't have the
latest information on the status of the
upper stage Tom Costello from NBC News
please right here on the front row
jacket well congratulations again I want
to follow up on Chris's question because
Chris asked you what's your timeline
potentially to go to the Moon or Mars
and you said did you say as soon as next
year can you quantify that by the night
my real question I'm just doing Chris's
water sure yeah yeah well the by hopper
tests I mean kind of like we have a
grasshopper program for falcon 9 where
we just add the rocket take take off and
land in Texas
I know Texas test site so that would be
will either do that at our South Texas
floor site near near Brownsville or or
do ship-to-ship we're not sure yet
whether ship-to-ship or brownsville but
most likely it's gonna count do I have
an NR Brownsville location because we've
got a lot of land with nobody around and
so if it blows up it's cool but by hop
attest I mean it'll you know go up you
know several miles and then come down
the ship the ship is capable of the
single-stage-to-orbit
if you feel it fully loaded the tanks so
that will do flights of increasing
complexity we want to test the heat
shield material something like you know
fly out turn around
accelerate back real hard and come in
hot to test the heat shield because we
want to have highly reusable
heat shield that's capable of absorbing
the heat from interplanetary entry
velocities so it's really tricky
potential the potential to go to the
Moon or Mars what's your timeline daya
so a lot of uncertainties on this
program but it is going to be our focus
after now that we're almost done with
with Falcon 9 and Falcon heavy
we're gonna level off as I said at block
five of version five as there won't be
any more major versions of Falcon 9 or
Falcon Heavy Dragon is also going to
level off a dragon version - they might
be like point releases you know point
five point one or Dragon two boilers
don't like that but most of our
engineering resources will be dedicated
to VFR and and so I think that that will
make things go quite quickly
the ship part is by far the hardest
because that's going to come in from
super super super orbital velocities
like into planet Mars transfer
velocities earth-moon transport velocity
these are way harder than coming in from
a little bit I mean there's there some
of the heating things that scale to the
eighth power which doesn't think relize
does anything that scales the eighth
power but turns out reentry
certain elements of reentry heating
scale to the at the 8th to the 8th so
just yeah testing that ship out is the
real tricky part the booster I think I
don't want to get you know complacent
but I think we understand reasonable
boosters reusable space ships that can
land propulsively that's that's harder
so we're starting with the hard part
first and I think it's conceivable that
we do our first test flight in 3 or 4
years of a you know full up overall test
flight including the booster oh no it
got a little bit first but it would be
capable of going to the moon shortly
thereafter it's designed to do that ok
sure there is a gentleman came from a
reddit community that I wanted to
definitely call on and I don't know your
I don't want to say your name so you can
introduce yourself with your name or
your handle hi my name is Martin Avenue
and I'm with reddit's our SpaceX
community I'd like to congratulate it
you as well as so many people have done
just
I'd like to know about Starman spacesuit
is it a production model is it
instrumented and/or pressurized and
what's holding is what's holding them up
well there's a mannequin inside so it's
just basically stuffed but yeah that is
the actual production design so the real
one looks like just like that that in
fact that's one of the qualification
articles it says that's that's real
that's the real deal yeah I figure if
you're gonna go you know to I mean it's
dangerous is dangerous trip you want to
look good you know man I took us three
years to design that spit that that's
basic
it was real hard and it's easier make a
spacesuit that looks good
see that but doesn't work or that works
but doesn't look good it's really
difficult to make a spacesuit that looks
good and works and you have to make it a
multi pot process and it was
surprisingly difficult very difficult
I take motion from mr. Spencer
um thank you so much for doing this by
the way and I want to go back to VFR for
a second since you were talking about
that and also Starman which is such an
inspirational thing that's happening
have you thought given any thought to
what you might do with bfr and that way
what is the what is the payload and any
thoughts of that no a no idea it's
gestures are welcome I mean it's a beast
so you know the VFR 9 meter diameter 30
feet roughly diameter which is yeah you
put a lot in 30 feet diameter yep 110
120 meters long yeah big although you
know I bet it doesn't look that big
after a while
maybe a couple more yeah sure yeah sure
how about a temper Holtz from ports on
the back of the white shirt hi Iman
thanks again for doing this two
questions for you one just about faring
recovery just curious how the SpaceX is
coming with that and to Jeff Bezos just
responded to your tweet congratulating
you on your launch today you just
mentioned a minute ago that we need a
new space race I'm just curious if you
see yourself in a race with Blue Origin
what was the first part of the question
[Laughter]
so the if you know varying or covering
has proven surprisingly difficult I
think I think I'm pretty sure worse will
serve very recovery in the next six
months it turns out like if you pop the
parachute on the fairing you've got this
giant awkward thing it tends to
interfere with the air flow on the on
the parachute and and miss and gets all
twisty and and it obviously was a low
priority to also we have varying version
two which is the really that's the
important one that would we want to
recover so even if we recovered fairing
version one that that wouldn't be we
wouldn't be flying it in the future
suffering too and recovery that's very
important and my guess is next six
months we figure out for recovery we've
got a special boat to catch the fairing
just like a catcher's mitt
it's like a giant catcher's mitt invoke
foam it's gonna run around and can't
catch the fairing and she's kind of fun
I think I might be able to do the same
thing with dragon so unless if NASA
wants us to we could try try cap dragon
meant for the fairing but it would work
on dragon two in the room how about a
James Dean from Florida today
I thank so much in life James in floor
today speaking of those dragons could
you give us a status on Commercial Crew
and and you know when we might
realistically see an astronaut just get
into low-earth orbit much less the Moon
or Mars yeah you know we're making great
progress on crew dragon or dragon
version two that's yeah if it actually
chose our company priorities the
obviously mission assurance is always
number one as a priority but then number
that the the priority used to be a
falcon iron block five and then a month
ago I said absolute priority is crew
dragging so we're pretty much done with
Falcon block five version five pretty
much almost done with Falcon Heavy a few
tweaks that it would occur with falcon
heavy block five but they're minor and
so it's all hands on deck for crew
dragon and our goal is to we're aspiring
to fly crew two over two
at the end of this year that's our goal
I think that's I think the harder we'll
be ready for one more question in the
room it's like last question question in
terms of the next Falcon Heavy which is
that Arab Satar the one for the Air
Force do you have any idea of how paté
held up from today's launch and how
quickly can it be changed and so yes and
I guess my questions are how quickly can
the pad be reconfigured between heavy
and Falcon 9 since you need that pad for
both its serve all going back and forth
this is it's designed that way and for
the block five version of the Falcon 9
or Falcon Heavy are the does the Falcon
Heavy need a dedicated core built for it
or the block it does okay
the center core needs to be dedicated
yeah so that's the center core is a
special boat the side boosters we can
reuse existing Falcon Knights but we
need to just replace the interstage with
a with a nose cone and and least use the
the upgraded titanium grid fins which
are sweet those worked out real well I'm
really happy about those in fact I'm
glad we got this decide boosters back
because they had the titanium grid fins
in the center core didn't so if I have
to pick any one I would have picked the
side boosters
I picked the center court of explode if
so that would be like the least yeah
those friggin grid fins all right
they're super expensive and an awesome
but they the production end they were
slow
we didn't we need back those that like
that was those the most important thing
to recover were those good fins inside
the spacesuit testing like its ability
to cope function nope it up there yeah
no it definitely works so you can just
like jump in a vacuum chamber with it
it's fine thanks I wrong I've had a good
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
