we are we are thrilled to have you here
today
you need um you need no introduction but
i'm going to give you one anyway
you've started over 400 companies in
your in your career of managing
businesses over five decades I'm sure
that there's going to be a bunch of
valuable insight that you can provide to
all the business owners that are here so
screw it let's get on and do it and and
I'm really excited personally this is
great for me so I'm just I'm just gonna
start you started all this when you were
kid you were 16 years old you want you
to magazine student and you then went on
to launch Virgin Records now I'm pretty
passionate about music myself but I know
a little bit about the music business
not an easy business you had no
experience in production so talk a
little bit about this entrepreneurial
spirit you're 16 years old
where'd this all come from well first of
all hi everybody and thanks for a lovely
welcome and I think I just saw lots over
lots of mobile people behind me you had
you had Sara Blakely here earlier today
did she tell a story yeah I pull it I
bullied her a little when she was very
young but she did she did really well so
and she survived I'm glad to say
actually so young and you've all the
girls I got great butts as a result but
and of course you're not allowed to say
things like that anymore but anyway I'm
very very pleased that their business
exists right you had a question pudding
no no I think yeah I was and I was
interested as a young young 14 15 year
old about and what was going on around
the world and and I was inquisitive and
and the Vietnamese war was raging and it
seemed to me as it seemed to a lot of
young people a very unjust war as most
Wars actually turn out to be and and I
like a lot of other people wanted a
campaign to try to stop it and there was
no young person's magazine at the time
and I mean quite strange lam dyslexic
and that I should feel that I concluded
who's dyslexic in this room Oh
all the best people the world is just
like sorry then but yes there being
dyslexic thinking that I could be an
editor of a magazine but and but anyway
I thought I could give it a shot and and
and so I decided to leave school and
start a magazine
- yeah campaigning magazine to try to
reform education and try to tackle
issues like like things like the
Vietnamese war would be a foreign war
and other wars that were going on at the
time I never thought I was becoming an
entrepreneur I don't think the word
entrepreneur actually existed 50 years
ago in Britain all that all businesses
were run by governments really British
Gas British cold British Telecom British
Airways you know and so the word
entrepreneur didn't really exist but in
starting this magazine I had to make
sure it survived I didn't have any money
so so I had to worry about printing and
paper manufacturing and distribution and
selling it and and that started taking
out quite a lot of time and and the word
survival was very important because in
those days you couldn't raise money to
start your business you had to sort of
try to start them fund and them from
people wanting to buy advertising or
buying copies of your magazine and so I
learned I learned the art of being an
entrepreneur
bye-bye you're in the jungle trying and
trying to survive and the magazine
became my education and and it was that
you know a lot of fun and one thing one
thing led on to another but so as you
said you you know it was it was survival
and you're struggling so of course when
that happens you went to the music
business right I mean that's exactly
what you do at a time like that not the
easiest business you you yourself have
said you knew very little about music
it's a great story I mean I haven't
how'd you get into the music business
how'd you start Virgin Records became
such a such a powerhouse of music
business well first of all you have to
come up with the name of a brand and and
as a 15 60 year old I was sitting around
in the basement and one of them one of
the girls who's sitting there with me
and said well we're all virgins are
laughed hysterically and said why don't
you call it virgin and the only other
name we had was slipped disc records and
because you chose well slip disc
Airlines would not occur anyway we went
we went for virgin we took it took us
four years for the registry office to
let us register it they claimed it was
rude and and after three or four years
I've got the dictionary out and I wrote
them a letter and said look the English
dictionary says that the Virgin is the
opposite of rude it's pure it's
untouched its unblemished it's
everything that's perfect and finally
they they they realized that they gave
in and and not sure how pure it was
after we'd had it for a few years then
but then but we then yeah so the music
business just simply came about again a
bit by accident and a young lad of
fifteen brought me a tape and I loved
the music
and and he said that no record company
would put the music out so so I said
well let me go and you know try a few
record companies myself and after after
going around eight record companies and
being turned down and I thought screw it
let's do it
we'll start a record company and and
Virgin Records was then born and and
this fifteen year olds Alden was called
tubular bells and and and you know it
was just music yeah no vocals but it it
outsold Dark Side of the Moon by Pink
Floyd Sam and it was a big big big hit
record yeah and we managed to get and
the Exorcist used it as their soundtrack
and and and it did it did well and that
and that really you started building us
building wall then came the biggest
independent record company in the world
and I mean I'd always wanted to sign the
Rolling Stones I kept trying kept trying
that must have been so exciting and that
was a great day that must have been a
great I mean it's a great day to go see
the Rolling Stones but actually no no it
was brilliant and I never really smoked
and Keith Richards told me to roll the
joint on the day that we sign
and I'm hopeless at it ever since so you
start a magazine as a Goldman Sachs
conference Ari
so you start a magazine and then you
enter this terribly difficult business
the music business that most people fail
and you have a bunch of success and so
what does somebody do after entering a
really tough business and having some
success they start an airline
I mean who starts an airline and so you
go out you go out to start an airline
and again you don't know anything about
the airline industry the business models
you probably have read that most people
that start Airlines fail there's
regulation there all sorts of issues you
know why did why did that work what did
you get right about that what you know
what were the lessons there and that's
obviously become a huge business
well what again you know with them with
a magazine I started it out of a mission
not to make money right with the record
company I started it to get music heard
that other people weren't putting out
with the airline I mean one or two of
you in this room would have heard this
story but it's a good story so I'm going
to tell it again I was 28 years old I
was trying to get to the Virgin Islands
there was a gorgeous woman waiting for
me it was 6:00 in the evening I I hadn't
been home for three weeks and then and
the American Airlines decide that
they're going to bump the flight because
they didn't have enough passengers so I
thought damn it I'm going to get there
somehow or another so I went to the back
of the airport I hired a plane and hoped
my credit card would advance and I
borrowed a blackboard and I wrote Virgin
Airlines one-way $39 to the to the BVI
and I went out to all the people who got
but and I
[Laughter]
selling probably going to charge $49 so
I had to do a few discounts wanted to do
so when we got to the BVI and I better
skip that part of the story the next
month the next morning and with a big
smile on my face I rang up I rang all
right I rang up Boeing and and I said
could I talk to your sales department
and I'd like to buy a 737 and I was put
through to this lovely lovely man called
r.j. Wilson well they always remember
and he took the phone call and I said do
you have any secondhand 747s for sale
and and he said well yes we do could you
tell me who you are I said um my name is
Richard Branson I have a record company
called virgin you know we have Janet
Jackson we have the Rolling Stones
whether Sex Pistols and he said what do
wonder seven four seven four so I say
well I not that well run and I think we
could start an airline that that could
give British Airways a run for their
money and there was a long pause and
then and then I mean I was just very
lucky it was him on the other end of the
phone call as it once they got to know
him later I realized how lucky I was
anyway he there was a long pause and he
said Richard it's what you said your
name was Richard yeah but he said then
look I'll come and see you he said but
obviously even had to change the name of
your company I mean nobody would expect
an airline with the name virgin to go
the whole way
[Laughter]
that's good one I bet you use that
before so anyway he came we got we got a
747 I'm gonna give one bit of useful
business advice they well well so you
can imagine the people who are running
the record company with me got in a
complete panic when I told them that we
were moving into the airline business
and and so I had to convince them that
the airline wasn't going to bring the
record company down and and obviously
the most important thing in business is
protecting the downside and so the most
important part of the negotiation with
Boeing was to persuade them that if the
airline didn't work out as I thought it
would that we could hand the plane back
at the end of the first year and they
actually agreed on that I mean they they
wanted to see a competitor to be a so
they can sell you know Excel planes to
that competitor and also you know
sharpen what were the price that they
got from British Airways so so they
agreed and at the end of that year and
the people loved Virgin Atlantic and
they sold us to more and the rest rest
is history as they say that was 35 years
ago they're extraordinary
you know not not an easy not an easy
business you know for sure and the fact
that you've you've you've made it work
for such a long time yeah I think I
think they you know we set up three
Airlines Virgin Australia Virgin America
and Virgin Atlantic and and they've all
been very successful and they've been
successful I think well I mean most
business is successful because the
people but the people only excel if you
give them the tools to do a great job
and if they if they feel that hurt and
so I think you know what was critical in
Virgin Atlantic was that all every
single little detail was right so we
were that you know we were the first
airline to introduce feedback videos and
five years before Percy Airways and you
know kids who travel them on virgin
would not let their their parents travel
on any other airline because they wanted
to they wanted to seek back videos and
you know we had stand-up bars for you
know upper class passengers and I'm sure
lots of romances started a request for
bars and we're not the kind of airline
that banged on lavatory doors either so
anyway we were we were a fun vanilla
you're certainly you're searching Jonah
Jonah change the Goldman Sachs brand
it's an interesting marriage of brands
ours arts good arts can move in your
direction a little bit so let's talk
about the future and by the future
I mean space travel and so I'd like to
queue up a video now Sir Richard Branson
ladies and gentlemen we are we are
thrilled to have you here today you need
um you need no introduction but I'm
going to give you one anyway
you've started over 400 companies in
your in your career of managing
businesses over five decades I'm sure
that there's going to be a bunch of
valuable insight that you can provide to
all the business owners that are here so
screw it let's get on and do it and and
I'm really excited personally this is
great for me so I'm just I'm just gonna
start you started all this when you were
kid you were 16 years old you want you
to magazine student and you then went on
to launch Virgin Records now I'm pretty
passionate about music myself but I know
a little bit about the music business
not an easy business you had no
experience in production so talk a
little bit about this entrepreneurial
spirit you're 16 years old where this
all come from well first of all hi
everybody and thanks for and a lovely
welcome and I think I just saw a lot
server lots of mobile people behind me
you had you had Sara Blakely here
earlier today did she tell a story well
yeah I pull it I bullied her a little
when she was very young but she she did
she did really well so and she survived
I'm glad to say actually so young and
you've all got all the girls I got great
butts as a result but
and of course you're not allowed to say
things like that anymore but anyway I'm
very very very very pleased that their
business exists all right you had a
question pudding no no I think I yeah I
was and I was interested as a sort of
young young 14 15 year old about and
what was going on around the world and
and I was inquisitive
I'd love to come with you on it
so really really entrepreneurship to a
whole different level when you talk
about when you talk about space red-tape
needs to be a it's got to be an
unbelievable thing I mean the process of
actually doing this and all the issues
that are created what's what's it taking
to get this done I mean you said this is
a big year you know for you with respect
to space what's it taking to get this
done it's taking 800 in our case 800
wonderful engineers and technicians
working day and night in the Mojave
Desert which isn't the most salubrious
place to work but they're all completely
committed to what they're doing it's
taking another couple of hundred
engineers in Long Beach working working
at Long Beach working very hard to get a
large rocket launch to put small
satellites up and and it and it's taken
some 12 years hard work so this is you
know this is really a really long-term
investment and and what Virgin what
Virgin Galactic is trying to do is to is
slightly different from what Iran is
trying to do I mean what Elon achieved
last week was absolutely breathtaking
what with what we're building is is
spaceships shaped shaped like yes shaped
like spaceships and also you know
reminiscent of airplanes as well right
with the idea that people will be able
to fly into space on honor on a
spaceship and then come back in back
into earth and land land in the same
spaceship and and hopefully one day we
can develop it from problems spaceships
go into space to point-to-point travel
another quite exciting things which we
got planned so it's it's been a it's
been a long haul we've had you know we
were I think all three companies that
have been working on this that have had
tears as well as as well as well as
great moments and this this year we we
think we're finally there
and over the next few months and we hope
it'll be Virgin Galactic's turned to to
put the world to Marvel and for all our
team to finally achieved everything they
set out to achieve so so much so much
hard work obviously to get something
like this done
you know what is is there there one or
two particular things that have been the
biggest technical challenge the biggest
practical challenge of actually
executing I mean the one of the biggest
technical challenges is is coming back
into right Minh to sorbets and and and
that's been the most dangerous time in
in in past space expeditions Bert retar
was the genius that developed that the
mechanism on Virgin Galactic which
effectively turns into a junk
shuttlecock and it comes back into the
Earth's atmosphere just like a
shuttlecock so it slows itself up then
it reforms again as a spaceship and
comes in to land
and it's a magnificent you know to see
to see the spaceship
you know folding folding into a
shuttlecock and then coming back out
again
anyway that's one of yeah one of one of
one of many challenges I mean without
with our smaller you know with Bergeon
orbit what we're trying to do is put up
with one web which we are partners 2000
satellites around the earth and
connecting the billions that people are
not connected at all in remote parts of
barley or Africa and so on and even
remote parts of America and and and
there what we've actually done is we
taken Virgin Atlantic one of the very
early boat in Atlantic 747s and we're
going to fly it up to 50,000 feet
attached to the wing of a 747 and then
we're going to drop it from a 747 and
it's going to far and go into space from
there and so it's quite fun that
directly that you know we were able just
to trans transfer 7+7 from Virgin
Atlantic to our space program and and
and it's now ready ready ready you know
hopefully mid this year to start
operation very very cool really quick
you can you can hear you know in the
conversation and we talk about things
and this is something I've always
admired about you you're a constant life
learner you're really interested in
understanding things learning you're
always trying to learn something new
it'll expand you know your horizons what
are you what are you learning about now
that's really exciting you both I think
a good leader it has to be a really good
listener
and and I'm listening to fascinating
people all the time not famous people
just yeah you know everybody has some
expertise in sure in something in life
and and and I get excited by so many new
things and in you know geothermal for
instance and you know everybody gets
excited about you know that's if you if
you're worried about climate change you
get excited I just recently come across
some geothermal technology that that you
know for the regions of the Caribbean
which you know happen to live in and for
places you know all the way around the
center of the earth you know if you
drill down 3,000 feet you've got you
come across incredible heat and and that
heat if it come if you can bring it up
to the Earth's surface
it works you know 24 hours a day seven
days a week and it uses up a tiny amount
of space compared to solar or wind which
both equally very good technologies but
you need you need more space for them I
don't know I mean you know I'm just very
lucky I my mind is open all the time
we've just a virgin Hyperloop one I just
come back from the Dubai where they are
incredibly excited by the possibilities
of virgin Hyperloop one off to India on
Sunday to talk to the Indians about it
and you know it will be transformed
I think as you know connecting airports
connecting cities and you know that's
the new technology we've got a test a
test run in the in the last outside Las
Vegas which you've been to and it's it's
just lovely of being at the birth of a
new technology and very very exciting as
we talked about that I mean that's a
technology that would really be
transformative you know is it execute
let's you mention the Caribbean so I
wanted to switch now and talk about
Virgin Unite and you know just talk a
little bit about about that and we were
talking a little bit earlier you know
you've been quoted as saying you know
business as usual should no longer be an
option we have to make businesses a
force for good and that's something we
certainly you know believe in and feel
very very strongly about you've been
you've been unbelievable in terms of
what you're trying to do you know down
in the Caribbean more broadly you know
the devastation of Hurricane Maria and
what happened you felt it in a very
personal basis but for so many others
that are affected and you're obviously
you know doing a bunch to try to be
supportive but talk about you know how
how do you focus and prioritize were you
given all of your resources all of your
businesses can really make a difference
you know to society to communities how
do you think about that talk a little
bit about Virgin Unite unite DVI and
what you're doing down there and now
it's a good question I mean there there
are so many problems in this world and
trying to prioritize you know which
problems to solve and which you just
feel you don't have the energy for or
the resources for is a really tough one
which is why we're trying to get like
you know every single business in this
room and even if you're a really small
business I love this kid whatever it was
eight coming up to me and pitching me
earlier in the in the corridor and but
but and and giving me one of his
products give away the products easily
anyway you're gonna have trouble getting
out of here now that someone knows that
your pitch to the court they and then
but I think
that if every single person in this room
can adopt at least one problem and and
you know like you know if it's just you
know trying to find a roof over the the
person you keep walking by who's
sleeping in the street every day you
know going to your office if you know
something you know but just a a problem
in this world I think you every single
person this room will feel you know that
much better for it you know in 50 years
time when they've look back on their
life and their careers and and and
obviously as you as businesses get
bigger you can you can you can adopt
bigger and bigger and bigger problems
and you can use your Ontario skills your
resources your teams to take on on some
of the really big problems in this world
and I think you we cannot let this let
government try to sort saw the problems
the world out they haven't got the
entrepreneurial skills generally to do
so so and it's great fun I mean you know
we have we have something called
audacious ideas gathering on Necker
every year where we get some of the more
successful people together and we we get
throughout the year with with Ted we get
maybe 300 companies
sorry 300 organizations to pitch and
then we choose 10 of the most important
things in the world to try to resolve
and then we go out to try to resolve
them every year you know it could be a
particular kind of blindness in Africa
you know it could be you know how do we
sort out methane leaks around the world
and you know can we use satellites to
spot them and then alert the companies
these methane leaks and so on and so you
know so as you get as you get as your
businesses get more successful you
become more entrepreneurially aware as
to how to look at situations in this
world and then
get into a position where you can
actually start tackling some of the
bigger issues that's great really really
great really really tremendous we're
doing culture is really really important
in business culture really matters in
business you know we've got you know
thousands of entrepreneurs here you know
that are building their own cultures you
know in their businesses talk a little
bit about what it is about you know the
culture of your organization's the
culture of the Virgen organizations that
you think has been special it's been
differentiated you know what's once made
a difference because there's clearly
something there
you know culturally that's really
enhanced you know all the success that
these businesses have had I think I
touched upon it pointed earlier but I
but I think it's it's really looking
after your people in a real genuine
sense so if I take the Virgin Group
headquarters in London and we do this in
a number of companies that you know that
we own a hundred percent of so you know
we say to our staff you know you know if
you you know if you want flexible
working and you at that's fine if you
want to work from home that's fine if
you want to work from home you know
Fridays and Monday's that's fine if you
if you want to go off for a you know
two-month sabbatical you'll get paid
that you know that's fine and I you know
obviously we want people to get you know
to do you know to do the product to do a
productive job but by treating people in
an adult way you get adults and adult
behavior back and and I think treating
your people as you would treat your
brothers and sisters some of you may be
you know
[Laughter]
people people who get on well with
Obama's as I member or your the way you
treat your children is then you know it
should it I mean it the the phrase our
business as a family is so misused but
it should be genuinely be a family and
you know if somebody you know it's
depressed or you know or down people
should be told you know go home for a
couple you know go home for a couple
days take some time off it yeah it's
just it's just being it's being there
being a human you know a human company
and I think that because of that I mean
I remember when that first second hand
747 took off thirty five years ago at
Virgin Atlantic it was we were about to
have the party of a lifetime onboard
that plane and but the you know the
spirit of the staff was just you know
fantastic and I remember thinking you
know if then if the airline survives 20
years will the spirits still be as good
and it it is 35 years now and the spirit
is honestly as good and I think that's
because we make sure that our staff have
the tools to do a good job I mean if if
your honor
yeah I mean there are some pretty crappy
airlines out there if you're on one if
you're on one if you're on one of those
airlines that if somebody wants kosher
food and the list it and and the staff
have to say to the passenger I'm sorry
they didn't they didn't put it on board
today know if they want macrobiotic food
and they say the staff didn't put it on
boarded it today after they've said that
a few times they're going to start
getting grumpy and and an unwelcoming
and and they haven't been given the
tools to do a good job so it's the
little details that matter if I if I'm
on a virgin plane you know I will have a
notebook in my pocket I will get out and
talk to all the customers
I'll talk to all the staff I'll write
things down
you know lots of ideas and and then I'll
make sure that when I get back most
likely the next day I will tick them off
I mean you're not so long ago I was on
the plane and and somebody said all the
salt peppers salt peppers and the salt
and pepper pots are getting stolen cuz
but they're because the guests loved
them so much they were little windmills
and and so I rang up her and another
continent actually brung me up and said
you've got to get rid of them we're
losing a fortune instead of getting rid
of them what we did was reprinted
underneath them pinched from Virgin
Atlantic and it became one of the best
advertising things we had this great
story great story
is there is there someone out there in
business today that you really really
admire oh there are so many so many many
many people out there I really admire I
mean I think every you know I mean every
single entrepreneur who's building a
business it's tough it's not easy and
it's quite likely that you know of all
the people in this room I mean maybe the
fact that they're in this room maybe
they've got past that stage but but
Olivia rates that area rates are high a
lot of a lot are gonna pull that in
their face and I think the entrepreneurs
I admire the ones that you know pick
themselves up and keep picking
themselves up until they succeed look
around how to get it done and they even
then it's tough I mean it's you know we
used to have 300 virgin megastores
around the world anybody old enough to
remember the Virgin Megastore and and
then Steve Jobs came along and I heard
the greatest on the iPod and but
fortunately you know we I mean virgin is
always reinventing itself so we were
okay but if we'd only stuck to the
Virgin Megastore businesses business
schools are apt to say stick with your
onions and I wouldn't be sitting here
today and instead we very quickly moved
on to mobile phones and other things if
you if you could go back to yourself as
a 16 year old and give yourself one
piece of advice based on what you've
learned over the last five decades what
would that what would that piece of
advice be well my mum had very good
advice and if I ever ever said even
slightly negative word about anybody
which I didn't do very often because she
sent me to the mirror made me stand in
front of the mirror for 10 minutes and
look at the mirror and she just said it
reflects so badly on you I don't want
you ever ever ever to say ill of anybody
ever again and
and and I think that was that's really
good advice I think especially as the
leader you've got to always be looking
for the best in people and if you look
for the best you get
so I'm just gonna do a quick lightning
round to wrap up here a couple of quick
questions quick responses what keeps you
up at night hopefully my wife
[Laughter]
best thing you've read this year I love
sapiens is just it's just this this
professor and it from Israel is written
these two three wonderful books but
sapiens is my favorite your morning
routine what are you doing to get up in
the morning do you get up in the morning
I always get up really early I've always
worked and lived from home and and I get
happened to find home isn't on a tiny
little island in the Caribbean so it's
rather nice to get up and and I go
straight down to the tennis court at six
o'clock in the morning I lay a tennis
pro who's better than me and and then if
the wind is up I'll go kite surfing and
and then I'll go and have some breakfast
and the day starts but I I'm fine I just
and I just need to you need to make sure
the body is is singing like I was like a
pretty good way to start the day
not exactly my start at a typical you
know Monday morning in New York he
actually comes to neck ok so then he
does exactly that's a hobby that your
favorite hobby I think it is kite
surfing actually I mean it's it looks
horribly difficult and anyone is there
we got any kind service in the room
anyway it's I really recommend it it's
an it's easier to learn than skiing and
it's you know it costs very little you
just gotta get a have a kite and it's
it's just beautiful incredible sense of
freedom out whether it's well away from
iPads and all that stuff the data man
walks a man or woman walks on Mars I
would say 2036 ok we're going to write
that down and on a budget we hope so
and on that note I'm going to say thank
you sir Richard this has been a true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
