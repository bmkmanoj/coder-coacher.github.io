Mike Aldridge I'm head of department of
computer science that's my very great
pleasure to welcome you to the Trinity
term straight G lecture and in fact as
you will surely have noticed we have an
exciting double bill this afternoon
because the straight G lecture will be
followed by after a half-hour break by
the Lovelace lecture but first the
straight G lecture and it's my enormous
pleasure to welcome my colleague sari
Krauss from bar-ilan University in
Israel Suri gained her PhD in 1992 one
of the earliest PhDs in the area of
multi-agent systems and it was a system
that played the game of diplomacy as I
recall and this system established many
of the techniques that went on to define
Tsaritsa career although her most cited
work is in the area of non monotonic
reasoning so-called klm semantics in my
community she's best known for her work
on automated negotiation automated
bargaining and this is an area which she
has really identified and made has as
her own and over the last two decades
she's been the one person in that
community which has really championed
that area and pushed it forward very
determinedly towards the goal of
building agents that can negotiate and
bargain proficiently with people which
is what she's going to tell us about
this afternoon she's won a string of
awards including each guy computers and
thought awards which is the most
prestigious award that can be given to
an AI researcher under the age of 35
that was now some time ago this sory
we've both got a bit older since then
but as then gone on to win a number of
other Ward's she's a triple AAA fellow a
fellow of the European Association for
AI and as a recipient of the ACM
autonomous agents research award in 2007
she's a good friend and a very close
colleague we've published many papers
together and I look forward to
publishing many more she suffers as I do
from from the current affliction of
being a head of department but when
we're both through that we'll both get
back to it so sorry it's an enormous
pleasure to welcome you to get a
straight G lecture thank you
thank you Mike for your kind words and I
would like to tell you what I like to do
I like to build agent I like to build
agent that interact proficiently with
people you know in this room I probably
don't need to say what is agent but I'm
looking at autonomous intelligent
systems that a plan is adapted a dev
tool and cooperate with people can face
adversary but especially I am interested
in these agents that interact
proficiently with people now what can
this agent do they can help people they
can replace people and they can be used
to train people for example supporting
people we have a project with General
Motors well the agent was a helping and
supporting a driver in electronic cars
to reduce the use of energy by helping
him set the air conditioning and the
climbing control system in intelligent
way we had a system with a milling
tambay that is still since 2007 in the
LAX Airport helping people to decide
well to put random checkpoints in to
save to annoy me for talking a world we
got an award from the homeland security
of the system I'm really proud of it
they are really using it and there on
the other hand I would like an agent
that will whisper in my ear and help me
convince my son to live he's a
smartphone and go to do something but I
really like this agent to replace people
for example I would like to have an
agent that will convince me or other not
to eat the cake back - with something
healthy
oh we built for with the Shiva hospital
in Israel a system that replaces a
speech therapist in helping
people with brain damage to train and
improve their speech capabilities and we
can also use agent to train people for
example I'll show in a minute we built
an automated system that can be used for
training people that want to get ready
for an interview on in the job market or
we build an agent for the Israeli police
to train people in interviewing at least
it's especially young gay personnel to
train a to interview suspect or other
people let me just show you a short
video of this so it's in Hebrew why
because the Israeli police but you have
subtitles okay and so we built the agent
that plays the role of the virtual
suspect and his answers depend on the
questions that the young police
personnel is asking and this led to a
huge help in providing 2020 project when
we try to play to train people to
collaborate together in interviews while
others you know the adversaries are
getting are collaborating etc we need
also the good guys need to train
themself how to collaborate together so
these are many project where computer
system interactive efficiently with
people what is common to all these
systems so the main issue is that in all
the system we need to predict the user
behavior in order to build a good agent
I need to predict whether the human will
accept or not accept an offer
I need to know how they my son will
respond to an argument that I say in the
in the discussion I need to predict what
well the adversary will attack I need to
predict well how the drivers in the
world in another project will react to
setting a a car race in a location etc
now why is it so difficult to predict
people decision-making well I always say
because peoples are upsetting their one
my experiments but really because they
don't maximize expected utility why they
don't maximize expected utility I am Not
sure but probably because they are
sensitive to context the electron
knowledge of their own preferences they
affect by complexity they have problem
of self-control and cetera so that made
our predicting human decision-making
very difficult you know I would prefer
to assume that people are following
really nice equilibrium strategy but
this is rarely happened at least in my
experience so what can we do so we first
start with some data data about decision
making of people and sometimes we have a
lot of data but in many you know Google
are collecting data for us but in many
cases we don't have that many examples
as you will see because collecting
decision making of car drivers how they
respond to our suggestion how to save
energy is more very difficult so in some
cases we are using human behavior models
that were developed by social sciences
as a way to to shape our models and to
find good features in the properties
then with this we are using some machine
learning method many times we need to
develop our own machine learning
algorithm because of the constraints of
the problem so we have a human
prediction model and then when we have a
specific human with a specific data even
if it's evolved over time we can enter
it to the model and get some prediction
but this is just the beginning
having the prediction or having a model
of the human just the prediction in this
is just the prediction it's just the
beginning of the story then the main
issue is that we have some optimization
problem or some game theory setting to
solve because our agent dough does have
some problems that it does have an
optimization problem to solve does have
a goal that we would like it to maximize
expected utility or to satisfy the goal
so the idea is to integrate the
prediction model of the human into some
optimization or some game theory model
such that after we solve it we have some
action that the agent should take in the
interaction with the human and usually
if you have some nice virtual a human
around it really helps the interaction
with people but this is not our way
mainly issues so for example if we are
thinking about the automated agent
negotiate that negotiated with people we
had this aspect we have data that we use
both to predict whether people will
accept an offer or not and also we use a
data because people with using chats we
need to recognize what they are saying
in the negotiation we also use a data in
machine learning but then we had some
optimization problem to solve what will
be the best strategy of the negotiation
so our agent will get the best result
from our point of view and we also use a
human behavior models so such
it will help in some decision of the
agents that we can solve by solving an
optimization problem so if we just want
to see our system so let me just show
you what is doing they will Chad possess
a full offer well you don't expect the
human counterpart to accept this offer
it does provide an anchor or a basis for
further negotiation offer
the agent incrementally focuses on one
issue at a time
based on which issue is the next most
important or aspire to the employers
most important value is salary neighbor
chat shows flexibility in negotiating
for an inspired Valley salary and tries
to find a counteroffer that yields a
similar utility value to itself while
incorporating the employers request for
salary okay so that you know if you the
young people if you need to train for
way negotiating about salary you can log
into the system it's online and try and
train yourself anyway so that was one
aspect in negotiation and the cases I
show you say domain was not that complex
we had it well in advance but in other
settings it's not just what we need to
predict the human behavior we need also
to predict things about the environment
and again we need the model so we need
the model for the human and we need the
model for the environment and again we
have data we need to collect data on
boss we have the machine learning method
to build the models and then it goes
into the optimization of the agent and
the agent takes in actions so I want to
present in this talk two examples that
demonstrate the use of this methodology
one is about providing arguments in
discussion and it's with my student I
really wasn't failed and the story was
like this people from Intel came to me a
few years ago and they wanted to develop
an agent that will whisper in the ear of
people when they are doing discussions
and they said you know you are you have
this a non-monotonic reasoning that was
the basic for argumentation theory
want to use argumentation theory to
build such an agent and the student was
very excited and he went and out many
many many papers about beautiful really
nice series about argumentation and we
read the papers and we said ok we'll use
this but before we use it I told him you
know I know that in game theory it's not
games here is not a good predictive
model for people behavior before we are
using argumentation series for our model
let's check that that people are
following along one of the series of
argumentation series so what we did we
collected we took from the little trail
six fictional cases that appeared in the
literature of argumentation theory we
participated people from Amazon tech and
we let them may negotiate and this you
can see it in a in the format of
argumentation series you have nodes
which are Z where is this thing
disappeared never mind
you have the the nodes are the nodes are
the arguments and they can attack or
support a is the argument and there is
some a ways in argumentation see we to
decide what is a strong gay and strong
argument and here's the wife is saying
let's buy SUV and the husband was the
other way around
the husband said let's buy a CV and a
wife said it's too expensive and I'll we
ask him what will be the next argument
you will say so you can say well SUV is
safe we said yeah yeah it's too
expensive because it's our taxes all you
can say I'm taking a loan or you can say
well at acting taking loads there is a
high interest okay so what will you say
in such a situation so we collected what
people said
and most of them choices this a argument
you know let's take a loan and it turned
out that any argumentation series that
use will get give very low weight to
this a argument and as I said thirty
five percent of it people choose this
one but this is just an example and this
is really low regardless to was
extension use or numbers or any so that
wasn't that nice I was very disappointed
the student was extremely disappointed
so I said well okay he said this is just
fictional situa a arguments Citroen you
know why won't we go and look at real
argumentation so the student found RL
found a database of transcript of
argumentation people arguments people
said about various topics and it shows
two topics capital punishments and trial
by jury and this was the database from
1995 and it checked a wedge of the
arguments that people said belonged to
extension extensions is a concept in
argumentation theory of what are good
arguments that will be say in the series
and it turned out that only less than
forty five percent of the argument said
in the discussion belong to any
extension and that was extremely
discouraging because this was really
real a discussions so yeah so just to
summarize this we have fictional cases
of 142 to the people with transitive of
these people and we have also students
added shet with a 72 people doing a chat
and most of them didn't follow
argumentation silly so what can be done
okay
I said let's use our methodology or the
methodology said let's try to predict
what people will say in there
commentation this will be the first time
fell sick you know so we collected data
from Amazon talc and for also computer
science student in Israel and they they
did both this and others and we try to
find features about this argumentation
and one thing that we did the features
that we used well based on argumentation
a series like justification that was a
but we also took feature from psychology
and also new concepts that we developed
which called relevance how this argument
is close to the previous arguments
looking this as a tree okay and then we
were able to do quite well this is us it
depends how many how many times I saw
you so if I so for example for responded
of the of the person I quite well know
how to predict the fifth times the fifth
argument that he will propose and this
our other a random or going according to
say a major way this is Emily and we did
they quite well interestingly enough
people around we did it in two countries
people from both countries didn't do
exactly the same but I can use the model
let's say the model I learned in the
computer science student and I got a a
77% across C to the Amazon tank and I
got 72% across C which is really nice
that it transferrable between a a
countries we did the same thing
prediction in the capital punishment and
we again got quite good the prediction
order so but as I told you prediction is
just the first step
how do I use a prediction to make
argument to to suggest to people which
argument to say next in the deliberation
so we said we look at different a
possibility one you just to offer them
the prediction you know I will see what
is the best prediction and then I will
choose one of them well I was very
reluctant to do it because I said you
know if a person is thinking about an
argument well I really like my argument
but you know I don't understand in
people I just understanding prediction
so okay so we said the concept of
relevance will clear related I was
thinking that we look at the graph each
of them is based on some mathematical
models but I'm just summarizing things
that are far away from the argument
because these are innovative argument we
have some heuristic of prediction prints
relevant I said okay I will say
something from the argumentation theory
and see if if it's left we compared to
is not saying anything and with random
so we have two hundred and four
participants in this experiment and you
can see this is the ones that did the
best form the acceptance rate you know
if I give you a suggestion what to say
in say a discussion will you accept my
proposal so this is the first day ever
do said so the prediction to swell
events did the best and so I do a
prediction and I have several arguments
that can be said I chose according to
all events and and then there was only
relevance that was doing well and also
the prediction weekly related which was
for my surprise this divorce I was
thinking if there is an argument that I
didn't think of I would like to hear it
as a suggestion but people didn't like
it
similarly if we are looking at this
faction of the people form the advisor
God again they like this one okay so I
was quite happy with this approach that
we can help people in the discussion
but really what I want I want an agent
that can convince people to do something
as I said you remember the cake and they
so we said we've we have a methodology
we we need human argumentative behavior
the sub model for me argumentation we
build a optimization problem and let's
see how we do it so we started with
argumentation series this is a we
combine here two models one is the more
serie and one is also based on weight
and and each of them gave different
possible conclusions so we chose one of
them according to our experience so this
is how the model is looks so we have a
arguments in the notes and we have a
attacks and support but we have also
weights on the attacks and support and
we also had weights on the argument if
it stay by itself that is a theoretical
model and it has some advantage of
various ways that we build it now if we
want to have it with people we need to
know where is these numbers will come
from so so we took two domains one was
about convincing computer science
mastered computer science undergraduate
student to to do a Master degree in
Israel you first do a master's degrees
and a PhD so that was a a good day and
also this akk issue just that you know
in this experiment people came to the
lab they said what they want a a bar a
healthsome bar or a chocolate cake and
then we try to convince them the other
way around and when they left they got
one of things we bought them it to the
lab and they got the cake all the
healthy well I'm not so is that healthy
but never mind
so first we collected human dialogues to
build this a possible trees or graphs
for the argumentation series and then we
also collected question we gave people
question eels about how strong they sing
the attacks what there is a thing about
argumentation and we collected a lot of
data to build these trees
interestingly enough in this say a
argumentation that they let them just to
collect data it turns out that people
use thirty three percent of the student
used in the argumentation at least two
arguments that attacked one another what
can I say so we have argumentation
fourth wave human argument a moment ativ
behavior and then we used also machine
learning to predict what some
distribution on the argument that the
person will say next given the last a is
a sequence of arguments that we said so
far so we use this data also for
prediction so we have already said now
we came to the optimization problem now
this was tough what do we have what do
we know about these people we almost
don't know anything about them because
what is their argumentation framework we
don't know what is there so we build a
poem from DP that the nodes are states
of our belief of states of the
argumentation graph of the person that
and we updated it over time and they
because we have observation the
observation is what the argument that
the person really said so this is a good
indication about his a model of
argumentation and we used all the
predict
and probabilities for buildings upon DP
and now given that way from DP we solved
it and we got a well it is safe to solve
it because it was not easy to solve you
know this huge from DPS and we use a
Monte Carlo surgery and some smart
optimization problems solutions to solve
the problem DP and that gave us the
strategy of the agent in the
alimentation convincing people did it
help
well we ran this experiment with new
people of course not the people that we
checked earlier and they lucky to us we
were able to show that ins a master
degree we did as well as they people
that try to convince their friends and
actually in the chocolate cake we were
doing better significantly better that
yuvan the baseline the ones that was
following some alimentation theory that
was a purposeful agents because no one
did with humans didn't do very well I
must say that in general as you noticed
the percentage of our ability to
convince another person to change his
mind is extremely difficult and while we
are doing at least as good as people
trying to convince people to change
their mind is not that easy now we have
a project where we have three people and
each tried to change a person that
doesn't have an opinion so if I don't
care if I have a cake or a bar it's
easier to convince me to take one of
them but they so we'll three so this is
the ongoing work and we'll see how we
are doing in this circus so that was one
example I wanted to show you how I we
developed and use this a methodologies
we had I want to say to show another a
project well we had also to model the
environment and this has to do with a
also with robots and this is the work of
also a real Rosenfeld and Nachman and
Oleg maksimov in a Moses alia so think
about now move to another things
forget about alimentation and discussion
just think about one person trying to
manage some robots so it can be a
soldier but it can be a drones and they
these days with drones usually and in
robot you have one person on one drone
or one person that manager if they are
doing smart things even if the drones
are autonomous UAVs I don't know if you
know there are two people on one UAV
these days and the challenge was can we
put one person on autonomous robots that
are cheap and its really problem if you
see this is my lab and the robots are
moving around and you should come to the
my lab and try to manage 10 robots the
robots are looking for healed for green
balls so you say this is autonomous
robots why do I care let the robot move
around but the robots are problem are
they are better you know backing to some
places and sometimes you know they these
robots like to get into the ladies room
in my lab and then going out is quite
difficult and while while they can do it
eventually a human operator can easily
maneuver them out and they are on the
way to continue searching for the green
balls or sometimes they went out of
battery sometimes and in addition still
there are several decisions that people
don't want the robot to make but won't
let a person with you know if when they
find the green board they wanted to
the confirmation that they this is
really a green ball and not just a box a
green box or something so the problem is
that the resistant robots moving around
and the person that is trying to operate
them is getting overwhelmed and they're
given that the question is can we have
an agent that will support the operator
and will help the robots and the
operator to get better result in our
case find more green balls so this is
just to see the robot these are the
robots you know they are looking for
this cream ball in my lab and they are
very cheap they cost less than 1500 day
and this is the interface of the
operator okay we'll go back to these say
robots in a minute there'll be another
movie
so engine design we need the model for
the humans who is a woman he's the
operator we need the model for the
robots because his environment
we don't know how he'll behave so we
collected data on the human behavior we
collect the data on the robot
performance this say the idea was that
it's really difficult to collect data
when the robot are moving around running
out of battery and cetera so the
interesting thing here in the machine
learning point of view was that we
collected data from the simulation and
then we deployed it on real robot so
that was a quite nice and then we have
an optimization problem to solve to set
and solve to give the best advice to the
operator what should it do next that was
the advice we gave him and this turned
out to be extremely useful so we have
150 hours of simulation and certamen
operators that came to the lab and then
after we have the agent we ran three
experiments we in in simulations but the
most interesting experiment was with
bringing real people to the lab twice in
a week in between once they managed a
robot by themselves once they managed
the robot with the help of the agent
half did this first have the rather sink
first just to be fair to all of them and
the agent really helps on average the
robot found seven balls when the
operator didn't have the help of the of
the agent and 14 balls when it did have
the help of the a operator as a agent
operator as a help of the and it's not
just that it was an average would it
help all the people that came to the lab
the agent
all of them and I must tell you you know
I'm not that good
manuevering robots but we have also
quite good operators and you can try it
it's really helping our people doing it
so let me show you another video
demonstrating why I have this I must
tell you why we have this video because
my student they wanted to do a video to
send to each guy competition on a video
for robots and I said come on you know
this is has nothing to do with research
but they were very excited I said ok
I'll give you the money but don't come
to me for anything about this stupid
video
and they won't first a place so what can
I say
a disaster environment both the victims
and rescuers lives may be in danger
robot technology people hide solutions
these robots in a harness and require an
operator's help whenever they cannot
handle the situation on their own movie
agent 3 away from agent for move agent
floor away from agent and you need a
robot 6 to the fast-paced simultaneous
streams of data from multiple robots can
you well me together a maybe grueling
task for a single operator robots are
too close together spreading around you
robots are too close together spread
them around and you'll be dry or wet 6 -
a bad position we have developed an
intelligent agent that supports the
human multi robot team collaboration the
agent prioritizes the different axes
scissors robot signals and generates
warnings which is the operators
situation areas nearby onion to meet
better decision
additionally widget house for both the
operators ability and robots performance
in real time through extensive empirical
evaluations we have shown that our agent
was able to significantly enhance the
team's performance which can translate
into being lives
there's sending this application out
okay so we actually use this approach in
another domain which is a storage a
domain well you have robots that bring
the items through the operators that
pack them and heal the person needs both
to pack and to manage the robots and
this is extremely difficult we had the
simulation about robot shelf boxes a
packing and the cetera and the agent was
helping they operate oh and again we did
we had healed two algorithms with
solving the optimization problem and you
can see that we are people are doing
extremely better when they have the
agent is advisor is advising what to do
so if I will summarize we have automated
agent can help people can replace people
and they can be used to train people I
demonstrate a few of these a projects
that we did it's difficult tasks to
build this agent and we need a lot of
things we need machine learning
algorithms we need optimization we need
to understand the interaction and use
game theory models but putting it all
together I'm having fun
