technology will come to order
and without objection the chair is
authorized to declare a recess at any
time welcome to the first hearing in a
series of hearings on artificial
intelligence this series is an
opportunity for the subcommittee to take
a deep dive into artificial intelligence
and today's hearing is an opportunity to
increase Congress's understanding of
artificial intelligence including its
development uses and the potential
challenges and advantages of government
and adoption of artificial intelligence
we have four experts on the matter whom
I look forward to hearing from today and
in the next hearing we do in March I
believe we will hear from government
agencies about how they are or should be
adopting artificial intelligence into
their operations how they will use AI to
spend taxpayer dollars wisely and make
each individual's interactions with the
government more efficient effective and
secure it's important that we understand
both the risk and rewards of artificial
intelligence and then the third hearing
in April we will discuss the appropriate
roles of both the public and private
sectors as artificial intelligence
matures artificial intelligence is a
technology that transcends borders we
have allies and adversaries both
nation-states and individual hackers who
are pursuing artificial intelligence
with all they have
because dominance and artificial
intelligence is guarantees a guaranteed
leg up in the realm of geopolitics and
economics at the end of this series it's
my goal to ensure that we have a clear
idea of what it takes for the United
States to remain the world leader when
it comes to artificial intelligence
thoughtful engagement by legislators is
key to this goal and I believe that this
committee will be leaders on this topic
so what is artificial intelligence
Hollywood's portrayal of artificial
intelligence is not accurate instead
many of us are already using it every
single day from song recommendations and
Spotify to digital assistants that tell
us the weather and while these consumer
applications are important I'm most
excited about the possibility of using
artificial
in the government to defend our
infrastructure and have better
decision-making because of the analytics
that artificial intelligence can run in
an environment of tightening resources
artificial intelligence can help us do
more for less money and help to provide
better citizen facing services I think
the witnesses for being here today and
look forward to hearing and learning
from you so that we can all benefit from
the revolutionary opportunities ai
provides us as always I'm honored to be
exploring these issues in a bipartisan
fashion I think the IT subcommittee is a
leader on doing things in a bipartisan
way with my friend and ranking member
the Honorable Robin Kelly from the great
state of thank you welcome to the
witnesses Thank You chairman herd and
welcome to all my witnesses today and
happy Valentine's Day artificial
intelligence or AI has the capacity to
improve how society handles some of its
most difficult challenges in medicine
the use of AI has the potential to save
lives and detect illnesses early one MIT
study found that using machine learning
algorithm algorithms reduce human errors
by 85 percent when analyzing the cells
of lung cancer patients and earlier this
month Wired magazine reported hospitals
have now begun testing software that can
check the images of a person's eyes for
signs of diabetic eye disease a
condition that if diagnosed too late can
result in vision loss and some
communities around the country
self-driving cars are already operating
on the road and highways that makes me
nervous but investment by major car
companies and self-driving cars makes it
increasingly likely that they will
become the norm not the exception on our
nation's roads but there is a lot of
uncertainty and revolving around
artificial intelligence AI is no longer
the fantasy of science fiction and is
increasingly used in everyday life as
the use of AI expands it is critical
that this powerful technology is
implemented in an inclusive accessible
and transparent manner in its most
recent report on the future of AI the
National Science and Technology Council
issued a dire assessment of the state
diversity within the AI industry the
NSTC found that there was a quote lack
of gender and racial diversity in the AI
workforce and that this quote mirrors
the lack of diversity in the technology
industry and the field of computer
science generally according to the NSTC
in the field of AI improving diversity
and I quote is one of the most critical
and high-priority challenges the
existing racial and gender gaps in the
tech industry add to the challenges the
a I feel faces although although women
compromise approximately 18 percent of
computer science graduates in the nation
only 11% of all computer science
engineers of female African Americans
and Hispanics account for just 11
percent of all employees in the
technology sector despite making up 27%
of the total population in this country
lack of AI workforce diversity can have
real cost on individuals lives the
increasing use of AI to make
consequential decisions about people's
lives is spreading out a fast rate
currently AI systems are being used to
make decisions by banks about who should
receive loans by government about
whether someone is eligible for public
benefits and by courts about whether a
person should be set free however
research has found considerable flaws
and biases can exist in the algorithms
that support AI systems calling into
question an accuracy of such systems and
its potential for unequal treatment of
some Americans for AI to be accurate it
requires accurate data and learning to
learning sets to draw conclusions if the
data provided is biased the conclusions
will likely be biased a diverse
workforce will likely account for this
and use more diverse data and learning
sets within the industry the use of
black box algorithms are exasperatingly
problems of bias two years ago probe
publicly probe publicly investigated the
use of computerized risk prediction
tools that were used by some judges in
criminal sentencing and bail hearings
the investigation revealed that the
algorithm the systems relied upon to
predict recidivism was not only
inaccurate but bias against
african-americans who were quote twice
as likely as White's to be labeled a
higher risk but
actually we offend judges were using
this information derived from black box
software to make life-changing decisions
on whether someone has let free or
receives a harsher sentence than
appropriate increasing the transparency
of these programs and ensuring a diverse
workforce is engaged on developing AI
will help decrease bias to make software
more inclusive increasing diversity
among the AI workforce helps aboard then
the negative outcomes that can occur
when AI development is concentrated
among certain groups of individuals
including the risk of biases and AI
systems as we move forward in this great
age of technological modernization I'll
be focused on how the private sector
Congress and regulators can work
together to ensure that AI technologies
continue to innovate successfully and
socially responsibly I want to thank our
witnesses for testifying today and look
forward to hearing your thoughts at how
we can achieve this goal and again Thank
You mr. chair I recognize the
distinguished gentleman from Kentucky
mr. Massey is here he's not a member of
the subcommittee so I ask unanimous
consent that he fully is able to fully

witnesses our first one is dr. Amir
Kazuo Shah he is vice president and
chief technology officer of the
artificial intelligence products group
at Intel welcome dr. Charles is well is
belt this Bell is executive associate
dean at the College of Computing within
the Georgia Institute of Technology dr.
Oren Etzioni is the chief executive
officer at the Allen Institute for
artificial intelligence and dr. n buck
is vice president and general manager
accelerated computing at Nvidia welcome

to also push the button to turn on your
microphone before speaking and now it's
a pleasure to recognize dr. cash or ocg
cha ha hee excuse me for your initial
five minutes good afternoon chairman
herd ranking member Kelly and members of
the House Committee on Oversight and
Government Reform Subcommittee on
information technology my name is Amir
Khusro chai and I'm the vice president
and chief technology officer of Intel
corporation's artificial intelligence
products group we're here today to
discuss artificial intelligence a term
that was an inspirational concept until
recently while definitions of artificial
intelligence vary my work at Intel
focuses on applying machine learning
algorithms to real-world scenarios to
offer benefits to people and
organizations thanks to technological
advancements AI is now emerging as a
fixture in our daily lives
for instance speech recognition features
recommendation engines and bank fraud
detection systems all utilize AI these
features make our lives more convenient
but AI offer Society so much more for
example AI healthcare solutions will
revolutionize patient diagnosis and
treatment heart disease kills one in
four people in the United States it is
difficult for doctors to accurately
diagnose disease because different
conditions present similar symptoms
that's why doctors mailing it had to
rely on experience and instinct to make
diagnoses more experienced doctors tend
to diagnosed correctly three out of four
times those with less experience however
just half the time as accurate as a
flipping of a coin patients suffer due
to this information gap recently
researchers using AI accurately spotted
the difference between the two types of
heart disease nine out of ten times in
this regard AI democratizes expert
diagnosis for patients and doctors
everywhere in the world
AI is also contributing positively to
agriculture the population is growing
and bite
we will need to produce at least 50%
more food to feed everyone this will
become increasingly challenging as
societies will need to produce more food
with less land to grow crops thankfully
AI applications provide tools to improve
crop yields and quality while also
reducing consumption of resources like
water and fertilizer these are just a
few examples of how AI is helping our
communities however as we continue to
harness the benefits AI for societal
good governments will play a major role
we are in the early days of innovation
of a technology that can do tremendous
good government's should make certain to
encourage this innovation and it should
be wary of regulation that will stifle
its growth at the federal level the
United States government can play an
important role in enabling the further
development of AI technology in a few
ways first since data fuels AI the US
government should embrace open data
policies to realize ai's benefits
researchers need to have access to large
data sets some of the most comprehensive
data sets are currently owned by the
federal government this data is a
taxpayer-funded resource which if made
accessible to the public could be
utilized by researchers to train
algorithms for future AI solutions the
open government data Act makes all non
sensitive US government data freely
available and accessible to the public
Intel supports this bill and calls for a
swift passage second the US government
can help prepare an AI work force
supporting universal STEM education is a
start but federal funding for basic
scientific research at universities via
agencies like the National Science
Foundation is important to both train
graduate level scientists and contribute
to our scientific knowledge base current
federal funding levels are not keeping
pace with the rest of the industrialized
world I encourage lawmakers to consider
the tremendous returns on investment to
our economy that funding science
research produces in addition to
developing the right talent to develop
AI solutions governments will have to
confront with labor displacement AI as
emergence will displace some workers but
too little is known about the types of
jobs and industries that would be most
effective
Bill's like HR for eight to nine the AI
Jobs Act helped bridge that information
gap by calling for the Labor Department
to study the issue and to work with
Congress on recommendations Intel
supports this bill as well and
encourages Congress to consider it in
committee AI promises many societal
benefits and government and industry
should work together to harness them and
also to set up guidelines to encourage
ethical deployment of AI and to prevent
it from being used in improper ways that
could harm the public I cannot stress
enough how important it is a law makers
seize the opportunity to enable AI
innovation as US lawmakers consider what
to do in response the emergence of AI I
encourage you to use a light touch
legislating or regulate regulating AI to
heavenly will only serve to
disadvantaged Americans especially as
governments around the world are pouring
resources into tapping into a eyes
potential thank you again for the
opportunity to testify today the
government will play an important role
in enabling us to harness ai's benefits
while preparing society to participate
in AI fuelled economy determining
whether or how is this in legal and
public policy frameworks may need to be
altered will be an iterative process
Intel stands ready to be a resource as
you consider these issues thank you
thank you dr. Cara Shahi and dr. Isabel
you're now recognized for five minutes
chairman herd ranking member Kelly and
distinguished members of the
subcommittee my name is dr. Charles
Isbell I am a professor and executive
associate dean for the College of
Computing at Georgia Tech I would like
to thank you for the opportunity to
appear before the subcommittee as
requested by the subcommittee my
testimony today will focus on the
potential for artificial intelligence
and machine learning to transform the
world around us and how we might
collectively best respond to this
potential there are many definitions of
AI my favorite one is that it is the art
and science of making computers act the
way they do in the movies and the movies
computers are often semi magical
anthropomorphic they do things that if
humans did them we would say they
required intelligence as noted by the
chairman if that is AI then we already
see AI in our everyday lives we use the
infrastructure of AI to search more
documents than any human could possibly
read in a lifetime to find the answers
to
staggering variety of questions often
expressed literally as questions we use
that same infrastructure to plan optimal
routes for trips even altering our
routes on the fly and face of changes in
traffic we let computers finish our
sentences sometimes facilitating a
subtle shift from prediction of our
behavior to influence over our behavior
and we take advantage of these services
by using computers and our phones or
home speakers to interpret a wide
variety of spoken commands all of this
is made possible because AI systems are
fundamentally about computing and
computing methods for automated
understanding and reasoning especially
ones that leverage data to adapt their
behavior over time that AI is really
computing is an important point to
understand what has enabled many of the
advances in AI is the stunning increase
of computational power combined with the
ubiquity of that computing that AI also
leverages data is equally important the
same advance is in AI are also due in
large part to the even more stunning
increase in the availability of data
again made possible by a Bic WA T in
this case of the internet social media
and relatively inexpensive sensors
including cameras GPS microphones all
embedded in devices we carry with us
connected to computers that are in turn
connected to one another by leveraging
computing and data we are moving from
robots that assemble our cars to cars
that almost drive themselves one can be
skeptical as I am that we will in the
near future create AI that is capable as
humans are in performing a wide variety
of general tap the sort of general tasks
that humans grapple with every day
simultaneously but it does seem that we
are making strong progress toward being
able to solve a lot of very hard
individual tasks as well as humans we
may not replace all three million truck
drivers and taxi cab drivers nor all
three million cashiers in the United
States but we will increasingly replace
many of them we may soon trust the x-ray
machine itself to tell us whether we
have a tumor as much as we trust the
doctor we may not automated way
intelligence analysts but AI will shape
and change their analyses so AI exists
and is getting better it is not the AI
of science fiction
neither benevolent intelligence working
with humans as we traverse the galaxy
normal level an AI that seeks humanity's
destruction nonetheless we are living
every day with machines that make
decisions that if humans made them we
would attribute to intelligence
as noted by the ranking member it is
worth noting that these machines are
making decisions for humans and with
humans many AI researchers and
practitioners are engaged in what we
might call interactive AI the
fundamental goal there is to understand
how to build intelligent agents that
must live interact with large numbers of
other intelligent agents some of whom
may be human progress towards this goal
means that we can build artificial
systems that work with humans to
accomplish tasks more effectively can
respond more robustly to changes in the
environment and can better coexist with
humans as long with partners but as with
any partner it is important that we
understand what our partner is doing and
why to make the most of this emerging
technology we will need a more informed
citizenry something we can accomplish by
requiring that our AI partners are more
transparent on the one hand and that we
are more savvy on the other by
transmitter by Transparency I mean
something relatively simple an AI
algorithm should be inspectable the kind
of data to algorithm uses to build its
model should be available it is useful
to know that your medical a I was
trained to detect heart attacks mostly
in men the decisions that the system
makes should be explainable and
understandable in other words as we
deploy these algorithms each algorithm
should be able to explain its output in
its decisions this applicant was
assigned higher risk because is not only
more useful but is less prone to abuse
than just this applicant was assigned a
higher risk to understand such machines
must less to create them we have to
strive for everyone to not only be
literate but to be compared that is they
must understand computing and
computational thinking and how it fits
into problem-solving in their everyday
lives I'm excited by these hearings
advances in AI are central to our
economic and social future issues that
are being raised here are addressable
and can be managed with thoughtful
support for robust funding and basic
research and artificial intelligence as
noted by my colleague support for
ubiquitous and equitable computing
education throughout the pipeline k12
and beyond and in developing standards
for the proper use of intelligent
systems and thank you very much for your
time and attention today and I look
forward to working with you and your
efforts to understand how we can best
develop these technologies to create a
future where we are partners with
intelligent machines thank you thank you
sir
dr. Etzioni you're now up for five
minutes
good afternoon chairman herd and ranking
member Kelly distinguished members of
the committee thank you for the
opportunity to speak with you today
about the nature of AI and the role of
federal government my name is Oren
Etzioni I'm the CEO of the Allen
Institute for artificial intelligence
which is backed by Paul Allen we call
ourselves
AI to founded in 2014 AI 2 is a
non-profit research institute whose
mission is to improve lives by
conducting high-impact research and
engineering in the field of AI for for
the common good the goal of my brief
remarks today is to help demystify AI
and cut through a lot of the hype on the
subject and I'm delighted to talk to you
in particular a chairman with a computer
science degree but it's really important
to me to make sure that my remarks are
understandable by everybody and that we
don't confuse science fiction with the
real science and Hollywood and hype with
what's actually going on what we do have
are these very narrow systems that are
increasingly sophisticated but they're
also extremely difficult to build we
need to work to increase the supply of
people who can do this and that's going
to be achieved through increased
diversity but also through immigration
and so so many of us are immigrants to
this country at AI - we have 80 people
who come from literally all over the
world from Iran from Israel from India
etc etc we need to continue to welcome
these people so we can continue to build
these systems I have a number of
thoughts but I actually want to address
the issue that came up just in the
conversation now about transparency and
bias and certainly the concerns that we
have about these database systems
generating unfairness obviously we want
the systems to be fair and obviously we
want them to be transparent
unfortunately it's not as easy as it
sounds right these are complex
statistical models
that are ingesting enormous amounts of
data millions and billions of examples
and and generating conclusions so we
have to be careful and I think the
phrase light touch is a great one here
we have to be very careful that we don't
legislate transparency but rather that
we attempt to build algorithms that are
more favoured more desired because
they're more transparent
I think legislating transparency are
trying to do that would actually be a
mistake because ultimately consider the
following dilemma let's say you have a
diagnostic system that's highly
transparent and 80% accurate you've got
another diagnostic system that's making
a decision about a key treatment it's
not as transparent okay that's very
disturbing but it's 99% accurate which
system would you want to have diagnosing
you or your child that that's a real a
real dilemma so I think we need to
balance these issues and be careful not
to rush to legislate what's complex
technology here while I'm talking about
legislation and regulation and the kinds
of decisions you'll be making I want to
emphasize that I believe that we should
not be regulating and legislating about
AI as a field its amorphous it's
fast-moving
where does software stop an AI begin is
Google an AI system it's really quite
complicated instead I would argue we
should be thinking about AI applications
let's say self-driving cars that's
something that we should be regulating
if only because right there's a
patchwork of municipal and state
regulations that are going to be very
confusing and disjointed and that's a
great role for the federal government
the same with AI toys right if if barbie
has a chip in it and it's talking to my
child I want to be assured that there's
some guidelines and some regulations
about what information barbie can take
from my child and share publicly so so i
think that if we think about
applications that's a great role for
regulation and then the last point i
want to make
is that we need to remember that AI is a
tool it's not something that's going to
take over it's not something that's
gonna make decisions for us even in the
context of criminal justice it's a tool
that's working side by side with a human
and so long as we don't just
rubber-stamp
its decisions but rather listen to what
it has to say but make our own decisions
and realize that maybe AI ought to be
thought of as augmented intelligence
rather than artificial intelligence then
I think we're gonna be in great shape
thank you very much
dr. buck you're on the clock five
minutes
Thank You chairman herd ranking member
Kelly and distinguished members of the
committee I appreciate your invitation
to give testimony today on this
important subject of AI my name is Ian
buck I'm the vice president and general
manager of accelerated computing at
Nvidia our company is headquartered in
Silicon Valley and has over 11,000
employees in 1999 Nvidia invented a new
type of processor called the graphics
processing unit or the GPU it was
designed to accelerate computer graphics
for games by processing millions of
calculations at the same time today GPUs
are used for many applications including
virtual reality self-driving cars AI and
high-performance computing in fact
America's fastest supercomputer at Oak
Ridge National Labs uses 18,000 and
video GPUs for scientific research our
involvement with AI began about seven
years ago when researchers started using
our processors to simulate human
intelligence up until that time computer
programs required domain experts to
manually describe objects or features
those systems took years to develop and
many were never accurate enough for
widespread adoption
researchers discovered that they could
teach computers to learn with data in a
process we call training to put that in
context to teach a computer how to
accurately recognize vehicles for
example you need about a hundred million
data points and images and an enormous
amount of computation without GPUs
training such a system would take months
today's GPU based systems can do this in
about a day the world's leading
technology companies have aggressively
adopted AI
Google and Microsoft's algorithms now
recognize images better than humans
Facebook translates over 2 billion
language queries per day Netflix uses AI
to personalize your movie
recommendations and all those systems
rely on thousands of GPUs my job is to
help companies like these bring
intelligent features to billions of
people but a eyes impact isn't just
limited to tech companies self-driving
cars as which was mentioned surgical
robots smart cities that can detect
harmful activities even solving fusion
power AI holds the best promise to solve
these English previously unsolvable
problems here's a short list of problems
for which I think AI could help first
cyber defense we need to protect
government data centers and our citizens
from cyberattack the scale of the
problem is mind-boggling and we're
working with Booz Allen Hamilton to
develop faster cyber security systems
and train federal employees in a I'm a
second as was mentioned health care
nearly 2 million Americans die each year
from disease we could diagnose them
earlier and develop more personalized
treatments the National Cancer Institute
and Department of Energy are using AI to
accelerate cancer research third waste
fraud and abuse
the GAO reported that agencies made 144
billion in improper payments in fiscal
2016 the commercial sector is already
using AI to reduce such costs PayPal
uses AI to cut their fraud rate in half
saving billions and Google used AI to
lower the cost of its data centers by
40% fourth defense platform sustainment
costs maintenance costs are a huge
challenge for the DoD typically equaling
50% or more of the cost of a major
platform totaling over 150 billion
dollars annually ge is already using AI
to detect anomalies and perform
predictive maintenance on gas turbines
saving them 5 million dollars per plant
each year these are complex problems
that require innovative solutions and I
can help us better achieve these results
in less time and at lower cost for the
role of government I have three
recommendations first fund AI research
the reason we have neural networks today
is because the government funded
research for the first neural network in
1950
the America leads the world in
autonomous machine vehicle technology
because DARPA funded self-driving car
competitions over a decade ago while
other governments have aggressively
raised their research funding the u.s.
research has been relatively flat
we should boost research funding through
agencies like the NSF NIH and DARPA we
also need faster supercomputers which
are essential for AI research second
Drive agency adoption of AI every major
federal agency just like every major
tech company needs to invest in AI each
agency should consult with experts in
the field who understand AI and recruit
or train data scientist three open
access to data data is the fuel that
drives the AI engine opening access to
vast sources of data available to the
federal to the federal government would
help develop new AI capabilities so we
can eliminate more mundane tasks and
enable workers to focus on problem
solving in closing AI is the biggest
economic and technological revolution to
take place in our lifetime by some
estimates a I will add eight trillion
dollars to the US economy by 2035 the
bottom line is we cannot afford to allow
other countries to overtake us and I
thank you for your consideration I look
forward to answering your questions
thank all of y'all now it's a pleasure
to recognize the gentleman from Kentucky
for five minutes for his first wanted
questions the doctor from Intel I don't
want to try to pronounce your name help
me out with that Cosmo strongly caution
shocking you said that AI was
aspirational but now it's reality where
did we cross the threshold in the in the
90s I worked at the AI lab at MIT I
worked on the hardware because the
software problem was too hard and it
seemed like you could solve certain
engineering problems in the software but
it still feels that way to me we're what
milestone did we cross what threshold so
I hear this a lot that people studied
neuro networks in the 90s and they're
kind of curious what has changed and so
let me just put it into a broader
context the history of AI goes back to
the
1930s the individuals who started the
field John von Neumann and Alan Turing
and there were also the first people to
build computers so the history of AI in
computing has been tightly intertwined
so computing as dr. Heath Bell mentioned
is really critical compute power has
dramatically increased since your time
to today
another thing that's changed is data and
the algorithms potentially have not
changed so much they might look very
familiar to you but there has been
actually a remarkable amount of
innovation in the space of machine
learning which is a dominant form of AI
and in neural networks that Yin
mentioned that as the state of the art
today and invariably these things change
with time the the state of the art in AI
changes with time but what the three
things that are different today are
computing power data and innovation and
algorithms this this next question I'd
like to ask all four of you if there
were going to be an X Prize for AI what
is the next big milestone what's the the
sword in the stone that somebody should
try to pull out and if they do they
deserve a big reward doctor at this
union I would observe that every time we
build one of these systems whether it's
in medicine or self-driving cars or
speech recognition we're kind of
starting from scratch right we have to
train them with these millions or
hundreds of millions of examples we have
to set the architecture by hand etc etc
etc if we could build as Charles was
alluding to more general systems which
is something that we're very far from
being able to do today a system that can
work across multiple tasks
simultaneously without being retrained
by hand every time that would be a major
breakthrough
so dr. buck what would it be for you
maybe driving from New York to LA I
think we've had our X Prize in
self-driving cars with the work that
DARPA did to kick off the industry
innovation there's a huge market for the
first car company to really come out
with a mass-produced self-driving
vehicle
I think AI at this point has the
opportunity to revolution
individual fields and some could help
from benefit from an X PRIZE certainly
healthcare I think if we can identify an
opportunity to do personalized medicine
to look at the genomics data that we
we've been able to get flooded with with
new instruments and apply ai to
understanding the net treatments that
are going to solve diseases many of them
just need to be detected earlier if we
could find them early we can treat them
if we wait till they're after the
symptoms surface with today's technology
it's sadly too late and I had to add one
more I think there's a huge
opportunities for AI to improve our
infrastructure transportation and just
apply it to to real modern problems
today
Kansas City is doing a great project
right now on detecting potholes with AI
they're actually gathering all the data
from the weather data the traffic
information and trying to predict when a
pothole is going to form on a particular
Road they're now up to 75% accurate
within about ten five to ten feet so
they can go out there ahead of time and
treat that road and tar it up before
they have to tear it up they have to fix
the pothole there are so many different
applications of AI I think those X
prices would be would be fun to watch
dr. Isabel so I think there's sort of
two answers this one all of us have said
in one form or another that AI is
interesting in the context of a specific
domain and so there's an X Prize for
every domain but the more general
question I think the answer is in the
air' lab from the 1990s I was also in
the AI lab in the 1990s and my adviser
was Rob Brooks if you might recall at
the time he was building a system called
COG and the goal of cog was to build I
remember cog yes look I
I was probably sitting in the back and
he announced it with you the interesting
thing about COG was the idea was that
they were gonna build a three year old
and I think that the general problem of
intelligence is a difficult one and the
real XPrize is being able to build
someone we would recognize as
sophisticated as a three four or five
year old okay just a speed round here if
you'll indulge me how all four of you
I'll start here on the Left how since
you mentioned the three-year-old goal
that Professor Brooks had how far away
is AI from passing the Turing test the
classic Turing test where if you were
talking to this
it's being cinchy and being in the
computer you wouldn't be able to
recognize it it's not a human how far
how many years away are we
you go first 20 plus 20 plus that chase
I assume the day after I die because
that's how these things usually work
yeah or the day after your funding runs
out I should caution that the Turing
test as it's set up is kind of a test of
human gullibility
I'm afraid that we'll pass it much
sooner and then it said but if your
question is about true human level
intelligence I agree it's 2025 years and
beyond effectively beyond the
foreseeable future it's definitely
easier to fool somebody than it is to
convince them they've been fooled right
doctor buck I agree with my colleagues
it's equivalent to worrying about the
overpopulation of Mars at this moment
but it's the question so what's your
guess Oh decades
yeah decades okay thank you very much
the gentlelady from Illinois is
recognized thank you a few of you talked
about the investment that needs to be
made in this and made into some of the
agencies so what an amount of money per
year do you think the federal government
should invest in some of the science
agencies and foundations that you were
referring to because it's easy to say we
should invest but what's your real
listing none of us are our policy of
budget expert as you can see from the
few seconds of silence but let me
suggest that you know much more than
China we have a substantially larger
economy we should be investing a lot we
know what China is investing III don't
know the exact numbers but it's
certainly in the in the billions
according to their recently released
blueprint email so I don't know the
numbers exactly but there is funding for
NSF I think is on the order of billions
and this money is highly leveraged and
funding graduate students in studying AI
universities it's a really good way to
spend the money to accelerate innovation
in AI and we do this at our company we
invest heavily in university programs
many grad students many labs and we've
seen a lot of return in this specific
area so money well spent
so three billion versus six billion that
the extra three billion will be hugely
effective and spurring innovation hi I
was going to ask you since your company
is big in this area how are you sparing
on diversity more women and more people
of color it is actually a prime
directive that comes from our CEO so
it's something that he is very focused
on we have diversity requirements in our
hiring everyone knows these requirements
rule you know in our hiring process we
focus on it and in our field in
particular we seen first hand I have
that additional diversity benefits in
many ways so we talked to discuss bias
transparency having diversity and the
scientific demographics within our
company we have different ideas
presented it's sometimes these uh issues
that you brought up are highly nuanced
and they surprised me and so again it's
a director from our our CEO
thank you dr. as well you talked about
increasing diversity but starting in K
through 12 what do you think schools
need to do K through 12 to spur interest
or what resources do they have to have
so to short answer to that the I'll
answer the first one first they have to
connect what AI what computing can do to
the to the lives of the people who are
in school that's the single most
important thing one thing that you just
heard is that every dollar you spend on
AI has a multiplying effect and it's
true because it connects to all of these
domains whether it's driving or whether
it's history whether whether it's
medicine whatever it is and just connect
that what you're doing will help you to
do whatever problem you want to solve
but the main limiting factor
fundamentally is teachers we simply do
not have enough of them you asked me how
much money you should spend whatever
number you come up with it's ten times
whatever you will come up with is the
right answer but even if you spent all
of that money we are not going to be
able to have enough teachers we're going
to be able to reach enough tenth graders
in the time that we're going to need in
order to develop the next generation
workforce it simply isn't possible what
we're gonna have to do is use technology
to make that happen we're gonna have to
make it so that dr. Etsy Elleni can
reach 10,000 people instead of 40 people
at a time and can work with people who
are locally who are local to the
students in order to help them to learn
that's the biggest I think resource for
bringing people in who are young man I
just had something real quick it's not
just a number of teachers but it's
teacher training my kids went to fancy
private schools in Seattle that had
classes called Tech and I was really
disappointed to learn that they were
teaching them features of PowerPoint
because the teacher did not know how to
program so we need to have educational
programs for the teachers so that they
can teach our kids and believe me eight
year old ten year old what a great time
to learn to write computer programs and
it'll also help with at least with with
gender diversity and other kinds of
diversity because at that point kids are
less aware of these things and they'll
figure out hey I can do this also we
talked about not getting the immigrant
community I serve on the board of
trustees of my college and that's
something that we talked about and they
shared that the amount of foreign
students has gone down drastically
because they don't feel as welcome in
the country and it's in engineering and
the STEM fields that that has happened
so I think my time is about up so I can
keep going one thing I'm going to ask
what are the biases you have seen
because of the lack of diversity I think
the bias is a very important topic
inherently there's nothing biased about
AI in itself as a technique
the bias comes from the data that is
presented to it and is the job of a good
data scientist to understand and grapple
with that bias you're always going to
have more data samples from one source
than another source it's inevitable so
you have to be aware of those things and
seek them out and a good data scientists
never rest until they've looked at every
angle to discover that bias it was
talked about in our panel and our
testimonies I think that ad is an
important part of it is is to detect
bias is where did it come from
traceability is a term that's used a lot
in developing AI systems as you're going
through and learning better newer neural
networks inserting more data you're
recording the process and development so
when you get out to a production system
you can then go back and and find out
why did it make that incorrect judgment
and find out where was that bias
inserted in the anok process and
recreate it it's very important for
self-driving cars and I think it's gonna
be important for the rest of of AI if
you don't mind me going back to your
previous question I also think it's
important that the committee recognize
that AI is a remarkably open technology
literally anyone can go by or on a PC
download some open-source software they
can rent an AI supercomputer in the
cloud for as little as three dollars and
get started learning how to use AI
there's online courses from Coursera
Udacity industry to Nvidia as a industry
program called the Nvidia deep learning
Institute to help teach so this
technology is remarkably accessible and
open and I think that it goes to your
diversity making it available it
inspires students kids with ideas of how
they can take data and apply these
technologies there's more and more
courses coming online and I think
that'll inspire the next wave of you
know AI workers if I can just add to
that I think the the first round the
bias comes from all of our beliefs
including myself the sort of fundamental
thing we want to believe is that the
technology is itself an biased and must
be and that it is no more bias than a
hammer or a screwdriver so I will point
out that both hammers and screwdrivers
are actually biased and that can only be
used in certain ways and under certain
circumstances the second set of bias
comes from the
that you choose which is exactly what
dr. buck said I'll give you an example
when I was sitting in AI lap apparently
across the hall from you a lot of the
original work and vision was being done
and particularly in face recognition a
good friend of mine came up to me at one
point and told me that I was breaking
all of their all of their facial
recognition software because apparently
all the pictures that were taking were
of people with significantly less
melanin than I have and so they had to
come up with ways around the problem of
me and they did and got their papers
published and then they made better
algorithms that didn't depend upon the
assumptions that they were making from
the data that they had this is not a
small thing it can be quite subtle and
you can go years and years and decades
without even understanding that you are
injecting these kind of biases just in
the questions that you're asking the
data that you're given and the problems
that you're trying to solve and the only
way around that is to from the very
beginning train people to think through
and in the way that that dr. buck said
to think about their data what it's
where it's coming from and to surface
the assumptions that they are making in
the development of their algorithms in
their problem choices bias is a very
real issue as you're saying is as we're
all saying but we have to be a little
bit careful not to hold our database
system to an overly high standard right
so we have to ask what are we comparing
the behavior of the systems to and
currently humans are making these
decisions and the humans are often
racist they're often sexist they're
biased in their own way we know right
you talked about the case with a
judicial decision we have studies that
show that when the justices are hungry
you really don't want them to rule at
that point right you want them to go to
lunch
so my perspective is let's definitely
root out the bias in our systems but
let's also think about these
collaborative systems where humans are
working together with the AI systems and
the AI system might suggest to the
person hey maybe it's time for a snack
or you're you're overlooking this factor
if we insist on building bias free
technology or figuring out how to build
bias free technology we're gonna fail we
need to build technology and systems
that are better than what we have today
am i right remember we need
an X Prize for that you know figure out
when I'm hangry and make better
decisions my last question is those of
you representing companies do you have
internship programs how do you reach out
into the community
well certainly I think the the most
exciting work is happening in our
research institutions and even at the
undergrad and earlier levels we're a
huge proponent of interns myself was an
Internet video when I started at the
company and worked my way up to to be a
general manager so I'm a huge proponent
of interns they bring fresh ideas new
ways of thinking new ways of programming
they teach us a lot about what our
technology can do if I'm allowed to
comment on your last question so we
talked about bias but this line of
thinking applies to everything so
transparency I heard accountability
humans are largely not transparent in
their decision-making this is something
that's been studied exhaustively by
people like Daniel Kahneman so I think
it's very interesting to hear this first
time firsthand but we have to be
concerned about humans as well as
machines and as a Interop operates
that's even more challenging but again
humans are biased humans are transparent
and there's something to be cognizant of
in your decision-making I want to stress
up thank you all right thank you
one of the reasons we do these kinds of
hearing is hearings is to to get some of
the feedback from the smart people that
are doing this and dr. buck for example
when I started we continue to do our
four tarah scorecards looking at you
know how the federal government
implements some of these rules one of
the questions we're going to start
asking our federal CIOs is what are you
doing to introduce artificial
intelligence into your operations so
you know federal CIOs if you're watching
friends at Fed scoot make sure you let
them know that's going to be coming on
the on the round six I think of the
Fatah restore court where to start with
so yes
basic research it's important what kind
of basic research do we need basic
research into bias do we need basic
research into some aspects of neural
networks like what kind of basic
research should we be funding to to
start seeing that you know to raise or
to raise our game and and all these
questions are open to all of y'all so if
if you don't want to answer just make
some you know give me a sign and I'll
you know start but dr. buck do you have
some opinions certainly as data and bias
become a state of science in general
becomes more important understanding
that the root cause of bias and how
again it's introduced in understood and
I think is a very important basic
research understanding a lot of this
work has been done they can be dusted
off and continued I think it'll be an
increasingly important as we basic as AI
becomes more of the computational tool
for for changing all the things that
we're doing I do feel that there are
different industry will tackle a lot of
the neural network design you have some
of the smartest people in the world here
in the US building newer smarter neural
networks they're largely focused on
consumer use cases speech recognition
translation self-driving vehicles I feel
like the the science applications of AI
how AI can assist in climate and weather
simulations how AI can assist in
healthcare and drug discovery are still
early and it's an area that they have
less of a commercial application but
obviously really important to this
country you have some amazing
computational scientists at the do e
labs that are starting to look at this I
think they also recognize the
opportunity the AI can
and assist in simulation or improve
accuracy or get to the next level of
discovery I think there's some real
opportunities there and we're starting
to see that conversation happen it
within the science community anymore
encouragement and of course funding to
help amplify it would be greatly
appreciated I think you make a great
point right there is the investment from
Google Intel and Facebook but but
there's so much basic research that they
won't do and I also can't emphasize
enough how primitive the state of AI is
sure we've made a lot of strides forward
but Dewey is not nothing about but give
me something what what our example is
the basic research they won't do we
should be doing common sense
something that you and I and every
person knows and AI does not that a
finger has five hands that people
typically look to they're you know left
and they're right before they cross the
street there's an infinite set of
information that machines don't have as
a result they really struggle to
understand natural language right so
we've seen success where the signal is
very limited like in a game of Go or in
speech recognition but all you have to
do is turn to a lexer or Siri and
realize just how little REI programs
understand and how little can we have a
conversation with them so I think
research into natural language
processing into common-sense knowledge
into more efficient systems in the sense
of that use less training data all of
these are very very challenging
fundamental problems and I could go on
and on gemenon
so I have very strong opinions about
this but I will try to try to keep it
short I think if I were gonna pick once
was I'm gonna give you two answers and
if I was gonna pick one thing to focus
on that I don't think we're doing enough
of it is long lived AI that is a lot of
the work that we're doing are systems
that solve a specific problem for a
specific relatively short period of time
is why it ends up looking like
supervised learning as opposed to
something like long term decision making
but if you think about what makes human
being so interesting
two things one is that we depend upon
each other and the other is that we
learn and we live for a really long time
not measured in minutes or hours but
measured in decades the problem of
reading is hard it takes human beings
six seven eight years to learn how to
read we need to understand what it means
to build systems that are gonna have to
survive not just figure out how to turn
the car now that have to figure out how
to live with other intelligent beings
for 10 20 or 30 years that's I think
it's sort of truly difficult problem but
having said that back off and say I
think the answer is you trust your
agencies who talk to the community NSF
has a long list of things that they
believe are important to invest in AI
and other things as well and they get
that by having ongoing communications
and conversations with a large community
it creates a kind of market as it were
what the interesting ideas are and I
trust them I listen to them I talk to
them they're the mechanism that sort of
aggregates what people are believing and
then in some sense what you can do or
what government can do or what these
agencies can do is to push us a little
bit in one direction or another by make
giving incentives for thinking about a
problem that people aren't necessarily
thinking of but in general I trust the
people who are doing the work dr.
cosway's shahi so we've been talking
about high level aspects of AI decision
making and so forth but in our some of
our testimonies you mentioned that there
is a substrate for computation that
enables AI you have lots of data you
need a lot of compute we're at an
interesting point in time where we
having rapid innovation in AI lots of
successes it's being driven by
availability by data and compute the my
data is increasing really really rapidly
and the date the compute house you can
measure commercially increase in power
so that will require basic research in
innovation at the silicon level at the
hardware level which is what our Intel
does we have fabs we build the hardware
from from glass so areas such as silicon
photonics analog computing quantum
computing low power of computing all of
these areas are potentially great
investment of NSF funding opportunities
you and I like to also mention the
landscape for getting AI systems to work
involve so many different things it
requires machine learning teachers and
so forth but it requires things that
seem prosaic but are really important
reliable software systems that are
accountable scalable robust and so forth
again that comes from investing in stem
computer science and early stages of
someone's career development so we've
talked about bias as a potential
challenge that we have to deal with as
as we explore and evolve in the world
with with AI another way you can
manipulate learning algorithm is by
loading it up with bad data what are
some of the other challenges and other
threats to artificial intelligence that
we should be thinking about at the same
time that we think about bias and
integrity of the data that's involved in
learning anyone that it's easy to say we
have lots of data it's actually quite
challenging to organize that data in a
meaningful way
the federal government has vast sources
of data it is very unstructured and I
think very aware and that is a challenge
and I think if we can there's that we
just spent a decade talking about big
data and as far as I can tell we've
largely collected data not really done
much with it you now have a tool that
can take all that data you've collected
and really have some meaningful insights
to to make a new discovery in healthcare
to save enormous amounts of money by
finding inefficiencies or worst waste or
fraud but that data needs to be
aggregated cleaned up labeled properly
and identified I certainly would make
sure that not only that the federal
government has an AI policy but also has
it
a sister data policy as well to organize
and make that data actionable and
consumable by a is whether within the
federal government or make them
available to the larger research
community I am sure there are there are
dozens if not thousands of PhDs waiting
to happen
if they just had the some of the more
interesting federal data to really make
those kinds well well dr. buck one the
first things this committee looked at
was the data act and shocker federal
government was actually you know ahead
of the game in trying to make sure that
we're taking all that data and adding
some structure to it implementation of
that as you have pointed out is a bit
tricky so so any tools that y'all have
to help with that would be great other
other concerns doctors Ville so I'll add
one which I agree with everything that
dr. buck said and what other people have
said before data is the problem but one
real issue is we typically build AI
systems that don't worry about
adversaries so this ties back into the
notion of long lived AI systems right so
we're building a system that's going to
determine whether you have a tumor
whether you have a heart attack whether
you should get a mortgage but we're not
spending a lot of energy some people are
thinking about this we're not spending a
lot of energy figuring out what happens
when we send these things into the wild
with wild to deploy them and other
people know that they're out there and
they're changing their behavior in order
to fool them right and how do we make
them change over time there's an arms
race you can think about this in
security it's easy to think of we could
think of something even simpler like
spam you know I get all this terrible
mail I build a system that learns what
my spam is the people who are sending
spam figure out what the rules are and
what's going on there then they change
what they do and it just keeps
escalating and so this notion that
you're gonna have to not just solve the
problem in front of you but solve the
problem as it's going to change on the
next round the round after that and
round up to that I think that's a real
limitation of the kind of way that we
build systems freeze them and then
deploy them and I'm not saying that
that's all people do and that no one is
thinking about it but I do think because
we tend to think in this sort of
transactional way about AI we sometimes
don't think through the consequences of
having long term systems I should take
it a slightly different tone so we've
talked
our testimonies about BIOS privacy
transparency assurances of correctness
adversarial agents trying to take
advantage of weaknesses in a system so
one thing that I've seen in this past
year that I haven't seen in the past ten
years is these things are discussed at
academic conferences companies like
Intel my team actually is these are some
of the top priorities these issues that
you raise
they're discussed they're attracting
some of the best minds in the field I've
just introduces the idea of transparency
literally a months ago and it's a really
interesting area it's highly nuanced
there was times for example if you have
you know humans are tribal and
multi-agent society there is times when
people have more information the overall
performance of the system goes down it's
very non-intuitive things can happen
academics are pouring a lot of effort
into this area so I'm just very very
optimistic that the things we've
enumerated today are being addressed and
we should just amplify them so the
government can play a big role in
investing in things like academic
research it is quite different to me I
don't know if you guys concur but the
last major machine learning conference
nips was really eye-opening to me that
there is a workshop in transparency
there was a workshop on bias there is a
workshop on diversity and the
demographics of the AI community so we
are definitely on a very positive and
virtuous track and we asking government
to just complan the distinguished
gentleman from the Commonwealth of
Virginia is now recognized Thank You mr.
chairman and thank you to our panel I
ducked etzioni eye from here a little
trouble reading what was underneath the
name and I thought for a minute it said
alien AI I thought wow we really are
getting diverse in the panel so putting
together here alien AI I come in peace
yeah thank God so
we were reminded rather dramatically
last September with the Equifax hack
that compromised information on 145
million Americans as to the risks of
devastating cyber attacks and the
absolute need for creating shields and
and protective measures both for the
government and for the private sector
according to the 2016 report from the
NSTC the National Science and Technology
Council AI has important applications in
cyber security and is expected to play
an increasing role for both defensive
and offensive cyber measures dr. Koster
o shahe and I'm from now on gonna say
the doctor from Hin tell how can i a be
most useful in defending against
cyberattacks so i'll suggests us a few
ways and i guess we'll have other
opinions but so cybersecurity of course
is a major issue broadly in computing as
well as an AI and as well as Intel it's
one of our primary focuses so in terms
of addressing cyber attacks using AI
cyber attacks are intentionally devious
nefarious obscure and these kinds of
actions are really well suited to the
latest state-of-the-art in AI and
machine learning these algorithms can
take large corpora of data these are
inputs from whatever the type of cyber
attack you're experiencing and you can
build a model of the cyber attack and
have a response essentially and their
response can have very low latency it
can it can study the statistics of the
attack potentially it's a novel attack
build the model and respond very quickly
so that's one way we can address cyber
security is with better models to defend
against it another way another thing
that we can it's a slightly long answer
to your question but when we build
models
we it's good to know the set of possible
attacks because a researcher a data
scientist is very cognizant of building
robust models that has resistant to
adversarial events so as we get
knowledge of cybersecurity issues in
this area and AI we build in security
and defence against cyberattacks into
the models such that adversarial actions
do not perturb or give erroneous results
presumably also one of the advantages of
AI would be early detection we could use
I mean part of the problem with cyber
certainly from the federal government
point of view but apparently in the
private sector as well as when we
finally realized we've been compromised
it's too late and right and AI has the
potential for early detection and
diversion preemption protective walls
whatever that's right the nature of
these attacks could be so devious that
you know the smartest human security
experts could not identify them so it
can be you can either augments or human
security experts or we can have systems
that or early detectors they can just
flag is this this is a potential threat
and these systems are really well-suited
for doing this latency and learning very
quickly but anyone else in the panel is
more than welcome to comment this job
doctor etzioni I just wanted that that
the root of the Equifax hack was was
human error several several human errors
so something you might want to think
about is what are the incentives that we
have in place to avoid that what are the
consequences that that people at Equifax
face and and not to pick on them for
making those mistakes you know without
with our with our data I think if we put
the right incentive structure in place
it's not a technical solution but it'll
help people to be more watchful and they
should be yeah I hear are alarming and
the the rate of attacks are growing
exponentially way faster than we can
expect a human operator even with the
tools they have today to keep up this is
a very hot topic in the startup
community
there are many startups trying to apply
a out of this problem it's a natural fit
ai is effective is by nature pattern
matching it can identify patterns and
and call out when things don't match
that pattern malware is exactly that way
suspicious network traffic is that way
one startup we work with they claiming
that top a the top AI software is only
able to capture about 62 percent of the
potential threats that are out there but
by plying AI they can shorten the time
to discovery and get to 90 plus percent
accurate malware detection and the false
error rate get it down to less than 0.1%
what I don't really it's 2% it's an
opportunity to increase the throughput
if de two of our detectives that systems
and make them much much more rapidly
responsive so why aren't we doing it the
cost the AI just needs to be developed
it's it's not yet but it is in the
process of being developed by those
startup companies it's not a talked
about in application as maybe video
analytics or ad placement but it is
certainly active well you put your
finger on two things among others but
one is the exponential growth and then
and the volume of attacks I've talked to
some federal agencies and I'm stunned at
the numbers I mean I know of one federal
agency not a big one where the cyber
attacks or attempted attacks are in the
hundreds of millions a year and you were
absolutely right I mean this particular
agency its mission isn't cyber it's got
a very human mission and it's trying to
put together through band-aids and other
measures some protection and it does
raise questions about the ability of in
this case the federal government to
protect itself I'm seeing a sea change
in that as well not just are we looking
to protect our firewalls and the data
coming into our firewalls but the data
traffic behind the farm yeah assume you
are attacked for the sake of argument
and then look at the the traffic that's
inside your firewall to detect it
because as it was mentioned before in
many cases you mean already be
compromised and you don't know it so
it's important to look at
off the the the frontline as well as
behind the lines and understanding your
network traffic in your security and and
and the second thing this conversation
you know I think underscores is the and
we had testimony yesterday from the
intelligence community but the idea that
the Russians are not going to continue
their attacks and attempts to distort
our electoral process is naive all
seventeen intelligence agencies in the
United States government testified to
the fact that it is an ongoing threat
and eight and then midterm elections
will be a target so in a democracy
that's the very heart of what and how we
function how do we protect ourselves and
I think I think maybe we've got one tool
maybe a very critical tool in terms of
artificial intelligence but trying to
get that out to the myriad localities
over 10,000 localities in other states
it's gonna be a different kind of
challenge I thank you mr. chairman mr.
Lynch you're now recognized Thank You
mr. Chairman I appreciate that dr.
Etzioni in your written testimony the
state and I quote here we can and should
regulate AI applications obviously as
more and more a AI systems used to
collect more and more sensitive and
personal data on Americans there are
there are palpable in real privacy
concerns what what are the what are the
ways in which you think that the
regulations that you anticipate would
would serve to protect private
information of Americans so I think that
there's some principles that I can talk
about and frankly you know your and your
staff are probably better better
qualified to think through specific
regulations but a principle that I would
really advocate is identifying when AI
is is involved and that's something that
we can regulate so that the bots at
least the the homegrown ones state that
their AI right we had Intel inside we
should have AI inside most recently
we've seen that they're examples of a
fake pornography right now superimposed
celebrities on top of bodies and things
like that if we can't trust the
integrity of our pornography
we're obviously I'm joking but but the
point is we should we should label for
making that clear
we should label when when AI is being
used and and likewise we should be clear
when we have AI systems in our homes
right Alexa AI Barbie the Roomba
vacuuming our floor they naturally also
vacuum up a huge amount of data some of
it from our kids if Barbies talking to
our kids
we should have regulations about where
that information can go yeah just so the
proliferation of AEI I just see it you
know it it proceeds at a velocity far
exceeding the ability of Congress to
keep up with it
and that's true with many technologies
and oftentimes it's it's you know we
riot we rely heavily on the private
sector to look at those ways that if AI
is being broadly used how we might
develop a protocol that would would
prevent that private information for
just getting out there and we we have in
a very narrow sense the Equifax
situation where we have the names
addresses Social Security numbers of 150
million Americans out there just just
gone so they basically burnt the entire
social security number system as a
reliable and secure indicia so you know
that that's gone and it's just because
one company was very lazy about about
protecting data and so I'm just
concerned I have similar concerns about
AI being out there
and you know these bots and you know
we've got some pretty creative hackers
out there Russians and others that have
been able to access some very very
sensitive information you know at one
point they they swept every bit of data
from any individual who had applied for
you know a high-level security clearance
in this country and so I could just see
if if there are as you say not
necessarily you know household
appliances but but other other forms of
AI operating a higher level if those are
hacked it just increases the the
magnitude of our vulnerability
exponentially and I'm just trying to
think you know in advance as this is all
happening in real time you know how do
we protect the people who elected us how
do we make sure that you know we're all
for innovation but I think with the
appropriate safeguards in place the
thing that I would like to highlight
those right that you're right this those
are some scary realities but there are
realities they're often instigated from
the outside so maintaining our strategic
edge and that's why I emphasize
regulating applications as opposed to
the AI field an AI research itself if we
adopt an overly defensive there I even
say you know reactionary posture we're
just gonna lose so this is a very
competitive global business and staying
ahead which we're all trying to do in
various ways for education and etcetera
is is essential okay thank you
actually my time is expired mr. Chairman
I yield back dr. Isabel did you have a
response to that question I just want to
add something I think it's important to
recognize here everything that you
brought up is deep concerns but AI is
the secondary problem they're the
primary problem there's that we are
sharing our data constantly every one of
you has a cell phone
possibly two of them you have a watch
which is pinging all the Wi-Fi watch
spots everywhere
go each one of those devices has a
unique ID that unique ID is not you but
that unique ID is with you all the time
I can figure out with very little effort
who you are where you are where you come
from by the way
I've deployed systems myself this is ten
or fifteen years old with the technology
where I can predict what button you're
going to press on your remote control
after just observing you for one weekend
there are creatures of habit we are
sharing our data in our cars our phones
everything that we do the data itself
even if it's anonymized is giving
amazing amounts of information about us
as individuals that's the primary
problem the secondary problem is the AI
the machine learning the technology
which can look at it very quickly and
bring together the obvious connections
even though you've tried to hide them
but the first thing I think to think
about is it's not the AI because
computers are just fast that's just
going to happen it's the fact that we
are sharing data and we've given very
little thought to what it means to
protect ourselves from the data we are
willingly giving to everyone around us
and I don't have an answer but that in
some sense is the root problem just the
ability of AI to to to aggregate the
data make sense of it and and give it
give it direction and and in a purpose
and na use that's that's the magic of AI
and so the data is out there and you're
right that's a problem but I just I'm
worried about weaponizing weaponizing
that raw data that's out there and and
how do we how do we control that you
know so but but thank you I think I
think you offered you know a very good
clarification Thanks I'll make a short
comment so I'd like to just balance the
discussion present a slightly dissenting
view to dr. etzioni
well-intentioned efforts such as
labeling robots and other devices that
use it employee I it could have
unintended consequences you have an in
state of California in my state we now
know that asparagus and coffee cause
cancer so we are going to have labels on
every piece of food and
every building that this thing causes
cancer and these designs are becoming
uninformative so if we have I would just
be wary of unnecessary regulation or
imposing regulation on a very young and
rapidly moving field because I can
really see that it can have some adverse
consequences we talked about
transparency to use your example would
you want something that is labeled and
worse performing or unlabeled and better
performing to use your example of it and
just just in general our view at Intel
is that legislation should not be based
on it should be based on principles not
on regulation that mandates certain
kinds of technology so we have we are
self regulating this field is wonderful
that it does a lot of high-minded
academics who are now leaders in
business and there was a strong impetus
to be good stewards of this technology
to do good and we have a lot of things
that we can impose on ourselves to
self-regulate to potentially address
some of the adverse conditions that you
mentioned not all of them perhaps some
of them do need legislation I've got
some final some final questions and this
first question it is for everyone and I
know you all have all spent your adult
life trying to answer this question and
so I recognized this before I asked and
in dr. buck I got to give some kudos to
your team that was out at the Consumer
Electronics Show they were very helpful
in helping me understand some of the
nuance of of artificial intelligence and
if artificial intelligence was based on
Fortran 77 you know I'd be your guy
that's my my background experience but I
understand how to introduce any software
antivirus software into your system I
understand how you introduce CDM into a
network when we ask all the federal CIOs
how are you introducing or thinking
about introduced introducing artificial
intelligence into the networks the first
question I'm probably gonna get is well
it's really hard and so my question is
simple how do you in and we've all been
saying that AI is interesting because
it's domain-specific and I recognized
how broad this question is but how do we
introduce AI into a network into us into
a system into an agency yeah that's a
great question and you know AI can seem
like rocket science
and first off having this conversation
is the first step explaining what it is
and understanding it so they can
comprehend it is obviously the first
step where and where I've seen it work
most successfully is in in meaningful
simple pilot projects project maven
which is a project the DoD where they're
using AI to help with reconnaissance so
that Airmen are not staring at TV
screens for eight hours a day waiting
for something to happen
letting the AI do the mundane parts of
the job so our soldiers can do the
decision-making that kind of application
of AI is well established people know
how to do it the network you don't need
to invent a new neural network to do it
it's the same same work that's being
done elsewhere but by creating these
pilot projects inside of these agencies
they're dramatically improving the lives
of the people that work there so do we
believe we're at a point now where the
agencies can be the ones that are
involved in training the algorithm okay
you find an algorithm you figure out
what data set you need to train it and
do you expect the person that Department
of Interior to be the one training that
or is it folks that are providing that
that sort of
you can do it both ways I've definitely
seen public partnerships where agencies
are going outside for consulting to help
apply a I technology to a specific
problem or in some cases the neural
networks are well-established image
recognition is a well as where AI
started it is a well-established
technique their networks are open source
the software is open source in public so
I think if you find those use cases off
the bat that are well published and and
well spoken in these AI conferences well
shared the beauty about AIS is
incredibly open it's being done in the
open-source community it's all being
published and it takes very little work
to take one of those established
workflows and apply it so that the then
the next step is to share that success
dr. Kawasaki so the underpinnings of AI
today so that AI has changed over the
last 80 years and it's almost surely
will change we talked about neural
networks five years from now
I almost surely I'm on TV but I
guarantee it's gonna be something
different so but the underpinnings are
you have data you have model you have
inferences you have data that has
statistical distribution whether it's
images whether it's a car driving down
the road collecting video and the US or
Canada or whatever different different
statistics that you build models the
models try to understand the statistics
of the data and then you can ask the
model questions is this a cat or a dog
is there a stop sign approaching me
that's basically what AI is today so if
you just take these simple underpinnings
and then apply them to whatever a public
policy or application CIOs want to
insert it into their business workflows
and so forth
that's where just understanding that bad
basic element there's gonna be some some
data it'll have some statistical poverty
properties maybe you'll be difficult for
a human to understand them a machine
what could be better and faster more
robust or power efficient than the brain
and then it can perform inferences and
whether or not you choose to rely on
these inferences
depends on how successful how good the
model is how much assurances of
correctness you have I mean the
landscape of AI is so vast and it's
touching so many different things and
it's still I would again stress that
it's very early on we don't have
artificial agents making decisions for
us almost anywhere so even in finance
you would expect automated trading
systems there it's not there yet we're
still in the very early stages there is
not wise put it adoption in industry it
will get there but it's still early on
but again the AI the underpinnings and
the applications is this model data in
France you can stick it in anywhere
where that works so and it just in time
I'll keep this short I I want to
distinguish between at least two
different things one is face recognition
in that class of things versus shared
decision-making I think the answer for
things like face recognition relatively
straightforward it's the you know at the
risk of oversimplifying it's like asking
the question when can we how can we
integrate the Internet how can we
integrate telephones or how can we
integrate money it's relatively straight
for it's well understood it's very clear
and you can ask yourself how to use this
screwdriver the shared decision-making
is what's difficult that requires that
the domain experts are part of the
fundamental conversation the research
question from my point of view is
figuring out how to be able to use
humans in order to train the systems
that we have when they don't understand
machine learning in AI but they do
understand their domain how do you get
those people to talk to one another I'm
not worried about the deployment of face
recognition I'm worried about how I'm
gonna get and you know an intelligence
analyst to understand enough about what
it is they're doing so that they can
communicate to a system that will work
with them in order to make decisions
that's where the difficult problem is
but it's really no different than just
trying to understand what it is they
actually do the problem is and the thing
that we know is that people are terrible
at telling you what it is that they do
you can't ask them and they tell you you
have to watch them observe them model
them and give them feedback it's an
iterative ongoing process I wonder if an
approach would be to focus on outcomes
and metrics and Grand Challenges and if
you ask for those rather than
demanding AI and then they have to
resort to AI to satisfy those those
mandates that that might work one minute
for awful y'all all for you all to
answer these two questions what data
sets in the government do you want
access to or should the AI community of
people that are working on these
challenges get access to and what skill
sets should our kids in college
beginning in order to make sure that
they can handle the next phase when it
comes to artificial intelligence all of
them and the skills that the students
need in college they need to understand
computing there shouldn't be a single
person who graduates with a college
degree who hasn't taken three or four
classes in computing at the upper
division level they need to understand
statistics and they understand what it
means to take unstructured data and turn
it into structured data that they can
construct problems around so on the data
sets things like NOAA weather data
things that are not sensitive have
private information though it does will
be the first and there was a vast trove
of this there's to be immediately usable
by academics but on the skillset side I
think I would just if I were to pick one
it would be computer science I would
invest as much as possible and teaching
computer science K through 12 especially
in high school dr. SEO research funded
by NIH by NSF DARPA etc is often not
available under open access write
journals keep it behind paywalls
that's changing way too slowly so the
data set that I would like everybody
human and machine to have access to is
the the data and the articles that you
and we as taxpayers paid for I think
that's incredibly informant as far as
the skill sets I would say that
everybody in college to be able to write
a simple computer program and to do a
simple analysis and we can get there and
remarkably it's not required dr. bot
last word
I certainly would love to see all the
datasets I certainly also would like to
see access to the problems around
healthcare and I know those are
sensitive topics but the problem is too
important the opportunity is too great
and it is where I feel like AI will
truly save save lives if we can figure
out how to make that data available it
would be an amazing achievement in terms
of Education
I believe that data science is becoming
a science again and I also feel like
training a neural network is not that
hard I think every it can be done at the
junior high level and the access to
technology is available today and I
think we should start teaching students
what this tool can do because it really
is a tool and it will inspire new
applications that will come from the
interns the undergrads the the college
students that that's what makes this fun
well gentlemen I think my colleagues
would agree with me on this this has
been a helpful conversation there's a
lot packed into y'all's testimony that's
gonna help us to continue to do our work
on the Oversight Committee and to look
at opening up some of these data sets
how do we double down on NSF funding how
do we focus on getting you know more I
think every kid in middle school should
have access to a coding class and we're
working on that stuff down in the great
state of Texas and many of these points
that you make we're gonna be talking to
folks in the government in early March
in the second series of this AI series
we're gonna be we intended to invite GSA
NSF DoD DHS and to have to continue this
conversation about how they are
introducing and looking at artificial
intelligence and what more support they
need for Congress so again I want to
thank y'all and the witnesses for
appearing before us today the hearing
record will remain open for two weeks
for any member to submit a written
opening statement or questions for the
record and if there's no further
business
without objection the subcommittee
stands adjourned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
