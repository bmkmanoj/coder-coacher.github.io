sounds pretty good not bad okay so we
have a lot of heavy-duty questions and
things to ponder tonight
so I thought maybe we would start with
something a little lighter and more
personal there's a really wonderful
essay toward the beginning of this book
science in the soul I have a bound
galleys which gives me complete license
to write all over these pages which you
won't want to do with your copy of the
book but there's I'd like to read what
you so I wonder dr. Dawkins you have
this wonderful essay about being
influenced by Charles Darwin and by dr.
Doolittle how many of you have read the
hugh fleming book dr. de Latour or seen
the film with Rex Harrison
oh so you all know you pretty much know
that's pretty good well I do think
there's some similarity between dr.
Doolittle and at least the young Darwin
I mean they're roughly contemporary and
dr. Doolittle was always sort of sailing
in little ships rather like the Beagle
and he was a great naturalist like
Charles Darwin and they both loved
animals and I think I was genuinely
influenced by dr. Doolittle I read all
the books I think I've never seen any of
the films thank goodness I'd like the
Rex Harrison is pretty good are they won
that one yeah I always think that if you
really love a book seeing a film spoils
it but but anyway I love dr. Doolittle
and I think he did influence me I think
he influenced me to value non-human
animals in a way that I might not
otherwise have done he's actually
censored in quite a lot of libraries
he's not allowed in public libraries
because of racism and that was just a
symptom of the nineteen twenties which
is when Hugh lofting wrote the books I
mean everywhere everybody in Britain was
racist at the time and but in a very
gentle kind of way but I think that he
that dr. Dolittle more
more than makes up for it by his auntie
speciesism
well dr. Doolittle as you point out in
the essay he he gets into fixes over and
over again in which he has helped out of
them by by other animals who figure
things out what he needs and sort of
form webs of rescue for him yes so he
couldn't even talk to two non-human
animals and that's really the plot of
all the all the stories and everything
turned on this one trick that he has
he's rather like good science fiction
where you just alter one thing and and
then everything else follows from that
well it struck me reading it that's in
the last couple of years we've had quite
a number of best-selling books and some
of them very good for example a book
called beyond words by Karl Safina who
was a wonderful marine biologist a book
called the soul of the octopus by sy
Montgomery who's a wonderful science
writer and and they're focused on animal
consciousness and as Carl Safina says
you know animals care about their own
life they want to increase their own
life and they care about it furthering
their own life just the way you and I do
and of course there's a there's kind of
a plea at the center of these books for
us to understand that we can't just be
wiping these creatures off the face of
the earth and what I like about the dr.
Dolittle analogy or connection is is
that he is helped and aided by these
animals in ways that we are also aided
by animals really without our
understanding how we are connected to
them quite consciously all the time yes
I think it's a bit of a stretch to to
link it in quite that way and it is a
children's book and that's true
all right you're so right actually
another of another of the early in the
book concepts I mean your writing is so
accessible and it's just charming and
easy to read but then you have some you
know real concepts that really make you
sit down and think about them pretty
hard and one of them I've just been
really pondering a lot is is your your
discussion of how humans and how this
moment in time organisms are adapted
perfectly because of this process of
natural selection which is law-like and
has been selecting genes over eons to
bring the next generation forth is is
perfectly well adapted to the past but
not to the present or to the future and
that along with that when we have these
aggregates of lots of successful humans
as we have now we have these what you
call emergent I don't know if we're
going to call them qualities or things
that are we create together such as
something like the Internet which then
again is a little bit beyond our own
capacity to to deal with perfectly well
we're always going to be a little bit
misaligned with our own present this
idea of of time I think an hour
placement in it is is it very
beautifully framed by the beginning
opening of your book and I wonder if you
would read from that so this is the
introduction which I wrote specially for
this book much of the rest of the book
is previously published essays although
many of them not previously published in
this country this is the introduction I
am writing this two days after a
breathtaking visit to Arizona's Grand
Canyon breathtaking still hasn't gone
the way of Awesome although I fear it
may
to many Native American tribes the Grand
Canyon is a sacred place site of
numerous origin myths from the Havasupai
to the Zuni hashed repose of the Hopi
dead if I were forced to choose a
religion that's the kind of religion I
could go for the Grand Canyon confers
stature on a religion outclassing the
petty smallness of the Abrahamic s' the
three squabbling cults which through
historical accident still afflict the
world in the dark night I walked out
along the south rim of the canyon lay
down on a low wall and gazed up at the
Milky Way I was looking back in time
witnessing a scene from a hundred
thousand years ago for that is when the
light set out on its long quest to dive
through my pupils and spark my retinas
at dawn the following morning I returned
to the spot shuddered with vertigo as I
realized where I had been lying in the
dark and looked down towards the canyons
floor again I was gazing into the past
two billion years in this case back to a
time when only microbes stirred
sightless beneath the milky way if Hopi
Souls were sleeping in that majestic
hush they were joined by the rockbound
ghosts of trilobites and crinoids
brachiopods and bela mites ammonites
even dinosaurs
was at some point in the mile long
evolutionary progression up the canyon
strata when something could call a soul
sprang into existence like a light
suddenly switched on or did the soul
creep stealthily into the world a dim
thousandth of a soul in a pulsating
tubeworm a tenth of a soul in a
coelacanth half a soul in natashia
then a typical human soul eventually a
soul on the scale of a Beethoven or a
Mandela or is it just silly to speak of
souls at all not silly if you mean
something like an overwhelming sense of
subjective personal identity each one of
us knows we possess it even if as many
modern thinkers over it is an illusion
an illusion constructed as Darwinian
smight speculate because a coherent
agency of singular purpose helps us to
survive
so I'll tell you what I wrote in my book
upon reading those those paragraphs is
Richard Dawkins getting spiritual on us
well that's part of the point I mean
it's kind of meant to be a little bit
provocative to put the word soul in the
title I said last night that I quoted
one of my great heroes Peter Medawar
great medical scientists and biologists
and Nobel Prize winner he said I hope I
shall not be giving election he said I
hope I shall not be thought ungracious
if I say at the outset that nothing on
earth would have induced me to attend
the kind of lecture you may think I'm
about to give and I then said I hope I
may not be thought I hope I shall not be
thought ungracious if I say at the
outset that if you have come hoping from
the word soul to witness some kind of
conversion you're going to be
disappointed that there are two meanings
of the word sÃ¶lden as in summer in the
book I quote two dictionary definitions
definitions from the oxford dictionary
one of which is the immortal soul the
religious soul the supernatural soul the
one that survives your death and that's
not what I'm talking about and the other
is the sort of spiritual aesthetic
emotional response to science to the
universe to life to deep time deep space
that kind of thing that's the sense of
soul in which I use it in the title I
wonder if you could if you could
elaborate a little on this emergent
concept yes well you were saying earlier
about how it's a very interesting point
you are making about how we are adapted
to the past all animals are adapted to
the past that the genes that made us are
genes that have survived through
countless generations you look back on
your ancestors and every single one of
your ancestors they're not a single one
of your ancestors
died before achieving at least one
heterosexual copulation obvious but it's
very significant because very very many
of their contemporaries died without her
or died young died without having
succeeded in reproducing so we we
contain the genes that helped our
ancestors to survive in the past I've
got a phrase which appears in the book
and have a lot of others of my books the
genetic Book of the Dead the genetic
Book of the Dead is the genes in a
modern animal which in a sense describes
the past there's a the G's in in an
animal can be thought of as a kind of
digital description of the world in
which the ancestors of the past survived
not the present and not the future and
as Mary Ellen has just pointed out
emergent properties mean that the future
is going to be different and in the case
of human emergent property is very very
different because we are changing
environment at breakneck pace much much
faster I suppose than any other animal
has ever done in a way it's amazing that
we do thrive so well in an environment
which is radically different from the
environment in which our genes survived
in the past we wear clothes we live in
huge cities we get around in fast cars
and fast planes and things like that we
do suffer from psychological problems
probably because the world in which we
live now is so different from the one in
which our biology was naturally selected
and this is all comes under the heading
of emergent properties so there's this
very beautiful passage you know that the
beginning that you that you've quoted
here where you framed of the very very
long geological time frame and then
the cosmic timeframe and then we have
this person you observing both and then
you're talking about this past that we
are very well adapted for but this
emergent future to which we are hurtling
and we're creating it as we hurtle now
this rate of change why has it increased
has it increased have we been increasing
it because of our increased numbers or
what's what's causing this I mean I
think we it is increasing and if you
think about the well you if you go back
to the Stone Age Bronze Age Iron Age and
so on that's you know hugely huge spans
of time in between each of those major
advances agriculture ten thousand years
ago ten thousand years or so then the
Industrial Revolution the invention of
printing nowadays we have the computer
we have computers Moore's Law the
exponential increase in the power of
computers the speed and economy the
speed and cheapness of computers we're
living in an astonishingly fast changing
world and it's not showing no signs of
slowing down it's it's still
accelerating so two questions kind of
related to that one is it would seem
that that it's that we are almost we're
driven by our own invention of our own
tools the tools of perception in
particular go starting with more
referencing perhaps Galileo's telescope
but satellite technology the microscope
the ability that we have to drill down
ever ever deeper to ever ever more you
know finely granulated discernments of
what reality is and then you know in
this in this way that becomes very
social like with the internet and
Facebook and Twitter becoming ways that
we actually organize ourselves socially
it would seem that our tool making is
actually driving our social behavior in
many ways
and I wonder what you think about that
it's not like we decided that our arts
that our culture that our understanding
of history would be what determine us
but our our tool-making is really the
thing it would seem yes and I think
there's a kind of it's it's rather like
what biologists call a coevolution of
advances make way for the next advance
and in in our case I think we have in in
the world of computers we have software
hardware coevolution where advances in
hardware make possible software that
wouldn't have been wouldn't have been
possible before the hardware was
invented and then so each one paves the
way as it were opens the door for the
next advance and it and that is getting
faster I have to say it would seem that
one thing we're sort of dispensing with
kind of willy-nilly as we go is is
biology the biology biological reality
of other species one of the things there
seems a couple of thresholds that we've
passed without really fully grokking
what we've done one is that the
aggregate number of human beings on this
earth has become a bio geophysical force
discernible in the fossil record the
American Society for geophysicists or
it's the American I never get it right
but they want to now call our Epoque the
Anthropocene to reflect this in profound
impact of humans on on life on earth now
one of the things that we're doing is
we're reducing biodiversity of other
species the way that some scientists put
it is we're using up too much
photosynthesis so we're actually
depriving other species of
photosynthesis
but mostly it's really that we're taking
away their habitat because we're we're
putting so many more human bodies on the
earth that we're converting their
habitats to human buildings for people
to live in and agriculture to feed
people but but we're doing something
very scary to may very dangerous and and
kind of tragic which is reducing
diversity itself and I wonder if you
could tell us about diversity in a
you know going back to the very profound
and simple mechanism of natural
selection and how it depends on
diversity how our life has a defense
depended on diversity and what are some
of the how do you see the horizon as we
take it out I think it's more your
subject than mine actually Mariel and I
mean but I mourn as you do the loss of
diversity and I mourn the extinction of
species if only it's an aesthetic level
I mean I think I think it's some that
there be mass extinctions before and
sometimes people say oh well the mass
extinction the so-called six extinction
that that humans are now causing it's no
worse than the previous ones no worse
than the one that wiped out the
dinosaurs and things well maybe not but
it's tragic and I I respond to it in an
emotional aesthetic way I I'm ORN the
loss of Silas Silas I mourn the the loss
of the dodo the passenger pigeon but
what you're talking about is something
bigger than that which is that the
catastrophic loss of species and
ecologists tell us that it this is more
than just the loss they actually our
species are actually necessary for the
continuation of the balance of the other
ecosystem you know I think it intersects
pretty pretty strongly with with your
expertise because you know you were
talking about the the genes that are
this genetic book of life but when I
first started writing about evolution
myself and I was taught by evolutionary
biologists that some species like an
octopus has conserved species conserved
genes in it that are so ancient because
it octopus is eventually way back in
time evolved from ammonites from from
different species that some in some
cases no longer exist but that those
conserved genes that have persisted
through the eons
are very likely to be genes that are the
most Hardy and the most adaptable to
future scenarios so it's very important
actually to conserve especially species
that have those ancient lineages because
those conserved genes are perhaps more
important than more recent genes that's
very interesting I didn't know that that
is interesting it is it is fascinating
how some animals have have conserved
things for very very long times and
other others have this enormous variance
in the in the the the in the in the
sheer age of genes yes well good to go
back to your own words because it really
is more important to stay in your world
although I think they overs over
intersect quite much right in that
introduction you have a sentence that
says it's not an unreasonable
speculation that the progressive growth
of consciousness in the infant mirrors a
similar progression over the longer time
scale of evolution does a fish say have
a rudimentary feeling of conscious
personhood now to connect that a little
bit with another essay that you have
somewhat later which is a really
fascinating essay about the Internet in
which you you wonder if if here's here's
a sentence from it the chapter is called
net gain and it's about how the Internet
may be changing the way we think and
here's your sentence the unplanned
worldwide unification that the web is
achieving mirrors the evolution of the
nervous system in multicellular animals
and then a little bit later you say the
cloud is a superhuman interstellar
traveler who's nervous system consists
of units that communicate with each
other by radio orders of magnitude
faster than our puttering nerve impulses
but in what sense is the cloud to be
seen as a single individual rather than
a society yes I mean I should interject
there that this cloud that you're
talking about is is from science fiction
it's a massage fiction book by Fred
Hoyle
Fred holism is or was a great astronomer
and he wrote a lot of science fiction
much of it not very good but his
souse fiction his first science-fiction
book is extremely good is called the
black cloud and it's marred only by the
obnoxious hero which you can't help
wondering maybe modeled on the also
because the same obnoxious hero keeps
turning up you know you know Fred Hoyles
under a different name and is supposed
to be different character he's always
always equally horrible anyway the black
cloud is a superhuman mega mega super
human organism that appears that comes
towards the Sun tough to feed on the
energy of the Sun and eventually the
human scientists on earth get in touch
with it and manage to communicate with
it and learn about it and its different
parts of the of the cloud communicate
with each other by radio and the
scientists raise the very interesting
question in what sense are you the cloud
a single individual and the cloud
replies well if the question doesn't
mean very much when when the rate of
communication the speed of communication
between the between the different
communicators is very very fast you
might as well stop talking about them as
different individuals altogether and if
all of us could communicate
telepathically with each other instead
of having to go through the slow
bottleneck of speech if we could all as
it were communicate our thoughts
directly by at the speed of light speed
of radio waves then we would be one
individual wouldn't mean anything to
actually talk about ourselves as being
separate individuals and I think the
point you're getting at is that the
Internet may be moving towards a sort of
science fiction future where it becomes
a single being
a single living organism of some kind
and I think also enough of the passages
you read made an analogy with the
development of a child where it's been
suggested that the consciousness of an
individual child forms itself as a kind
of melding of separate entities the
child starts off not as a single agent
at all but becomes a single agent
through the same sort of melding as we
just been talking about it's pretty it's
all pretty fascinating it's it's as
Charles Dickens said the best of times
in the worst of times I mean looking at
it both ways it seems exciting yeah
that's what that's the way I feel at
times on the west of time and then it's
terrifying at the same time
speaking of which just reading I was
rereading The Selfish Gene which I read
many years ago and I was reading a very
contemporary book called the gene which
is just out in the last year which is
also very good and I was I was just
remarking to myself how how how timeless
your book The Selfish Gene is that the
the profundity of what you're explaining
in that book hasn't changed that much in
the decades since it was published thank
you for that that's I'm glad about that
well in my my opinion but a couple of
things have changed
and one is our ability to mess with the
gene so now humans can we can alter the
gene at the germ level we take out we
can suppress the expression of certain
genes and we've also developed the
ability to insert influences on genes
and I wondered if you would explain what
CRISPR is to the audience some of you
probably know but not everybody does and
and tell us what you think about this
this moment in time when we've perhaps
become the blind watchmaker ourselves
yes as it happens I've read I read
coming on the plane coming over from
England a very interesting book on
CRISPR by Jennifer Doudna who lives in
his past she's a professor at Berkeley
going on planes as a wonderful
opportunity to read books isn't it you
know separated I read this entire book
between London and New York reading an
entire book by the way is more than
Donald Trump has done in his whole adult
genetic manipulation the actual changing
of genes is something that has been
possible to do only relatively recently
and one of the main ways of doing it has
been to transplant genes from one
organism into another one and you've
probably heard about cats that glow blue
because they've had jellyfish genes put
them in them and things like that
CRISPR is a new technique which Jennifer
Doudna was one of the main pioneers of
and it's a wonderful book I do recommend
it it's called Kraken creation and it's
kind of semi autobiographical about her
career but it's it explains all about
the technique of CRISPR and the
misgivings that she has about its
possible misuse and the power that it
might might have it is a very very
powerful fast technique for changing
rapidly writing actually programming
genes in organisms any organism you like
it comes from bacteria bacteria have
their own immune system against viruses
bacteria are very very heavily afflicted
by viruses called what they called rages
that's right thank you that bacteria
phages and the the technique that
bacteria used in order to recognize
viruses in order to in order to kill
them is a technique that humans can now
exploit in order to edit genes of any
organism you you you like so it's an
immensely powerful new technique and
it's giving rise to great possibilities
and also great misgivings whereas in the
past until for the first several well
actually thousands of years we have
controlled evolution by manipulating the
selection part of the Darwinian equation
the non-random survival the non-random
reaper
we've controlled that to produce dogs
that are wolves that have been changed
in Topeka nieces and poodles and
Bulldogs and corn that corncobs changing
from that size in the wild to huge great
things cabbages things like kale
kohlrabi cauliflower broccoli all these
things are modified versions of the wild
cabbage Brassica oleracea that's been
going on for hundreds of years but now
we can actually change the mutation part
of the Darwinian equation not only the
selection part and this is much faster
much more powerful potentially very
dangerous and people are worried about
it
so yeah I mean we recommend the book
very good this might sound like a very
might being over simple question but
let's say someone messes with a gene in
humans and creates some some kind of
human that is dangerous and from science
fiction could what would happen after
that is is it possible that we that
something could be released that could
never be well I suppose it is I mean the
the sort of ethical discussion partly
centers on the distinction I do croak a
bit because I had a stroke a year and a
half ago and it's the one thing that's
still there is this is my croaking voice
the the distinction between negative and
positive manipulation it's already being
used quite successfully and with rather
little objection I think for removing
genetic disorders things like
haemophilia Huntington's disease to shed
muscular dystrophy things like that
there are some people who even object on
an ethical grants of doing that messing
with nature meddling with nature playing
God much more people object to positive
manipulation trying to change the genes
of a human so that they become better at
music say or mathematics or
john-paul or running or something like
that a lot of people have objections to
that I think partly because it sort of
smells a bit of Hitler trying to make
sort of blonde blue-eyed Aryans what he
called Aryans I think that you do need
to make an important distinction between
draconian dictatorial government imposed
genetic changing like Hitler was doing
and voluntary it's it's you can still
object to people the idea of people in
the future going to a doctor and saying
doctor I want my child to be a brilliant
musician please give her the right genes
which may be possible it's not possible
yet it seemed inevitable that we will do
it I mean yes and there are people who
do do object object to that meant many
people object to that actually and I can
kind of see why although if you sort of
think a little bit laterally we don't
worry too much about parents who are
ambitious to make their child into a
brilliant musician and force the child
to sit down at the piano for three hours
a day and work at it is that really all
that much different than putting a bar
gene into a child
I think I'd rather have the G doesn't
work but still it people are worried
about that and a nightmare visions of
regiments of saddam hussein's and
marching all with the same genes of a
brave new world Aldous Huxley kind of
world as you said Mariel in the best of
times and the worst of times it the
future can look pretty scary sometimes
we have some really fantastic questions
from this incredibly literate audience
and I'll since we're kind of on a
technical topic I will read this one
there's been many there have been many
recent advances in abiogenesis both in
the area of potential RNA components and
metabolism what are your views in this
area abiogenesis we're talking here
about the the beginnings of life that
the creation of life from non-life which
has to have happened at least once it
has to have happened at the origin of
life you may have happened more than
once and it's one of the big mysteries
that faces biology we don't know how it
happened it happened about 4 billion
years ago and they've been various
theories of how it might have happened
we know the kind of thing that it must
have been we know it was it was the
origin of the first self-replicating
entity in in in effect the first gene
once you've got the first gene it
needn't have been DNA almost certainly
wasn't DNA once you've got the first
gene the first self-replicating entity
then that's the prerequisite for
Darwinian natural selection to get going
once that started then the whole story
can take off and you get competition
between genes then building cells to
live in and then bodies composed of lots
of cells and so on and once that started
then we kind of understand what happened
we know then Darwinism took off and gave
rise to the full diversity and
complexity of life but how did that
first step happen it's a huge mystery
it couldn't have been DNA almost
certainly couldn't have been DNA that
started because DNA is what's being
called a high-tech replicator it's a
very very efficient replicator but it
needs a complicated infrastructure of
protein in order to do its replication
and you can't have a complicated
infrastructure of protein unless you've
got DNA so we have a catch-22 is we call
the catch-22 of the origin of life RNA
is a related molecule to DNA as many of
you no doubt know and RNA has always
kind of weakened replication from
property it is a replicator it's not as
good a replicator as DNA and it also has
the capacity to be an enzyme like
protein so RNA could have done both jobs
remember I talked about the catch-22 of
the of the origin of life or you can't
have DNA unless you've got protein new
contact protein let's see what DNA if
you've got RNA it can do both jobs you
can do the job of DNA and the job of
protein so the sort of current most
fashionable theory of abiogenesis at the
moment is that it was RNA that first
started things off and then the
replication function was taken over by
DNA and the enzyme function was taken
over by by protein
I'm going to aggregate a few questions
that have to do with machine machine
learning and artificial intelligence
once is how do humans adapt to the
coevolution of machines and their
inevitable evolution to learn is is
there a point that we must unplug I
guess that's kind of a question about
whirring as another one of the questions
does about artificial intelligence that
there's a another question references
Elon Musk's anxieties about a possible
threat from artificial intelligence yes
Elon Musk is worried about it and you
caught you and you must listen to Elon
Musk I mean he's he's Elon Musk is a
genius and there's no doubt about it
so is Stephen Hawking and he worries
about it as well I am as well as a
philosophical naturalist I'm committed
to the view that there's nothing in the
brain nothing in in our bodies nothing
in our brains that isn't physics I'm
committed so therefore to the view that
anything that our brains can do
potentially can be simulated can be done
also by machines so I think it is
definitely possible that machines will
do everything we can do and likely that
they'll do it better so it may not
happen for a long time but in principle
it's possible and various people
including Elon Musk are worried about
about it some people are worried about
are not being necessary anymore or our
jobs are going to be taken over by
robots and maybe will be dispensed with
altogether if they if they get to the
point where they could make their own
children make new new robots and they
don't even need us at all
and so we we go extinct and
Creations take over maybe they'll do a
better job than we do I don't know why
would be we would be so particularly
worried about that really well I bet I'd
be worried in exactly the same way as
I'm worried about losing the rhinoceros
and the elephant and it's it's an
aesthetic thing but for me I think I
think I would I would be sorry if
Shakespeare and Mozart and Schubert and
Michelangelo were forgotten and nobody
knew about them but of course there's no
reason why the robots shouldn't not have
not only know about Shakespeare but
actually appreciate him because we
remember we're talking about robots that
can do everything that humans can do
fall in love be wowed by great poetry
and great music maybe write better
poetry and better music
no no so best of times worst of times
yet again it's scary terrified but at
the same time exhilarating well we've
got a number of different questions here
about religion so I'll try to watch the
sack is them a little bit
so when are liberals afraid of Islam if
you could ask believers one question to
most shake their beliefs what would that
question me I have a question about the
statement that you make in one of your
essays that says will understand
religious behavior only after we have
renamed it and in that essay your I
didn't hear that's a you say will
understand religious behavior only after
we have renamed it so when we have
understood what what religious behavior
has been good for or why it evolved and
then we don't have to call it religion
anymore we can just understand that it
served a purpose or perhaps still does
yes I think what you're talking about
there is when I was when I was talking
about the evolutionary advantages of
religion where which in a sense there
has to be we are challenged to produce
an answer to the question what is the
Darwinian survival value of religion and
the reason that we're challenged to do
that is that religion is extremely
widespread it's - its ubiquitous in
human cultures that all human cultures I
think have something equivalent to
religion and so it suggests it really is
that a human universal and therefore
probably does need some kind of
explanation and I what I said was which
is what were what you're quoting there
what I said was that we have to rename
the question before we cannot before we
can answer it it may be it's the wrong
question to say what is the survival
value of religion it may be that the
right question is what is the survival
value of some psychological
predisposition which manifests itself as
religion under the right circumstances
so that's that what I mean by the
renaming we're reduced riving the
problem it's no longer the question
what's the survival value of religion
it's what's the survival value of a
psychological predisposition which might
be things like a tendency to obey
Authority a tendency to believe what
your elders and better
tell you a tendency to be scared of
dying something let's say a combination
of psychological predispositions which
manifest themselves as as religion
rather than ask the question what's the
survival value of religion I think
that's what I was meaning yeah but what
was the question that the card said
before you because I didn't really hear
that here's here's one there's a couple
of them humans are getting rid of
religion and replacing it with New Age
whoo rather than skepticism how do we
get rid of this danger dangerous
emerging trend another person wondering
what your thoughts on the future of
religion and governments are in the age
of artificial intelligence and never
dying superhumans and I think if you are
going to puncture someone a believers
belief how would you do it what would be
your main way to do that right okay well
take the last one first puncture read
the Bible
what was the earlier one our liberals
afraid of Islam sorry are liberals
afraid of Islam are liberals afraid of
Islam yes I mean you I think the
question of that may be referring to the
tendency for sort of nice people are
people my kind of people
to abandon their principles when talking
about the horrors of homophobia and
misogyny and things like that all these
things which we all hold dear when we
hate misogyny we hate homophobia but
when it comes to Islam this there are
many people in this country and in
Britain you forget all about that and
say oh well you know we don't criticize
that because that's religion that's
there that's part of their culture what
a patronizing condescending thing to say
margit now as who is an ex-muslim
X almost Muslim terrorist actor actually
who now runs a a magnificent foundation
called the Quilliam foundation to try to
reform Islam he coined the phrase
regressive left for this tendency to as
it were give Islam a free pass when you
talk about your principles about
feminism and about homophobia and and
things like that I think that it's that
this regressive left tendency in the in
liberals stems from partly from a terror
of being thought racist because they
mistakenly think that Islam is a race
which of course it isn't
well you laugh but it's very very
widespread if you can convert into it or
apostatize out of it
it's not a race
so that's I think that's that that
that's part of it
I think also is that it's a laudable
tendency to identify with victims of
oppression and we all do that at least I
hope we do and but I think they have
identified the wrong victims they think
that Muslims are victims of oppression
from the West
actually Muslims are the victims of
oppression from Islam especially Muslim
women Muslim gays X Muslims
apostates that that's the real
victimization that that's the real
problem and so I think we need to do for
magic now as they're trying to reform
Islam from from within and and that's a
very good thing to try to do ayaan Hirsi
Ali strive to do the same thing we in
the liberal community in the West need
to reform our view of who is the victim
here and who is doing the victimizing so
we do have a big problem with with this
idea of trying to reform religions that
are oppressive to people's human rights
and yet
saying that we should reform them is
only talking to people who already agree
that we should not be oppressing other
people's human rights what do we need to
replace religion with some other kind of
code of behavior what what what could be
effective and changing the way that
people aggregate their communities
around values I mean people that will
criticize your position on religion say
you're not getting the whole thing about
religion because religion is because
science does not explain everything and
there are there are beliefs that people
have that are spontaneous and continuous
over generations through history through
literature through art through music
many of the finest expressions of human
creativity
and what we would call religious so we
can't just get rid of religion one of
there's a there's a lot there and and I
mean there's there's science can't
explain everything
science can explain everything about the
real world
what
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
now I mean art and music and and
morality and they're there they're a
different matter science can't tell you
what's right and wrong probably although
Sam Harris might disagree there but
science certainly can help you enormous
Lee in thinking clearly about what to do
about what's for what's right and wrong
you can identify logical inconsistencies
in your moral position using scientific
reasoning and moral philosophical
reasoning which is a kind of application
of scientific method of thinking to
moral questions now things like you
mentioned art and music yes I mean many
many great works of art great works of
music are inspired by religion it's a
great mistake of course to think that
that makes religion in any way valid the
true only thing like that nothing -
nothing - nothing of the sort
it's entirely natural partly that great
music and great art should have been
inspired by religion because in past
centuries that's where the money was and
artists and musicians are sponsored by
rich benefactors in bark was employed as
a as a church Kapellmeister for example
Michelangelo was employed to paint the
Sistine Chapel but also religion of
course does provide did or has always
has provided genuine inspiration I mean
this is the story of Jesus's passion
Jesus's crucifixion is a tragic story
which not not surprisingly inspired
great artists and great musicians and we
we don't we shall never know what might
have worried if science if say Hyden had
written his evolution oratorio as that
of his creation or a
or Beethoven's mesozoic Symphony you
have you asked what what what do we
replace religion by well for all sorts
of different purposes from for morality
we replace it by moral philosophy for
music and so on I suggested you have
mind slightly facetiously that science
and indeed reality could provide
inspiration perhaps every bit as
beautiful as or just nature provides
beautiful inspiration for art community
religion has provided community where we
can do that in different ways we don't
need religion in order to provide a
sense of community a sense of oneness so
what do you think is going on here why
why do we have Donald Trump as our
president
scientifically speaking well I mean
partly because you have this dopey
electoral college system which by the
way is not quite so difficult to get rid
of as as people often think on paper
it's very very difficult to get rid of
because you need a two-thirds majority
in both houses of Congress I think and
then and then it needs to be ratified by
a substantial number of state
legislatures so just simply to abolish
the Electoral College at one stroke is a
very difficult thing to do but the
Constitution does allow each state to
change the way it chooses its delegates
to the electoral college
now Maine and Nebraska as you know do it
in a pro-rata way but they're very small
and so it doesn't make much difference
if California were to suddenly do what
Nebraska and Maine do and hope here
disaster because I mean it so you you
you you can't do that what you can do
what you what you could do is for
individual states in their own way
decide that they will follow the
Constitution and send all their
electoral college delegates one way or
the other but California for example
could decide that all its electoral
college delegates will vote in the
electoral college the way the entire
country vote so they would look at the
the popular vote in the entire country
and say right they they're all going to
vote that that way and that can be done
on a state-by-state basis it's not it
wouldn't be a drastic sudden change in
the way that suddenly going over to the
Nebraska main system would would be it
you don't have to wait until a
substantial number of states agree to do
it which is which is there there is this
move movement afoot as you as you may
know waiting for a certain number of
states to agree to do it
I don't you need wait for that because
individual states can do it it won't
make much difference to begin with but
it would get rid of the anomaly that you
have at present I think the Electoral
College when it first started was
probably rather a good idea and if you
could have a true Electoral College
where instead of the Electoral College
members being pledged to vote for
particular candidates that's when the
Roth set in if the Electoral College was
a good group of people elected to go to
Washington sit down together and
deliberate on who would make the best
president rather like we do when we
choose a new professor or a new
chancellor of the university or
something take up references read their
books read them
since we do have annulled Trump as our
president interview them so that that
the electoral college what why we got
Donald Trump well I recommend Michael
Moore's analysis if sorry you've seen
his his his I mean he he was one of the
few people who got the prediction right
and he's sort of talking about Rust Belt
people feeling inferior feeling left
behind feeling that there that world is
disappearing and they need defending
things like that so if you haven't seen
his his his an analysis well worth
looking at so to tie a two tack us back
to more scientific questions perhaps and
since we do have Donald Trump as
president I think this this question
might wrap it up well if a catastrophic
event resulted in the death of most
humans and rendered all electronics
useless how long would it take for
humans to evolve to survive in the wild
without technology and then a related
question from another person asking can
humans do you think humans will ever
evolve to the point of speciated
that we actually become split off into
more than one species yes well
speciation requires that there should be
some separation so that there's no gene
flow between the incipient species and
normally this happens by a geographical
accident time okay normally this happens
through a geographical accident where a
population gets split perhaps part of
the population finds itself or on on an
island and so there is no gene flow
between them and so they are free to
evolve in different directions and that
it's not going to happen on this planet
now isn't the opposite kind of happening
where we are we are becoming so much of
flowing into each other that were
actually yeah exactly so the only only
chance for humans to speciate would
probably be if a colony was set up on
Mars or something where and there was a
little gene flow between between
so that that was that question and the
allocate for getting what they would if
you could they were to push the time
since we only have time for one last
question I think that I'd like to ask
you what you would like to tell us if
there's something that you didn't come
up tonight I mean you are a person to
whom we are looking very earnestly for
guidance and helping us to synthesize
things that very often really feel very
separate our moral values our knowledge
of science our technologies our our past
our comprehension of our place in the
universe and what would you like us to
understand what what do you feel like
most of us are not getting it um I think
evidence is the only reason to believe
that anything is true
personal opinions feelings emotions are
fine and we all have them but they do
not tell you what's true and they don't
and they should not guide important
decisions like who you vote for and what
what you do what policy decisions that
you that you take evidence is the only
reason to believe anything that's as far
as believing things is concerned where
morality is concerned ethics is
concerned that needs to be intelligently
designed don't base your morality don't
base your politics don't base your
ethics on holy books or tradition or
revelation or authority based it on
intelligent design sitting down together
and trying to design the kind of society
you want to live in yeah ok that's it
that's it
so I hope you have enjoyed this
evening's program brought to you by the
Commonwealth Commonwealth Club of
Silicon Valley we would like to thank
Richard Dawkins author of Science in the
soul selected writings of a passionate
rationalist our audience here in Santa
Clara and those of you joining us on the
radio and the web and now this meeting
of the Commonwealth Club
is adjourned
that's fun
so Richard Dawkins will be signing books
we'd like you to sign up to have that
occur over here on the left because of
the number of people here tonight
there's no personalization just just the
autograph and no selfies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
