we're gonna return to some of those
themes a little bit later Satya but I
want to start with something that's a
little bit more in tune with your own
personal personality and that is your
love of cricket and I actually brought
something for you you know one of the
anecdotes one of the anecdotes the Satya
tells in the book that refresh is that
when he's on a conference call and so I
want to hand this to you think when he's
on a conference call he actually likes
to hold a kookaburra cricket ball so I
went literally to the ends of the earth
to find this thing and I just applied
tell us about your love of cricket what
it means to you and how it influences
your life is a person and a leader first
of all thank you so much and this is
probably you know the one thing that
people have found out because of the
book is I love cricket and so I've got a
lot of kookaburra balls now but I really
appreciate it you know growing up in
India I would say for South Asians this
very English game has become more than a
religion and how it happened is just
it's one of those artifacts of history
and for me when I look back I think it's
true in most team sports in fact the
other day I had in a great fortune of
going and seeing the Seahawks train and
heat was sort of explaining how we even
sets up the training session and it
brought back the memories because some
of the coaches like you know played
under and the captains I played under in
cricket
I think these team sports grab you and
teach you so many lessons in my case in
the dusty fields of the Deccan Plateau
in fact that is the place where I must
have played a lot of cricket and then I
went back recently and you know and so I
write about the lessons whether it's
about how to compete how do you know in
some sense one of the really incidents I
recount is a captain I played under one
I was a bowler and I was bowling trash
that day and so this guide replaces me
and takes a wicket it gets us a
breakthrough and then gives the ball
back and
incident has sort of perhaps had a lot
of influence because why did he do it he
could have just sort of broken all my
confidence thrown me out of the team but
for some reason he decided that you know
what I'm gonna give this ball back
because I went on to take more wickets
another decent season that ability that
sensibility of what leaders do to bring
teams along to do their best work you
can learn from team sport I know that it
also teaches endurance I believe one of
the types of cricket that you like to
watch and perhaps play is the Test
cricket can you explain for this
American audience yeah I mean yeah one
of my most there's a huge debate going
on in the cricket community because we
now have a version of cricket which is
like baseball which I know American
think is long but for us that's the
shortest form of cricket and whereas I
love the five-day Test cricket it's like
a Russian novel it's got plots and
subplots and it's just beautiful and and
so the debate really is how does that
continue in its popularity but
nevertheless I'm a big fan and I was
very clear even with ESPN cricinfo if
Test cricket goes away they'll lose one
fan at least yeah that's right and so
you actually got to sit down with ESPN
cricinfo the cricket info what was that
like because I know that was sort of a
highlight for you of the tour you know
it was it was really fun I'd never been
to Lourdes in London which is the home
of cricket as they like to call it
I've been past it but it never I mean
I'd watched it on telly a lot of times
but I never been in there so to go to
this hallowed ground and then you know
it's one of those other fascinating
things that happens I guess when people
go to places where you've read
everything about it and cricket has a
lot of literature by the way around it
and I've read everything now and so this
is one of those places that you walk in
after having read about everything for a
lifetime and then you see the place and
it was just fun and then to have an
interview as Frank Shaw who works with
me was telling me I don't know who was
excited whether the interviewer or I was
and I was really excited about that
that's great that's great all right
let's take a look at this picture
February 4th 2014 you were named the 3rd
CEO in Microsoft's history you're here
with
Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer the the
prior to what was going through your
mind at this point and and what do you
wish you could go back and tell that guy
in the middle right now about about what
he was about to face you know I thought
a mom a consummate insider I grew up in
the company that bill and Steve built
everything that I've learned everything
about me has been shaped by the company
I worked for which is Microsoft for now
25 years and obviously something that
wouldn't have happened but for one of
the greatest partnerships in business
history which is the partnership of Bill
and Steve and as I I distinctly remember
that day and leading up to that day
because it was not really long before
that day I even knew that I was going to
be CEO the thing that I was seeking the
most and in particular based on all of
the people around me that I you know you
see even in that photograph is asking
that existential question and being able
to answer it for myself which is why do
we as a company exist you could say what
you know what sort of a silly sort of
way to start but I do believe that I do
believe companies exist for the reason
there needs to be a sense of purpose if
there's going to be long-term success
you can't be group bound by one brand
one product one technology wave it's got
to go beyond that right because anything
that you started with it's not gonna
last forever but what is that core sense
of purpose that can really help drive
and then of course what's the culture
that will then help you
you know reinforce that sense of purpose
with every changing technology wave so
those were the things that I mean now I
see it even three-and-a-half and in fact
when I wrote this entire book came about
not as some kind of we reached on any
destination you anything its reflections
of a sitting CEO going
who that process that hard process of
transformation which by the way I posit
is a continuous process you'll never
ever reach your destination how do you
keep hitting refresh and being smart
about it
that's what I would sort of say I was
pretty naive even three and a half years
ago about all of what I at least now
know a bit off and all I know is I know
we need to learn a lot more looking at
this it strikes me that Bill and Paul
and then Bill and Steve had each other
there was a partnership there were two
partnerships that resulted in this
company really you don't have a singular
partner you have what you call in the
book a Legion of super-heroes right the
SLT is the Microsoft insiders would call
it how has that changed your leadership
of the company the way the company is
run and ultimately the culture of
Microsoft in fact Steve was the one who
was switched me on to this even which is
he had once reflected when he was CEO
about how even in his tenure and his and
Bill's 10 you as you you rightfully said
it was Paul and Bill and then bill and
Steve they built the company many
management people you know teams came
and went but they were constant and so
they could provide that continuity in
their own way and they realized that
when the next CEO is going to be in
place the way that CEO will need to
operate it's going to be very different
and also the business especially when I
was talking to Paul recently is when it
struck me right you know how different
the company is then the company that
Paul worked at in terms of its scope its
size its complexity its operations so
the thing that Steve was in fact trying
to even do in his own tenure at
Microsoft was to build more of a
leadership team for me of course it's an
absolute necessity there is no way I
could operate with the context and the
depth I mean Steve could do pretty much
anybody's job better than anybody I mean
he had such you know such immense
intellectual horsepower I clearly dog
and the thing that I wanted to make sure
is bring the team and also have that
ownership for this is our company and
that's something that I always felt
which is I really and this is not just
for the SLT I want people inside the
company to feel it's their company so
that they can use it as a platform to
realize their own mission and their own
personal philosophy and that's sort of
what I believe is applies to the
leadership team as well you said earlier
that you were the consummate insider and
you've said in the past that that gave
you the credibility internally to make
change you were not an outside person
coming in to make change now after three
and a half years the stock price is
double I recognize you don't have direct
control over the stock price but in fact
that is some external credibility that
you've gained through your leadership of
this company what do you plan to do with
that external credibility could you take
even bigger bets now on Microsoft's
feature given that kind of rope that
you've got on Wall Street I mean I think
you're absolutely right I mean tech
businesses in particular are about that
constant need to renew itself by taking
big bets because in some sense we are
we've got this attribute that things all
look like failures until they're not
there are pretty binary transitions
because of these network effects in
technology so you've got to be able to
see things that are changing long before
their conventional wisdom take bets and
then go after them in a strong way so to
your point but at the same time the
market is going to hold you accountable
now they want to pass judgment on your
judgment in some sense it's a rearview
mirror because they're trying to sort of
make sure that you're able to walk the
walk of producing results and then they
will give you permission so you've got
to get as I describe it you use a
cricketing raha metaphor a batting
average that is good and I think that in
Microsoft in our 43rd year think about
it this Vitara I mean here we are 43
years after inception fighting it out
with a whole set of new characters not
the ones that we competed with 43
years ago let alone ten years ago that I
think shows that we have that capability
the capability to renew ourselves we'll
hit some we'll miss some but we'll keep
at it but I'm very very excited about
what we're doing in mixed reality what
we're doing in AI what we're going to do
even in some really longer leade things
like quantum and by the way all these
efforts didn't get started three and a
half years ago it's really Bill who
started MSR it's Steve who started our
cloud push and so these are the folks
who saw it long before you know it was
conventional wisdom that these are the
things that can be successful and that I
think is key and you're right I mean as
an insider I've been through that
journey but at the same time I was also
very grounded on the things that needed
changing so along those lines one of the
things that struck me about the book and
it's fun to read a book like this as a
reporter has been covering the company
because you get the inside information
on some of the things you've been doing
that we've been reporting on and you
find out what really happens so apart
from the rose petals anecdote the witch
folks will have to find out about one of
my favorite anecdotes in the book gets
directly to this and that is how you and
amy hood decided to reorient Wall Street
you said we're not going to focus as
much on where we are in smartphones we
were gonna set a target twenty billion
dollars in cloud revenue and it was an
interesting mind exercise that you went
through to try and get Wall Street to
look elsewhere is that is that a good
approach would you give that give that
advice that other CEOs in the audience
to set goals like that and make them
externally because it's risky I mean
it's clearly I mean one of the things
it's it's not about looking elsewhere
but one of the key things that we felt
that we needed to make clear what what
frankly internally and externally is
what's the trend that we are really
capitalizing on and how are we winning
in that space because that I think was
going to be very important for the
confidence internally and externally the
reality was most people even today
should a view our cloud sometimes
narrowly by talking about it as hey here
is your competition with AWS that's one
space but if you look at even our cloud
we have our SAS applications with office
365
we have business applications with
Dynamics 365 we have a sure we are a
believer in distributed infrastructure
is not just as your Azure has an edge
with agile stack so we want to make sure
that it was clear both internally and
externally that we will have a big
business here but most importantly we
will innovate will serve our customers
and so you're right you have to take
that risk and it's our ability to walk
that walk quarter after quarter that's
really helped the street in some sense
say well this is a management team this
is a company that can in fact follow
through and we'll never be done oh yeah
I've been oh I'll have another quarterly
call in a few weeks and I have to show
up with a B and show our progress and
that's how it is and that's what's going
to give us permission to keep doing the
a I work the quantum work the mixed
reality work but I think that's what all
companies have to do which is you've got
to be able to perform but you got also a
crew power for the future because your
revenue one of the major cultural
changes we made even in the company was
not to fall in love with essentially
lead lagging indicators of success but
really fall in love with leading
indicators of success which is you know
usage customer satisfaction come long
before revenue and profit and we needed
to sort of make sure we are really
tracking that not just what we deliver
per quarter I want to talk about the
future of technology and that portion of
the conversation actually starts in an
unexpected place here with your son Zane
he was born with cerebral palsy and you
write in detail very candidly about your
early struggles with this but it has
totally changed your outlook on the
world on technology on your life walk us
through that if you would yeah I mean
Zane was born when I was 29 years old
and his but perhaps more than anything
else has shaped a lot of who I am
perhaps today especially that was
probably one of the more harder parts of
writing even in the book to go back and
reflect on it in more concrete terms as
to what he has taught me as a 29 year
old we
you know that both my wife and me we you
know were the only children of our
parents and so when Zane was about to be
born was all exciting in the house and
we were looking forward to him and the
nursery being ready and whether on who
would get back to her work or how
quickly can she get back to her work as
an architect which you just started but
of course that night when he was born
everything changed he was born because
of in uterus fixation with severe brain
damage which has led subsequently to
cerebral palsy and quite frankly tada I
struggled with it I struggled for it for
perhaps multiple years because none of
the well laid out plans or mine as sort
of a and you know a mid-level or even an
entry level engineer at Microsoft were
all sort of out of the window I needed
to sort of recalibrate and I for a long
time felt like why is this happened to
us and me and and then it's only by
watching my wife who even right after
recovering from her c-section was
driving Zane up and down the bridges
here to get him to therapies and give
him the best shot and that's what
perhaps you know really got me out of my
stupor and said okay how would I as a
father have to do and over the years
we've been blessed in this community
whether it's the Children's Hospital
it's the physical therapists the
occupational therapists the speech
therapist the community that we have now
around us and the connections and their
it role of Technology same you know has
gone through many you know sort of
hardships of you know medical surgeries
and what-have-you and there was even one
incident I remember one day I was
sitting waiting for him to come out of
his surgery room and then all of the
equipment around me a lot of thought was
windows and I was saying hey it was all
better work and and you know just sort
of you know gave me the feeling of all
the understanding of the responsibility
even of a platform company a technology
company because that's one of the things
that's very unique about Microsoft which
is we are in every power grid where
every hospital we're in every critical
part of our society and our economy and
we've got to take that responsibility
very very seriously how has it shaped
your views on the accessibility of
technology and making sure that everyone
can access the power of innovation and
to me my personal life of course has
been a great influence on how I think
about the importance of accessibility
but one of the things that I am seeing
inside of Microsoft is this universal
design and and accessibility as a real
driver of true innovation and I'll give
you a couple of things one of the apps
that we launched recently which was uses
the cutting-edge AI in our cloud around
computer vision and gives anybody with
visual impairment the capability to see
in fact Angela Mills was a co-worker of
mine whom I had worked with very early
on and as part of my Microsoft career
was telling me the story of how she now
can go into our own cafeteria at
Microsoft order with confidence because
she can see the food seaweed the
ingredients read the menu she can walk
into conference rooms you know we have
Braille readers and what have you but
the issue is she wants to walk into the
conference room knowing that that's the
right one not barge into something
that's not the one that she needs to and
she can do that now with confidence so
she is able to fully participate she's
empowered because of AI and we will
fully participate this is an app called
seeing a iOS and Android you can hold it
up to the world it identifies people who
will tell you the approximate age of
somebody it's kind of like sort of a
petri dish for AI technologies it's
really it's really cool and in fact
we're gonna try and even make it
extensible and there are already some
extensibility like it'll recognize
currency if you want a page awesome it
just you know it gives people more
empowerment who need it similarly what
we did with learning tools this is again
an another very passionate group inside
of Microsoft who said you know we have
some amazing technology around reading
which now makes with AI can change
the outcomes for kids with dyslexia so
now in Word and OneNote you have
learning tools so that you know kids or
anyone with dyslexia can start you know
reading faster better more comprehend
text Steve Gleason came to one of our
hackathons and again a group of
passionate people sort of said what can
we do for an als patient who has the
ability to move there has gaze I gaze
but all of the other muscles can't be
moved but can they communicate and so we
now have in Windows 10 in fact in the
fall creators update I gaze as an input
mechanism so I feel one of the things
that's being unlocked is this
fundamental recognition that it's not
just about accessibility as a tea
technology in fact we historically even
at Microsoft would think of it as oh wow
this is something that you do as
assistive technology have a niche as a
niche as a something that you do on top
of having built the product but the
reality is the one thing that is true in
all for all of us is at some point in
our life we all will need some help with
some sense of ours that's going to be
really the universal truth so we better
business design products so that it can
help everybody and that's what I think
we're trying to invoke and the beauty it
is of it is it's not some top-down thing
but frankly it is much more if you look
at our hackathons but they don't end
with just that one week we do it takes
life after that where product teams are
passionate only we have a long distance
to cover
but what Cortana can mean for
accessibility what you know mixed
reality can mean for accessibility these
are exciting frontiers and I think it's
gonna make us better AI company a better
devices company a better everything
company by sort of focusing in this area
great so let's talk about the future you
identify three trends in the book mixed
reality quantum computing and artificial
intelligence that are in your view going
to drive the future paint for us if you
will a picture of that future what is
the world going to be like if these
three
things come to fruition for our
grandkids or perhaps even our grandkids
grandkids what are you thinking about
now as you're laying the foundation for
that future you know one of the has
oddest things to do is speculate in
technology about the future but these
three trends broadly how they manifest
in you know specific terms I think will
be very path dependent it'll be
dependent on where we start so here's
how I think about big mixed reality
we've been on this journey where we've
been creating these mirror worlds right
which is we have been trying to create
metaphors that we find in the physical
space in a digital world desktop being a
great example of it but for the first
time we now have the ability to take
what you see and just superimpose on in
your field of view the digital artifacts
so in other words the analog and digital
medium can merge you can have a complete
you know immersive experience that's
what people call virtual reality or
people can in fact see the two together
and that's what people call augmented
reality our view is that that's a dial
that you get to set and we're in the
early stages of the devices but
ultimately my dream is that people will
have devices which would be like your
glasses that you will wear that you can
set dials and be able to sort of really
all computing experiences will be
mediated by this new medium now in order
to do that you really need AI I mean one
of the things that even in the hololens
today is a chip called HP you or the
holographic processing units it's one of
the first neural processing units
because what it does is it understands
spatially everything that is happening
and then is able to do this lock of on
digital object into real space it does
it that means it solves the computer
vision challenge so I think AI is going
to be very much
part of even bringing forth these new UI
metaphors in fact I look at what we're
doing with mixed reality as a gaze first
gesture first and a voice first
interface because you're not really
trying to do keyboard and mouse or touch
but it's really all about gaze and
speech and computer vision and so that's
the real AI capability that we want to
build now in AI I feel one of the
challenges we have and we talked about
all of the things but you know around
seeing AI or learning tools but even
take cortana one of the things that I'm
most excited about his AI that helps me
with my more scarce commodity which is
time every day I send lots of emails get
lots of emails I make in fact
commitments in email which I forget but
Cortana saves me every day because it
tells me oh you sent mail to todd saying
you'll follow up on Thursday and
Thursday comes and it'll wake up and
tell me have you followed up with Todd
so AI that helps me in fact focus get
more out of my time that's what we're
trying to do with something like Cortana
and I think that that's going to be the
real currency of our time which is I
always say it's not you know AI can help
you get stay distracted by engaging a
lot more on in you know in things that
you know take away time but the more
real at least purpose we need to solve
for is how does a I give you back more
time for the things that matter the most
to you and and quantum to me is if you
say well you know this is amazing we're
gonna have this mixed reality future
we're gonna have all this AI what's the
one thing that we need more off it's
computing in some sense in spite of all
the progress we've made what is still
not solved for let's talk about all the
computational problems that are not
solved we can't yet model that natural
enzyme in food production
we can't model the catalysts that can
absorb say the carbon in the air or
build a superconducting material for
lossless power transmission
those are all computational problems and
if you try to solve it using a classical
computer they'll take all the time from
sort of beginning of time to now and so
obviously we don't have that time and
that's where I think this advances in
quantum computing us is going to be
super important so I think of these
three things then are all on the same
they're not gonna be linearly juxtaposed
with each other but I do believe that
these three changes are going to be
profound in their impact in our lives
and in our work all three of these areas
are highly competitive Microsoft is far
from the only company pursuing them
you've got two competitors in particular
in Google and Apple that have an
advantage in that they have their own
large base of first party smartphone
hardware users how much of a
disadvantage is it for Microsoft that
you don't have that on the smart phone
now and how will you overcome it that's
a great it's it's a great question and
you know it's it's absolutely right
which is we want the 300 million pcs
sold and there's a billion smartphones
sold so rare rare and lies I guess the
map around the high volume device I take
inspiration quite frankly from our own
history and how others approached it
there was a time when the only hub for
all things was the PC and until it was
not and today of course the conventional
wisdom is that said this is the last
device that you will ever need and want
and have and if you don't participate in
it this second there is no way except
the two companies you mentioned were
born after or the rebirth at least of
Apple was off you know came not because
of their PC share going up it was mostly
because of what they did with the iPod
and the iPhone later so the question
really is for us how do we meet the
reality of today and then invent our own
future and the way I think of that is
first let's make sure our software and
applications are used on iOS and Android
so we want to be first class after all
most people don't remember this but
office was there on
Mac before Windows was even a platform
and so this is not new to us and we want
to go and make sure that whether it's
LinkedIn whether its Skype whether it is
office whether it's Outlook are used
every day how are our games minecraft we
want to make sure whether it's gaming or
productivity and communications do our
best work on iOS and Android we also
want to look at these changes inform
function what is a mobile device today
how is that one it should be shaped and
whether it's what we did with surface
after all or as a category worth two in
one nobody thought that there will be
such a category we invented it we
popularized it to the point that now we
have you know good competition that
means we've got to keep at it what's the
next forum function change and also what
are these new big changes like mixed
reality which in fact put everything up
in the air you know in terms of what's
the you know if you can start seeing
your computing in front of you you
probably not want to keep reaching out
to your phone as the hub for everything
so I feel we've got to do our best work
and take some bets some we will hit some
we won't but we are very committed to
both making sure that our cloud services
are available as great applications on
every mobile endpoint and we invent the
next set of devices the next set of form
factors with the next set of natural
interfaces have you given up on smart
phone hardware the thing that we
absolutely do not have the share to have
a smart phone hardware that's a real
consumer choice that's I think the
reality of it I think there's a lot of
press I think this week suddenly around
this but the reality is that we cannot
compete as a third ecosystem with such
you know with the ship with no share
position and attract developers so the
thing that we are doing is to make sure
that the software is available so that
we can service the enterprise customers
who really don't care about a lot of the
things that a consumer abroad car
consumer will care about
and it's one operating system for us so
it's not like we have a phone operating
system that is separate from the Xbox
operating system that's separate from
the Windows operating system it's one
platform and so that's where we are and
what we are now all in on is to say okay
what are we gonna do with surface one of
how we want to push the boundaries of
what is a PC even and all in on mixed
reality all in on gaming all in on all
of our applications on iOS and Android
and that's how we're gonna go at it you
just ask a good question what are you
going to do on surface well I'll tell
you we're to have a lot of exciting
things that are happening in surface is
there any kind of form factor that
you're most interested in that you have
not yet entered I mean I'm definitely
not gonna talk to you about it all the
Grieco a stage before I have the device
just you and me and a few of our friends
here but but I think the the lesson for
us one of the things that again Steve
was the one who really thought us this
was you gotta build the capability if
you think about even the last five years
or seven years the capability we now
have you know of being able to build
devices it's not about the device it's
the software plus the device and the
ability to know or even it's not even
just the device as a system it's even
the Asics like the HPU
the fact that we now have that
capability to do end-to-end as I like to
tell us from silicon to cloud is what
now we've got to use to innovate new
categories and clearly category creation
is going to be a big part of what we
have to do yesterday we had two of
Amazon's top executives Tony Reed the
head of echo and Alexa and Jeff will be
the CEO of Amazon's consumer business
you have a front row seat for a very
interesting story in technology even
apart from Microsoft right here in the
Seattle region
you've been partnering with Amazon
between Cortana and Alexa what are your
observations about Amazon and the growth
that they've seen every I think it's
Amazon's a very impressive company or
Jeff and his team of Don is something
that I think I've long admired and and I
think there's a lot that we can learn in
fact the good news I think is between
Microsoft
Amazon we have a lot of
cross-pollination of talent and it's I
think helpful for this region by the way
which I think was something that Silicon
Valley always had which i think is a
good thing for this region but I do I
mean right I mean I look at what we're
trying to do with even Alexa and echo in
particular it's very straightforward
which is I want to make sure that at any
point in time value that we can deliver
to customers is not artificially held
back because the way to reach them is
through someone else's platform I I felt
like one thing I've learned actually at
Microsoft is that and most people don't
think of it that way but that's the
lesson I learned from what we did with
office on the Macintosh to start with so
I thought that was you know Cortana is
going to be the assistant that helps me
with my time my productivity that's
going to be the unique skill so there's
no reason why I shouldn't have that that
capability if I'm a user of echo and
Alexa so that's the partnership we have
it's a it's a you know we're gonna see
you you know these are all about user
habits I am NOT a believer in that oh
there's going to be this one agent I
think each agent is going to have
different characteristics and you should
be able to scaffold these agents
together some of them after that so a
while of habitual use will even become
automatic that's what at least about
Jeff and I talked about and that's what
we would hope to see will we ever see a
Microsoft HQ to another headquarters
somewhere else in North America you know
we're very very happy where we are we I
love the in fact one of the things we're
also committed to is what I would say is
our development that's happening in many
parts of the world and many parts of the
United States we have a thriving Silicon
Valley office we in fact just broke
ground for a new office there we have a
fan big office in New York now we have
offices in Boston in Cambridge obviously
in China and in India and so I I mean I
I am at least you know no hurry to talk
about any HQ twos and
happy with where we are at Redmond if
the Amazon example is a good one because
it's emblematic of the approach you've
changed and you write about this in
detail and in one chapter of the book
with those industry partnerships
frenemies you're competing on some
fronts and you're cooperating on others
what's the most awkward moment you've
had has it been Salesforce when they
competed it or they disputed your
LinkedIn acquisition and how have you
navigated those I mean I think the
fundamental approach I always take is
how can we look at things which are so
that is a nonzero-sum and recognizing
where there is overlap and there is
going to be zero some competitions but
my in especially in today's day and age
right which is we are lucky
AHA as a company and as a community
intact
to be intact it's shaping every walk of
life every part of our economy and I
think it'll be really in something
short-sighted to view things inside of
our own industry as all zero-sum and so
that's at least an attitude that I come
out come up with you know come out with
and that's what sort of shapes a lot of
our party but at the same time we're
going to compete we compete with
Salesforce in business applications
head-on in fact we are the disruptor in
that space I'm so excited about what
we're doing with Dynamics in Dynamics
365 it completely changes the business
model the technology and everything but
at the same time Salesforce and office
365 for the users of those two clouds is
great integration and this is something
we did in the past as well whether it is
with Oracle or with s ap and so I want
to just bring that maturity I sort of
feel sometimes now what is needed is
customer obsession let's view three
things through how they view us versus
just our own strategic all the time and
then compete so I can't even believe we
haven't talked about the largest
acquisition in Microsoft's history which
closed less than a year ago LinkedIn in
our pre-event survey one of the biggest
concerns among attendees was privacy
data is one of the biggest assets that
you acquire through LinkedIn how can you
capitalize most on that data while still
being respectful of current and future
privacy concerns yeah I mean I think the
entire LinkedIn proposition franchise as
you said is built around trust trust
about the data of LinkedIn for and the
value LinkedIn provides to the user so
that's of the paramount importance and
that's why even when there were some
concerns about what we would do with it
it's very clear that there is no you
know we will only do things that the
community of LinkedIn gives us
permission and adds value to them so
that's not our data it's the data of the
the 500 million people who use LinkedIn
who are members of LinkedIn and that's
one of the things that I clear I want to
me I reinforced at Microsoft we don't
own data
it's either the user data or it's the
organizational data and we are
essentially entrusted to make it secure
be trend you know make it private and
make sure that we are there in control
and we're very transparent about all of
it and those principles is what guides
everything that we do whether it's in
office 365 or whether it's on LinkedIn
and if there is value in integration you
have to ask for permission and get that
permission and I think that's where
we're going and so things like GDP are
our recession essentially gonna
legislate that and so therefore that's
the front in a world we should build for
should we expect an acceleration of
integration between the companies we've
started to see a little bit of it
between LinkedIn and Microsoft in terms
of the products yeah I mean in fact I
feel very very good about one of my top
goals was the reacceleration
of LinkedIn and we'll talk more about
this even in the next quarterly earnings
but then on top of that the product
integrations the product integrations we
announced between office 365 and
LinkedIn between Dynamics 365 and
LinkedIn these are all there today
and and now customers benefit from it so
we're all in fact it's one of those
places where we have executed super well
on a large acquisition keeping their
ethos their culture their value
proposition accelerate that core asset
and then add these product integrations
not exclusively there can be others who
can also do these product integrations
so that's I think have been our strategy
before we close here I want to talk
about a couple of your personal
community initiatives you are on the
boards of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center dr. Gary Gilliland
Gilliland was here yesterday and also of
course of Starbucks Kevin Johnson was
here yesterday
share with us what you're hoping to
accomplish through those roles oh it's a
real privilege to be associated with
these iconic organizations in the
community and you know with Starbucks in
fact I you know Kevin was at Microsoft I
worked for Kevin when he was at
Microsoft and I've known him and I've
gotten to know Howard and I think what I
think he was here yesterday and I'm very
very excited about what Starbucks is
doing whether it's I mean ultimately
it's about that experience that they're
trying to create and using of digital
technology and to be on the board
to learn and to contribute I think
that's fantastic and what Gary and team
are doing at Fred hutch is just truly
inspiring to me to have even that goal
of solving cancer by you know you know
by the turn of the next decade as it's
an audacious goal it's one of these
places where again I had not understood
it which is one of the big league rate
limiters to even progress in cancer is
how can you take the research that is
happening and make it comprehensible in
sort of in a way so the new hypotheses
can be created by sort of the
researchers at Fred hutch and other
places so technology is gonna play a
huge role for me I'm learning so much
and Gary's an amazing leader in terms of
the organization
what a great team so it's fantastic to
be associated with both of these
organizations as you look to the future
I know that you're a big fan of poetry
is there a line or a phrase of poetry
that most capitalizes or summarizes your
view of the future personally and end of
Microsoft and of the technology industry
that's a great while as we were getting
ready to disclose at our ignite
conference a few weeks back some of our
quantum efforts so I had a chance to
spend a lot of time with Michael
Friedman who's a fields medal winning
mathematician who is part of our quantum
effort and he was schooling me on a lot
of the quantum technology and being a
mathematician so he asked me this
question is there I say do you know your
square roots I said what oh I think I
did I was not a great student but you
know I think I know square roots and he
says deal of square roots of imaginary
numbers and I didn't know where he was
going but it turns out that the square
roots of imaginary numbers have a lot to
do with quantum computers but there was
a line of poetry I read a couple of
years ago by Pulitzer prize-winning poet
called Vijay Sheshadri it's called
imaginary numbers and it goes something
like this it's the soul like the square
root of -1 is an impossibility that has
its uses and I think it just captures I
think a lot that force that's within us
that seeks out the unimaginable that
gets us up to solve the impossible and
so there is poetry behind square roots
of imaginary numbers well Satya Nadella
Microsoft CEO thank you very much very
much yes that they keep our son
