of you for for coming this afternoon
it's a real pleasure for me to be here
it's always a pleasure to be back at
Princeton it's always exciting to see
the incredible progress that is being
made here in the field of computer
science but frankly in so many fields
across the university that benefit from
computer science and of course it's
always exciting to be with Princeton
students there's nothing like a meeting
with Princeton students to keep anybody
who graduated from here or anywhere else
on their toes so this is a just a
wonderful time today I do want to talk
about what's going on in the world and
more importantly what we might expect to
see go on in the world as we think about
the rise of artificial intelligence it's
something that we've been giving a lot
of thought to it Microsoft and really
across the tech sector but we published
a book in January we call it the future
computed and unlike a lot of books that
just talk about where technology is
going or all the good things that
technology is going to do we really
focus on the role of artificial
intelligence in society and a big part
of what we focused on is what it will
mean for jobs and the economy which is
really what I want to talk about this
afternoon but one of the things we
really found ourselves concluding as we
put this together is that it's really
not all that helpful to think about
technological change in terms of what's
going to happen in a year or two years
indeed in a way that most people who
work in the technology sector perhaps
don't typically think about it really
helps to step back and look at periods
of 10 or 20 years and for those of you
who are students today I therefore
wanted to pause and spend a moment on
what life was like about the time you
were born because if you go back 20
years in 1998 and you asked how did
people begin their day it began with
what you see here there was really
nothing digital in the way people began
their day
it really began by turning on a
television listening to the radio
reading a paper newspaper pulling out a
calendar if you had to call somebody you
used an old phone and if you they
weren't there you left them a message on
their answering machine and if you were
around in 1998 what you would have found
is that perhaps the single most common
joke about technology is where other
people couldn't look at their VCRs the
things that we put cassette tapes into
record TV shows and get the thing that
just kept flashing 12 o'clock 12 o'clock
12 o'clock to ever change because you
had to use a controller to change it and
most people said this is just too
complicated I'll just turn it on when I
want well here we are in 2018 and in
this image I think captures the way we
live today I think for many people the
very first thing you reach for when you
wake up in the morning is your phone
I mean increasingly people sleep with it
next to their bed it's not altogether a
wise thing to do but it has become a
habit of our time and even if you manage
to keep it in another room you probably
find yourself very quickly reaching for
it or sitting down at a laptop or
desktop computer and that's where you
find out what happened in the world
that's where you get the world's news
but interestingly it's where you get
your news what happened to your friends
your family on your various social media
feeds and when you think about your day
you look at the calendar on your device
so the real question is what's life
going to be like in 20 years in 2038
now there is no perfect way to know but
I think it's fair to assume that it will
probably be grounded in artificial
intelligence we're already living with
so-called digital assistants whether
they're Siri or Cortana or Alexa and we
will probably have more than one helping
us just like we turn to more
one person during a day for advice and
help on different topics but instead of
just going to a news feed and scrolling
and flipping between
apps were more likely to have a digital
assistant will who will assemble the
information for us who will tell us
about today's weather who will tell us
about the traffic not for every highway
in the area but just talk to us and tell
us what the traffic is like for us in
fact I think it's altogether possible
that twenty years from now if you're a
man and you're shaving or if you're a
woman and you're putting on makeup
you're probably going to have your
digital assistant talking to you rather
than the radio as you get ready for the
day the real goal in our view is to make
sure that all of this technology
actually helps us that amplifies human
ingenuity but when we think about what
this is going to do to the way we live
our lives the jobs that will be
available that will hold we think that
the best way to start is to think about
what artificial intelligence really is
because we talked about it in the world
as if it's one thing and in some senses
it is it's the ability of machines to
take in data to learn and to make
decisions but it's also many things and
one way to think about it is some of the
big pieces that really do go into
artificial intelligence there's a big
part about AI that's really about
perception the ability of computers to
have vision
now of course machines have been able to
see since people invented cameras what's
different today is that machines can now
recognize those images and discern what
kinds of things are there who is there
all about that's fundamental to one part
of artificial intelligence and the same
goes for speech the ability of computers
to not only understand what is being
said the discern is meaning and there
have been huge steps forward in both of
these spaces over the last 10 years and
there will be ongoing improve
in these fields there will be
fundamental to advances in AI overall
now there is also cognition the ability
to think to reason and there are many
pieces that go into that but two that
stand out or one related to language the
ability to understand what is spoken or
written in one language and translated
into another something that Europeans
have long been very good at and we in
the United States not so much well the
good news is we may all be helped in
this space and similarly the ability to
sift through knowledge to find patterns
to identify trends and derive insights
and even reach conclusions all of these
things are advancing I sometimes think
that in the world today we read about AI
and we expect that there will suddenly
be one day when it's all here all at
once
well that's not really the way it works
each piece advances and we are already
living in a world where AI is around us
in pieces as it progresses but we don't
always stop and think about it but just
to give you a few examples BMW touts a
feature and some of its newest cars
called the pedestrian alert so the car
has a camera the camera is able to
recognize a human being and the car will
display that red icon even if it's in
the dark of night and the driver doesn't
see the coffee a pedestrian the car will
beep the car will even apply its brakes
that is one element of artificial
intelligence or to take another simple
app that you can get on your phone if
you like it's called steno
you can bring steno on your phone to a
meeting and it will not only record what
is being said but it will transcribe it
meaning it is understanding human speech
none of these things work with a hundred
percent perfection but guess what
neither do human beings so the real test
typically for artificial intelligence is
not
necessarily when will we get to a
hundred percent it's always when does
the computer get as good as an average
human being a talented human being or
maybe in an extraordinary circumstance a
Princeton student who's a human being
but it's making progress in all of these
areas similarly we're seeing this a
language translation Skype translator
for Microsoft is one of several things
where you can speak in one language and
then the computer will show the written
word in another language
we've now incorporated this into
PowerPoint it is not far-fetched at all
now to go to a meeting or two years from
now go to a meeting you could have
people who speak ten different languages
and instead of seeing a group of
translators in the back with with
earphones you basically have somebody
presenting slides and the computer
automatically translating everything so
then everybody in there your earpiece
can understand what is being said in
their own language that's here today or
for anybody who uses Spotify Netflix and
iTunes which I assume means every
student on this campus using at least
one of the above we're used to being
delivered suggestions for the next TV or
movie program we should watch or the
next song that we might want to listen
to all of that's machine learning it's
all based on the computer knowing that
we watched something else and appeared
to like it and then it is using machine
learning based on the pattern of what
other people who have liked that program
or song have tended to want to listen to
or watch as well now interestingly all
of these things are made possible by two
fundamental advances in computing they
are the fundamental engines of
innovation for every single thing they
make it all possible and it is the
characteristic of this particular decade
huge computational power meaning data
centers coupled with vast amounts of
data we build data centers around the
world as a company so does Amazon so
does Google the three of us probably
build far more data centers than
one else some of these data centers
would occupy multiple football fields in
space they have hundreds of thousands of
servers so it means that when people
want to do huge computations they no
longer have to build their own data
center they no longer have to get their
own rack of huge numbers of servers they
can simply contract for and use what
they want and use it when they need it
and similarly the fundamental engine for
all AI what you quickly appreciate
whenever you work with people who are
expert in this field is it's all about
the data and there is nothing like
getting more data in fact there's almost
an insatiable appetite for data because
the more data the better one can train
computers and perfect algorithms but
these two things are going to continue
to drive AI forward easily for the next
decade and beyond
all of that is very exciting all of that
delivers huge amounts of potential and
even promise for the world but as we
said in the book we really need to step
back and recognize that we can't afford
to look at this future with uncritical
eyes technology is always used in good
ways and bad and even when it's used in
good ways it has an impact that people
can't necessarily predict it has
indirect effects that are not
necessarily intended and what the world
needs to do is grapple with all of this
in the world today there is perhaps one
question above all else as we think
about AI as computers behave more like
human beings what is it going to mean
for us what is it going to mean for real
people we live increasingly at a time
when people are starting to recognize
these questions you see Stephen Hawking
you see many people Elon Musk and others
warning of the future that we are
creating I want to talk about that
future but in some ways the most
important thing I want to say as a
preface is a caveat the truth is there
is no crystal ball
for a long time I have admired futurists
they can stand up and confidently tell
you what the world will look like in ten
years and if they're wrong in ten years
you probably won't remember what they
said it's a wonderful job if you can get
it I think more than that we need to
stop an acknowledge at the get-go that
it is possible to discern a number of
trends and we can make decisions based
on those trends but there is no such
thing as a crystal ball none of us know
with certainty what lies ahead
so how do we predict what's coming that
really is the fundamental question how
do we figure this out there are many
ways and there's some exciting research
going on right here at Princeton but I
want to offer two thoughts two different
analytical approaches if you will to
think about what may be coming in the
store for all of us the first is to
learn from the past to learn from
history not because it will repeat
itself necessarily but because it
provides insights that we can draw on so
one of the great examples that we've
been interested in is the transition
from horses to automobiles and there's
some fascinating things one can learn
from it starts with this photograph this
is a photograph of what happened in
Germany in 1888 in August of 1888 there
was this woman Bertha Benz you've
probably never heard of Bertha Benz but
you've probably heard of her husband or
at least her husband's last name because
Karl Benz invented the first automobile
and is reflected in Mercedes Benz well
it turned out that Karl invented the car
and he took it for a drive out in the
driveway and he invited reporters and no
one took any interest at all
they said this thing's never going
anywhere well there was Bertha's dowry
that had paid for all of Karl's work she
was not willing to see her investment go
down the drain so on the morning of
August 4th in 1888 and there's a
powerful lesson here for both men and
women in the room
she got up and left her husband a note
while he was still asleep and she said
I'm taking our two sons and I'm taking
the car and I'm driving it to my
mother's house now the good news was she
was fully intending to come back but her
mother lived over 70 kilometres away so
the three of them got this car moving
they started driving over these dirt
roads they had to stop at pharmacies to
get chemicals to keep the car working
before the day was done Bertha had used
her garter belt to repair the car but by
the time this the son had said they had
reached her mother's house and the world
awakened the press took an interest they
recognized this has a future but
interestingly that was in 1888 people
were talking about the automobile well
here's a photograph taken on Broadway in
1905 almost two decades later but look
at that photograph what you see are our
Street trolleys and horses and there's
not an automobile anywhere so what it
shows you is that people start talking
about something before it necessarily
explodes but now look at this next
photograph at the exact same location
twenty years later and what you see are
automobiles and trolleys and not a
single horse this fellow lost his job
and what it tells us is that sometimes
we end up waiting longer than we expect
but once the technology diffuses it
moves very quickly and it's like a
tsunami that takes over and impacts
everything now what did that mean for
the economy well it turned out that that
supply the number of horses in the
country plummeted what did it mean for
jobs well in some ways you can see it
reflected in the number of companies in
the United States that were in the
business of building carriages to be
pulled by horses in 1890 there were over
13,000 company
in the United States in that business by
1929 it was less than a hundred and what
did it mean for jobs well in some ways
it was sort of easy to predict you think
about the jobs that went away the jobs
that involve the care and feeding of
horses the management of horses the
creation of carriages to be pulled by
horses they disappear it's not
necessarily a surprise you'd expect that
and simply you could look at the new
jobs well guess what a lot of new jobs
emerge that had to do with we'll call it
the care and feeding of automobiles
building them putting gasoline in them
being a mechanic and repairing them or
driving them that too is not altogether
surprising what is more important and I
think instructive for our whole future
is this there were a lot of indirect
economic effects that resulted consumer
credit is not something that you would
say was necessarily inherent in an
automobile but it turned out that
consumer credit was in effect an
invention so that people could buy
automobiles here was this expensive
thing people had to buy other than their
home it was the most expensive thing
they probably ever would buy the once
Henry Ford invented the Model T and the
assembly line there needed to be
consumer credit so people could afford
it a new branch of the financial sector
not only gave birth it exploded and so
there were people who were employed and
consumer credit because of the
automobile another really interesting
thing is what happened to the world of
advertising suddenly people were going
by these signs at a speed of 25 or 30
miles per hour they had to be able to
recognize a product and a company
immediately this gave birth to corporate
logos that the corporate logos that we
see today or BB the Princeton logo logos
were the result in a way in an important
indirect way of the invention of the
automobile so their advertising
as a result but it wasn't altogether
good news and the most sobering thing is
this it's what happened that caused the
Great Depression because in 1932 the US
Census Bureau put out a report that
basically said that the decline of the
horse was one of the main contributing
factors of the present economic
situation and it affected the entire
country well how could this be well the
answer when you start to think about it
and reason through it becomes clear in
1905 25% of all agricultural output of
the United States was used to feed
horses as the population of horses
decline farmers were smart they said you
know what horses like hay but people do
not they grew less hay they shifted
their acreage into wheat and corn and
because of the in elastic nature of
prices for crops they over produced and
the price of those crops plummeted once
the prices of those crops plummeted the
income of farmers plummeted and once the
income of farmers plummeted they lost
their ability to stay current with their
loans to rural banks the rural banks
started to a foreclose on the farmers
but they couldn't keep pace and then
rural banks started to fail and because
of the structure of the nation's
financial system at the time the
infection and World Bank's spread across
the country and led to what became a
broad financial collapse in fact if you
think about it some of the major things
that we take for granted today came out
of lessons of that experience subsidies
so that farmers wouldn't produce too
many crops the FDIC and insurance and
other things to regulate banks and what
it tells us I think more than anything
is we need to be prepared we need to be
prepared for the unexpected and we
may need to be agile as we think about
what we call on governments and
communities to do which i think is
sobering because in some ways we don't
live in a time of say the most agile
government in history in terms of how
our politics works regardless of what
part of the political spectrum you may
be on but we're going to have to get
ready to deal with new things there's
another powerful lesson from history I
think as we think about jobs and this is
the era that is one that some of us have
lived through in this room it's the one
that I first worked on when I became a
part of the industry in which I've now
worked office automation or processing
well it turned out in the 1960s when
this photograph was taken or even the
1970s or the first half of the 1980s
people wrote things out on pads of paper
and then you gave them to someone else
who used a typewriter to type it up if
you were working in an office that was
typically a secretary and more often or
not than not it was a woman if you were
a Princeton senior in 1981 and you were
dating somebody who were later become
your wife as I did
she wrote it up along hand and I stayed
up all night so I could type the last
chapter of her thesis things worked very
differently the world today is quite
different we all do our own writing on
our own devices but what is interesting
is this between then and now there came
a point in time when two things happen
to jobs relating to IT the first is
there was this change in jobs
secretarial jobs decline there became
fewer secretaries and the IT staff was
born every Enterprise whether it's a
company a government a university or
typically even a medium-sized business
decided it needed to hire a professional
IT staff but there was a second thing
that was interesting as well everybody
realized that the IT skills were not
only for the IT staff everybody had to
learn how to use these computers you had
to learn how to use a word processing
program and now today we sort of take it
for granted that we're gonna figure it
out along the way we're gonna find a
video on YouTube or learn from a friend
but for the first 10 years there was
actually a big increase in employer lead
and paid for training to train employees
in this new technology and as we've
looked at the last few years employer
subsidized training has been falling
this tells us we're probably going to
have to get back to more on-the-job
training in new technology but as we
think about how work will change I think
there's some important questions for us
to think about one is what jobs can AI
replace well now let's look beyond the
history and then basically apply a
second analytical approach let's try to
answer this question by thinking about
what computers will be able to do well
vision speech language knowledge you
start to discern jobs that are most
likely to be impacted when you think
about it think about what a radiologist
does a radiologist takes an image and
analyzes it a computer is getting very
good at recognizing images including
radiological images x-rays you think
about driving well driving is really
fundamentally about recognizing images
visually analyzing it and making
decisions and it is because of the
computers ability to do that through AI
the people are talking about the impact
on jobs for people who are employed to
drive vehicles automobiles or Krux
think about what goes on in a call
center it's the ability to understand
speech analyze it and make a decision or
think about what happens when you go
through a drive-through of a fast-food
chain there is somebody on the other end
who has a job who's listening to you
simply entering what you say onto what
is in effect a computer it is highly
likely I think that in the next five
years we're going to be driving up and
drive thrus and we're no longer going to
be talking to people we're going to be
talking to computers because the speech
recognition of the computers is going to
be as good or better than people now
think about language the ability to
translate from one language to another
now I will admit to some degree this has
been you know on the Holy Grail for a
long time the notion that computers
would say replace professional
interpreters who do a wonderful job it's
an incredible skill a year ago Satya
Nadella our CEO and I were meeting in
Berlin with Chancellor Merkel in her
office and there was an interpreter and
Satya was explaining that your computers
were going to replace her table she said
oh somebody from IBM told me that 20
years ago I'm still here
it probably will happen but what it
underscores is that it's always hard to
know precisely when but if you look at
the progress being made in this area
it's not necessarily a something that I
would encourage somebody who's
twenty-two years old to go make their
future and when we think about learning
when we think about what goes into say
inspecting a machine at Microsoft we
have 3500 fire extinguishers on our
campus we used to have somebody whose
job we had several people who had the
job of inspecting the fire extinguishers
every month and they can tell whether
the pressure had fallen and therefore
the fire extinguisher needed to be
addressed
well every one of those 3,500 fire
extinguishers is now connected with an
IOT an Internet of Things device to the
network so whenever the pressure falls
below a certain level we know instantly
and then somebody can go out and fix the
fire extinguishers that need to be fixed
but not inspect every one similar when
we think about knowledge the ability to
analyze documents and spot issues of the
like we see a real prospect increasingly
for having certain paralegal tasks
assumed by automation so these are among
the jobs that probably are going to
become fewer in number in the coming
years now on the other side of the scale
there's other things to consider when
you start to apply that same analytical
approach it becomes apparent that some
jobs really cannot be replaced by a AI
and they more fundamentally relate to
human ingenuity human creativity and
perhaps most important of all human
empathy and human interaction so nurses
I think are in good shape
social workers therapists teachers these
are much more likely to be people who
will use AI than be replaced by it and
it helps us understand a little bit
of how we can think about AI helping
people serving people and even helping
people grow certain jobs and become more
valuable and effective and find
enriching time and lives in what they do
and that leads to two other questions
the first is how can a I empower people
in new ways well the first thing to
really think about I think the thing
that I personally believe is the single
most exciting thing for the next five
years is what AI can do for people who
have a disability because think about
what vision can do for people who have
blindness some level of visual
impairment the computer can see and
recognize an image and help inform
someone think about the various issues
relating to neuro diversity think about
what it means for somebody who has
dyslexia it dyslexia or autism or ADHD
the ability for computers to be able to
look and recognize what is going on and
advise people on what their facial
recognition what their facial image says
are they happy are they sad either are
they concerned it's a valuable tool
think about what speech recognition
means for people who have some level of
deafness or think about what the various
ways that computers can manage knowledge
and what that can do for people who have
a variety of different mental health
issues just to get your mind around this
a little bit I want to show you a short
video clip of what we're doing as we
think about and move forward the
technology that is being used with AI to
address the needs of people who have
some level of blindness
seeing AI is a Microsoft research
project for people with visual
impairments the app narrates the world
around you by turning the visual world
into an audible experience point your
phone's camera select a channel and hear
a description the app recognizes saved
friends Jenny near top-right three feet
away describes the people around you
including their emotion 28-year old
female wearing glasses looking happy it
reads text out loud as it comes into
view like on an envelope Kim Lawrence PA
walks or room entrance conference 2005
for scan and read documents like books
and letters the app will guide you and
recognize the text with its format top
and loved edge is not visible world
studied lease agreement disagreement
when paying with cash the app identifies
currency bill twenty US dollars when
looking for something in your pantry or
at the store use the barcode scanner
with audio cues to help you find what we
want Campbell's tomato soup when
available here additional product
details can even microwave : Hodge and
even here descriptions of images in
other apps like Twitter by importing
them into seeing AI a close-up of Bill
Gates finally explore our experimental
features like scene descriptions to get
a glimpse of the future I think it's a
throwing a frisbee in the park
experience the world around you with the
seeing AI app from Microsoft what's
exciting is what this can do for people
and what's exciting is that it was a
group of young people who really first
developed this project in a hackathon it
was released as a product just last July
it's already been used over three
million times in terms of different
tasks so we're accumulating data that
will just make it better and smarter as
we go forward but for people who have
blindness you can look at this and you
can say this can be a game-changer it's
exciting to see ultimately we need to
ask some other questions as well what
jobs will a I create well the truth is
it's a lot easier to identify the jobs
that AI will replace them the jobs that
it will create that's always true
many studies have now suggested that for
people who are starting in kindergarten
today by the time they graduate from
high school 65 percent of the jobs in
the economy will be jobs that do not
currently exist now that may happen it
may not I think it's a little hard to
get down to that level of single-digit
for precision but it is so clear that a
number of new jobs will come into
existence and there are some interesting
ways to think about these new jobs some
will clearly be in the disciplines that
are required to make AI work after all
if AI is exploding the people who can
work with AI are going to have a bright
future in terms of jobs and of course
that causes want to start where you
would expect computer science and data
science the two fields that are just
foundational for AI but it's really
interesting I think to think beyond that
to think about some of the pressing
issues that will just become a paramount
importance that companies that create AI
will need to address and that starts to
bring us into the field of ethics one of
the things we thought about when we put
this book together is that ultimately
the question
is not what computers can do it's what
computers should do that is really one
of the great questions of our time and
in effect what it should inspire us to
do is really think about the ethics of
AI what does this require well in the
book we really thought about six
different fields that we see coming
together some of them exist today but
some of them are just in their infancy
if you look at the six ethical areas and
you look in the middle in the top there
are two fields that are really well
developed already reliability and safety
if you look at epics or law it was
really created by the world's transition
to the automobile and when you look at
privacy and security it was really
created by the world's transition to
information technology but in both
places there are strong principles that
one can now apply to AI but on both
sides of that there are issues that will
be of huge importance and deliver great
fertile ground for discussion one is
fairness if we're going to entrust
computers to make decisions how do we
ensure that they're made fairly what
we've already learned is that if you
have a data set that has bias in the
data that was selected then the
algorithm will not be able easily to
solve for that so there will be a huge
amount of focus and learning and
discussion around what it takes to
ensure that computers don't discriminate
in ways that we would find unacceptable
or unlawful and similarly because of the
impact of a eye on inclusiveness on
people with disabilities is going to be
so profound it will either make people's
lives better or if we don't think about
these needs it will hold these people
back this too will be of huge importance
and then there's two issues that
underlie all the rest one is
transparency if the world doesn't have
some reasonable way to know what AI is
doing then it actually has no way to
evaluate those four issues on the top
and that probably doesn't mean that
every other algorithm should be
published for all kinds of reasons
including most will be in Capri
sensible to most people virtually all
the time but there's a huge focus on
what it will take to make AI explainable
so that people can understand how it's
working and thereby evaluated and then
ultimately to me the most important the
reason it is the foundation for
everything else the reason I believe it
is one of the most important questions
of our time is how do we ensure
accountability will we ensure that
machines remain accountable to people
will we ensure that the people who
design these machines remain accountable
to other people only if we address both
of those questions and find answers that
ensure accountability can we have the
kinds of confidence that we need to have
and where the future is going but I will
say as somebody who deals with a lot of
the real world questions that arise out
of this those six put together are not
sufficient we probably need to talk in
the future about what a Hippocratic oath
for AI developers would be what does it
take to ensure that AI will do no harm
what does it take to train a new
generation of people so that they can
work on AI with that kind of commitment
and principle in mind and one should
never think that this is just a question
that is going to need to be thought
about by people who happen to work at
some large tech companies because given
where AI is going especially given the
kind of approach that we're taking as a
company it's all about ensuring that
anybody can build an AI solution we're
creating building blocks the vision
building blocks the speech building
blocks and the like so that other people
companies governments universities
individuals can take them and create
their own AI solutions it's a wonderful
thing but it means that AI X are not
just for a few people
they're for almost every part of society
if we're going to remain true to what I
think we would typically say our
timeless values we also need to
recognize one other question do we want
only
ethical people to behave ethically or
would we like everyone to behave
ethically well to some degree that is
the question that every government has
to ask when it decides whether it wants
to pass a law and while we don't pass a
law in every field of ethics we do pass
laws in many fields and so ultimately
this is going to create new questions
for issues of Public Policy and the
evolution of the law it's why we
concluded as we wrote this book that in
many ways skilling up for this future
isn't only about science technology
engineering and math it's not only about
computer science and data science it's
actually about the humanities it's about
the social scientists I think we're
gonna see a decade from that many more
people working in tech companies and
many more people working on technology
that come out of the liberal arts
already we see this at Microsoft it's
why it was really interesting to put
this book together for me who came from
the liberal arts side of Microsoft and
Harry Shum who co-authored the forward
with me who got a PhD in computer
science who Carnegie Mellon after
growing up in China more and more often
it takes both of us to find the right
answers it also just reminds us of why
diversity is such an imperative for the
future of Technology because given where
all of this is going and given the risk
of bias creeping into AI systems and
datasets it makes it all the more
important that we have a diverse group
of people working in our industry then
there's the last thing I want to share
it in some ways I think this is one of
the most intriguing and certainly if one
wants to end on a more optimistic note I
think it's quite fascinating what are
the disciplines that a I can make more
impactful well the truth is almost any
because as we look at where AI is going
it is changing healthcare it will play a
fundamental role in the cures for cancer
that it is changing our agriculture the
future of farming is really precision
farming with IOT to
Isis and broadband connections and AI
systems to help farmers know what the
plant went and where as you've seen the
future of accessibility is going to be
influenced by AI and even the protection
of the planet is going to be impacted by
this
and two examples really bring this to
life one is right here on the Princeton
campus there's this wonderful work going
in the heart in the Department of Near
Eastern Studies what's called the print
Princeton Ganesa
lab and one of the real leaders in using
ami in this field is a Princeton
professor Marina Rostov now it turns out
that the Princeton Ganesa lab is at the
forefront of the analysis of a very
large number of middle-eastern documents
that were written between 700 and 1500
AD they work with these documentary
fragments oftentimes they only have half
a document it turns out that these
documents were written in this case in
Egypt and in 1897
there were over 200,000 fragments that
left Egypt and they went to Cambridge
and they ultimately scattered in many
cases around the world including here at
Princeton which is one of the world's
great repositories of learning and even
a collection of these documents well
here's a very interesting half a
document the professor Rostow was
working on it tells a tantalizing tale
of a situation in Cairo where a Jewish
member of a synagogue brought a lawsuit
in an Islamic court to contest the fact
that he had effected a thrown out of the
synagogue but the problem was it was
only half a document you couldn't tell
whether this happened well some this is
where technology has made a fascinating
difference because over time these
images have been copied digitally stored
and AI is being put to use a team in
Israel developed different algorithms to
try to identify
how these documents might be joined the
technical term for how they come
together and they recognize that because
the terrors in paper changed over time
you couldn't just look at where paper
would match although though that would
be a standard case of vision recognition
that I described before
instead they developed algorithms that
did even more than that they looked at
the density of the text on a page the
distribution of writing on a page and
then they made a lot of these algorithms
and these techniques available well it
turns out that Professor Russell was
able to access this and what she was
able to do was use an algorithm use AI
to find a match and suddenly this
question that had been imponderable when
was this document written became clear
it was written it turns out in 1463 who
would have thought that artificial
intelligence would transform the study
of documents written in the 15th century
but it is yet another example of what
you see it happening across the
Princeton campus in academic departments
it is making every feel better and I
think that's exciting and what it
reminds us is as I was saying before
engineering isn't only for the engineers
anymore it really underscores the fact
that everybody who is in the liberal
arts can benefit from learning a little
bit of computer science and data science
and every engineer is going to probably
need some more liberal arts in their
future and if you have any doubt about
that you can consider this other example
it's what AI can do for environmental
science for what it can do for the
future of the planet at Microsoft we've
created a program I'm a 50 million
dollar program we call AI for Earth and
it focuses on providing seed grants to
startups and universities and four areas
climate which is really around carbon as
well as around issues of water
agriculture and biodiversity and as we
do this work we then
five projects that have promised and we
put more money behind them and we bring
together people who are great experts in
environmental science and we give them
more training and tools relating to AI
we believe this can be a game-changer as
we all work on the future of the planet
and it is starting to have an impact
around the world as you see here in this
short video that literally covers the
planet
hunger is a hydropower company located
in the south of Norway
we have been basically running the same
operation for decades the fourth
Industrial Revolution is about
connecting things together we now can
collect data from a millions of sensors
in our systems in our grid in our
production and we can use this data to
make new products technicians and manage
our business the smart grid pilot
program that we did with Microsoft was
looking into the grid and see how could
we use new technology to operate the
grid in a new way and what we found was
that we could actually interact with the
customers in order to reduce the load on
Pacific components in the grid we need
to be prepared for what's coming and to
do that we would need better tools than
we have today
and that has to be based on artificial
intelligence
there was a very warm climate country
entities he has a lot of buildings with
air conditioning your Casas bourbon hi
James is an Internet of Things system
that seeks to leverage technology gather
all the building data to some analysis
and then sure that our buildings are
efficient within this project we are
able to achieve 15% in energy cost
avoidance we also saw an improvement of
15% for productivity I think it's a
government agency we set the tone we
believe in the environmental
sustainability
the purpose of the yield is to feed the
world without wrecking the planet we use
real-time weather data at the farm and
then it goes into Microsoft Azure cloud
when we apply our machine learning the
help growers know when to plant when to
irrigate them when to harvest houston's
firm estimate that they say 30 percent
their irrigation costs and water losses
are through using our technology
selamat change is making weather more
and more unpredictable we can't control
mother nature but we can use technology
to help understand the remote
I think that gives us a glimpse of what
it means to prepare for this kind of
future in AI power future and it gives
us some glimpse of the impact we may see
on jobs and the like but what it also
really tells us is where we're going to
need to do more work where we may need
in effect a new social contract if you
will because people are going to need to
learn those skills they're going to need
to be new career pathways for people
whose jobs are displaced we're going to
need to think about the kinds of labor
rules and protections that were created
in the economy of the 20th century and
we're going to need to change them for
the jobs of tomorrow we're even going to
need to think about the social safety
net as these changes through ripple
throughout the economy all of that will
be important but there's one last thing
that I would leave you with as well
especially for the students in the room
every time I talk with new people who
join Microsoft I like to remind them
that when they got a job they got a job
description it described the job they
were hired to do but as I always like to
point out to people the job description
defines where your job begins you get to
find where your job ends you get to
decide where you take initiative and
move things forward and fundamentally
what I believe is true for an individual
is true for a generation because if you
look at what the world leads and what
and then look at what they eye has to
offer it will take a generation of new
people that can take what we know today
and do far more with it than we even
today currently can imagine but that I
believe is an exciting future and I
think we have a generation that's coming
out of Princeton and other places that
can seize that challenge and make that
future real so thank you very much
we have a few minutes for questions if
you have a question please raise your
hand we'll bring you a microphone and
excellent presentation
you didn't really touch on the what I
would call the more not opportunistic
things that are going to come
I'd like your comments or thoughts on
universal basic income do you think
that's going to be necessary what is
going to happen to say truck drivers
cashiers
jobs that are kind of high school
graduate type things the pathway that
these people will have is going to be
very limited either by economic reasons
that they can't in the middle of their
life 40 45 50 years old to retrain who
would pay for that do they have the
intellectual capacity to do a higher
tech job I think these are going to be
displaced people I'm a social and
economic historian I just love the
presentation that you did about the
recession most people don't know that
the future may not have the
opportunities that we did coming out of
the thirties the failure of the forms
back then hadn't had a environmental
anomaly we would call it we are going to
also have a bigger one coming with
climate change that you'll have to deal
with but I see I see a great political
social and economic crisis coming within
20 years like your thoughts on that
no thank you first of all I think you
raised what are frankly a number of
profound questions and the first thing I
would point out is to some degree the
future has already arrived in the
following consider this between 1989 and
2016 the number of jobs the United
States states held by somebody with a
four-year college degree or greater went
up by a hundred and seven percent it
more than doubled and the path was
almost completely linear meaning it
didn't actually matter whether there was
a democrat or republican in the White
House or controlling Congress this
country has been sort of an economic
machine in creating jobs that college
graduates could hold but then think
about the group that you just mentioned
think about people who only have a high
school diploma or less between 1989 and
2016 that number actually fell by 13%
there were 7.3 million fewer jobs in the
country for people who had that level of
education so you look at this and you
say that is clearly going to continue in
fact it may even diverge to a greater
degree what are we going to do and I
think initially there are two things
that we have to focus on and then
there's more to follow the first is the
skills gap how do we equip people with
the new skills they will need now the
some degree it's digital skills but it's
lots of other skills as well and I think
there's a just a new generation of
challenges for the workforce development
ports across the country for the
community colleges across the country
for technology companies like Microsoft
that owns LinkedIn where technology can
help people acquire new skills and get
connected with new jobs so that skills
gap is just a much bigger issue than it
was before then there's a second issue
that I personally believe is getting far
too little attention in the country and
that's the broadband gap I there are at
least 25 million Americans that have no
access to broadband most of them live in
rural
counties and the truth is it doesn't
matter you can take anything I've shown
including Netflix and if you don't have
access to broadband you're just reading
about something that somebody else gets
to live with it actually doesn't help
improve your life and so just as we
brought telephone service to every
person in America just as we brought
electricity to every person in America
if we're going to enable everybody to
move forward we are going to need to
bring broadband to everyone everywhere
and it's going to require a combination
of market innovation and public policy
and then there is the big question that
you also posed that's great let's say we
make great progress on the skills gap
and on the broadband gap will there
still be some people who do not have it
in them to be able to succeed this is
where we are going to have to think
about the social contract and about what
it means for the social safety net I
probably wouldn't myself run towards a
universal your basic income as the
answer but I do think we fundamentally
need to ask about where the social
safety net is going and just one of the
many questions we have to consider today
is that much of our social safety net is
paid in by people who are called
employees who make contributions match
by entities called employers but in uber
drivers not an employee an uber is not
an employer because that person is
called an independent contractor and as
this economy continues to shift as we
have people doing more work digitally
we're going to alive you need to create
some new 21st century job categories or
just not going to have the money flowing
in to be able to construct a social
safety net that as strong as the country
is going to need so all of these are
very big questions
yeah no I agree that well I'll just say
one more thing I know there's other
questions if you look at the transition
from the horse to the automobile and you
look at it over 40 years it all ended
well but if you look at it at the
midpoint life was pretty challenging the
1930s were not an easy decade and so
it's a very powerful reminder of the
importance of addressing these
disruptions that could come that I
mentioned the woman in the white
education how do you think AI will
affect or impact education going forward
I'm sorry how do you think AI will
impact or effect education going forward
well first of all I'm not going to say
that I can predict how it's going to
affect every field but I do think that
you can think about AI in two different
ways one is what it will mean for
learning and the other is what it will
do for teaching
certainly for learning you know
everything that is done that involves
sort of reading for example or studying
you know AI can be a very powerful
assistant I believe and so it can be a
tool to help students probably at all
levels and you know you can imagine
education for kids including for
students in college you're really
benefitting from what will probably be
almost a panoply of different AI tools
now some of this actually will have
special application for students with
disabilities but I think for everyone
when you look at the machine learning
capabilities you know that's where you
what we're just seeing if frankly just
in terms of improvements in search and
the like you know what we'll see that it
can provide new learning tools
I think AI also offer some potentially
interesting new resources for teachers
you know Bill Gates has long spoken
about a number of education issues and
you know teaching is so interesting
because as a teacher one spends a lot of
time giving feedback to others but a
teacher doesn't always have as much
opportunity to get feedback from others
because the teacher is the only adult in
a
in a public classroom for example but I
think AI can be a tool that teachers may
find useful to see in effect bring with
them into the classroom and even be
their assistant if you will to help
identify what's going on analyze what's
happening in terms of test results to
serve patterns and trends and offer
suggestions to teachers that can make
them more effective so I think we're in
early days but you just think about
these educational fields AI I think is
going to be quite impactful in ethics it
seems to me that the problem is less
often good and evil but conflicting
goods so I'm wondering do you see
diversity as an obstacle to achieving
values it seems to be very hard to
identify what are values that everybody
would hold particularly in our society
now the other part of my question is
transparency how do you achieve
transparency when you can't even tell
the way neural networks reach
conclusions nobody you've just
identified two or three of frankly some
of the most fundamental issues that one
will need to grapple with when it comes
to AI the first is what I would call
diversity
there will always be divergences in what
people value but I do believe that a
diverse group of computer scientists and
data scientists is going to be better
able to identify where bias has crept
into a data set because with a
fundamental one of the one of the
fundamental contributors to say bias in
AI is a data set that is itself
unrepresentative and so I think diverse
groups will be better at being able to
work together and identify that so that
that's one piece of it the second piece
really does go to this very difficult
around transparency I think we need to
sign up for transparency as a
fundamental ethical principle and even
need for AI that is societal
irresponsible then the question becomes
core 8 how do we do that and what we're
seeing in the early days is a lot of
debate some people say well just you
know make the data set available to
everybody
others say well you just make the
algorithm available to everybody
ultimately the term of the year is make
it explainable to everybody
in other words explain how this
algorithm is working and how it is
making decisions now you're right it's
like wait a second when we're talking
about deep neural Nets I wish we knew
you know there are some aspects that can
be quite challenging but what I would
say is this I mean I think sometimes
especially when you see the world of
computing sort of collide with the world
of values and ethics and policy and law
it's very easy to get stuck by talking
exclusively about what we do not yet
know how to do I think we need to start
by doing what we do know how to do and
so what I would advocate is that we
start to take steps to develop standards
around explain ability that companies
start to implement those steps and then
we'll all learn will get smarter
together and we may solve 90% of the
problems and then we can devote our
energy to the last 10 I just think
that's likely to be a far more
productive path than just debating the
what we like to call it computing edge
cases the hardest cases frankly the
cases that may be impossible to solve
hey thank you for coming today and I was
wondering what your thoughts are where
AI is going to go with our military and
our law enforcement will that just
enhancing the OEE or replace replace
some Robo Joe or Robocop or how far off
is that I think there's two very
different questions when you think about
law law enforcement and military
applications of AI and put them together
and I'll just capture two and I'm sure
other people who know more than me would
say oh there's really six or eight but I
can at least give you - the first is
giving people information about what is
going on and you know it can be
tremendously helpful for example for
troops before they enter a battle now
with that there's just so much more data
that is coming back today and then the
ability to use in effect what is vision
recognition and machine learning to
enable troops to know what to expect
before they go into an area for a battle
it does I believe have the potential to
really fundamentally transform early say
ground combat over the next decade and
what we're really probably going to see
in that space is this combination of you
know more real-time data large data sets
and then what we called augmented
reality you have the ability for people
to wear goggles or glasses as they go
into battle and have information
displayed so that if they're in an Iraqi
town before going into a building and
opening the door now they can much more
likely discern what it's most likely
behind the door yeah but there's another
part to that when you start to take that
same technology and apply it to law
enforcement that also raises one of I
think the most important ethical
questions because if you want to keep
the public safe from crime or terrorism
you can put cameras everywhere you can
build a facial recognition
into all these cameras the New York
Times actually had a long story about
this just yesterday and you can go a lot
farther than most parts of the world
have in identifying where individuals
are what they're doing and frankly
fighting crime and combating terrorism
this has probably done more broadly in
the City of London than any city in the
world
but if you're an authoritarian regime
you can also use that ability to engage
in an effect mass surveillance coupled
with this enormous amount of data to
stop people from exercising what I'll
suspect all of us in this room would
regard frankly as fundamental human
rights and this gets back to this
question that was posed before different
people have different values and there
are huge questions I believe about where
different parts of the world are going
to go how are they going to use AI and
you know are there global norms around
human rights that the world is going to
want to adopt at least in principle even
if they're not prepared to sign up for a
new practice all of this will be huge
the other thing I'll just mention more
briefly is of course there are issues
when it comes to AI and weapons now
already we may well have entered a
period of time when all future plays
that are purchased by the United States
Air Force will be purchased with a
design that has no seat for a pilot
what do we do then to enable the machine
that is piloting that plan to make
decisions on its own this is where the
accountability issue I think in some
ways is even more important for AI
applications in military combat than
perhaps anywhere else and it's frankly
one of the reasons I think the
accountability principle just needs to
be a bedrock principle in every part of
society so that we don't wake up some
day and find that we have entrusted
machines with the ability to make
decisions that frankly horrify us we've
got to avoid that kind of outcome are
you optimistic or pessimistic in terms
of how the laws are going to change
versus the technology will change and
what makes you one way or another I
think one of the great questions of the
day is well you know is what an optimist
or a pessimist about where all this is
going and first of all if you work in
the tech sector you must be an optimist
it's almost a job requirement and there
are so many causes for optimism and yeah
I think that when you look at what this
technology can do to help us solve
fundamental societal and even global
challenges it's it's it's a game changer
in so many ways but I will say but we
have to be realistic and frankly part of
being realistic
his expect is to fully expect something
that has happened for 250 years in a
consistent way I was like to point out
no Benjamin Franklin invented the post
office and then criminals invented mail
fraud hey we can use these letters to
defraud people in the eighteen hundred's
people invented the Telegraph and then
the telephone and then criminals
invented wire fraud and then people
invented the internet and criminals
invented Internet fraud and we struggle
and we have always struggled with new
technology about both what individuals
did with it that we've decided as a
society and really on a global basis was
unlawful and therefore even certain
circumstances criminal and we have also
struggled with new technology in terms
of what nation-states come governments
countries do with the technology so
while I am optimistic I think it's
really important to be a little bit
sober and that whenever I perhaps need a
little dose of extra sobriety I turn
back to this incredible statement that
Albert Einstein made in the 1930s after
the Japanese invaded Manchuria and there
were this there was this horrible war
first erupting across Asia before
anybody even saw it quite happening in
Europe there was a peace conference in
Geneva at the League of Nations and it
fell apart it collapsed and what
Einstein said was that between the mid
1800s and the mid 1900s humanity's
organizing ability had not kept pace
with humanity's ingenuity when it came
to new technology and so I actually
think that in some ways the most sober
question for all of us is can we do
better in the 21st century
and the world did a century ago or will
we have to go through some other
calamity before we wake up and do what
the world requires and when we look at
issues like cyber security and
nation-state attacks and how cyber
weapons are being used in new ways I
frankly think that even as we embrace
all these exciting things we do need to
wake up and I don't think we're quite
fully awake if we if we wake up a little
bit more then I'll be even more
optimistic it's what I would say that
seems like an excellent point to close
