my presentation yesterday I enjoyed the
stage with Grand Prince and I came here
from Sunday and I feel like I'm coming
back to my home I have been here for so
many times in the last 12 months so
companies announced a great new city
neon I'm very excited to be part of that
program and today I'm going to talk
about what we are bringing to neo and
what is the future of mankind
in relationship with artificial
intelligence and robots so let me start
the vision the history of humanity we
started with one little simple tool and
that was rock now in the same hand we
have something much more sophisticated
this little things in the same hand can
do a million times more things a million
times more convenient and if I leave my
key or to the car or whatever wallet I
don't go back to the home to my home but
if I leave my smartphone I go back to
home because the whole day I waste my
time
I cannot communicate with anybody
anymore so it's so important such an
important tool when I met with Steve
Jobs before he announced iPhone he told
me Martha Martha if you see what I'm
developing when I finish I'm gonna show
you you're gonna piss off your pants
and when I saw it I actually almost did
many people who didn't understand did
not understand impact that this new
little tool was going to give but after
this introduction of new tool he
completely changed the lifestyle of us
living in everyday life in all over the
world such a remarkable invention in the
- so anyway that truth human we evolved
with different kind of new tools along
the way we invented many tools and we
this is not the end we will continue to
innovate new tools and what are the new
tools that we are going to create before
talking about new tools with these
innovation of new tools actually
population on the earth the mankind
population on the US dramatically
increased dramatically now we have 8
billion people on the earth that is ten
thousand times increase in the number of
population so this this mankind create
many new tools but I will say this
neutral would be giving more impact in
mankind history than anything else the
impact is so huge that it will not only
disrupt information industry not only
disrupt advertisement business model or
some of the productivity tool it will
redefine every industry and that is
artificial intelligence
artificial intelligence that become so
smart than ourselves so it will be
redefine every industry agriculture
industry the transportation industry
medical industry and everything so if
you think only ten years ago how many
companies in top ten market cap
companies in the world how many of them
were Internet related only one Microsoft
now after ten years has passed how many
do we have in top ten whether you call
Microsoft as an Internet company or not
is a different subject but anyway after
10 years has passed out of the top 10
companies there are seven internet
companies in the top ten seven and two
of them are Chinese who has imagined in
just 10 years such a drastic change has
happened could have happen anyway but
still I say internet revolution is only
a part of the big change that we're
going to encounter this truth is so
smart that it will redefine as I said
every industry not just advertisement to
remodel in a new form so the concept
recently I often say singularity
singularity is the concept that mankind
you know brain will be surpassed this is
the tipping point crossing point the
artificial intelligence computer
intelligence surpass mankind brain and
that is happening in this century for
sure I would say there is no more debate
no more doubt will it be in 30 years 25
years 35 years it's just a margin of
error in my view two thousand years ago
four thousand years ago
the mankind's bread how many new long
did we have in the mankind brain
basically the same 30 billion you know
neurons in mankind in the main brain
today same 2,000 years later the same
basically our DNA for me does not change
but in this century next 30 years or so
this crossing point is really happening
big-time big-time okay so that is
singularity so that is bursts of super
intelligence and this is something that
we encounter first time in our mankind's
history so if you say how do we compare
the brain power there are many ways to
compare one of the method is IQ if we
have hundred we average if you have 200
like Einstein is called
genius if you are 200 a genius if you
are 100 you are average I mean between
make most of you are in between so how
much is the IQ power of the super
intelligence that we will encounter in
the count in the measurement of IQ it
will be 10,000 the IQ count the
artificial intelligence will have will
be 10,000 in 30 years or so from now
because the power of CPU in the last 30
years has improved 30x another in 30
years 1 million X the past 30 years 1
million times more increase in power of
computing what is the next 30 years CPU
press GPU it would be another million
times
another million times
so they are going to become if you say
today are way smarter than them well in
some area they are already smarter than
us in many area we mankind are smarter
than them but thirty years from now most
of the subject they would be so much
smarter than us because they are going
to be a million times smarter than today
million times
so can we forecast weather of tomorrow
mankind and them they're already smarter
they can have a better forecast of
weather people everywhere in the world
but not just the weather forecast in
many many many subjects they will be
smarter because the million times
improvement is happening so if you talk
about the power of computing it's not
just CPU stress GPU it is a size of
memory it is the communication speed
difference and they are going to be a
million times and million times and
three million times faster than today so
if it is a three billion
you know transistors in one chip today
it will be three quadrillion okay memory
size if it is 256 six gigabytes today it
will be 24 petabytes okay and if it is
one gigabit per second it will be three
pet a bit per second we don't talk about
pepper that much in daily life but it is
a million times bigger than today in in
our hand in our hand not in a gigantic
computer in the same hand when we had
mankind had to spawn a storm of 30 years
later you know iPhone 38 or something
will be sleep at a bit per second 3/4
transistors and so on so it's amazing
and not just power of computing as the
CPU and hardware today mankind is
smarter so mankind his programming 30
years later most of the program we don't
even program anymore they learn by
themselves they are so smart that they
we don't need to teach them they will
learn by themselves machine learning
deep learning whatever learning you call
they will learn by themselves as we are
not programming to ourselves we are not
programming to our children they will
learn by themselves by seeing touching
reading same as the kids these computers
they will learn they will read they will
see and they will learn by themselves ok
so that's a scary future but anyway
that's coming and imagine the population
of the earth of mankind will be 10
billion people from today 30 years later
I would say in my view it will be a 10
billion robots smart robot with the
super intelligence you saw peppers here
and you're going to laugh at them oh
they are like a you know a puppet
whatever and they are programmed how to
speak we're gonna laugh at them today
but 30 years from now they're gonna
learn by themselves they're gonna
they're gonna maybe laugh at you and us
okay so today they look cute and they
will stay cute but they will be super
smart robot with the super intelligence
that's happening for sure and the
population of robot will be 10 billion
robots flying swimming running so in my
in my definition all the card that
become autonomous driving they in my
definition robot because they are
autonomously this
hiding which way to turn left or right
where to go
the as long as we tell destination
they're gonna drive by themselves it's a
robot in my view smart robot so robot
with super intelligence that's coming in
everywhere all over in many different
sized many different kinds and not only
robots one trillion chips is going to be
shipped to everything internet of things
internet of everything maybe some of you
know that i acquire the company called
arm arm has a market share of 99 percent
more than 99 percent market share on any
smartphone is shipped in the world now
today we have Softbank hub ninety
percent of any IOT chip that's being
shipped today and that's gonna be one
trillion chips we are we have estimated
inside our company this number is going
to be one trillion chips one trillion we
don't talk in daily life one trillion
chip that calls everywhere in everything
and they become connected with the super
intelligence and that's coming so if one
trillion chips goes to the big data in
the crowd and those feeding into the
deep learning through the artificial
intelligence they become super
intelligence collecting data we are time
from everything from 1 million data
points so as I said we mankind created
tools the premise was mankind were
always smarter than the truth we
invented so we control they are true we
had a controller this is the first time
we mankind encounter something smarter
than ourselves the truth becomes smarter
than ourselves so that's why I say
every industry we will redefine every
industry this is the first time
experience for our kind mankind so if
the internet was gold rush gold rush
creating seven company in top ten in the
world in the world
no that would be small thing this
singularity is going to create even
bigger gold rush it's a it's a great
opportunity it's a great opportunity so
as I say every industry will be
disruptive that's why we called created
shop envision fun and I've talked to the
one person this person in Tokyo last
year some people say I convinced him to
invest forty five billion dollars in 100
billion dollar fun visual fun in 45
minutes
now the truth is I didn't convince him
he already had an idea and the vision
that mankind will have artificial
intelligence the Internet of Things and
robots about robots so I didn't need to
convince him he already had the
understanding in the vision we happened
to meet the mind in 45 minutes that's
how we create friendship partnership and
the bonding of the minds so not only
that we invited a few other partners we
invested already to 15 companies also we
are increasing more and more every day
so anyway gold rush money it's just a
money thing it's not important it's just
a process what is more important what
the humans
happiness how do we help ourselves human
become happier with new encounter the
robot with super intelligence do we have
to fight with them are they going to
attack us I don't think so
they are so smart that they wouldn't
understand
there is no meaning no meaning it is
meaningless to attack human for what
they would rather feel much better if we
and they become friends with harmony
with harmony so we don't need to fight
with them we create a new happier life
together
I'm optimist I'm super optimist well
taking bed with his optimism and I lost
99% in the internet bubble but somehow I
survived because I'm optimistic there's
always a solution in many ways so I'd
like to say who is a great dream as
Grampian said all the dreamers all the
dreamers come to new place do that's the
nucleus let's dream together for the
happiness of mankind thank you very much
Thank You massa
that was fascinating
thank you I think we all appreciate it
trying to think through what the future
looks like given that so many people in
this room are in the investment
community and given that you're pursuing
this remarkable vision fund help us
understand how you're thinking about
that future which may be 30 40 50 years
from now and the vision fund today well
at least in the last five months
we studied there five months ago in the
last five months our return is 22
percent already we made roughly 3
billion dollar profit so good start not
bad if you analyze that it's much more
than 20% right so even financial result
wise not bad and I think my track record
the last 18 years is 44% compound every
year so dreamers not necessarily
people call me high-risk high-return
what I've eaten definitely yes
but I don't know if it's high risk if
you think deep enough if you work hard
enough you if you smartly select I think
it's not just a high return but could be
good and when you make an investment
today what what is the time horizon for
these investments we in the life of the
investment tom is 12 years and we have
two more extension average life of the
investment is probably seven eight years
a little longer than others the fund but
my track record is as I said 44% average
life that we own is like 13.5 years and
how much of the investment thesis is
around AI and what you just described
okay so if you say at least the last 15
investment that we made in the last five
months in some sense all of them has
intelligence factor different feel
different subject and so on but somehow
somewhere it's all artificial artificial
intelligence related how do you feel
about having to invest a hundred billion
dollars quickly so people said it's too
much I say it's it's too little it's not
that much
we are already investing at the pace
it's not gonna take five years it's
gonna be much less to invest you made a
comment recently that you might actually
want to even do another fund that's even
bigger and another fun that's even
bigger well I would say each fun will be
bigger each father could be maybe the
same size but I will do more frequently
and when you think about AI right now
how do you assess the startups that are
coming up with AI projects versus the
biggest companies in the world
meaning the Microsoft's the Google's the
Amazons the apples I would say all those
the big successful company in the
industry will be a big player
continue to innovate and continue to
fight each other but always you start up
with young you know a guy who can who
can think disruptively from different
angle they are always coming always
coming what was the lesson of the
dot-com boom and bust for you I say that
as I say I lost ninety nine percent in
year 2000 and at the time of the bottom
people say you were crazy you lost
everything and so bad but I said nah now
is the time and I want to invest the
only one problem I didn't have money at
the time to really invest but I was
hundred percent right if I had a little
more extra money that was the best
timing and only one fact the number of
users number of users kept on growing
one
dai election so it was just a people's
you know expectation goes too high or
too too little but the truth is this
innovation is continuously continuously
broad one way dilation and how do you
think about valuations now where are we
in the cycle of the valuations for all
of these tech companies beginning
beginning this is the beginning as I
said if it's gonna grow a million times
smarter
today's 130 years later it's a million
times do you call this as the peak now I
wasn't call it as a peak it's gonna be
million times more sophisticated they I
will say this is a beginning what other
words do you use but what do you say
when some the critique is that
potentially we are late in the cycle
given where the market is right now and
in fact given the amount of money that
you're putting to work that you could
potentially even press prices higher
than they really are so as I said the
peak of the internet bubble in year 2000
most people say it is was a peak that is
super inflated compare that price and
today that was not a peak that was a
little peak today is much much more okay
so I say the usage at least the usage of
internet usage of artificial
intelligence this computing power
continued to grow this is not a peak at
least the usage is going to grow and the
power is gonna grow million times then I
don't call it as a peak I'm maybe I'm
too optimistic people call me crazy very
often I I said that's a great compliment
so I'm not worried two final questions
we have all read a lot about a potential
investment you may make in uber what is
the state of that and what is the fee
is behind it well I don't want to make a
specific comment to the specific company
but the the usage of the vehicle is
going to change it was a it was a
premise that you know everybody have to
own the car no we we get right on taxi
bus and a train so it's just extending
with the power of the Internet a little
more convenient and then later on
autonomous driving is going to happen
final question 2050 our robots going to
be in better investors than you in many
of the subjects compared to the index
and so on they will be definitely be
smarter than us however if you have to
envision 10 years 30 years later some at
least some human will have a better
imagination than them so it's not the
end we the power of brain is no limit
the imagination that we can have it has
no limit so we are also going to improve
our imagination and our our feeling gut
feeling so if you watch the Star Wars
movie don't just look at what you can
see listen to the force
Mazal sent everybody thank you very very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
