lectures by saying any questions many
University can talk about today well I
was listening to you people talking
about universes and seems to me that
there's one possibility that is so
simple that people don't discuss it
because certainly a question that occurs
in all religions is who created the
universe and why and what's it for
and one thing that preoccupies me a
little bit is the question of why do
things exist and I think the answer is
that that's an extra hypothesis that
doesn't make any sense
you see it's all right to say does this
glass of water exist but if you ask does
X exist that means is X one of the
things in the universe so to say that
the universe exists is silly because
it's saying the universe is one of the
things in the universe oh there's
something wrong with that idea well if
you carry that a little further then it
seems to me that it doesn't make any
sense to have a predicate like where did
the universe come from or why does it
exist
so another view which might be related
to the famous many worlds theory is that
this is just a possible universe and
there are lots of possible universes and
there isn't any reason to say that this
one is distinguished except that we're
in it so if you think of of a computer
game or something like that here's a
little sequence of reductions first
imagine that there's a computer that
simulates some little world and there
are people in it and the people are
pretty smart
we'll talk about how they could get
smart later and after a while one of the
people asks the other why are we in this
world and where did it come from and of
course they're fooling themselves there
isn't any world it's just a simulation
somebody wrote the program but if they
got that far then they could say who
wrote the program okay now step two is
suppose somebody wrote the program and
didn't run it so there's no computer
well still once you've written the
program and let's say a description of
the computer it runs on then everything
that happens in that world is determined
and at logic this computer and the
program logically imply what people will
be in and what they'll do and what
they'll ask and so all of a sudden there
doesn't have to be a program it's just a
possible computation and then the next
step is you don't even have to think of
it there is such a computation so anyway
the question is getting back to our
universe what's going on here why is the
universe we're in the way it is whether
it exists or not and now there's this
famous thing called the Hall anthropic
principle and some physicists take it
seriously and some think that there's
something wrong with it and they
shouldn't think that way but clearly we
couldn't ask that question and with less
our possible program that we're running
had certain properties and one of the
properties that you need to have an
intelligent creature is that there well
we know how we got here in this universe
we evolved and you can't evolve unless
you have self reproducing machines or
approximately things like something like
DNA or RNA and some way to copy it and
there are other constraints on the
universe that come from the anthropic
principle you couldn't
have you couldn't have a booth like
universe where suddenly things are
exploding and creating stuff so you
can't have too many bubbles or in fact I
think you have to have something like
conservation laws because if energy
weren't conserved than any every now and
then some configuration would appear and
everything would blow up so the real
question is why the universe has to have
laws at all I suppose but one thing I've
noticed is that when physicists try to
explain to the public this is the old
days before things got sophisticated
they would make a great fuss about how
what they call the uncertainty principle
and so forth and they'd say you know the
world isn't the way Newton described it
it's things are probabilistic and
indeterminate and the curious thing is
it seems to me they very rarely mention
the opposite side of that the reason why
polling was so interested being chemists
is that nobody talks about people
instead of the uncertainty principle was
I'd like to call it the certainty
principle if you take in Newtonian solar
system it won't last
or at least if it's a big complicated
one Gerry Sussman
and John wisdom once simulated the outer
planets for a while and they decided
they were stable for about at least
three or four billion years but it
looked like the orbit of Pluto was
chaotic
they didn't simulate the inner planets
and for all we know for all I know it
might be that the influence of Jupiter
and Saturn which are really big are
enough that at some point in that time
maybe the earth will get enough energy
to be thrown out into space but
generally in classical physics you can't
have things like atoms with things in
orbits that stay there a long time and
it's only so what I'm saying is nobody
explains to the children in grade school
in high school when they talk about
quantum mechanic
that in fact quantum theory is why
things are so stable and certain they'll
emphasize that if you have a DNA
molecule there's a possibility that one
of the carbon atoms will suddenly tunnel
out and land in Arcturus but the fact is
that at room temperature a molecule of
DNA is good for several billion years
and that's one of the reasons why
evolution is possible so sort of
interesting that in communicating with
the public most businesses are so
entranced with uncertainty that I mean
have you ever heard of physicist
explained that quantum mechanics is why
things don't jump around sort of a funny
thing and I think this question of why
the universe is the way it is if you
think of a collection of possible ones
is maybe we should take the anthropic
principle more seriously and say if
you're thinking of various models which
of them are stable enough to support the
kind of evolution that we know took the
order of billion years apparently the
first the first cells appeared pretty
quickly after the earth got cool enough
I think I've heard people estimate that
it's less than 100 million years and
then it took about 3 billion years to
get to really good cells that animals
and plants appeared about 4 or 500
million years ago and then things took
off very rapidly but evidently was a
long period where nothing much happened
anyway somebody asked what about
intelligence and emotions and why don't
we have a completely different subject
why don't we have good theories of what
the mind is and how it works and I think
we're in the last few years some people
have be started to get good theories of
of the nature of thinking and so forth
before computer science and there
weren't particularly good theories it
seems to me that to understand something
like a brain you have to have hundreds
of concepts like data structures and
different kinds of memories and so forth
and if you look at psychology seems to
me it has a very strange history there a
few thinkers like Aristotle who sort of
start out with some pretty good and
pretty bad ideas about psychology and
then as far as I know nothing happens
the ideas of Aristotle on in the book on
rhetoric seem to me about as good as the
heart as the essays by John Locke and
and Hume and the English philosophers
even Spinoza so that a couple of
thousand years elapsed without any
progress in psychology and although
physicists started up around that time
with Galileo and we've had three
centuries of rapid progress in physics
it seems to me that psychology didn't
start till around 1880 or 70 this is the
first recognizable idea that the that
the mind is some sort of mechanistic
system and you can make theories and try
to predict them and do experiments to
confirm it is barely a century old and
even that stuff didn't make any progress
till around 1950 when we started to see
cybernetics in the 40s and artificial
intelligence in the 50s and 60s and
something called cognitive science
starting to appear in that same period
so mysterious question is why why didn't
science have ideas about thinking until
recently so we don't really know very
much about how the mind works because
history is so short
my favorite example I think is that in
the 1930s late 1930s a botanist named
Jean Piaget in Switzerland started to
observe his behavior as children and
taking notes and asking them questions
and in the next 10 years of of watching
these kids growing up he wrote down
several hundred little theories about
what sort of processes are going on in
their brain and how did each of them
develop from some others and and so
forth he wrote about 20 books on this
stuff all based on observing three
children carefully and although people
nitpick about the observations he's made
the general structure seems to he'll
have held up and strangely enough almost
all of these processes as described seem
to happen at about the same rate in the
same ages in all the cultures that have
been studied which is a whole lot but
the question isn't was Piaget right or
wrong but why wasn't there someone just
like that 2,000 years ago what is it
about the nature of cultures and science
and so forth that no one thought to
observe children and try to figure out
how they work because Piaget didn't need
cyclotrons what he uses glasses of water
and pieces of candy and make little
shapes of candy of different forms
you know sometimes you'd have 5 candies
close together and 5 spread out and
children younger than 5 years old will
very much prefer the ones that are
spread out the conjecture is that
they're estimating size by the extent
where as seven year old say all those
it's the same I'll take these I can
because it's easier to pick up and what
happens between 5 and 7 and he tried to
make some theories of that and
some well series we're okay Seymour
Packard was a research assistant for him
and he had another theory which I liked
better and we studied some children and
anyway the point is that theories of the
mind are very recent psychology really
went through many phases that we now
think are very silly and shallow but the
reason for that was that people didn't
have the ideas of data structure there
was something called mathematics which
worked very well for sins in physics but
it turns out that the kinds of
mathematics that developed in the years
before computers were not good at
describing in detail what would happen
in a process that involved maybe a dozen
laws physics in physics we're successful
because we discover ways to account for
very large classes of phenomena with
just three laws like Newton or four
forces or or whatever and the number of
assumptions are always less than 10 or
so and then there's some chance that
mathematics will give you ways to do
logical reasoning and figure out exactly
what might be consequences of those
simple laws but if you take 20
assumptions mathematics is dead there's
a beautiful subject that both physicists
and mathematicians love called group
theory and group theory is a little
mathematical thing where you make about
five assumptions and from these five
assumptions you get lots of problems and
and theories that people spend their
lives on there some problems in group
theory that have been unsolved for a
hundred years and but there are many
that have been solved but my point is
that if you make five assumptions about
the same things these assumptions are
different then you're on the edge of
what people can understand
the other end if you write a computer
program to do something and it has a
hundred lines of code then we don't have
any way to figure out the consequences
of that in general it's just too hard
and it seems to me that the reason why
psychology didn't get anywhere until
starting around the 1950s was that in
the appearance of what we now call
computer science several hundred new
ideas appeared that no one had ever had
so very often people think of computer
science as the science of what computers
do and I think if it is quite different
computer science is a new way to
describe and think about complicated
systems and it comes with a huge library
of new ideas for example sometimes I
hear a brain people saying well it looks
like memory is located in the
hippocampus and then another one says
it's not located in the hippocampus it's
only stored there for a little while and
then somehow it's moved into somewhere
in the cortex other cortex the
hippocampus as four or five Cortex's of
its own and they talk about working
memory and long-term memory and
short-term memory now even in the year
2002
most of those so-called
brain scientists have never heard of - I
don't mean money cash see a CAG if you
buy a computer today you know that it
has a big memory that's slow called hard
disk or tape or whatever and it has
another memory that's pretty fast called
RAM maybe it has a million words of that
fast memory or 50 million now since it
only costs a few cents per megabyte
maybe less than a dollar and the average
computer also has something called cache
for instructions where it remembers the
last few things it did in case it needs
them to do again then it doesn't have to
go and look somewhere else for them it's
got several kinds of cache it has a
front end cache and back end cache and I
don't remember what those are but the
point is that in computer science there
are ideas about a dozens of kinds of
memory there dozens of kinds of ways
they can be stored in memory you can
store them as if then rules if this
happens do that you can store them as
things called semantic networks which
are little pieces of information
connected by links that themselves have
properties you can store things in what
are called neural networks which are
like semantic nets except that the links
are dumb this is connected to this one
by a by a link that has some number like
point seven neural nets are wonderful
for learning certain things but they're
terrible for the rest of the machine
because the rest of the machine can't
figure out what the neural net knows so
some years ago Peppard and I wrote a
book about the limitations of neural
nets although we didn't talk about the
really serious limitation which is that
the more of the brain that is used to
learn in that particular way the less
the brain will be able to think and
reason about what it's learned
so one thing that we learned in
artificial intelligence or computer
science is that there's some fast tricks
which are sort of effective and and
useful but in the long run they're dead
ends because the Machine cat doesn't
understand what it knows and John where
am I going with this what I'm saying is
that we're in an era in which people
have just started to get what looked to
me like pretty good ideas about what
thinking is and how it works and we're
still burdened by most of the world
having one or two hundred year old bad
ideas that the way thinking works is
that there are ideas and they're
associated with other ideas and when you
do something good you reinforced and
there are traces of that and so forth so
the world is really very thick with old
pre computational theories of how the
mind works and in some way it's almost
harder now to get people to think about
more sophisticated ways of representing
knowledge and acquiring it for example
when you learn something the standard
theory is if somebody gives you a reward
then you're more likely to keep it in
memory and if if they discourage you or
don't reward you then you throw it away
but suppose I happen to do something
that works I find a new way to hold a
screwdriver to get a screw in without
the screw falling off one of the
troubles with screws is but it's the old
ones with slots is that as opposed to
the new ones with little crosses that
they won't stick to the screwdriver and
but after a while you learn how to do
that what is it you learn you certainly
don't learn the exact sequence of
motions you learn some higher-level
representation and we call that the
credit assignment if something works and
you had to do 10 things in order to get
it what is it you remember how do you
figure out which part of your activity
was
relevant in the old psychology theory
they had a simple idea the thing you did
last was relevant but of course the
thing you did last was put put the thing
down because it was fixed so there's all
sorts of new ideas coming out what has
not happened strangely is is this the
the first experiments to get computers
or computer programs to simulate human
problem solving actually started around
in the early 1950s I'd even say just
before computers became available to the
general public for example there was a
early computer at Princeton designed by
John von Neumann several copies of it
were built he was a mathematician who
appears to be the first or second person
who clearly had the idea of the modern
computer there was also a fellow in
Conrad in Germany man Konrad Zuse who
worked out this idea but he couldn't get
anyone to pay attention to him and the
main idea about the difference of the
main difference between the modern
computer and the computing machines that
had come before
is that the old computing machines could
perform the same kind of operations they
could add numbers they could store
things here and there and get them out
again but they but the what they did was
made by effect determined by a fixed
program usually by a set of punched
cards which would say first do this then
do that then do that maybe if this
happens use this deck of cards if that
happens use a different deck so that was
the early computers and what von Neumann
and Zeus realized is that wouldn't it be
better if you stored the program in the
computer's memory just like the data and
then you could have they were thinking
of the future rather than the present
and then maybe someday the computer
compute
new program for a new job and Stewart
and that made the computers more
powerful and in the early 1950s for the
first time
computers got enough memory so that
there was actually room to store new
programs in them and some pioneers
started in fifty nineteen fifty four or
five six started experiments where they
actually wrote programs that wrote new
programs that would then run and this
led to the development of certain
languages which were very good at
writing in which you could write
programs that would write in the same
language so they could keep changing
there's a lot of progress and by 1960 we
had two major languages which were good
at modifying themselves unfortunately
these languages were a little bit
unfamiliar to other people who didn't
see the great power of programs that
could change themselves and the world
was overtaken by other terrible
languages like the famous C language or
Fortran or Algol and so forth which
became universally popular and which in
which it's almost impossible to write
programs that change themselves on
that's just a parenthesis there's a is
it Bentham's law that says the badge
drives out the good whose law is in
compression Gresham's law in modern
software practice we see this we I can't
understand why this 35 year old language
called UNIX has suddenly become popular
but the only thing I can think of is
that the other operating systems got
filled with so much garbage in the
intervening 35 years that nobody could
deal with them and it's not that UNIX is
the latest thing it's the last fossil
that hasn't
completely dissolved from the past and
they're starting over and as far as I
can see they're starting over to make
the same mistakes well in the early days
of this thing called artificial
intelligence we started to try to make
programs that would do very advanced
things maybe that was a mistake
one of the first programs that I was
involved with was a program that would
prove theorems in Euclidean geometry it
just crossed my mind I'm curious how
many how many children learn Euclidean
geometry anymore what Euclidean geometry
used to be was a rather amazing subject
where you would learn a dozen
assumptions like that two points
determine a unique line or if there are
two lines then they're either parallel
and don't intersect or if they intersect
they just intersect in one place and
that two triangles are the same in all
respects
if they're the same in two sides and an
angle between them and so forth and
Euclid I don't know when the hell you
Khalid was probably 600 BC this was a
wonderful subject because you were in a
world where assumptions were very simple
and there were only small number of them
and you used a logic which was very
clear and so it's a beautiful thing and
you get all sorts of interesting truths
and falsehoods and you can check them
and so forth for some reason a large
fraction of humans find it very hard to
deal with the subject where you don't
have to know much it's a great mystery
to me how you can be bad at mathematics
when mathematics is the simplest of all
things yet you get people who get high
grades in history or social sciences
where nobody knows has the slightest
idea of what's going on and
you can't understand anything but that's
that's a side subject how could a person
be bad at mathematics it must be that
somehow they get a wrong model of of
what the activity is I remembered once
trying to tutor a student who couldn't
prove theorems and I said what's your
trouble he said well I think I was sick
the day that the teacher explained how
you prove theorems this is good so this
poor kid thought that there was some
special way to do this of course the way
you do it is by using general
common-sense knowledge to figure out
what if two things are related which one
is causing the other and that sort of
thing and in fact when I told the
student that there wasn't any known way
to do this yet he brightened up and got
better at it because he really seemed to
think there was something he didn't know
that he needed to know and that it
wasn't a matter of growing on the
general resourceful list that you'd
expect every normal person to have if
you didn't if you didn't know you're
supposed to be a little bit original
maybe it's hard anyway I was fussing
with geometry a little bit and I wrote
down a draft for how would you make a
program that would in fact take some
statement in Euclidean geometry and find
a proof for it and that was in the late
50s and by 1960 a little group at IBM
research managed to write one of these
programs that in fact was pretty good
and could compare pretty well to a high
school students ability at that sort of
thing shortly after that we had a
student who wrote a program that solved
symbolic problems in calculus and to
grow calculus and it did it well enough
on an old computer that it could get an
A in the MIT first-year calculus course
because it couldn't do the word problems
but it did quite well in calculus and we
told it about fifty or a hundred little
rules of thumb that you use in different
situations and work very well so here
we're aiming at what's considered to be
fairly high quality of human performance
before long in fact that program had
evolved into a computer that was better
into a program that was better than any
human in the world and there was a
commercial version of that program
called maxima for project Macs symbolic
mathematician program which in fact put
a lot of mathematicians out of business
know who had been involved in trying to
find new ways to integrate functions so
exciting story ah but it couldn't do
word problems so a couple of years later
one of our graduate students decided he
would try to get a computer to solve
less formal problems like um John was
four years older than then Joseph when
Joseph was twice as old as John had been
ten years ago most high school students
I don't know if that's a real problem
but most high I buy your book science
but most even high school students have
considerable trouble with that if you
can get your head clear which is hard
you end up with two equations about
John's age and the other guy's age and
the two equations are different and it
if you're lucky they have a unique
solution and this program was able to
take pretty complicated English
sentences and figure out what equations
they were talking about and solved the
equation if it was about anything else
it couldn't do anything and we tried to
improve that program for a while but it
ended up it was
dead-end in the sense that if you ask
the program to do anything else it
didn't know what the words mean so
people started to use computers for
other specialized problems and by 1980
we had tens of thousands of programs
each of which was quite good at doing
some very special thing but there was no
program that could do the kinds of
things that you'd expect your
five-year-old to do like five-year-olds
can beat you in an argument if you're
wrong enough and the kid is right enough
so to make a long story short we've
regressed from calculus and geometry and
high school algebra and so forth and
we're trying to get people to work on
common-sense problems like the sort that
every four or five-year-old can do and
what's interesting is that although
they're perhaps a hundred thousand
people writing expert programs maybe
even a million around the world expert
specialized programs I've only been able
to find about a dozen people so far in
the world who are interested in trying
to do simple everyday common-sense jobs
of the sort that all children can do
