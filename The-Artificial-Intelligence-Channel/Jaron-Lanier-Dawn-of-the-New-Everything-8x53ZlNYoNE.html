he is this and the little clips are for
c-span hello something like that
[Laughter]
hi
I wrote in The Times that Jaron is one
of the most unusual or the most unusual
person I've ever met and I've met quite
a few unusual people including our
president and he I asked him I said
wouldn't you rather have someone more of
a techie you know interview you and but
what I love about his books the voice in
his books is so alive and vivid and like
a child in a savant all at once and it
really draws you into that world so I
feel like you don't have to be an expert
to really enjoy it and I've interviewed
him at his house a couple of times and
he is a hoarder as am I so I felt quite
at home there but he hoards much more
interesting things he has every kind
every musical instrument known to man
and every square inch and you know a
Chinese opium bed filled with what is it
filled with well instruments yeah yeah
mostly sort of the really big
floor-standing wind instruments so I can
sort of put up in there yeah yeah and a
beautiful golden harp and and the piano
is is the oldest well no it's it's the
best it's I feel yes it's that for that
are there piano geeks in the audience
it's a 1929 Mason &amp;amp; Hamlin full concert
nine-foot and it's the best one I've
ever I mean it's really amazing yeah so
and then instrument called a serpent the
SERP the SERP actually wrote a piece
that used the serpent on a commission
the pieces that premiered at the Met
earlier this year it's a big it looks
like it looks like a big snake with
holes in it and you play it's a it was
the only bass wind instrument in the
Middle Ages it's really hard to play but
it's kind of wonderful yeah Aaron Sorkin
once wrote this great line in a play
that music is what science does on a
Saturday night and often times Jaron
starts his talks by playing one of his
unusual instruments and as you see he
brought one so let's start that way okay
so I don't have a mic stand
okay the human mic stand
I might have to patent you
[Laughter]
what is that you know no it's called a
can kje and usually it's from Laos in
Southeast Asia and I love it for many
reasons one is its well just honestly
it's a good crowd pleaser that I can
take on carry-on so it's like it's
effective as a little thing to take the
events but it's also arguably the oldest
digital number so this is 16 similar
objects that are either on or off in
fixed positions and it goes back at
least 10,000 probably more than 13,000
years so it's a 16-bit number this is
where it all started and actually
there's a whole lineage that leads to
the modern computer directly from this
do you want to hear about it yeah so
these were traded across the silk route
and the ancient Greeks and Romans knew
them the Romans made a giant version
that was steam powered called the
hydrolyse to accompany me accompany Gore
in the Colosseum and it was so hard to
operate that they had to develop these
planks to control the holes and that
evolved into the keyboard on the organ
and the piano and the planks were so big
that this the slave boys who operated
them had trouble with them so they have
to be these cross planks to automate
chords on it and that gradually turned
into automation mechanisms on both
organs and early automated harpsichords
and around Mozart's time there was a
player piano that didn't play the same
way each time and had a little bit of
randomness in it and that notion that
you could have a player piano that kind
of made up its own mind inspired a guy
named Jack hard to try to see if he
could make a programmable loom
which then inspired a guy named Babbage
to make a programmable calculator which
in the 20th century inspired a guy named
Alan Turing to formalize a math for
general general calculation which we
call the computer and here we are with
throw an election so it all started it
all started with this little thing yeah
I think it's very it's very good that we
have the father of virtual reality at a
moment when the whole meaning of reality
is up for grabs I wanted to start with
some personal questions because Jaron
was born in New York City and then his
parents fled the big city when he was
one and jaren's life is as colorful as
he is as you might imagine and and they
were running but we're not sure from
what and you had a tragedy at a young
age and I just wondered if you could
tell us a little bit about your youth
that you write about in the book sure so
we're Jewish and for my parents
generation they were a European the
story you might imagine applies does
apply my mother was a concentration camp
survivor she was captured at 13 she was
from Vienna my father's family had been
mostly wiped out by pogroms in Ukraine
and they made it here and they had they
kind of lived an interesting bohemian
life in the 50s in New York kind of a
cool one my dad became the science fact
editor for Hugo Gernsback Golden Age
science fiction popes so he used to
write the science fiction pieces in the
back of amazing and astounding and
fantastic and you said he came up with
the rumor about alligators in this world
he said I don't really know for sure I
mean this is something he told me when I
was a kid and and now that I have my own
child I've been trying to watch how
frequently I lie to her to try to gauge
how often I was lied to
on the chance that its genetic and I'm
not sure and I'm and I'm and so my
doubts about some of these stories have
increased slightly based on that
research but so my dad was a kind of a
sidekick on one of the early may be the
earliest callin radio shows which was
called the Long John Nebel show and he
one of the things he liked to do is make
fun of weird pseudoscience stuff but
initially sort of pretend to be into it
but then exposed it so he was involved
in a lot of the early science flying
saucer stuff and he might have invented
the alligators of the New York New York
sewers but there might actually be
alligators in the New York series I mean
I really I have never gotten to the
bottom of this and I feel like with
questions involving New York no one ever
really does right so but he might have
so I was born in 1960 and I think they
just had this feeling based on their
experience in Europe but they wanted to
run to get away they didn't want me to
be around and by the way this is a
different topic but I have an 11 year
old child now a daughter and I I'm so
haunted by this because my mother's
family waited too long in Vienna until
it was too late just sure that things
couldn't get bad and so now I wonder to
myself like how do you tell like how do
you know and I I don't have the answer I
really don't know and I'm I don't like
that feeling I don't know what to do
with it
but at any rate we went out they ran as
far as they could to what seemed like
the most remote place but their
criterias that still had to have a good
university because you don't live far
from a good University so they ended up
at the the edge where Texas New Mexico
and the country of Mexico meet near El
Paso but there was a New Mexico State
University next to White Sands Missile
Range this is a really solid Technical
University so they settled there at that
corner and there are many other stories
in the book has a lot of stories I can't
possibly tell you the whole tale now but
the short version is my my mother died
in a car accident when I was 9 and
coming coming home from getting her
driver's yeah that's right she just
gotten her driver's
since that morning and I think after
that I felt a profound profound sense of
isolation and it led me to to a
fascination with just the potential to
connect with people how do you do it to
me other humans I mean just even looking
at you now I could almost remember what
it felt like you know when you go out at
night and you look at the Stars and
they're these they're just right there
you can see them they're real but then
when you learn a little bit about how
the universe is put together you realize
oh it it they're inaccessible to us it
could take hundreds of thousands of
years just to get to that place it's
right there and we can't know we can't
get there you know and that's how people
felt to me they were like these orbs
these heads were like these orbs that
felt so distant like the Stars and there
were bullies in that part of the world
there were serious bullies when I was in
elementary started out in Texas which
was kind of I mean in um quite as Mexico
I went across the border used to be this
open border it was an amazing thing you
just would take a school bus across the
river and you'd be in Mexico and he'd go
to school there nobody it wasn't you
know this whole crazy paranoia about the
border just did not exist it was just a
very sweet place he just went just went
right across and but when at a certain
point we transferred me to the Texas
school system and there within when I
was back some of the kids in my school
drowned and killed the only Chicano kid
in in class which is with the term that
we used to use for people of Mexican
descent and they totally got away with
it even though everybody knew and it was
just terrifying I mean it was a
terrifying environment to live in so
yeah and then after your mother's death
your house burned down you lived with
your father in tents on a little plot of
land he purchased in the New Mexico
desert and then he let you
drop the design of the house you would
build together a geodesic dome yes now
you're a parent and your daughter Lily
Bell is the same age as you were then
would you let her design your house okay
so we came up with it we negotiated a
compromise on this question so did you
notice in the new part of the house
we're building there's an eye shaped
window that's little bells eyes she made
it her make a window that's the shape of
her eye so that way she can do part of
the house but it's not like structurally
critical because what I should point out
is that my father did let me design a
house at 11:00 and we did build it and
then part of it collapsed with him
inside about 30 years later so my advice
is not to let an 11 year old design a
house even if they seem precautious all
right I mean you might disagree and we
can have a conversation about it but
that's my thought you write you write
about how you vividly remember
discovering hieronymus Bosch's the
Garden of Earthly Delights for the first
time you were hyper perceptive hyper
sensitive and even in your own words
hyper romantic how did this later
develop into your becoming the father of
virtual reality and do you think that
you were drawn to VR as a form of
escapism from the many traumas of your
childhood well I don't feel like it was
escapism I was what really struck me
about the Garden of Earthly Delights was
that here's somebody from centuries
earlier I mean evil artists had created
this thing that didn't represent reality
it was this active imagination and yet
it still could come across to me art was
like if other people's heads were like
distant stars he couldn't get to art was
like this warp drive that somehow
transited between the heads you know and
I just I was just I sort of thought that
some kind of I had this idea that if
somehow you could really see what was
outside of other heads or if they could
see what was inside of yours it would
just be so astonishing and I cereal art
for me was the first thing that had a
feeling of something that did that that
opened up people's heads and and expose
them and I of course Suri surrealism
isn't the only genre that does that and
I've actually gotten a little bit of
flack from people who think the serial
genre is kind of tasteless and whatever
so it's a funny
it's a funny conversation to have so but
but I think art does that and when I was
a little older I got I got super excited
by early experiments with computer
graphics and the guy who invented
computer graphics was Ivan Sutherland
more or less you can get you can get
into the weeds with the history but
that's approximately true and he also
made the first reality like headset in
this in the late 60s and when there was
this journal article I was in college
early in the 70s and I was like 15 or so
I think and there was this Journal
article that talk was about some of his
work and I got so excited that I I ran
out and just stopped strangers in the
street and was holding up this like math
journal and of course it made no sense
to anyone and I offender said that was
before the Internet see there was no way
to just contact people you didn't know
that actually wasn't a feasible plan and
there wasn't any method for that so I
just like run up to strangers and accost
them with these journal articles and
yeah I was I was a badly behaved boy I
guess yeah speaking of which in the late
70s you found your way back to Manhattan
and lived in a purple penthouse just
behind the Dakota used to hang out at
the ear in and became part of an
avant-garde music scene spending time
with John Cage and Laurie Spiegel and
Laurie Anderson you write that at that
time New York City amplified you right
back at yourself a giant parabolic
mirror as you walk down the street you
made eye contact and exchanged
subconscious signals with thousands of
people no law
so today everyone is looking at their
phones what do you think of New York now
is New York over when was the last time
you went to the ER in
I think the earrin is still there
is it yeah I would think so I haven't
been there in a while I should go there
it's right at the end of Spring Street
by the Hudson they have great shepherd's
pie oh they did back then - I believe
that well what do we think of man I mean
I I'm not sure I can say anything
brilliant about Manhattan that you
wouldn't know more about than me because
you live here probably since you're here
it strikes me as being less distinct
from other places and less flavorful
than it used to be it's there's so many
chain stores and that sort of thing and
it seems to have priced out a lot of its
own Bohemia maybe not entirely but it
one thing I'll say though is that when I
was 17 and I lived here the first time I
used to come to the Strand and I used to
just haunt this place and hang out all
over it and it used the employees here
used to be really strange people it used
to be an odd scene it was like something
out of an underground comic wandering
around in this place so I really have
fun memories of it and I believe my
father had come here before me too and
tell about when you guys see stuff to go
up to John and Yoko apartment to beg for
money
hmm yeah well no the the ear magazine
the avant-garde music journal was funded
by them so they'd have to run up
discreetly and in periodically and say
the printer wants to be paid and yeah so
that was but that's how things go I
think that sort of thing still goes on
today and there was a patron of the Arts
right a rich woman you're going - yeah I
bet threw somebody in the audience will
know who I'm talking about there was
this there was a woman who had energy
like I've never seen before she was I
mean I'm not sure how what her what her
age was but she she was elderly I'd say
but she would be out all night running
around and
she she was this patron of avant-garde
artists and musicians who a lot of
people you've heard of depended on and
now she claimed to have this amazing
house made of stainless steel shaped
like a spike with her ex-husband's bones
hanging in a mobile from the top inside
upstate somewhere it sounded real and
true at the time but it seems like if
something like that was really true I
would have heard of it again somewhere
so it must be one of those things I
don't know but I remember it we used to
run around she and I and people like
John Cage we'd run around in the middle
of the night you say oh I know this one
restaurant is gonna put out their unused
cheese right about now and run into this
alley and grab this block of cheese and
and then and like these kids are crazy
like why why are we running around and
stealing cheese from an alley behind her
Ostrom at 3:00 in the morning I don't
know and then finally she'd wear us out
and she'd be off on her own to the next
adventure and I say well we can't just
leave her because you know in those days
New York City was dangerous it was I was
actually a kind of a scary place as you
know nobody keeps up with her she can
take care of herself you just go off to
whatever the next thing was yeah I love
the way jaren writes about women in this
book he goes off on a discourse about
the difference between lust and
limerence and you know he has a lot of
insights into men and women and I love
this story of your first marriage and
you ended up in a house with tarantula
venom in the fridge yeah well yeah so we
there was this house in Berkeley
California that was I think of an
amazing eccentric old mansion built
above a spring that bursts forth out of
the hill and in it was a group of people
who started publishing this new kind of
zine initially and then it turned into a
glossy magazine and it sort of combined
psychedelic culture and technology and
the most famous version of it was called
mondo 2000 and it gave the psychedelic
style to the
world which is then reflected in the in
Wired magazine in other places and so
this group of roommates made this
magazine and the woman who is the editor
of these magazines who is known but as
Queen mu collected weird substances and
she we did have this problem that the
refrigerator was almost completely
filled with her collection of tarantula
Venom's
and I don't know why we had transyl
venom but it did become a problem they
kept me get another fridge can remove
the transfer venom but yes that is
correct and we knew that when you got
divorced there was some weird incident
with Marvin Mitchelson does anybody
remember him now he was a famous divorce
lawyer I remember he wasn't he Lee
Marvin's divorce lawyers yeah yeah but
wasn't there a fight about virtual sperm
well he was trying he was going to try a
new legal theory that if you failed to
impregnate somebody who felt that it was
their last chance to get pregnant which
was it she wasn't she was certainly
young enough and didn't have another
child but that you could be sued for
failure to impregnate that you could be
sort of sued for virtual child or
something like it was it really it's
hard to even reconstruct but the
interesting thing about it was that I in
a way you know in retrospect almost he
was a he was thrown in jail and
disbarred during the course of it so the
whole thing went away but for other
thing not not for case related to me for
something else but I almost wish it had
gone through because the interesting
thing was in order to do it they're
saying okay we're gonna we're gonna need
your sperm samples and we need to prove
that you could father a child in order
to proceed with this lawsuit and it's
like you're gonna force me to give you a
sperm sample and I realized a feeling of
like the state telling me what to do
with my body and I suddenly thought
right you know like men don't ever
experience what that feels like but I
I'm one of the few men who got to
experience what that feels like to have
the legal system tell
you something about your own
reproduction in your own body I thought
all right did I
i I mean it kind of I wish more men
could actually experience that directly
I guess that's the thing that came out
of it for me because I I do think that
sometimes we've been a little too cool
and abstract and talking about abortion
rights but fundamentally what it's about
is whether the state can come and
control somebody's body and I just I
felt that really keenly so I put the
story in there just because I don't know
it might help somebody else see like
what a bad idea that is you've talked
about social media as one giant behavior
modification Empire you said when
everyone is getting personalized feeds
empathy becomes impossible and others
have said one day Twitter Facebook and
the like won't be seen as a passing
often destructive fad or maybe we'll
have president Zuckerberg who knows so I
guess the question is what what what did
it become as opposed to what you hoped
it would become on the off chance we get
a president Zuckerberg I hope you're
saving up your worst venom four columns
for that era yeah well you'll need to
bring out the transferor venom Oh God
well yeah so this is oh my god
I mean I'm actually writing another book
about this but the the really short
version is that the computer world the
techie community wanted everything to be
free but we also wanted everybody we
want we love Steve Jobs and Bill Gates
we love entrepreneurs we didn't want the
government involved so if you want
everything to be free but you want
everything to be business the only
answer is advertising and so Google for
instance was born as an advertising
driven thing but then the problem is
computer algorithms get better and
better computers get faster and faster
devices get cheaper and more plentiful
and so what started out as advertising
turns into continuous monitoring and
feedback it turns into behavior
modification feedback loops and it's
easy to design those to be addictive and
if you can and it's easy to it's easy to
hire them out to manipulate people and
well Sean Parker admitted this the other
day he did it the day after your piece
was published I should note right yeah I
think that's what he said the whole that
they knew they were designing something
addictive just to soak out you know get
out your precious way so it's yeah you
know and the most tragic thing about it
is that since these these schemes
require input from people they only work
with the field that comes from people
using them and adding their own posts
and videos and everything when people
add really positive minded constructive
material to social media it gradually
gets routed to terrible purposes for the
simple reason that social media has to
drive engagement above all else and
negative emotions drive engagement
better than positive ones so so a year
after some positive social change you
have some backlash that interrupts the
arc of history and sets it back because
it's the backlash is is more powerful
because social media makes it so so uh
the Arab Spring turned into the reign of
terror women trying to improve theirs
there's their status in the gaming world
turned into gamergate which turns to the
outright black lives matter turn into a
sort of a bizarre normalizing those
neo-fascism and and so and then the and
there's no reason for it to stop I mean
what I'm worried about is the me to
movement in a year will then turn into
some horrible thing that we don't know
the details of but all we can say is
that it'll be worse than we expect
because structurally that's what happens
on a happier note yes you mentioned your
next book so can we tell them the cats
and dogs theory
yeah Jaron has like four cats that he
really really loves it's true we are a
cat household by which I mean the cats
out vote us except he's worried that one
is a trump voter she's been coming
around well she's an anti immigrant
voter because she'd been there forever
and then these kittens showed up and
she's like why are there immigrants
everything was fine they're ruining
everything they're eating all the cat
food she was really upset about it so um
Maureen kind of scooped me on this
because this was going to be the intro
to my next book and I feel like I have
to come up with some other clever things
since it's out of the bag or maybe I can
just leave it the cats out of the bag
the cat is out of the bag so the theory
you might have noticed that cats are
especially popular online cat videos and
everything and so why is that well my
theory butter is very simple we're
watching our own independence go away
and the cat's remind us of what it's
like what the thing we're losing is like
because cats are you know cats cats
weren't domesticated they domesticated
themselves and they're still partially
wild they can live in the wild they're
still independent they have this
aloofness and that's what we're losing
in ourselves as we use these tools so
we're watching ourselves go away that's
the theory I love that no I by the way
one of our cats is named Ruth because
she is not aloof you know they're
hanging from the ceiling above the
antique musical instruments yeah it's
true so you were friends with Timothy
Leary and once even had to help break
him out of the Esalen Institute and I I
noticed in the Financial Times the other
day there's this whole big piece about
how a new generation of San Francisco is
working San Franciscans working in
Silicon Valley believed that LSD makes
them more creative but they're taking it
in micro doses I guess rum which is just
a funny thing coming full circle to your
story about breaking him out yeah I have
if people went experiment with LSD micro
doses or something but I think there
might be a sort of an odd definition of
creativity at work in Silicon Valley
sometimes but oh well they it says they
took their cue from Steve Jobs who said
LSD was one of the two or three most
important things he did in his life I'm
sure I'm sure that he felt that deeply
too because it was really important to
him well so I tell the Tim Leary sorry
yeah so I had never met him but he pins
he started speaking in public about
virtuality the first time it became a
big deal in public life and there was a
wave of interest in virtual reality I
guess would have been in the 80s it was
in the news a lot and whatnot and and so
Tim sort of say this is it this is the
new LSD electronic LSD this is the next
way but of course he'd never seen it or
met anybody in it so I started kind of
criticizing him in some places and back
then we didn't have the Internet but we
had ziens we had like these little
magazines would be published so I wrote
some pieces saying you know there's it
doesn't do anybody any good to try to
treat technology as like some outlaw
thing I mean like what like I don't I
don't know if it's not any good to treat
drugs in the way that you do like why
don't let's is there some other way to
do this and so he said okay well we
should meet and I said great I got I got
contacted by him and so he said okay
we're gonna meet I am he told me okay
and I can't use voice I wish I could he
had a sort of a gentle American Irish
voice jaren I'm getting paid to do this
workshop up at Esalen and I like the
money but I really don't want to do it
so I'm hiring this guy who's a
professional Timothy Leary impersonator
I'm gonna give them some of the money
and then then I won't have to do it but
the thing is I think I have to show up
at least at the start because they know
me there you know what I mean so here's
what I want you to do bring your car and
I want you to smuggle the this other the
guy who's gonna impersonate me in your
trunk and then you're gonna smuggle me
out but they have a guard gate so you're
gonna have to keep a really straight
face do you think you can handle it and
like this is esslyn this is like this
hippie this is not East Berlin this is
not the Stasi this is like a this is
like guys with beards and tie-dye
t-shirts I mean it's not like a
high-security place but so anyway we got
him out that's how I met him yeah well
here's something weird so there was
recently a story in The Times about the
Esalen Institute which now is having
this huge comeback by these you know
millionaires and billionaires who have
decided that they want to try and find
their soul so they're they're drinking
kombucha and you know finding their soul
and yeah it's just well you know I still
I still know Michael and Dulcie Murphy
who excellent and and yeah there's this
whole new generation of Silicon Valley
people so it's gonna change hands and it
does look like it's moving from the
original sort of transpersonal
psychology people who started it and and
Eastern mysticism people to this new
generation of Silicon Valley people and
originally it was more about sex right
The Economist called it I don't even
know what this means exactly new agey
bag no bordello where people got high
and had sex throughout the 60s and 70s
before coming home talking about
psychobabble and dangling crystals I
mean I understand that sometimes people
feel the call of flattery and go a
little overboard there but no I don't
know whether I feel like that's a little
unfair I I've been to eslint a fair
amount and I never I've never seen it be
that way
but I don't know the world is what
Esalen is halfway between San Francisco
and LA right on these very hard to
access cliffs high above the Pacific
Ocean and their natural Hot Springs
there and it's really kind of an
astonishing place just as a natural spot
and a lot of the early like the
psychoanalytical movement in the u.s.
that started to become diverse and break
away from the Freudian orthodoxy kind of
had its start and its focus in esslyn
and there are a lot of actually a lot of
what you think things happen there I
mean I kind of feel like I should defend
it from the characterization yeah well
one really interesting thing you said to
me was that there's a certain kind of
personality that's emerging from the
digital age and you said if if you're a
mark of social media if you're being
manipulated by it one of the ways to
tell is if there's a certain kind of
personality quality that overtakes you
it's been called the snowflake quality
people criticize liberal college kids
who have it but it's exactly the same
thing you see in Trump it's this kind of
highly reactive thin-skinned outrage
single-mindedness I think one way to
think of Trump even though he is a con
man and he has an actor and he's a
master manipulator and all that in a
sense he's also a victim I've met him a
few times over 30 years and what I see
is someone who was moved from kind of an
Eeyore character who was in on his own
joke to somebody who was completely
freaked out and outraged and feeling
like he is on the verge of a catastrophe
every second and so my theory about that
is that he was ruined by social media
yeah I mean I I do you think that's
exactly right the the the addiction
algorithms in social media well I guess
there's no reason to go into in great
detail but that it does create this
personality effect and people look like
zombies while they're using it and then
when they get off if they have this
weird nervous kind of affronted
small-minded quality and you see it all
over the spectrum it's not it's true for
those liberal college kids who criticize
it's true for Trump and it's true for
all kinds of other people too it's a did
you ever think you would see a president
who was basically running everything on
social media it's such a strange God
I'll tell you straight you know who the
composer Terry Riley is he was a founder
of the minimalist School of Music and
for a long time we were writing an opera
together and was called bastard the
first and it was a science fiction opera
about a president who had run things
through manipulative computer systems
and we didn't get it exactly right but
it's right and it was right enough that
it's too depressing to complete the
Opera so yeah I mean sort of thought of
something like that
I mean Silicon Valley designers tend to
never foresee the possibility of bad
actors and surprised over and over and
over again so Gerry another delight of
Darrin's book is his footnotes which can
be really hilarious and in one you were
saying you had a friend who dated Donald
Trump oh yeah where's my editor why did
you let me leave that in well yeah I did
know somebody I didn't know somebody
who's dating him for a while yeah and he
said it was a bad experience I don't I
don't think she came out of it feeling
like I don't I don't think it was like a
dignity enhancing experience yeah yeah
and because were inundated with this and
in my world I wanted to just ask you
about you know gender inequity and
sexual
in Silicon Valley I interviewed did the
first interview with Susan Fowler who is
number two on the recode list today
above Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg in
terms of power because she kind of
brought uber to its knees over this
stuff and you you said something really
great where you said that it was you
said there's a kind of emerging new male
jerk persona of the digital age which
would be some kind of cross between the
uber guy in the pharma bro and maybe
Milo and Palmer Luckey and maybe Steve
Mann and sort of smug superior I've got
the levers of power I know better than
you like a insecurity and a lot of power
at the same time mm-hmm yeah I mean it's
become a recognizable type and if if the
snowflake persona is what comes from
being manipulated by these behavior
modification loop empires this other I
don't did I come up with a name for what
that is this I guess I can't use curse
words on c---span so this kind of asks
ask God or something like that it's sort
of like Christmas for asses yes whereas
this is what I said yeah but I mean
there's just there's this kind of other
persona that comes over the people who
run these schemes which also does some
no favors and it's also horrible and so
yeah and that's this kind of yeah this
kind of weird smug insecurity it's a
it's a it's a sort of the strange
twisted persona but we see it again and
again in the new kind of male power that
comes out of these networks one thing
you seemed kind of worried about when I
talked to you is so these guys who got
rich writing code to solve banal
problems like how to pay a stranger for
stuff online now contemplate this
vertiginous world where they're the
creators of the new reality and perhaps
a new species and you've talked about
them getting high on their own supply
yeah well back in the 90s when I used to
talk about the stuff I had uses
bootleggers vocabulary which is don't
drink your own whiskey which is to say
that if you have some sort of heipiess
story to help sell your stuff you should
believe it yourself because then you
confound yourself and then there was the
ten crack commandments since what the
rap was called it had done one of them
was don't get high on your own supply
and I thought that's better so it's the
same thing but updated so I started
using that I forget when that was
sometimes the late 90s I think when that
came out and yeah you know I think that
is a problem I think when you're when
Silicon Valley does have this way of
hyping itself that it then believes and
we are not to our own selves true as
much as we need to be so but I'll tell
you there's a good side to that though
which is I feel I'm one of the rare
people who still inside it and has been
inside it and I just try to call it as I
see it I try to speak truthfully and
people still talk to me and I feel like
more and more just recently there's been
like when Shawn came out and said oh
yeah we made it deliberately addictive
we use these techniques the techniques
by the way were proven initially in
behaviorist experiments and then in the
gambling industry that's where they were
tested at large scale so it's we
imported it from the gambling world but
you're starting to see people realize
that it's okay to be more honest and
that that we've gotten any trouble and
we have to be and I think we're gonna
see more of that I feel I feel I detect
a bit of a shift in Silicon Valley and I
think we might start to see some more
honesty and some more clarity see you
didn't think we're gonna need to you you
mentioned sometimes we might need to
shut down the internet well you know
that's a question we keep on getting do
we just need to shut it down and start
over I you know what I think would fix
it and I I don't have a lot of people
agreeing with me on this but I think I'm
right you know it's like I really think
if we just changed the business model of
some of the big companies so that they
weren't incentivized to bring out the
worst emotions and
most addictive designs then it would it
would self correct and and basically the
problem is the advertising what's called
the advertising business model that
morphed into this behavior modifications
scheme so instead of that we had people
Oh able to earn money by being really
popular Facebook posters and if people
paid a small fee to use Facebook if it
was just monetized it would just create
an alter an alternative to just peer
attention seeking and I think people
would rise to the occasion and suddenly
there'd be better quality stuff and it
just it wouldn't get perfect but it
would get a lot better and I think
Facebook could still be in business
they'd be fine their shareholders would
do fine so I think that's the best I
don't know if that's the solution will
come to you but that's the smoothest and
best solution that I know about I mean
this idea of having regulators just
pound on them I think is tough because
hackers cannot run regulators jaren gets
upset with me when I dwell on this but I
am obsessed with this fight between Elon
Musk and Mark Zuckerberg on Twitter and
you know trashing each other I'm just
gonna ask quickly where Mark where Elon
Musk thinks that killer robots killer AI
is coming to get us that's why he wants
to have interplanetary colonization and
the Rockets to Mars and and Mark
Zuckerberg keeps saying that Elon Musk
is hysterical and then Elon Musk implies
that Mark Zuckerberg just wants to you
know soak up more information and get
more ads and isn't worried enough about
getting the kill switch to the killer
robots
so all right just quickly well in
general if you have a company that makes
its money by selling goods or services
it's more likely to be a decent company
than if it only makes its money through
behavior modification for pay so
intrinsically what Elon Musk does is
going to bring out the better in him and
other people then what
Zuckerberg does Zuckerberg fundamental
business is to screw up the world almost
explicitly
and Musk's isn't so my my initiative
sympathy has to be with musk on the
other hand what musk is doing saying
about AI is is in my view incorrect and
the reason why I say I doesn't exist so
here's the way I see it oh god this is a
whole long story and it's in the book
it's actually in all my books in some
form or another we make up this story
that the machines are intelligence is
and it's like it it suggests that we're
godlike because we're creating this new
life and it's I was just thinking
actually you could also spin some kind
of womb and be themed around it it's
like these men wishing they could create
life I don't know but anyway there's
this there's this whole fantasy about it
and the problem with it is is that it
makes you into a terrible scientist an
engineer if you say here's this machine
I'm making and this is what it's
supposed to accomplish and then I can
measure how well it accomplished it and
then I accept the reality of that
measurement then I can make it better
and that's engineering but if you say I
believe this thing is alive isn't it
alive it's an intelligence well that's
not well-defined Alan Turing showed us
that with the Turing test it's something
that's just subjective it's based on our
judgment and and so you no longer can be
an engineer at this point you're a
religious you know ritual practitioner
you you you have no basis for saying it
but why is it alive I don't know because
I feel it's alive so now everything
becomes absurd user interface has become
worse people take less responsibility so
now all of a sudden it's sort of okay
for some giant corporation where the
biggest in the world to be promoting
jihadist videos or horrible things or or
personal destruction for people because
well it's all a big AI it's not us it's
our electronic brain it was its decision
and what we'll talk to it we'll see if
we can get it to do better I mean it's
ridiculous that's ridiculous it's just
and another thing about it is that
behind every claim of AI as a theft
to paraphrase Balzac I guess the the the
in order to run AI you need a
of data which the corpus of data that's
the example set that she is to drive the
machine learning algorithm and those
things come from people the example I
always like to uses language translators
so language translators have seen their
fortunes plummet it's like investigative
journalists or recording musicians there
they they no longer make money from what
used to be their daily bread which is
translating memos because now you can
get free translations from online
services but for those services to work
we have to go and steal example
translations from tens of millions of
people every single day because the
language changes that fast and so on the
one hand we're saying oh you're no
longer needed because our giant
electronic brain will replace you so
you're no longer gonna be paid you'll
have to go in the public dole and basic
income you're no longer earning your own
dignity but on the other hand we
actually need them there's no electronic
brain it's just a new channel for their
value to be brought to people and so
it's a lie it's theft so there's no AI
and every time you say oh we should be
afraid of the killer AI you're actually
promoting the very myth which itself is
the danger it's not the tech it's the
myth so when Elon does that he's
actually making it worse ok so this is
from the point of view of a woman I'm I
just saw Blade Runner and I've been
watching Westworld and I just I'm
wondering if women are just really
screwed in the future because you know
Ryan Gosling has a an Alexa that can
come alive and looks like a Latino
brigitte bardot
and then Harrison Ford is still in love
with his gorgeous replicant and I don't
know I mean should women be worried
about the coming sex robots and and live
Alexis or as Joanna Coles the former
editor of Cosmo says well virtual
reality be the greatest thing that ever
happened to female porn huh we'd like to
talk about porn on c-span yeah
so this is this is a this is a this is a
topic with a lot of angles to it isn't
it the the first thing I want to say is
that before we dig too much into this
sort of porn like approach it's worth
saying that there are other ways that
fort reality and advanced media in
general could contribute to sex romance
sensuality that are far more interesting
and creative than this than this model
of in my view that I mean remember if
you look at at the history of sexuality
and art it actually was kind of more
diverse and interesting and peculiar
before cinema came along before we could
capture things literally with the camera
and I think what happened is is the
cinematic the this way of capturing sex
created this new kind of it cemented in
place sort of erotic visions that had
been more more variable before just if
you look just look at art from before
and you'll see this thing really
interesting and kind of diverse and and
kind of more aratus ism was more in
motion before in my view you know that's
not to say it was perfect I don't think
the role of women was it was better
before cinema because historically it's
been sort of worse and worse in general
the further back you go with some
exceptions but I think cinema kind of
made us into sort of literal eyes errs
of sexuality in a way that we hadn't
been before and it's possible that we'll
remember the cinematic era is sort of an
unfortunate and sad and sort of perverse
era for sex and and and eroticism I
might be wrong about that but I I
wouldn't I think it's a possibility
so in virtuality there are these other
weird things you can try that are kind
of powerful like sharing a body with
somebody else to become a unified
creature within a virtual world that we
have to coordinate your sensory motor
loops in new ways and then what that
must sound terribly abstract and strange
but you'll see you'll see it's really
cool and and so I want to say that we
shouldn't think that this sort of porn
way
thinking about how media intersects with
sexuality is the only way it can I think
there's a lot more interesting stuff in
the future and then I will say that tech
culture is male-dominated and this this
idea that we won't need women anymore
has been one of the fantasies in tech
culture for a really long time
every tech utopia I've done everyone but
this sort of nerdy ones out of Silicon
Valley often include like a paradise for
prostitution Peter Thiel's talking about
that or or sex robots or something like
that so we'll need to deal deal with
these these people does that like
seasteading where you would have islands
with libertarian it's sometimes American
teen libertarian libertine worlds out on
the sea or sometimes in space or
whatever and I think it's a bit of a
fake I think in their hearts a lot of
the men who imagine this actually would
like to have something that's a little
more tender than that and they're not
they're not just purely consumers of
whatever they think fulfillment is as it
can be packaged I think I think they're
under estimating themselves that that's
one thing I'll say okay I'm just gonna
ask one more question and then we're
gonna open it up for questions so a
feature in Politico this summer explored
the idea of a robot president some some
text it's sounding better and better
isn't it yeah yeah - can't be bought off
by lobbyists yeah they won't bring the
clueless son-in-law along for the ride
and so forth yeah so and and you know in
India the Prime Minister was campaigning
as a hologram so where are we headed
with this stuff yeah Oregon has
projected himself as a big hologram in
Turkey and the Saudis gave citizenship
to some AI right - yeah - a female robot
right and it's right don't do it did
their own women drive - yeah yeah
no just barely no I mean the female
robot is probably allowed to drive
where's a human female probably right
yeah yeah well I mean this hope that we
can have a program that'll solve our
problems is very much a false hope
because the program's I'm actually doing
anything they're just channels between
us that that's like the illusion I was
talking about where we want to pretend
we don't need all of those translators
who are supplying the raw material
that's repurposed to provide so-called
automated translations we want to
pretend that there's this electronic
brain where there isn't it's just us
talking to ourselves see any channels
and so there's there can be no such
thing as an electronic president that
president would just be a channeling of
some number of people's data
I mean democracy is in the sense that
it's an algorithmic leadership scheme I
mean that's what that's what the ideal
of democracy is if you if you want to
think of it that way and I hope
democracy is still possible well on that
cheery note do you guys have any
question I have a question about using
virtual reality for health I know that
there have been some studies and
veterans hospitals using virtual reality
to manage pain and I'm wondering if you
could talk a little bit about how it
could sort of be keyed into assisting
people rather than demolishing them yeah
no I mean virtual reality in medicine
has been very well-established for
decades and in fact my proudest time in
the early the first phase of virtuality
in the 80s was co-creating the first
surgical simulator at Stanford with dr.
Joe Rosen and probably the most pleasant
outcome of that personally is that in
the last couple of years my wife's been
battling cancer and successfully but one
of her most difficult procedures was
performed by somebody who trained with
somebody who trained with Joe my old
partner and building the simulator and
the procedure she underwent was designed
in a in Evert reality surgical simulator
and he trained for it in reality and it
was successful so
it came around to us and so that sort of
thing is very commonplace and has been
and every vehicle that you use was
prototype in VR at this point and I mean
there's a whole industrial life of it in
which it has done very good things and
then there are a large variety of
medical applications that have been
tested including a lot of psychiatric
ones PTSD phobia treatment that sort of
thing I was initially skeptical because
I thought they sounded too trendy but
then they sort of have really worked out
in clinical trials and the question is
could you use fort reality for behavior
modification and prison systems possibly
a friend of mine named Walter Greenleaf
who studies this has tried to use which
reality simulators to help gang members
learn skills to avoid conflict and he's
had pretty good results and some
replication so I don't I don't think
there's such a thing as a panacea in
this area but I think that these can be
helpful tools
hey Jaron it's Nayland I'm wondering if
you could talk a little bit about what
are some possibilities for cultivating
spaces that are not susceptible to this
sort of digital pacing like how do like
how do we go back to the kinds of places
of sort of serendipity and mild danger
and and excursion that are outside of
these kind of behavior loops well I
think there's an easy answer to that
which is just provide people with some
alternative motivation other than the
pure seeking of attention so if the only
thing you can get out of a system is
seeking attention then you'll turn into
a kid who's acting out again and then
everything turns bad some examples of
systems that that offer alternatives if
you look at the various social networks
and you say which are the ones that
don't have a bunch of malicious fake
information don't have
mob like ganging up on people don't have
bullies
they're always ones where there's
something else to do other than seek
attention like a LinkedIn people are
worried about their career so they have
something else to think about we did a
virtual world some years ago called
Second Life some people might remember
and there was an economy in it and it
had bullies it had what they were called
griefers back then but not as many and
and you know you just give somebody some
alternative creates some broadening and
diversity in incentives that are
available and I think people rise to the
occasion thank you
could you talk a little bit about what
you think happened to you
telepresence as a technology I believe
you did some work on that in the past
and then it never really seemed to
emerge as much as some of the other
things that you have worked on well you
know in the new book and dawn of the new
everything it alternates between story
chapters and technical chapters and one
of the technical chapters actually
includes a section on this and so the
problem is that we never solved the
duplex problem which is that in order to
see someone else three dimensionally in
telepresence if you need some kind of a
display that can do that and very
typically those might be in the form of
a headset but then they see you with a
headset and so if you try to make
software erase the headset or something
it never quite works right because of
what's called the uncanny valley and the
isochron so we've never figured out a
two-way scheme that completely solves
that problem there's lots of sort of
almost ways but that's where it's hung
up right now hi Jaron is there anything
in the music you're working on now or
any music that can help our tattered
social fabric or even our personal
conditions especially with what you're
working on in music well music helps my
tattered condition anyway I like I am
I'm not willing to give up my
starry-eyed idealism about the power of
art I do think that in the present
environment
since even the best things online or
channeled in ways to create negativity
because Adam that's the maximum
engagement factor it's very and and and
this the sort of social networks have
taken over music distribution it's very
very hard to do it in a positive way so
I stopped distributing my music a while
ago I just feel I think there's no way
available that fun that feels positive
to me to do it so I just don't do it
anymore
hi so thank you very much for your talk
I was wondering where does or where does
or where could religion fit in to the
conceptions you've created so for
example as a child of Holocaust
survivors I was wondering if you ever
read the Maus comic series or something
else related to that to what happened
and what your response was as a
technologist have you had any connection
to Israel and and the technology stuff
that goes on there and you just
mentioned music so it's wondering if you
had any connection or checked out
klezmer which and it's often been called
Jewish jazz so I view those as four
questions that are almost totally
unrelated although they all have some
Jewish connection so let's see let me
I'll try to run through the reverse
order class we're sure hell yes
hand me clarinet I'll show you something
and then absolutely a class or love love
class where and and I mean klezmer is a
whole universe in itself with a lot of
different things that you can call
clothes wear and you know it's great and
then integral I've actually never been
to Israel but we have a zillion Israelis
and Israeli companies in the tech circle
now so see Israelis all the time and I
I should say that the techy part of
Israel tends to be more aligned with the
part of Israel that hasn't been in power
in Israel in a long time there's sort of
two Israel's in the same way there's two
America as far as I can tell not not
having been there
and then let's see then you asked about
a Holocaust literature nest about Mouse
in particular I have read Maus I've read
a lot of other things of course lately I
think everybody's reading haaa aren't
for obvious reasons and within us about
religion and so here I mean it depends
what you think religion is I mean I I
would say the first hypertext was Talmud
for instance very that's an interesting
thing for the goyim you won't know what
I'm talking about that's okay but for
but the thing about virtuality that does
interest me is that there's this way in
which you can I sometimes call it a soul
noticing device because with other with
other forms of other designs for digital
technology you're sort of interacting
with the device and designers typically
tell you to talk to it as if it's a
person so you talk to your phone or you
talk to this speaker thing on your
counter or to your car or something and
if it's like if it's kind of like a
person then you're kind of like a
machine and this kind of equivalence
comes about and people demote themselves
and they think well okay that I'm a part
of the big machine of Facebook I guess
about makes sense but with virtual
reality it's a different story
like um you can keep somebody's Facebook
page going after they're dead but a
virtual reality experience doesn't make
sense once the person is dead because
it's live interactive moment-to-moment
it's a when you're in virtuality you can
change your body you can change the
world you can change everything but
there's still something floating there
no matter what changes and that's you
that's your experience it's your
consciousness and it's very easy to just
go through the day without noticing that
experience is a real thing our tech
culture asks us to forget that it's real
because if we think experience is a real
thing then it cuts a chink in this idea
that we understand everything already
you know because the tech mindset is
that realities understood we're just
filling in details and doing better
technology what if experiences there
then
it totally upsets everything because
it's a whole other dimension of reality
and it is there you know I think you do
experience there's some you that's
floating there you could call it
experience you could call it a soul and
when you experience which reality you
experience a thing floating separated
for one so you can notice it we have
time for two more questions Maureen did
you want to say something I was just
gonna there's some Silicon Valley guy
who is doing um looking for the AI
Godhead now Oh God
[Laughter]
jaren I love your love your mind a
beautiful mind since there are at least
four big elephants in the room if you
read the masha gessen our article in
Harper's the Reichstag fire next time we
know that we're really any week now on
the verge of losing democracy altogether
we know that unless we keep fossil fuels
on the ground in the next two or three
years the plants probably going to go
over the cliff wealth inequality
grotesque wealth inequality it's all
chasing us toward oblivion oh you're
just a bundle of cheer ya know so here's
the good news
I'm a tech activist I'm developing an
app and its really its root core it is
really what Kurt Vonnegut once said
which is the battle between the forces
of good and evil greed and compassion
only one thing has made the difference
organizing so we're trying to play with
a new concept I want to know what you
think about this called crowd acting as
opposed to crowd funding are you
familiar with the concept if not I can
explain it one or two cents well you
know what I have to ask you not to make
a pitch using question time because I'm
a bitch I just wonder what you think of
the concept of how we get millions of
people to be willing to get arrested or
willing to do math civil resistance by
using crowd action so far every time
people have used online platforms to
organize for positive social change it's
been channeled into negative social
change of a vastly greater magnitude
than the initial attempt so in principle
can work but it has to be done
completely outside of any existing
channels you can't if you use social
media at all you're doomed I'm sorry to
be so blunt but it's just over and over
again it happens
I was wondering if there's any emerging
like mythical or philosophical cultures
within technologists that are making you
more optimistic for the future if a lot
of it is based around myth are you
seeing new myth making that is a bit
more happy well it's an interesting
question I mean in a lot of ways the
history of computer science is a battle
between mythologies because computers
are such an abstract thing you have to
have some way to think about what the
bits are I mean this is something that
might not be obvious to see but like if
you took a computer like it took a I
don't know a Macintosh or something and
you stick it in an alien world it would
just be a space it would be like a lava
lamp or something it would be these
patterns changing but it wouldn't mean
anything because the meanings lost and
so the the the bits only mean anything
according to our interpretation and we
have to remember the interpretation from
when we started the process to when we
look at the bits again right that makes
sense right
and so therefore computer science only
has any action to it if it's tied to
some cultural framework and so the and
so therefore myth-making it's very
strange it's a technical field that can
only exist in concordance with a
myth-making process and so and there
have been these battle Royales about
what myth should be in place for
computers from the very beginning Alan
Turing invented the artificial
intelligence idea that we're actually
making new people people that was one of
the first myths but he did it in the
weeks before he committed suicide while
undergoing a really horrific torture
over his sexual identity and I think I
think the artificial intelligence myth
is in its own way escapist it's a way
about escaping that is about creating
some sort of a pristine human condition
that escapes the messiness of sexuality
and the ambiguities of being a person
it's other things too I think I mean I
don't want to I don't want to cheapen or
simplify what Turing was
thinking because we can't really know
what he was thinking he didn't tell us
enough but we know a little bit and
shortly after that Norbert Weiner who I
talked about in the book came up with it
completely he wanted to come up with an
alternative idea because the AI idea
seemed kind of hopeless and creepy to
him and he came up with the idea of
cybernetics that cyber comes from Greek
for navigation that computers would
constantly be connected to the world
like thermostats constantly making
adjustments with algorithms and he
warned that if that was applied to
people it could become a evil
manipulation empire he wrote a book in
1950 called the human use of human
beings where he warned that
hypothetically someday could somebody
could make a global computing facility
with wireless connections to devices
that would be in every person constantly
and could make society absurd but of
course that's not feasible but he it was
just like his bold thought experiment
and and and so in a sense the whole idea
of virtual reality is another one of
these myths if you like I sort of made
up and yet another myth and I some time
in the book I propose that AI and vert
reality are kind of opposites and
they're opposites in the following way
invert reality it's almost people behind
the bits there's no angels or aliens who
are making anything happen it's all
action from people that's reflected
through bits but in virtuality change
the spatial aspect of a person you might
turn into an octopus you might be in
Mars so there's this this is a spatial
transfer in AI we steal the example sets
from real translators then present them
back to you as if it was an electronic
brain so the the transfer is in time
instead of space so that you can even
think of AI and VR as being orthogonal
illusions can you see that another
difference so what's the difference
between a charlatan and a magician a
magician announces the trick and it's in
a sense of virtual reality is when you
announce the trick in AI is when you
don't yep
[Laughter]
Thank You marine thank you okay so
you're gonna we have copies of Maureen's
book two in the back and you're gonna
stick around and sign copies for us I am
I guess Maria thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
