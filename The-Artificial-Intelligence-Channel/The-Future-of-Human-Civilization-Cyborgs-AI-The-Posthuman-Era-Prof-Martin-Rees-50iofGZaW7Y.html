astronomer and a space scientist and I'd
be very lucky to have been working
through several decades now but each
decade has brought exciting new
developments and if I look at what's
been happening now what I'm thinking
about at the moment one issue is the
very beginning of the universe can we
understand the Big Bang right of the
start when we have only indirect
evidence and when the physics is
uncertain and in particular can we
understand how much bigger physical
reality is than the part we can actually
observe we can observe a huge volume
many many galaxies out to 13 billion
light-years from us but there's no
reason to think that that's all a
physical reality any more than if it
middle of the ocean you don't think that
the horizon you see around you is the
end of the ocean and we want to know how
much further reality extends and the
domain we can see and almost everyone
thinks it goes a great deal further but
it may go so far that all combinatorial
options are fulfilled that there are
avatars of us far away making the right
decision when we make the wrong one etc
so that's the possibility and even more
interesting is that our Big Bang may not
be here anyone there may be other Big
Bang's
and they may give rise to universes were
which are governed by different physical
laws because many of the theories of
fundamental physics suggest that there
are many different so-called vacuum
States and they can give rise to
different laws and this leads to an idea
which makes some physicists foam at the
mouth but which I think has to be taken
seriously which is gone anthropic
reasoning the idea that perhaps what we
think of as the laws of nature are just
sort of parochial bylaws there's some
deep underlying laws but what we see in
the part of universe we can observe are
just local manifestations and if that's
the case then of course they're not a
typical manifestation because many of
these universes will be sterile or
stillborn they will
not allow complex phenomena to happen no
stars no chemistry learners no life and
we're in one that does allow these
complexities and to trap it on a firm
footing I think is a big challenge for
the next 50 years I won't live to see
that done I like to quote dialog after a
talk which I gave in a panel discussion
with Andrei Linde and we were asked at
the end how much would you bet on this
multiverse story being correct and I
said on the scale would you bet your
goldfish or your dog or your life I was
nearly at the dog level and Andrei Linde
who's agree upon a of this subject who
spent 25 years developing an idea called
eternal inflation
he said he'd almost bet his life on this
and then Reming told this the great
theorist Steven Weinberg said he'd
happily bet
Martin Reese's dog and Andrei Linde
day's life and I think that was a few
years ago and I think the opinion has
shift in favor taking this seriously I
can give you some indications of this
because in 2001 I hosted a conference on
this subject in Cambridge and we held it
not in the university but in the barn of
my old farmhouse at the edge of
Cambridge and then five years later we
had another conference which was held in
the Masters Lodge of Trinity College
where the speakers stood in front of a
picture of Isaac Newton and Frank will
check attended both these meetings and
he gave the summary talk at the second
one where he said that five years ago we
were a beleaguered minority whereas now
he and I and others had led many other
people into the wilderness and here we
were in front of Newton's portrait
taking seriously the idea that our part
of the universe is just a tiny and a
typical atypical fragment and this is a
big idea so this is a news of the
Copernican revolution which i think is
very important but in fact the other
thing that's exciting now is as
both in a sentence are the Copernican
revolution but on cosmically a much
smaller scale this is the realization
that our solar system is just one of
zillions of planetary systems around
other stars in fact we didn't know that
these planets around other stars existed
even twenty years ago
people speculate they did but the first
one was found in 1995 but now we have
literally thousands that have been
discovered and it's fairly clear that
most stars are orbited by retinues of
planets just as the Sun is orbited by
the earth and the other familiar planets
and many of these planets are very
different from the earth of course but
enough of them are like the earth for us
to suspect that there are literally
billions of planets in our galaxy and
remember our galaxy is one of billions
in universe planets on which conditions
were rather like on the young earth and
where life could have evolved now of
course saying a plan is habitable isn't
the same as saying it's inhabited
because we language into biology and
biology is a much harder subject than
anything in the physical world and even
if we understand a planet and we know
that it's got a geology like the young
earth etc we don't know how life gets
started
in fact we don't even understand how
life got started on earth we understand
Darwinian evolution from simple life to
complex life but we don't understand is
the transition from just complicated
chemistry to the first replicating
metabolizing structures that we call
alive but the good news is that this
subject which was relegated to the as it
were too difficult books by most
scientists serious people didn't work on
it except as a hobby it now attracts the
attention of serious people so I'm
optimistic that within 10 years or so we
will have an understanding for how life
began on the earth that'll tell us two
important things it'll tell us first
how likely was it was it a rare fluke or
is it something we would expect to have
happened on these other planets which
are rather like the earth and the second
thing that these water tell us is
whether there's something very special
about the chemistry of DNA and RNA which
all dressed your life is based on or
could there be other kinds of life could
they even be life that doesn't need
water maybe there are planets which we
wouldn't think a habitable Betar in our
solar system for instance as the moon of
Saturn called Titan which is at minus
160 degrees centigrade and has lakes of
liquid methane it looks as though it
would be rather nice place and if life
could live based on methane not on water
then places like that will be habitable
these are questions that we'll be able
to answer but also we might have some
direct evidence for whether planets have
life on them because at the moment we
only have indirect evidence for these
planets we don't see them we see them or
we infer them through the effect they
have on their parent star the best way
to detect them is that if a planet
transits in front of a star then it
blocks out a bit of a light from the
star so the star looks slightly fainter
so a signature for planets is if a star
shows regular dips and then another dip
and another dip each time the planet
comes round and that is a method that
had led to the discovery of thousands of
planets and from that kind of evidence
you can infer how big the planet is from
how much of the star that it blocks out
and of course what the length of the
eater is from how frequently you see the
recurrent dips so we have that kind of
evidence but of course we'd really like
to observe these planets directly and
not just see their shadows as it were
and this I think we will be able to do
for these nearest ones in about
ten years using the James Webb Space
Telescope and using the next generation
of big telescopes on the ground in
particular a telescope which Europeans
are building which is unimaginative
called the extremely large telescope the
ELT which has a mirror 39 metres across
not my big sheet of glass but in effect
a mosaic of 800 sheets of glass and the
James Webb telescope and the ELT should
be able to identify the light from a
planet even though the plan dishes
millions of times fainter than the star
is orbiting around and tell us something
about the atmosphere is there something
specially Green doesn't have oxygen is
the atmosphere out of equilibrium as
Lovelock says it would be if there's
life there etc those are the kind of
questions you might be able to answer
within 10 years and this is a very
exciting development now of course that
kind of observation is going to tell you
if there's some kind of life but of
course what most laypeople want to know
is is there any advanced life
intelligent life and that's a completely
different question more speculative
because even though we understand how on
earth life evolved over four billion
years from simple proto organisms to the
biosphere that we see around us in orbit
we're apart we don't know the extent to
which that was inevitable and the extent
to which there were contingencies in
fact there was a big debate among
biologists Stephen Jay Gould thought of
lots of contingencies he thought if you
were to rerun evolution and if the
dinosaurs hadn't been wiped out in the
balloting of a difference then you might
end up with a quite different biosphere
with no intelligent life as Myer I think
thought the same thing whereas others
somehow feel that the evolution of life
is going to be rather like happened on
earth and something will emerge with
intelligence
and even though we're completely
uncertain I think it's such a
fascinating question that it's worth
using every possible efforts to see if
we can find evidence for something
artificial something beeping some
apparent artifact or something which
could not be natural and that's why I'm
very keen to support yuri milner a
Russian investor who was put a
substantial sum of money ten million
dollars a year for 10 years into the
search for extra intelligence and this
will allow a much deeper search that has
been done in the past one day of what
this search will be able to do would be
equivalent in terms of depth to all
that's being done up to now by earlier
searches going back to Frank Drake Carl
Sagan are the great pioneers and I think
it's worth a try we don't know what to
look for but it's worth looking for any
evidence for some theories artificial of
a narrowband signal something which is
beeping in a curious way etc but what we
expect to find my personal view is if we
find something it is not going to be the
sort of civilization our people talk
about when you look at if we think of
what's happened on earth then there's
been four billion years of evolution and
for a few millennia there's been some
kind of civilization organized human
groups leading advantage technology and
the world we live in today if we
extrapolate and of course the
extrapolation we get depends on whether
we listen to someone like Ray Kurzweil
or someone more conservative but I think
even though the rate of progress is
uncertain the direction of travel is
pretty well agreed and it's almost
certainly going to be towards a
posthuman world where our intelligences
would be surpassed by something which
will either be genetically engineered
from us or more likely is going to be
some sort of artificial some electronic
device which has not all human
capabilities but has
robotic abilities and and intelligence
and some people say that what happens in
a century others say it will happen
within a few hundred years and even if
it takes a few hundred years that of
course is a tiny instant compared to the
power system on earth and more important
it's a tiny instant compared to the
long-range future because there are
billions of years ahead for our solar
system maybe even more for the universe
and so the way I look at it is this that
if you imagine a time chart for what's
happened on the earth there's been four
billion years when to be no
manifestations of any technology then a
few millennia of gradually expanding
technology generated by human beings but
then after that maybe billions of yours
more when the dominant technology the
dominant non natural things will be
entirely inorganic that therefore means
the following if we were to detect some
other planet on which life had taken a
course rather similar to what happened
here on earth it's unlikely that its
development there would be officially
synchronised with development here that
we would catch it when it's in the those
few few millennia when we got technology
which is controlled by organic beings
like us if it's lagging behind what's
happened on earth then of course we'll
see no evidence for anything about
official on the other if it's ahead then
what we will detect if we detect any
evidence that that civilization existed
will be something which is mechanical
which was machines and those machines
maybe will not be on a planet because
they may not want
want water etc so there maybe in space
so I think if the euro Millar program
detects anything then it's likely to be
some artifact which is created by some
long dead civilization and it's unlikely
therefore that it be any kind of coded
message intended for us but it might be
something which we could clear clearly
see was not something which emerged
naturally and aphid in itself be be very
exciting to expand in a bit more detail
about what's going to happen here on
earth that might lead to this takeover
by post humans in some form I it leads
to another fascinating question which is
the future for space flight and land
space flight another things I've been
fascinated by since when I was young I
remember reading about Neil Armstrong
land and all that and thinking at that
time that it will only be ten more years
before there were human footsteps on
Mars but of course but we know that what
happened was that the Apollo program was
fueled by superpower rivalry and when
the Americans had beaten the Russians in
the boom they cut back expenditure NASA
joined the Apollo program is spending
more than 4% of the u.s. federal budget
it's now down 2.6 percent so it has to
be a real step change if they would have
ever go back and do something a trumped
what the Apollo program had done and of
course what we've seen in the last 40
years has been humors just going around
in low-earth orbit but huge developments
in miniaturization and in robotic probes
let think of the pictures we had sent
back from Pluto just last year lost from
NASA's new horizon Pluto is 10,000 times
further away than the moon is and we had
these very clear pictures of it and what
was remarkable about those pictures was
that they were based on 1990s technology
because the space probe had taken 10
years to get to Pluto and of course the
design has to be frozen several years
before launch and
we think how smartphones have evolved in
the last 10 or 15 years one knows how
much better we can do now in sending
miniaturized probes and throughout the
solar system and that's what we do for
science but I still hope that people
will go but I think they will go not in
the style of NASA astronauts they will
go more in the kind of mode being in
visited by Elon Musk's SpaceX and these
other private pioneers they be
adventurers prepared to accept high
risks
NASA's man's program is so expensive
because of a so risk-averse the shuttles
failed twice in nearly 140 launches each
of those failures was a big national
trauma we've been so there's something
which was safe and routine test pilots
are happy to accept a far more than 2%
risk and there are many adventurers who
will repair to people like the guy who
fell supersonic - from how to balloon
and as a british adventurer called
van or fine so at the age of 70 dragged
a sledge across the Antarctic and winter
the people like that and they're the
kind of people who will be the first
colonizers on Mars I think that's where
we go I don't think Ellen musk is
realistic when he imagines sending
people hundreds at a time for a normal
life because Mars is going to be far
less Clement than living at the South
Pole and what many people want to do
that so I don't think would be many only
people who want to go but there will be
some crazy pioneers who will want to go
even if they have one-way tickets and
the reason that's important is the
following that I suspect that we are
going to want to control here on earth
by regulation the application of genetic
modification and of cyborgs techniques
on grounds of ethics and of prudence and
this links with the another topic I want
to come to later which is the risks of
new technology but if we imagine these
guys living as pioneers on Mars they're
out of range of any terrestrial
regulation and moreover they've got a
far high
incentive to modify themselves or their
descendants to adapt to this very alien
and hostile environment so they will use
all the techniques of genetic
modification which 50 years from now
will be of course far more powerful than
they are today and also cyborgs
techniques and maybe even linking
themselves or download content machines
and so the posthuman era is going to
start probably not here on earth but
it's going to be spearheaded by these
communities on Mars so I think these are
the exciting developments in space I
don't think that people will go for any
practical purpose because robots are
became more sophisticated and all the
science can be done by robots just as
well as by human beings in the future so
humans will only go as a spectator sport
or as an adventure but the other thing
that will happen is that by the second
half of the century there will be huge
fabricators up in space able to assemble
huge telescope dishes solar energy
collectors and things like that
maybe Mining material from the moon or
from asteroids and that of course is
something which can run away because we
get bigger bigger machines making larger
and larger artifacts but I think that
will happen and it may be controlled
from USP it won't need humans up there
this could be done by machines but this
will be an entirely new technology which
could be very important for us on earth
as a way of getting clean energy more
efficiently for instance ai and
generalize machine learning of course
are topics where I'm a follow I'm in no
sense an expert but it's clear that they
are surging ahead very fast now some of
the key ideas actually developed in the
1980s and 90s from a guy called geoff
hinton but they've only been realizable
because of the greater processing power
of modern computers because the learning
which is done by these methods requires
analyzing a huge amount of data I mean
for instance the Google translation
algorithms which are very effective now
they are now done not by feeding in
detailed information but by letting the
Machine read not only millions but even
billions of pages of documents and they
use European Union EU documents I never
got bored so they read those in
different languages and eventually they
work out for themselves
the syntax of different languages and
machines
learn by crunching huge amount of data
many many books and pages and they learn
to recognize cats and dogs by looking at
literally millions of pictures and they
can identify natural kinds like cats and
dogs in without being told so they can
learn for themselves without being
programmed and that's of course the big
difference between the deep mind
computer which played go last year and
become world champion and the IBM deep
blue computer which twenty years earlier
had beaten Kasparov the World Chess
Champion the chess-playing computer was
programmed in detail by experts whereas
the go playing computer was not it
learnt itself by watching many games
analyzing many games and playing against
itself and eventually managed to make
moves which puzzled even expert players
but proved to be excellent moves and and
now a computer is able to play poker
very well that's again is something
which it learns itself so there is this
important development in generalize
machine learning which enables the
machines to actually learn without being
programmed in detail and this is an
important breakthrough and I think we
should rightly acclaim it and I think we
can expect very rapid progress because
people sometimes say well if we look at
the history of AI there being these
false dawns there was one in 1960s and
then there was another one 1990s and now
there's another one but this time it is
different and the reason it is different
is that it's got above the threshold
when does commercial interests and lots
of money being thrown at it in the past
it was just done by a few academics and
I know in this country
the field was completely killed off
because a scientist called James lighty
wrote a report saying it would never
work and that stopped all the funding
because it's dependent on small amounts
of academic funding whereas now it's
clear that there are lots of major
commercial sponsors for AI and this is
means it's not going to die and it's
going to develop fast so I think this
time it is different and I am fortunate
to have got to know some of the people
in this field almost next but
particularly the people after google
deepmind which is a company based in
london and they are very keen to
interact with academia and also blur the
boundary between academia and commercial
work in to respect first they try to
publish as much as they can in the open
literature they've had papers in nature
for instance reporting on some of their
breakthroughs like the go plan computer
and they also encourage the young people
who work there to it to publish
obviously some things which are
commercially confidential but they try
to be as open as possible the other
feature of some of these groups doing an
AI is that they realise that things are
evolving so fast that is not premature
to think about the need for regulation
and perhaps for sort of guided
responsible innovation to make sure that
things don't go badly wrong and in this
respect they're rather like biology
because the people who work on gene
editing and all that they've accepted
for a long time that you need to have
some kind of a regulations and try and
enforce it and so the people in a I fear
we have to think about the same thing
and to try and ensure that the programs
don't get loose in the internet of
things or something like that and also
to try and think about the order in
which or like things to happen if you
think about future risks it depends on
whether a happened before B or it
happens after B and you want to try and
ensure that things are done in the
best order of course it's gonna be hard
to enforce this when there are many
commercial pressures involved but so far
there has been a very interesting dialog
between those in academia and those in
the commercial world and that's not just
on the ethics but also on the on the
science because the other interest is
what's sort of exemplified best by Dan
Dennett for instance which is the the
nature of artificial intelligence and
the extent to which it is like human
intelligence and the extent to which
consciousness is part of it and this is
of course a classic philosophical
problem and this is I think one context
where the philosophers really can
provide a perspective because most of
the the techies and geeks come to these
problems of fresh without knowing the
history of these debates about what is
meant by the brain and dualism and all
that I think that not only do the AI
people need to engage with those
concerned with safety and ensuring that
the regulation is appropriate but also
there are clearly deep philosophical
questions about what are the limits of
AI what will change if we have quantum
computers and to what extent are these
going to be conscious beings because
clearly they will have more and more
human capabilities and this raises the
field for a question of is consciousness
an emergent property of any sufficiently
complicated system or is it something
which is special to the kind of wet
hardware in our skulls and the fact that
we are linked to a body this is a very
old question and it's still an important
question and of course it has has been
opened movies but it's a serious issue -
implications for how we should treat
these robots when they're seemingly
intelligent and what responsibilities we
have towards
because most of us feel we have a
responsibility to ensure that other
human beings can exploit their potential
and even at some animal species can
exploit their potential and are given
the opportunities that they need and the
question is are we going to have to
start worrying about whether robots are
underemployed or bored as we would if
they were things with a consciousness we
just don't know if we're going to have
to do that and that's a very deep
question because of course the old
question of how do I know you're not a
zombie
I only know by analogy or not a zombie
and that's going to be true for the AI
as well but I think it's good that there
are some philosophers who take this
seriously Dan Denis is one another
actually is my colleague Hugh price in
Cambridge and police have lost for
science but he's also taken interest and
that's why we are starting up in
Cambridge as an outgrowth of our Center
for excessive risks a new center for the
Future intelligence which is going to
try and address questions of artificial
intelligence and also real brain science
as well from a philosophical and an
ethical perspective so I think there are
some people indeed some people who carry
a trade union card as philosophers who
are starting to take this seriously
rather than those who have a purely
humanistic background we we've got to
ensure that the public does know what's
going on and that there is some
regulation and there's a big issue about
privacy and who has access to your
personal data and all that and that's
coming up in this country with medical
records can they be anonymized
adequately I mean maybe Ross Anderson
talks about this and you probably heard
him on the subject and this is a very
serious issue in this country and and
elsewhere so we do have to address these
issues but turning to the to the risks I
think
we've got this new Center in Cambridge
and we're really trying to do something
which is not done sufficiently I mean
there are huge numbers of people
thinking about conventional risk like
carcinogens in food low radiation doses
and that sort of thing whereas these um
high consequence and low probability
risks which are coming upon us because
of technological advances and because of
the greater interconnectedness of our
world are not being studied that much
and that's why I and a few other people
felt we should try and do do a bit
towards this because even even if we can
only reduce the risk of one catastrophe
by one part in a thousand the stakes are
so high we'll have more than earned our
keep by doing that and it goes back to
the book which I wrote about 13 years
ago now called our final century of our
final hour in the US which did address
some of these concerns and there were
two types concerns that I addressed one
was the collective effect that we are
having as a species because of the
heavier footprint we are making on the
planet because the more of us more
demanding of resources and we are
causing changes to the atmosphere the
climate and all that and as a risk of
environmental tipping points as it were
that's one one thing that is fairly well
appreciated now although it's under
acted upon still for obvious reasons
because the issues are long-term and
diffuse and politicians focus on what is
what is local and and and immediate but
the second class of threats which I
think was the most distinctive thing I
highlighted in that book and which is I
think stood the test of time quite well
which is that we are getting more
vulnerable because the world is more
interconnected and small groups or even
individuals are more empowered by
technology so as I put it the global
village will have its village idiots and
they will now have a global range and
this is because they are
empowered by technology we see this in
cyber attacks which can be done by just
one geek but they can have an
international effect and this is getting
more serious we're all aware of that and
there will be other threats as
artificial intelligence gets more
powerful and more more diffuse when we
have the Internet of Things will be far
more vulnerable and to be an arms race
between them those who are trying to
prevent these sorts of attacks and those
forever more genius in doing them so
that that's one threat the AIA by oh
sorry
AI and cyber but there's also the bio
issue and here I find it very scary I'm
not a biologist but talking to them I've
I'm very scared because of the very
rapid developments and because the
techniques that are needed are
small-scale and jool use available in
many university Lampanelli industrial
labs it's not like making nuclear weapon
which needs last conspicuous
special-purpose facilities so this does
worry me and some people say well these
techniques are more powerful we just
need more regulation they quote the
example of the famous conference in
Asilomar in the 1970s when the leaders
in melaka biology got together to
discuss their new techniques of
recombinant DNA and they discussed
whether some types of experiments on
which they should impose a moratorium
whether some things they should be
careful about doing etc and they came to
an agreement and they were if anything
overcautious but they managed to enforce
what guidelines they thought were
appropriate and there have been similar
groups convened by academies the Royal
Society the NASA kind of science etc
involving some of the same people people
like there who Baltimore who were
involved in the old Asilomar conference
to try and address the risks for
crispr Cassadine and those new
techniques and also another new
technique or gain-of-function where
people have shown that you can make the
influenza virus for instance more
variant or more transmissible such
experiments were done in Wisconsin and
in Holland in 2012 and the US federal
government stopped funding them in 2014
because they seemed potentially
dangerous so these new techniques gained
a function and CRISPR cast nine and
clearly powerful and they have downsized
both ethically and Prudential and
therefore everyone agrees they need
regulation but the difference between
the present state and the old Asilomar
conference in 1970s is that now the
community doing these experiments is far
more global and also there are far more
commercial pressures and what makes me
very depressed and very anxious is that
even if we have these guidelines which
are agreed though globally then I don't
believe they can be effectively enforced
globally any more than the drug laws or
the tax laws can be enforced globally I
worry that whatever can be done will be
done somewhere by someone and we can't
stop it we can obviously do what we can
to minimize the risk but we can't stop
it so we need to think about what
precautions we can take now of course
people say in order to reassure people
like me that biological weapons haven't
been used by governments because their
effects are uncontrollable and if you
are a government for the world to find a
more even a terrorist group with
well-defined aim then you won't want to
release some biological pathogen which
you don't know who is going to kill that
may be true but it's just that reason my
worst nightmare is someone who is
sort of ecology fanatic with the mindset
assembly extreme animal rights people we
had in this country someone who thinks
that the world Gaia is being polluted or
destroyed by too many human beings
though many people who think that but if
there's one person who thought that and
had this kind of mindset then of course
they might think it's a good idea to try
and kill off as many human beings as
they can they wouldn't care who it was
and obviously this is unlikely you need
to have someone with this very extreme
psychology but the point is that one
such person is too many because the
downsize could be so colossal and I
think that that is number one on my my
list of not entirely unrealistic scares
if we look further ahead then of course
we have to ask how far these techniques
will go in and how you should design new
species etc and that's why I think
groups like we have in Cambridge are
well set up to use our convening power
to get some of the world's best
biologists together to try and
brainstorm and see if they can figure
out when the boundary is between what is
pure science fiction and what might
actually happen now of course they won't
be right but they're more likely to be
right if they're working at the frontier
than the random person and that's why I
think academic groups like ours and the
fear for other similar ones around the
world can I think be helpful in trying
to decide what are the concerns we
should focus on and what can we do to
minimize those we should do something
but I'm pessimistic because these
techniques in biology very widely
disseminate and biohacking is a sort of
student support sport almost you know
and it's going to be very possible to to
do these sorts of things and in fact
Freeman Dyson in one of his articles in
New York Review of Books speculates that
the next generation of kids
maybe able to design new species just in
the same way as he had a chemistry set
and made new chemicals now I hope that
is science fiction but if that weren't
then of course it may be curtains for us
all because you can't if you try and
mess up the ecology then that could be
dangerous and Adi even the quite short
term there are issues being discussed
related to these gene modification
techniques called gene Drive where it's
possible to affect the fertility of a
particular species and and wipe out a
species this has been used in a
seemingly benign way to try and kill off
the mosquito species that carries the
Zika virus and if that works that's fine
but then people are saying well this
should be used to kill the the grey
squirrels in England which are
dominating the ground squirrels wherever
and likes much better kill off all the
grey squirrels now that may be feasible
but of course when you mess with ecology
in that way there's a nonzero risk of
things getting out of control or
certainly unintended consequences
so I think given the power of these new
techniques and the fact that they are
going to be usable by literally millions
of people with modest equipment then I
think we are going to have a bumpy ride
and a growing tension between privacy
security and liberty if we want to try
and minimize these risks I think these
are these are serious worries and
despite the exciting developments I I do
worry about how we are going to cope
with these new developments and also I
worry that society is fragile as well as
being interconnected and let me give you
another example of this quite apart from
biological weapons natural pandemics of
course can emerge you know and we can
try and do what we can to preempt them
for instance if you want to stop
pandemic spreading
what I've got to do is to make sure that
a Vietnamese farmer notices any strange
disease in his pigs or his hens we gotta
try and minimize those but but if a
pandemic spreads then of course it will
have catastrophic consequences and
especially catastrophic because of
social consequences if we think back to
earlier pandemics the the black death or
even the the influenza epidemic in 1919
which killed many millions then of
course it didn't cause the breakdown of
society whereas I think now if we had
any kind of pandemic in the UK or the
u.s. then once the number of cases
exceeded the capacity of hospitals to
cope with then I think that'd be real
risk of social breakdown because people
would know that treatment was available
but they're not getting it and I think
that sort of pressure and potential
breakdown would happen even if only one
person in a thousand got infected just
thinking what the capacity of hospitals
is so in that sense our society is more
vulnerable to a pandemic
there's an interesting sociological
question which is that if there is a
pandemic in Mumbai or leg offs or one of
these mega cities then it will be
terrible but does the fact that most
people have mobile phones make it better
or even worse this I think is an
important so it's not a question you
could say it makes it better because
advice can be disseminated etc but on
the other hand it allows panic and rumor
to spread more rapidly and it's not at
all clear and identities clear to anyone
what the balance is between those two
conflicting effects but that's just an
example of how in order to minimize the
downside of these risks which we can't
reduce to zero we need to the
about the social science impact and of
course there many things we can do to
minimize the risks even though we can't
eliminate them and we can at least make
people conscious and the other thing
which is very much at the forefront from
my mind being based in university is to
try and promote long term thinking
because at least when we are interacting
with people age 20 they may be alive at
the end of a century and so they are
going to be more concerned about what
may happen towards the end of a century
the technology is not very predictable
but of course environmental changes and
climate change which is not going to be
important on a timescale of a decade is
going to be more important then so they
are more concerned with these things and
I think it's very important to sensitize
the younger generation and indeed the
wider public to these issues because
although to be fair many politicians
that in this country are very aware
about these long term threats the effect
of climate change the risk to
biodiversity etc they aren't going to
prioritize dealing with these unless
this public demand and even if a science
advisor to a minister makes the point
and of course we've had good science
advisors in this country and the US had
John Holdren people like that they can
make these points but I think the points
they raise won't be acted upon unless
has continued public pressure and that's
why I think it's very important that
scientists should obviously if they're
lucky they can be a scientific adviser
but those advisers have limited impact
on political leaders what politicians
care about far more is what's in the
inbox and what's in the press so in a
way I think the scientists have the
biggest impact are probably those who go
public those who become media figures in
the Carl Sagan style public figure and
we can think of other examples because
they influence a wide pub
and that public then does bang-on and
feeds into the press and to politicians
so I think it's very important that we
should on these long term issues try and
ensure that the the public is engaged
and of course those of us in academia
can start with our our students but we
want to go wider than that and
incidentally I I think there's one
example where even the Catholic Church
has had a positive effect because the
the Pope produced an encyclical in the
summer of 2015 where he raised concerns
about the risks to biodiversity and to
climate from the heavier footprint of
the rising human population and he said
for the first time to his flock that
humans have a duty to the rest of
creation he didn't take the old attitude
that man has dominion over nature he
said something which only Franciscans
had really said clearly in the past
which was that people did have a
obligation to nature and whatever one
thinks of the Catholic Church one can't
contest it's got global range a
long-term vision and concern with the
world's poor and I think that statement
which was spread around the world in the
summer of 2015 and the Pope got a five
minute standing ovation of the UN on
this was an important input to the Paris
conference on climate change in December
in 2015 which was of all those climate
conferences the one where at least there
was a consensus it's limited in its long
term impacts but I think that was an
example where the the public impact in
Latin America East Asia and Africa did
have a big effect on making a consensus
easier to forge in in that context I
personally think it's going to be very
hard to get people to cut down on co2
emissions because the effect is so
diffuse and long-term
if it involves any sort of denial of
what they want and that's why I've been
very much behind the campaign to
increase the level of research and
developments into all kinds of carbon
free energy and another outcome of the
Paris conference led actually initiated
by a British group but led then by
America and India together was to
persuade more than twenty countries to
double their level of R&amp;amp;D into research
into all kinds of clean energy
generation and into the ancillary
technologies of batteries and DC grids
and things like that and the motive for
that is that this is an exciting this
it's hard to think of a more inspiring
goal for young engineers and to provide
clean cheap energy for the developing
world but also the more we do the
research and this is going to be now
funded at a higher level by government
and also incidentally Bill Gates and the
group of private philanthropists they
they joined and they said they will
spend more on this if this succeeds it
was speed up the availability of clean
non carbon energy generation after an
economical price because as things
develop the costs come down and as soon
as the costs come down more realistic it
would be for Indians who clearly need to
have more electric power so that they
don't depend on stoves burning wood and
dung easier for them to leapfrog
directed clean energy and not build
coal-fired power stations so I think the
most feasible way to deal with climate
change and co2 in the long run is to
accelerate as much as possible the
development of carbon free energy so it
comes down in costs and everyone will
choose to prefer it when it is as cheap
as fossil fuel and we can't predict of
course which future technology will come
up from surprised us just as much as the
the iPhone did in the past and we can't
predict either which will be taken up
because there are of course cases where
technologies allow things to happen
but there's no demand I mean take an
example supersonic airliners you know 50
years ago some people might have thought
that we'd all be flying supersonically
where they're flying well it's the same
way as we were 50 years ago for reasons
we can understand there was no economic
pressure for supersonic flight and so
there are examples and of course manned
space flights another example where
governments funds in the past but don't
now so it's not the case that all
technologies are developed but some are
and some are developed and run away at a
huge rate and those who control those
runaway technologies are in a very
powerful position and how we're going to
cope with that is something which is a
big challenge for all of us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
