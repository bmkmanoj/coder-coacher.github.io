tire track stories about robotics I
think unlike Peter was talking about IT
being 10 to 15 years robotics is more
like 20 to 30 years for the same sort of
change from fundamental breakthrough to
economic production and once we get my
title up there you'll see that it says
robotics automation and the future of
transportation I did not come up with
that title but since I'm talking about
the future of Transportation apparently
I will Peter I'm gonna give three
stories Peter asked me just earlier this
week to give some tire track type
stories and there's a there's a great
commonality with all the stories we've
seen before I'm gonna start with mobile
robots these were the world's mobile
robots in 1977 and the significance of
1977 is when that's when I came to the
u.s. to go to grad school at Stanford
and I chose Stanford because Stanford
had a mobile robot there was one in
France and there was one and at JPL the
the one of JPL was really tally up the
other two people were trying to make
them autonomous I didn't actually work
on the mobile robot myself but I became
hands marv --ax gofer as he was working
on it and 1977 he had to this was funded
by NASA it was a you know early early
work on getting a robot to go on a
planetary surface but in 1977 you had to
either invent or implement everything so
for is this this was a picture he put
for one of his reports to NASA
well he had to figure out how to do
computer graphics and there were a few
papers around and then he had to write a
computer graphics program in order to
make a diagram he also had to invent
image pyramids stereo vision building
maps navigating simultaneously to render
an image on a Xerox graphics printer was
a hard task then but there you see an
image and some data that he was getting
from his stereo vision
and he found this very difficult problem
that you'd take some data where
positions were and then the robot would
move and it takes some more data and
then they had to correlate the data
between the the things from unknown
different coordinate systems so you're
trying to build a map up from multiple
observations as you're moving with
uncertainty in the world and not knowing
the the relation between those those
observations by the way he also had to
build a digital radio link overlay
graphics and all sorts of other stuff
and he had to do path planning and this
robot was the mainframe when everyone
was asleep between midnight and 6:00
a.m. he was on a good night
I helped him set things up he was able
to get about twenty yards in six hours
moving across this space I went to MIT
and and started to work on this problem
myself built a robot from scratch and in
1985 two of us Roger - Thiele and john
pullum on two groups one from France one
from the US published the same idea at
the same conference and that was
something called loop closing that when
you move around and you make many
observations and you keep moving and you
see the same place from somewhere else
you can propagate backwards the errors
and tighten up your observations that
turned out to be a key observation for
what became simultaneous localization
and mapping slam but but the two of us
had terrible terrible model statistical
models I claim my model was worse than
this it was really bad the next year
Peter Cheeseman at NASA came up with a
better model and by 1991 you Durant
white at Oxford along with John Leonard
who's now at MIT came up with a crisp
model but Peter one of the things you
asked about is where do these people
come from Hugh Durant white did his PhD
at the University of Pennsylvania with
the Rosina by Qi and Luo Paul and so he
was federally funded to
what thinking about this problem back
then and then something happened where
there are lots and lots of low-cost
mobile platforms made available and
instead of just a handful of people
working on these problems suddenly
though hundreds of people working on the
problems and by the mid 90s to the late
90s the conference is on on robotics
were all about this problem of SLAM
simultaneous localization and mapping
and people started the read there is the
without Luke closing the observations
and then you do the loop closing and you
tighten it up and you get the Cartesian
map and so lots and lots of papers
publishing maps of computer science
buildings around the country we made it
hard at MIT with the Stata Center
because it's not rectilinear their
results always looked worse than
everyone else's but that Hardware
availability led the crowds of
researchers got the well-defined
scientific problems that lots and lots
of people could work on and it came to
solutions and then DARPA got back into
the picture
Dhafir got back in the picture how do we
now make this practical and with the
DARPA challenge and then the DARPA that
was above was a DARPA Grand Challenge in
the DARPA urban challenge a series of
challenges where people tried to take
this technology out of the labs slam
simultaneous localization and mapping
put it onto real vehicles on real roads
with real traffic which through
Sebastian thrown from CMU then led to
the Google cars and now these
technologies are starting to be in
high-end automobiles
that's a 2014 s-class Mercedes has lots
and lots of safety features not not
completely autonomous driving but a lot
of safety some of this is it's sort of
based around the slam ideas extended out
with other ideas so there's a long
history from really late 70s to now of
an idea which wasn't about self-driving
cars when it started it was about
navigation on other planets and
you know those some work some funding
from Oh an hour but DARPA and NASA were
big in it in the middle when it got out
of the Watson Lots universe universities
then NSF came in and was a heavy funder
of this they were not in the in the
early days but when it became a
well-defined problem that was where lots
and lots of universities lots and lots
of people all making little
contributions came in later it's become
private governments and other private
companies and other governments
Singapore government for instances is
really trying to deploy self-driving
vehicles at the ends of train lines in
Singapore right now Daniela Rus from MIT
is very involved with that but there's
two problems still that are out there
this is since of said future of
transportation it's the future of
transportation part how the drivers
interface with robotic cars so you've
got this robotic car that you're in and
something really bad happens how do you
bring back a person's attention to the
problem and get the person involved
that's a serious problem but there's I
think there's a more serious problem
that people haven't been looking at and
that is the social acceptance of these
robotic cars how do people outside the
cars interface with them so so Peter
you're on a a little country road
walking on a little country road in the
dark at night you know at night and you
hear a car coming and it's really narrow
little road you're walking in the middle
of it the car comes what do you do jump
out of the way you jump out of the way
because you will have no clue whether
the drive of that car is going to see
you or not if it's if it's daytime
central square in in Cambridge
Massachusetts and you step out onto the
road on the marked pedestrian crossing
you don't know where that car is gonna
see you or not either but you look at
the driver and you see if they've got
their cell phone up and their head away
or they're terminally down like this and
you have some social interaction with
that driver some social understanding of
what the drivers intent is so imagine
that Nissan is correct and we are going
to have self-driving cars soon deployed
I think if if there's no interaction no
understanding from people of what the
cars intent is it will be everything a
week like that country road at night if
you don't know what it's going to do the
cars become the first-class citizens the
people become the second-class citizens
and I think that's going to lead to
problems so I think the adoption of
self-driving cars beyond the technology
is going to be a complex interplay of
social and irrational along with better
user interaction and just as an example
the when Bart was built in in the Bay
Area the Bay Area Rapid Transit System
it was originally going to be
self-driving trains but that was
socially unacceptable here in Washington
the redline was running under what's
called ATO automatic train operation
with a person in the cabin but the
computers driving the trains until 2009
when there was a non redundant
communication system and there was an
accident which killed a few people and
it's only in the last few months that
the Red Line trains have gone back to
Starling to go back to ATO automatic
train operation which is much more
efficient because the trains stop
exactly where they're supposed to stop
but just a few deaths and I say just a
few deaths completely change people's
acceptability of self-driving trains we
are seeing self driving trains happen
without it without people at all in a
few places but it came about because
first we had them in very constrained
situations in airports where you had no
choice of going on a self-driving train
or not you didn't realize it was
self-driving and only slowly over time
is that extended so that now the
Toulouse
subway system is totally self-driving
without human operators at all in the
trains and one of the metro lines in
Paris but imagine as we get self-driving
cars
Randee suppose self-driving cars kill
ten people in a year what what's the
reaction to that going to be in the US
that's not good even though there'll be
50,000 people killed by yeah it's around
35,000 people per year now are used to
be 50,000 I've killed by human drivers
but the the outrage about five people
being killed which is not a good thing I
agree but it's not all gonna be about
ration rational cost-benefit analysis
having the self-driving cars may save a
lot more lives that human drivers would
have caused to be lost so I think it's a
complex situation and this is the
research now is not the technical
research the researchers is social
research and it's gonna be these
companies which figure out the adoption
and the adoption models second example I
want to talk about second tire tracks
behavior based robotics this was
something I've gotten because my
statistical models were so bad for
mapping I decided to give up on them and
started looking at models of robotics
based on insects spiders and birds
simple behaviors that didn't have very
complex models and started a different
approach to robotics which took a while
to get going
I at this time we still had a little
block funding from DARPA some of us
remember the block funding days and the
block funding you could do weird stuff
without without having to justify it too
much and that was really good for us so
based on these insects I built robots
and got funding from NASA for very small
Rovers very small planetary explorers
this is a paper with an either Flynn
that I published in the Journal of the
British interplanetary society people
ask me why they publish in that Journal
I just wanted to have Journal of British
interplanetary society on my CV for the
rest of my life
but we worked with with with NASA we
built a little tiny this is a column
angle a summer of 89 built a little tiny
rover out of JPL
that turned into their rocky program
very very highly funded as you can see
those who recognize that that's a old
Macintosh case for the robot body it was
a real little little little tiny project
on the side that Donna Shirley at JPL
kept going with a little trickle of
money meanwhile column Helen greener and
I started iRobot I'm the young guy on
the left there and we started
iRobot as a space exploration company we
were going to go to the Moon and Mars we
did a lot of stuff we tied up with BM vo
ballistic missile defense organization
another government sponsor and put a
robot in one of their brilliant pebbles
it was going to go with Clementine to
the moon we did test launches with it on
earth and then NASA got wind of it and
said oh oh you can't do that but we've
got this little project out at JPL the
Rovers that we had started there and so
we did that's how he got Rovers on Mars
not directly via the company that I
started the bio the project that we'd
started out at JPL at iRobot we went on
we started getting company funding so
this is corporate coming from Junction
wax to build a cleaning robot which
didn't get deployed ultimately and we
got more DARPA funding to build robots
to go out and and inspect areas was the
original idea of them but then in 2002
those robots got deployed to Afghanistan
and then Iraq and 4,500 of them moves
for IEDs in in those two wars so and
another 4,500 robots from another small
robot company in in Massachusetts Foster
Miller which got bought by kinetic
they're about nine thousand robots in
all deployed in
in Iraq and Afghanistan to do improvised
explosive device disposal and at the
same time after 14 failed business
models which I have a list up somewhere
else we got to working business models
in 2002 that Roomba
home robot cleaning which came from the
behavior based stuff and didn't come
from that corporate funding from Johnson
wax the PAC bots were in Iraq
Afghanistan the rumbas brought you this
the YouTube videos of cats on but
there's about 14 I believe 14 million of
those deployed now I Robot making 2
million rumors per year so behavior
based robotics early on it was DARPA and
NASA and ONR onr was really interested
in in the biological emulation aspect
and the middle it was DARPA ballistic
missile defense organization NASA and
MIT II in Japan now here's an
interesting story about how hard it is
to tell when something's going to become
practical Mitty
you might remember was the big the big
thing that Japan had that was funding
its its corporate research the US was
upset with the unfair advantage that was
giving to you Japanese companies so
Mitty said ok we'll fund US companies
too and the very first company they
funded was mine
iRobot at the time called ice robotics
we had 6 employees and we'll funded to
do nuclear power plant robots and we did
it for about three years and then myth
he said ah you don't really need robots
in nuclear power plants and that was the
state until you might remember March 11
2011 when Fukushima happened on March
18th 2011 the Japanese government called
up iRobot and said could you send some
robots which we did I was still on the
board within 48 hours the robots are
still there I was in Fukushima last
April
as part of the Obama of a summit that
was on and with Gill Pratt and so back
in the mid 90s the Japanese government
said ah they're not really needed 20
years later
they realize they'll need and the
Japanese robots could not go in there
because they were not battle-hardened in
the way that the iRobot robots were have
having been deployed in real situations
for ten years later behavior-based
robotics DARPA private companies full
deployment rapid equipping force and
then VC funding to get that outfit third
thing I'm going to show is humanoid
robots this is one of the early humanoid
robots while I read what was going on I
changed my research at MIT to start
building humanoids this is Cynthia
Brazil who's on the Media Lab faculty
now working with one of the early robots
we had robots interacting with people
giving social cues to people
understanding social cues from people
and not very practical at the time this
is what a typical robot installation has
looked like in factories up to now you
notice there are no people where because
the robots are too dangerous so
factories partitioned into all robots no
people you go into an automotive factory
the body shop all robots no people not
even lights on because they don't need
the lights and just sparks flying from
the spot welding you go into the final
assembly it's all people know robots
because you can't mix the two so and
then to get the robots installed you
have to have these beautiful user
interfaces over there on the left
lots of control boxes sensing comes
separate you have to cage them and so
what we did Matt Williamson particularly
in that system developed under NASA
funding serious elastic actuators is
start to put robots in factories with
people and humanoid robots which have
social interactions with people they as
he was showing in that video from the
90s they show the robot what they wanted
to do by grabbing it and moving it
around it learns the tasks not the
coordinates and an ordinary factory
worker who has no training is able to
program these robots whereas traditional
robots there's about 3,000 people in the
world who can program them they have to
understand quaternions six dimensional
vectors
it's a very very complex task and so
there's some of those robots this is a
this is a kid you know that plastic
plastic furniture you have any basement
that no one gets to see it's the real
cheap stuff that you'd put together
yourself this is kidding that sort of
plastic furniture this is a steel case
actually picking up sheet metal doesn't
have to be highly aligned because it
uses force feedback as it puts it in a
press break and then the press break is
bending these pieces of metal these
becomes show but you know drawers in
office furniture the guy in the fire
bear is doing the same job those guys
often don't have fingers that have been
cut off in the press break that
particular place is 120 degrees
Fahrenheit in the summer it's not a very
pleasant work environment his this is
Howie Davidson gearbox gears in a fact
in a factory making harley-davidson
gearboxes these all these tasks that I'm
showing you now very simple tasks we
were not involved in the deployment of
the robots at all it was the factory
workers or the lion engineer this this
particular case the there's a crossbeam
the parts of moving forward till they
break the crossbeam but then it's using
vision in the cameras to locate the part
and go pick up the parts and I think
with that I'll take questions oh yeah I
want just a few more of these these
going just to show you some examples
these are all American factories people
in the factories have gotten these
robots to do these really dull boring
tasks and the humanoid robots early on
DARPA and NASA middle da from NASA and
later VC funding but that that was
really style in 1991 so it's still 24
years and we're not cashflow positive
yet so yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
