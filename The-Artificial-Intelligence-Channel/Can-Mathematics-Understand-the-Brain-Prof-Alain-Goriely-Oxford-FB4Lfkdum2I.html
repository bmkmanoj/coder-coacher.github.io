under wilds building my name is Martin
bride s'en I'm the head of the
mathematical Institute here in Oxford
this highly successful series of public
lectures I'm sure many of you here have
enjoyed previous ones in this series and
it's the brainchild of an angora ally
and he normally introduces the speaker
but he's not doing that today
for obvious reasons because he is the
speaker and so having persuaded various
of the rest of us and to talk about
mathematics for general audience Allah
who's a real master at doing this is
actually going to show us how it should
be done properly so let me introduce him
tell you a few things about allow so and
I is the professor of mathematical
modeling here in the mathematical
Institute he's originally from Belgium
and after getting his PhD from the
University of Brussels he spent a number
of years in the States
most in Arizona until 2010 when
fortunately we were able in those
prepregs that days to attract him back
to britain and he came first to be the
director of the Oxford sent of a
collaborative ok
Oxford sent of a collaborative applied
mathematics thank you and he's now the
director of the air
okie am the Oxford Centre for industrial
applied mathematics
he's an applied mathematician a modern
applied mathematician which means he's
somebody with broad interests who used
whatever mathematics he can to solve
real problems and he has a remarkable
range of interests across mathematics
and into engineering and Sciences so
just to name some of the things he's
thinking about at the moment he's
thinking about the mechanics of
biological growth and it's applications
to plants and physiology the modeling of
new photovoltaic photovoltaic devices
excuse me the foundations of elasticity
the modeling of cancer the mechanics of
the human brain and on and on and on
he wrote this wonderful little book
which you can buy a very modest price
outside and get him to sign and I rather
like what Steve's stroget said at the
back which I think sums up very
well both Allah and and this book that
he complements it for it's snappy
writing illuminating graphics
fascinating examples unconventional
insights and goofy humor allegory alley
conveys what modern applied mathematics
truly is and why it matters when I give
presentations general presentations talk
about what we do in the mathematical
Institute I usually begin with two
slides one of which is to talk about
outreach and diversity in the fact that
not only do we believe in equality in
Oxford but we actually invented it I
then show a a slide of a manuscript can
fit from the sixteenth century that the
equal sign really was invented in Oxford
by a man called Robert record with a
manuscript that's in the Bob Ian the
other slide I always show is is a slide
with our last picture on it and it's
talking about what do we do in the
mathematical Institute well we do
everything from brains thinking about
mathematics to the mathematics of brains
there's a wonderful circularity in this
I like this so you have brains think
about what the mathematics is to
describe brains and so on and so on and
allows the master of this and so without
delaying any longer let me introduce you
to a languor ele who's could talk to us
about can mathematics understand the
brain
thank you very much Martin for the nice
introduction before I start talking
about the brain itself let me indulge a
few general remarks about mathematics in
the spirit of the little book that
Martin mentioned so here I have on the
right mathematics abstract mathematics
fundamental of pure mathematics it's
constituted theorem proof structure and
things like that and on the Left we have
the real world not exactly sure what it
is but I'm told it exists somewhere
outside the building and in the real
world you have application you have
problems you have science you have a lot
of things and the naive idea of
application of mathematics or applied
mathematics is that whenever you have a
problem in that box where you'll find
something in that box and you use it to
solve the problem here of course this
might have been true in the nineteenth
century or the 18th century but it's
certainly not true nowadays when we use
mathematics what we mostly use are
essentially methods this is the
interface with the real world we use
computation algorithm we have things to
solve equation with things to analyze
data we use statistics and so on we use
matrices we use linear algebra where a
lot of it is based on fundamental
mathematics it's very important to have
that basis a lot of it nowadays is not
part of mathematics no more than
accounting she is considered to be part
of mathematics it has its own
development if you really want now to
understand the world and understand the
problem what you need on top of that is
theory and theory is really all the
fundamental principle that people have
extracted over centuries about the world
around us in different discipline it is
physics biology chemistry science
engineering economy this is the body of
knowledge that we have on which we can
draw the broad models use the method to
solve simplify your complicated model
and go back to the real world and try to
understand it better so where the method
give us a way to
interface with the world the
understanding really come from the
theory so naturally would ask me where
is apply mathematics in all that well
apply mathematics is really everywhere
around here some might include that
whole thing around here but it's not
let's not create a debate about that
you'll find people working in Applied
Mathematics working in all these areas
some of them just doing experiments some
of them just developing theory many of
them very much enjoying serving equation
developing new method to solve equation
numerically or synthetic ly analytically
and so on developing new idea or to
handle data and so on and a lot of T's
Theory might even be used as a
nourishment to create new mathematics
just like in the old days when
mathematics was first established there
is on simple question from the real
world so you'll find question everywhere
around here so no to get to the brain
where does the brain fit in there where
in the brain we have a very
well-established theory neuroscience
nowadays is a very mathematical patient
and neuroscience that essentially a type
of applied mathematics for the brain
that relies on a lot of partial
differential equation network Theory
dynamical system and other ideas most of
the interest there is about information
or the brain receive an input and orders
it read that or that input is being
propagated in the brain in a big kind of
network and try to understand the
structure of the network there is yet
another area where mathematics is
heavily used and that is to do imagined
Alice's whenever you put you head in a
scan whatever it is and my riot or CT
scan or anything like that there is a
lot of arguing going there to extract
the information so that it's useful
information and nowadays the best scan
the MRI over the last five years has
been tremendous revolution there's a
method that comes not only from the
development of methods in computer
science but also from fundamental
mathematics the best techniques that
allows to take very quick MRI actually
come from the work of
essentially apply mathematics and other
disciplines correlated so what is my
interest in the brain so when I look at
the brain personally I've always been
fascinated the first fascination I have
is about its structure its convolution
and I have my question and in trying to
understand the brain I wanted to been
systematically on that and over the last
five six years or so I've been trying to
ask question and trying to find basic
answer and to my surprise whereas there
is a lot of work at the brain level at
the functional level I found that there
very little was known about basic
question that I had and I try to
understand and answer them so when I
have a title can mathematics understand
the brain I still not have a definite
answer when I started I said let's try
and let's see if I can understand or can
answer some of my question I thought the
word that can happen to me that I would
learn something in the process and maybe
I won't be able to do any mathematics
but things are such that often when you
start looking at a problem and you try
to dissect it with a mathematician I you
can extract from it interesting problem
and this is what I'm going to try to
convince you so my first question was
what about the shape of the brain or
does it attract its shape is geometry
what are the basic things that we know
another question is what happens during
trauma we always talk about we hear
about traumatic brain injury and things
like that what actually happened what is
the chain of event and what are the
consequence of that can I understand it
from a mathematics perspective again I
found that very little was known on the
description of mathematical description
that modeling of T's and most of it in
the medical literature was unfortunately
not correct yet a third aspect that I
want to address today is about dementia
and this is really fascinating it's a
process that we all know people that are
affected something is happening to a
brain we have a disease progressive
disease degenerative disease that remove
some of the basic faculty and I just
wanted to understand what happens or can
we describe this
so these are the three things that I'm
going tried very quickly to sketch you
and type and in the process try to fill
these different bubbles so here I start
with my first slide you see this is a
painting so when you see it your brain
works
you receive the photo in the back of
your retina that's that information is
being sent to the by the optic nerve all
the way to the occipital lobe where it's
treated it's during part of the memory
there is a very sophisticated algorithm
that people have discovered that allows
you to recognize that it's a phase I and
so on and based on that you trigger some
memory and say AHA yes on top of that
and you've all done that within a second
this is Ludwig van Beethoven a lot of
functional process happened there right
and so you can say or maybe part of your
memories being triggered some music and
one may be wondering why is he showing
us a picture of Beethoven in a master in
the first place so this is all the
function of your brain and what it works
there is physics behind it blood is
being delivered a different part of the
brain signal is being processed so there
is a lot to understand that but again
I'm showing this picture of Beethoven
because I want to talk to you about his
brain so what do we know about his brain
well let's hear from the toven itself
when his pompous brother send him a
letter and sign it from you brother
you're on land honor Beethoven replied
from your brother Ludwig brain honor so
we know you had a brain at lizzy's
thought he had a brain by the time of
his death in 1827 in middle or early in
the 19th century scientists were
obsessed about brain and the morphology
of the brain oh it was related to the
criminality or to the insane or to the
idiot and all that but also to the
genius what makes somebody so remarkable
and indeed the question is the following
as Ludwig says there are many princes
and they will continue to be thousand
more but there is only one Beethoven and
I don't think he meant his brother when
he talked about that
so what was remarkable about Beethoven's
brain is good thing we have his autopsy
report makes very light and enjoyable
reading so we can look in that so the
first thing you think that at the time
it was an ideal for the whole 19th
century and the idea was bigger brains
are better it's something that we still
always a big brain and things like that
so my first parts first part of the talk
the first movement would be oh because
your brain ludovic so when you look at a
human brain like in T's drawing I want
you to have an idea of the physicality
of your brain so our big is your brain
well so you take if you ask people to
say oh that might be my brain but that's
actually you skull so if you put you two
hands together you're welcome to do it
put you and you put them like that this
is about the size of your brain okay so
to be precise let me take a brain here
this is this is the size of your brain
right it's about 1.2 to 1.4 kilogram
about right it's about the volume of
this little ball which is 70 centimeter
radius seven centimeter rate you see
that's right so this is your brain
1.3 kilogram let's say on average and so
on so if bigger brain are better these
brains should be even better
this is African elephant and it's three
times as big as our brain I said well we
know that African elephants are probably
very wise but they don't do crosswords
they don't tweet about Kim Kardashian
and all that but I know it's not as is
it's not a matter of intelligence but
even to do these kind of things you do
need higher cognitive ability you'll
have to agree with them so you gotta say
AHA but wait a second this is only three
times bigger and elephant are much
bigger maybe fifty to a hundred times in
elephant African elephant six thousand
kilos so you should really scale it
should really brain should be the weight
of the brain for the mass of the animal
and and indeed if you scale it up this
is what it would look like he's a random
individual next to an African elephant
and if you scale it indeed the brain
does not grow as fast as the rest of the
body as you go and look at different
animal and this is the law that was
discovered by the swiss physiologist van
halen's in 1762 and he does mention the
African elephant I'm not sure we mention
any royalty in his description and the
idea is as animal gets much bigger the
brain doesn't grow as fast so how would
we quantify that kind of relationship
well let's assume we gather a lot of
data about brain weight and body weight
and the first thing we want to do we
could plot them let's say X is brain
weight and an excess body weight and Y
is brain weight now if it falls more or
less on a line like that what you want
is put a line and then you can find the
best fit line and you'd find a
correlation you'd find the coefficient a
and B in the process very traditional
it's very easy to do but what we want is
not a linear law that we expect from
vanilla slow that it doesn't grow in the
same proportion it grows slower than
than the brain what we express is a
non-denial so the data might look
something like that
where if you try to fit a line you see
the line is really not good there so
that would be a terrible fit for a long
so what you really want is a law that
looks like like this one right what you
want is to find this curve and if a is
bigger that one in such case it goes
faster than the body weight and if is
less than one then it goes slower like
what we would expect from one other slow
so you can try with different power so
it looks like a parabola so I can fit a
parabola but what you really want is to
extract his coefficient so the smart
trick that you can do is you take the
logarithm of that relationship and if
you remember that the log Wing of a
product is the sum of the log reign it
transformed into this log log y equals a
log X plus log B so if it follows a
power law like this in logarithmic
coordinates if I plot log log plot it
would look like a line and a will be the
gradient of this line and if a is less
than one we have something like bananas
law in is bigger than
and what we expect we weren't meant to
be superior so we hope that somewhere
will be sorry we'll be right here and we
can say animals are all over here the
follow natural evolution and we are very
special because we do not follow that
the scaling that does not apply to us as
men is superior where if you look at the
data it's not quite as clear this is
what the data looks like and man he is
still in red
he's right in the middle of the pack
really you see the pesky the dusky
dolphin right here is as good as we are
really and brain to pound where the
mouse is actually the same ratio so
really that ratio argument really does
not apply and indeed the exponent here
it is one a lot slow that is between 2/3
and 3/4 so if you do like scaling laws
and there is a good talk coming in April
7 public lecture here by Joffrey West
who spent his life doing that you say
haha point 66 that 2/3 that I know what
it's coming from something like surface
area and volume or people would say our
hearts 3/4 I know where it's coming from
this is the metabolism below and you can
make a whole theory about that but
that's not what I want to do today I
don't want to speculate I want to
understand the mechanism about that and
you see that his idea of brain white
really doesn't doesn't work and by the
end of the 19th century Darwin was
really aware of this when he wrote in
the dissent of mint
no one supposes that the intellect of
any two men can be accurately gauged by
the cubic contents of their skills and
really that was the end of that that
line of reasoning so going back to going
back to Beethoven if his brain was when
his brain was looked at during the
autopsy unfortunate was not removed the
distinction came to Laplace actually the
mathematician and Laplace sat in a jar
of alcohol as a trophy for many years on
the desk of the pathologist that took it
out so Beethoven's brain was not removed
but he was described as being very small
and a trophy and we'll go back to that
in a second just
but probably the doctors were desperate
to find something special about the
Tobin's brain and in the description
they say the convolutions appear twice
as numerous as in ordinary brain hmm
that's interesting so maybe it's not the
weight that is important for being a
remarkable genius
maybe it's the convolution aha so maybe
we should look at that
so our next chapter or next movement is
or convoluted are you Ludwig and I show
you as a proof as an other evidence of
this obvious statement that can related
Draenor better please I'm offer you teas
brain and I'm sure mathematician would
directly recognize anything coming from
this great brain because this is Karl
Friedrich Gauss the greater so arguably
one of the greatest mathematician who
was described also by a doctor named
Vagner as the cerebrum is remarkable for
the great complexity of the convolution
goes died a little later his brain was
not either remarkable in volume but
maybe there was something special about
it so what do we mean about convolution
let's think about it a little bit deeper
here so if you take a brain and you take
a slice so this is called a coronal
slice will you slice it like that what
you'll see is this convolution and you
see two type of tissue the auto tissue
is called the gray matter because it
appears gray when you stain that you
remove it it's mostly made of cell body
really highly packed it's where a lot of
mental activity i cognitive activities
take place and the white matter inside
it's a more fatty tissue that's why it
looks a little white and essentially you
have axon bundles carrying information
between different part of the brain you
can think of that here is where the
processing takes place and the highway
of information the cables in between
essentially very roughly but what you
see is the convolution where you have
T's rough and T's reaches this valley
and Montaigne that I call sulcus and
gyrus or sulci and gyri if you have more
than one and this is what we go
to look at and in the brain it took it
it takes it first appears around seven
months here the in gestation to
pregnancy the brace is smooth and then
at some point becomes wrinkled and his
wrinkled further develop and then gets
convoluted to a normal brain and let's
look a little bit deeper we have good
scanner for this kind of thing we have
amazing scan actually it is a whole
field that generates a lot of data in
the scan you see right at the twenty
seven twenty eight week of gestation you
go from the smooth brain to and you see
here the wrinkled really developing here
to be very convoluted and indeed if you
look and the idea is that at that time
the area increased much faster than the
volume right so if you look indeed at
the cerebral area at that time it
increased very quickly compared to the
volume so if you had a brain that just
expand like a sphere the area would go
much slower than the volume it goes like
a square and the volume grows laaskar
cube so but if the area grows quicker it
gets folded inside and what you will
measure is the area and for a smaller
volume so the folding comes inside and
that's why you have these different so
how do we quantify that a nice way to
quantify it looks is to look at what's
called the gerra fication index which is
the ratio of the curve where you follow
the contour by the curve that you obtain
around the contour the auto contour here
you see it well is the blue the length
of the blue curve divided by the red
curve the one that you put if you put
like an elastic band around the whole
thing in this case for instance the dura
fication index is 1.47
okay so now we have a way to measure
things and we can go and look at all
animals and all that cut brains and be
happy aha hooray here we are again the
red dot sitting on top of all the
animals way ahead of the competition
so finally we found something that
distinguishes from all these animals and
indeed if you look closely
you compares to a primate cousin we do
much better injera fication of course
the only problem is when you include the
marine mammals we are here and purpose
is here our leader if I even for a long
way and there are many more Jura
fication here so again as a measure of
anything remarkable about the brain this
might not be right so my question is not
so much why we Sapir why is the brain
but again I look at these slides and I
said this is striking in beauty but also
in patterns and apply mathematician
really like pattern formation we like to
understand a pattern of form from simple
physical problems so can we do it in
this case where people of course have
been thinking about that for a long time
and this is there many different
hypotheses for that and we can use
mathematical modeling to test them one
of the earlier hypotheses were going
back to about a century is that that the
brain grows it hits the skull and since
the skull is very hard it's forced to
fall back and that seems a reasonable
idea but in the 50s barony at yale
university did a series of experiment
and when i say a series of experiment
this is cheb number 409 and this is
really sheep number 409 right so it
would go and manipulate the embryo of
the lamb during gestation and see what
happens
very very nice paper a lot of data but I
mean must be quite a carnage if you
think about it I call it the silence of
the Lamb experiment so but one
remarkable experiment he did is the
following
he went during gestation and removed the
skull and when he removed the skull it
still so all the convolution so the
convolution are not created by the
interaction with the skirt another
hypothesis since the leading way of
thinking about is this day is that the
gray matter go undergoes very rapid
tangential expansion on top of the white
matter and that force it to fold on
itself
so let's see if we can understand that
in a simple case let's be like towing
model for that we're going to take some
Prius slide and we're going to try to
understand or or the convolution are
created in a two dimensional setting
let's simplify the problem so if I
rectify that it looks like this I have
the white matter in blue the gray matter
in yellow where the cortex is so since
I'm uninterested in the relative growth
I'm going to assume that the white
matter grow quickly and that there is no
growth in the white matter so the gray
matter grows here so ever be must a thin
film growing very quickly and on attach
bounded to a substrate and elastic
substrate that does not grow and my
question is is there a critical value of
the growth so gamma equals zero mean
there is no growth and get my equals
ones like twice as long as the original
one is there a critical value where
instead of having something like that
I'll have something like this I'm going
to start having wrinkled appearing and
what I want to know is the number of
oscillation per unit length and that
would tell me something about the brain
maybe so why do I call this a toy model
well here is an error an analogy for you
suppose that your scientists was mostly
interested in monster-truck and this is
your favorite one as a scientist you've
been looking at it your whole life and
you know all the part and all the
details you know the piston and things
like that but when you come to the
subject and you say well what I really
want to know is how this thing move what
is the principle of the locomotion to
start with all these things one thing
works for instance right so maybe you're
not so much interested in the world
sticker that is right here that the
scientists think is very important
because it's seen it in all the monster
trucks but maybe we can start with the
wheel so what you want to do is you want
to start with a toy model maybe
something like that or if you're really
lucky you told model is really going to
look very close to the original ones and
this one comes with crushable car so
so this is my time model for you we're
going to play with and my mathematical
toy model is this one this is the
simplest possible one that still
containing a physical information so
that we can learn something it is a
relatively simple equation it's a fourth
order equation that described the
mechanics of a beam attached to a
substrate in very very simple term so W
is that wrinkled what we want is W as a
function of s so for instance this look
like a sign of something sine X right so
we want to find H here is the thickness
gamma is the growth and Phi is the ratio
of the stiffness of the two layers
essentially a material parameter that
tell you are stiff or stiff you layer is
on top of the substrate so it's
relatively simple and I'm sure you want
to see the real thing you want to go and
see under the hood of the real machine
so I can let you peek for as little time
this is the real system in two dimension
that has all the exact mechanics it is a
system of two rather nonlinear partial
differential equation in two variable in
mixed coordinates formulation takes a
while and all that this is the real deal
this is the real thing until on which we
work and you have to add that boundary
condition and this is work with Anza I
don't know times those around and I know
you feel all very sorry for him having
to deal with that but actually we do
have techniques like every every
technical discipline we have way to deal
that it's not like we go by hand and
change the power or something like that
we have plenty of way to deal but
morally the physics of that a lot of the
physics of that is also contained in my
toy model and we all want to go back and
play with it so let's go back to the toy
model so now you find this one is not
too difficult so it's a one with
constant coefficient and maybe you've
already seen ordinary differential
equation it's part of some of the
further Matt so you you will see it at
some point so we can start playing and
removing wheels for instant and see how
it works so
let's see what happens if we remove T
stone so let's remove system that means
we done one and substrate here so we
remove the substrate and what you have
the layer bros push against the wall and
buckles right this is Euler buckling
17:57 as the layer grows it push against
the wall and there's something like that
very well understood and if you work a
little bit on this equation you can you
can find a solution in T's not very
difficult but now we want to add the
substrate back you still have a solution
like that but this one takes a lot of
energy you have to raise the whole
substrate so this is not the preferred
solution the one that is prefer is one
with a lot of oscillation and it's a
it's a compromise between having to bend
so between system and having to lift the
substrate now you see that we can try a
solution of The Fault cosine because
it's constant coefficient the fourth
derivative of cosine is a cosine the
second derivative of cosine the cosine
and the cosine is a cosine so it's a
solution of the equation for some value
of N and gamma so you can put that back
and study it and what you find is that
the critical mode number or mini
oscillation you have depends on gamma is
the square root of gamma divided by the
thickness so here is the thickness and I
can run the whole thing I can do a
simulation of the whole thing and this
is what it would like and we have a
critical value and we have the number of
peaks per unit length or something like
that if this is going to be given and
you recover that in the full system so
the simplified system contains already
the physics there what is more important
is what we can deduce from this formula
well there are three things we can look
at we can see that we will have more
wrinkled larger n if you have more
growth so gamma increase you'll have
more wrinkled with thinner cortex if H
decrease makes n bigger and you have
less wrinkled with thicker cortex so
let's see at these basic trends compared
to what we know about the brain go back
to the brain in the brain you have that
in pathology you have interesting case
so for instance in the case of
schizophrenia
you have excess growth and the excess
growth is related to a lot of wrinkle
and a higher education index so indeed
an increase with gamma you can look at
other pathological case where you have a
thinner cortex and this is chronic
called polymicrobial and when you have
thinner cortex you have more and more
oscillation and when you have a thicker
cortex this is called listen safely and
you can have a almost completely smooth
brain so T's is all consistent so let's
reflect back before we move on to the
next topic
- what we've learned scaling laws a good
way to organize data and try to look at
some laws but it gave a good suggestion
of where to look but if there is any
conclusion is that based on scaling law
there is really nothing special about
the human brain at least not the one we
know but for brain morphogenesis now we
have models that allows us to identify
the correct mechanism that leads to the
convolution we can couple this model to
both the genetic and a cellular level
and try to answer fine a question we can
try we can generalize that we can look
at different species for instance and
different geometry vary the parameter
and all that and recover all the trends
that I observe and since convolution are
an important biomarker for a lot of
neurological disorder like autism
schizophrenia it is crucial to
understand the origin and order form
during morphogenesis or doing brain
development in the process we see that
we had to develop theories to understand
our continued material grow and we had
to formulate a new theory for that that
what we've been doing with colleagues
for the last 10 or 15 years or so we had
to develop new methods in order to deal
with differential equation and they are
nice aspect of pure mathematics that I
have no time to discuss that you can
also generate in the process so let me
go back now to Beethoven all about
trauma so as you know Beethoven was that
for a large part of his life he says
that he didn't hear the 9th symphony
being played for the first time and the
reason they are multiple
potus's of why why was death what was
the cause of his deafness Beethoven
himself attributed that to a fall it
says that he he hurt his brain and that
caused swelling other people believe
that it was the abuse of repeated abuse
of his father and the idea is there that
swelling in the brain caused compression
on the nerve that damaged his earring
the other hypothesis that it was
discussing but for us this is an
interesting part swelling in the brain
swelling is really bad in the brain it
can occurs in different case in an
accident but it can also be due to
rather stupid human activities like
punching each other in the face or using
the head as a weapon it's very strange
when you think from evolutionary
perspective when evolution has built
something over millions of year to try
to protect the brain oh yes but let's
put a helmet around it that's really
going to help or it can also be due to
stroke or brain tumor also create
inflammation that produced brain
swelling high altitude can also - brain
swelling
Medical is called cerebral edema it just
mean brain swelling edema is the
accumulation of read in the interstitium
at the microscopic level it is due to
the fact that freed from the blood
vessel if you think of this as tissue is
being drawn inside the tissue and this
is due to the fact when cell died they
released a lot of small ion positive and
negative charge a neutral solute into
the brain tissue and that creates a huge
osmotic pressure difference between the
tissue and the blood vessel that drains
the fluid from the blood into the tissue
a very complicated mechanism that has
electrochemistry 3 dynamics solid
mechanics and so on that you have to
incorporate and we've done we've done
some modeling that answer some of the
mechanic's question about that but that
takes a little too long the interesting
thing is that when it starts happening
it's really bad why because when it
starts happening the brain swell but has
no places to go so it increased the
pressure at it increased intracranial
pressure blood vessels are accrued
and cannot deliver oxygen to other part
of the brain other cells start dying
they die they release the solute they
released their ions and the brain swell
even more so you have catastrophic event
a cascade that takes place in the brain
and that invade this is the part that is
necrotic that's invade the whole brain
within a few days so when doctor sees an
elevated intracranial pressure of 20
millimeter for more than 20 minutes
nowadays they have to intervene and the
one thing they can do is rather drastic
but it's one of the few things they can
do is this removing a big part of the
skull this is called the compressive
craniotomy you take a big part of the
skull out to let the brain swell and
release the pressure so cells don't die
so that's I thought was very interesting
as a process cool images too so decided
to look a little bit at that and again
we had simple question and if you look
at that my first question is do I
understand his shape others what is the
shape of that burning brain but also
what are the forces generated during
that process if I have swelling here and
what are the possible damage that occurs
during that swelling process so started
with a tone model here's a little
experiment experiments that that Finn
has been doing here in the lab where you
put a genuine you let it swell
essentially it's among the same
mechanically as pressing on it you
probably can see it and it burns but
here is the movie so this is swelling
through an opening emerging that is the
brain and that is the opening here and
what you obtain is a bulge so a problem
was okay let's study the bulging problem
and to my surprise again the bulging
problem has not actually been studied at
all even though a lot of problem in
contact mechanics have been studied so
the bulging problem you assume you have
a big let's say big cylinder and you fix
you fix the displacement around here and
you let the brain bulge out like this so
just like these box you have a small
opening and you squeeze it and what you
want is what happens then this is a
finite element simulation
and what you see here she forces sheer
stress that presents a singularity here
the stress goes to infinity around this
point okay
a national college said singularity is
always a clue this is always a good
point to look at so you can formulate
this problem and do some approximation
in linear elasticity and when you do
that you can further simplify it and try
to find the pressure at all point that
maintain this shape and when you do that
after a long computation you actually
obtain a very simple solution this is
the exact solution for this problem it's
a it tells you the shape of this bulge
and if you look it's actually almost
like a sphere that is squashed by a
factor here in front of it so this is
the exact solution it's a projected half
Emmis feel for the problem and once you
have that if you have the deformation
you actually have everything you can
start looking at the force generated
inside the material and you can look at
this point where you have a singularity
where the stress are very large because
you suspect that this is a point where
you have problem if you have a tissue if
you have too much compression or shear
this is where the cells are going to die
and what you see here are what we call
damage drops and you see they always
have t-shaped very nice regular shape
when you look closer and you can
actually find exactly the angle given by
that nice formula the arc tangent of a
nice root number which amount 211 and 32
degree where you have these two
directions of course you're going to say
well this is Utah model or relevant is
it for the real thing so we should do
the real thing for that you need a brain
if only I had a brain so so in order to
get a brain here is Alan Coon my
collaborator from Stanford which I've
done with whom I've done most of these
studies with and here is Mehmet by
putting Ellen in the MRI machine and you
scan it very very quick scan and you get
all these slice
and once you have to slice you can do
what's called a segmentation you can
tell and see what tissue is is at what
place in the slide and you can do that
for all the slides and then you have a
description of the tissue at all point
in these different slides and then you
reconstruct the full 3d model you put
all these slides together and this is
what you obtain so what you have is a
mesh and that mesh as 1.3 million
tetrahedral element that describe both
the skull but also the different type of
tissue and this is the 3d print from my
office this is actually the same brain
as this one that I show you and that's
the skull that goes with it so here you
see the white matter here you see the
cerebellum and now we have everything we
can let it swell with the skull right so
we put we put back the skull and now
what I want to do is I want to open it
here is the opening I do a decompressive
craniectomy this is glow-in-the-dark
but you can't really appreciate it so
you do decompressive craniectomy and you
let it swell and this is what you have
and once since you do the full
computation you not only have the
displacement of geometry but you have
all the forces that are developing that
very complex material and very complex
geometry you have the displacement the
shear force the strain and so on so you
can go back and now compare comparison
is not that grace not the best the best
cut here but you can compare the damage
drop that occurs here you find them
again with the same angle on the 2d
slide ok so the same phenomena that you
see on a very simple model is actually
very generic in all these problems and
if you had asked before to the
neurosurgeon where are the possible
damage that occurs during tease they
would say of course it occurs right at
the boundary that they know because
there is a lot of pressure but there is
no there was no understanding of where
it occurs inside the material that's
only one type of damage
and you can deal with that if the
opening is large enough however you have
another type of damage is that when you
open the brain you're actually going to
stretch the axon and we know from axonal
studies that stretch that even like less
than 20% in stretching the axons can
lead to permanent damage and when you
look at this map you realize that what
is more open you actually have extremely
large 50% damage but also very deep
inside the tissue so you do have damage
and the damage is very deep inside
inside the tissue which was also a bit
of a surprise so now what we have is
really computationally and a theoretical
framework on which you can test
hypotheses about different option and
also gain understanding about this
process we understand piece about
swelling we understand about Romine
craniotomy and about damage it's very
early on and we still have a lot to
learn of course and maybe we are the
madman treating the madmen just like in
this painting of Bosch so as I told you
Beethoven's brain was rather small
unfortunately and one of the reason for
it was so small is that probably a bit
oven like to drink a little bit too much
and actually died of cirrhosis infection
of the liver or due to excess alcohol
not helped by the fact that the cure at
the time was to drink more alcohol but
understanding is good for teas so the
problem is that if you have a normal man
here's a normal 43 year old compared to
alcoholic you see you do lose a lot of
brain mass so when somebody tells you
that alcohol preserves cells when they
drink it's not true you do lose a lot of
cells due to excess alcohol and here is
an extreme case you probably recognize
too many Duff Beer I think so in the
normal process we want to talk about
aging atrophy and apathy and dementia
eventually in the normal process we know
that we lose brain mass
we gain brain mass up to the age of very
quickly up to the age of four then
slowly up to the age of 20 and then we
start declining in brain mass so you can
all place yourself somewhere around here
and you know where you stand but that
process can be accelerated tremendously
due to some type of disease for instance
in Alzheimer disease it's well known
that you have very very strong atrophy
due to the propagation of some type of
toxic protein in the material so the way
it happens is that there are certain
type of molecule there are different
hypothesis which one are important and
so on of course a lot of complexity
certain type of molecule very small
molecule protein in inside the cell that
are toxic that are turn into toxic
proteins and when they initially seeded
they propagate through the brain and
propagate and when the propagation the
concentration reached a certain level
it's fully damage the brain and that
part of the tissue is removed so the
fusion process of transport process are
very interesting and one of the simplest
thing you can do at the mathematical
level is really try to extract
completely and make it the extremely
simple model and the idea is the
following
here is a structural map of Aksum so
this is taken from image analysis you
can find axon the axon bundle I told you
about it's beautiful object you see and
what you can extract from that is a
graph you can identify region of
interest and see are they connected to
other region this is what's called the
connectome which is in this case a
structural connectome that tells you or
part of the body are connected to each
other but this is nice because that's a
very neat mathematical object this is a
graph and a graph we can start labeling
nodes let's call that 1 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;amp; 3 &amp;amp; 4 and
out of these you go on like let's say a
hundred and out of that you can create
matrices that allows you to study teach
the subject and the matrix you can
create for instance let's take a very
simple one we
six nodes 1 2 3 4 5 6 I'm going to
create a matrix like and I'll tell you
how I created let's call that L and
matrix on the diagonal will be the
number of neighbor this one has two
neighbor five and two so I put two two
or three neighbors so I put three in and
so on very easy and I put minus 1 each
time I have a neighbor 2 1 for instance
the first row has name as I put a minus
1 here because 2 is a neighbor 5 is a
neighbor so minus 1 minus 1 and I create
a symmetric matrix okay we all we all
agree with the rule very simple this
matrix is very important in graph theory
and in all network problem because it is
called the graph laplacian and it is the
matrix that contains information or
about our process diffuses on a graph so
if you think let's heat number one I
want to know other heat is going to flow
in the graph from number one and
propagate to number six all that
information is contained in to that
matrix the graph laplacian and you can
extract it by taking things that i call
icon values that you have ever either
seen and you know what I'm talking about
or you've not yet seen and when you see
them you'll go aha remember it was
important for the brain so trust me on
that you can extract that knowledge and
when you extract that knowledge here is
the second eigenvector of the network
diffusion so the of the graph laplacian
for now I make a big one and the corner
represent the intensity of these eigen
vector this is a nice word from 2012 and
the surprising and remarkable thing is
that if you compare that to a trophy
pattern due to Aldama
you have extremely high correlation so
the second eigenvector of the graph
laplacian of the brain connectome is
somehow correlated to the a trophy
pattern of Alzheimer disease amazing
result but I wanted to know more I said
this is nice but I really again I want
to go back to the mekinese the really
doesn't tell me how things flow what is
the evolution process so first we have
to understand what happened in the
I told you about toxic protein what are
they well you have a lot of protein that
does normal cellular work inside the
brain and T's let's are in blue here and
sometimes they miss fall instead of the
normal configuration they take another
shape and some of these fall are toxic
think of them a little bit like a zombie
a cop apocalypse in a city right so you
have a normal guy that become for some
reason a zombie and that zombie whenever
it meets another normal guy transform
them into a toxic guy now you have two
zombies in the in the city and the
zombies they bunch together they quite
slow in the progression but they always
go on and and neurodegenerative disease
take a long time but it goes on and on
and we have very few ways to stop it so
it goes on they burn together and they
make aggregates and when they meet other
guys they transform them into zombies
into toxic proteins and when they become
large enough then the whole neighborhood
starts functioning and it's dead
essentially right they stop the normal
process from working and that's the end
of them so we can build a model out of
that and the model is to follow both
toxic and non toxic protein you follow
the concentration of the two both in
space and time within the brain and what
you do you write rate equation for both
aggregation and fragmentation process
here and you can borrow IDs from things
from other or the field of applied
mathematics which is processes take
place and then you realize that what
happens is that you have very fast
transport along the axon and that's why
the graph laplacian work but very slow
transport inside the tissue so you
zombies they go very quickly in the main
street but very slowly in the only way
if you want and when they reach a
certain concentration level the axon
dies because there's too much
concentration and is removed from the
material okay so you can write it's a
little too late to write big equation
now but you can write big system of
equation for that and you can look at
the consequence of that so here again
the map and
the kind of map that you find in in a
quite recent article about the
progression of neurodegenerative disease
this is the sum up of the knowledge for
maybe 20 30 years of how
neurodegenerative progress in the brain
now what you can do is you can see that
the same place here and you let the
process run and what you obtain is
almost identical process where you see
that part of the brain that are not
attack at all indeed free of the toxic
protein the same in the back in the
temporal lobe and so on so you can match
a lot of T's you just let the process
run and you can say well if this work
for this particular system or about the
other ones so you can go back and you
can look at different molecule different
seeding and different disease including
Parkinson disease and lateral sclerosis
what's remarkable about this I found is
that it's very systematic and people
have been able to follow that it always
more or less takes place in the same
characteristic way so there is something
generic in the transport process and I
think that the way we model it extract
that simplicity out of that system but
of course you say well that's quite not
enough right now if I know that can I do
more people always want more so what
about atrophy here is an Al's I'm a
patient at Year Zero when the first year
when the scan was was made here zero so
you extract out of that you segment and
you have you have the full tissue white
white and gray matter and you let you
see it here at the base in two
dimensions because it's easy and you let
the process run and this is year 1 and
year 2 in year 3 and you can actually
superimpose that almost identically so
the atrophy patterns that is processed
great by the evolution of this toxic
protein seems to be extremely consistent
certainly correlated with what is
observed doing atrophy showing you teeth
I've done something I'm not supposed to
do this is actually the work of the last
few weeks with my collaborator in
Stanford
you're not supposed to talk about things
that are not published yet but between
us and my 20,000 Facebook friends I
thought that it would remain in the room
so to speak
so I thought that was so interesting
it's so compelling that there is
something there to study so let me
conclude what did we learn from this bit
on atrophy and amnesia well the
interesting part that I found from a
modeling perspective is that these
phenomena are both multi scale and
multiphysics the include process that
takes place at very short time folding
of protein or shock in the brain
milliseconds all the ways to year and we
have to understand how we go from one to
the other one it also goes from the
protein level all the way to the head
level it also include different type of
physics different process transport but
also solid freed mechanics protein
understanding what happened to the
protein and all that so you have to
combine that and that's natural ground
for apply mathematics combining
different field different expertise and
looking at complicated equation and
trying to extract from it simplicity
against these tremendous complexity I
don't want to say that these disease are
easy to understand thirty years or more
fifty years of research have shown that
these extremely complex problems yet
despite that I think there are aspects
of it that mathematics can unravel that
should be simple of it and that can
improve our understanding and the last
part which is really where we're going
now is that once you understand all this
process and or dementia takes place at a
true when atrophy takes place you can
now go back and couple the physical
atrophy with the functional connectome
and try to understand how the network or
brain function start degrading based on
the underlying physics this will you
couple the structural part which is the
physics part to the functional part
which is all the brain process
information and no it loses its ability
to process information and this is where
we're going no so what we're really
trying just our robe
flirt a Kabbalist from Oxford from the
17th century we try to create a
microcosm trying inside the head you
have a microcosm old world we're trying
to do the same we trying to model things
and include different part we try to do
physics and geometry and in genetics and
an all different bubble all different
onion and every time you peel one you
come to other question and you try to
answer them and it's really mathematics
and the way we applied that give us a
chance to understand art is different
world within our heads are really
connected and here is we started feeling
a bubble and again I think applied
mathematics is all the way there so of
course I want to give the last word to a
friend Ludwig who said he had a good
sense of humor friends applaud the
committee's over thank you very much
I think we've got time for a couple of
questions unless you have complete
understanding already so yes so right
now what people says is that over the
years neuroscientists are established at
their points that's particular point in
the brain that are important for certain
process they call them ROI region of
interest alright and so they say ok
we're going to look at that and we're
going to average the connection in this
region and decide you can do that a
different level with different precision
I'm not sure that there is yet a good
way to do it systematically at the
structural level at the functional level
you also have to do that you have to
decide where you establish you you
entryway in the continuous model we
don't have that every point is equally
there right but we do have the external
connection because they're very
important in the transport that was the
two theory even though they're very
different when it's very coarse grain at
the level of graph and the other one is
a full process with an isotropic
diffusion seem to have similar result
that's what's also interesting another
question for me just one more thing is
one over here somewhere oh yeah go ahead
17.3% I don't know it's very hard to
tell I'm certainly not the expert on it
what I can say I'm trying to plead for
for this type of approach is I think
that there is a lot of work on trying to
understand population level and things
like that what happened but really what
is really crucial in order to make
progress and you see that in a lot of
different aspect of science is a full
understanding of what's going what are
the mechanism at each level because when
you understand the mechanism it gives
you a target for therapeutic target you
can say I understand his process it has
a certain time scale I can identify and
I can attack these properties process I
think what mathematics give you in that
regard is really identifying what are
the correct mechanism because the system
is so complex that if you just look at
experiments even for large population
and things like that you might not know
what are the important effects and what
are the underlying mechanism so it
allows you to sort it out somehow so I
think that this is where mathematics is
partically important in that approach
but yes I wish it would be so if you
want to consider that very much a race
against time and for for many other
cities right we were trying trying to
solve this problem before it's too late
before we losing our ability to solve
them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
