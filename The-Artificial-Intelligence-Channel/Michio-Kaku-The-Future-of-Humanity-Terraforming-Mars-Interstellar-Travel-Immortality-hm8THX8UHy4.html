of you on this network in 1979 if you
look at the recent government reports
concerning the Three Mile Island the
government now concedes that one to ten
people will eventually die of cancer in
the Three Mile Island area do you
remember that time many many years
almost forty years ago and what have you
changed in your thinking since then
well yes I read that very vividly
because you see I'm a theoretical
physicist and I work with the theories
of Einstein in the quantum theory and so
to me before a television camera is a
new experience but when the Three Mile
Island accident happened all the media
was saying we need a scientist
we need a scientists who can help to
decipher this mess to the American
people so they contacted me and so I
said to myself well this is what I do
for a living I'm a physicist and so I
said to myself okay I'll get on national
television get on national radio because
the situation demands it not because I
wanted to do it but because people had
to know the dangers the positive the
negatives of energy one of the big
questions of the age and that's sort of
how I backed into becoming a media
person you say in your book that there
was a teacher when you were in the
second grade that had an impact on you
remember I'll never forget she walked in
the room one day and said God so loved
the earth that he put the earth just
right from the Sun not too close because
the oceans will boil not too far because
the oceans will freeze but just right
from the Sun now I was floored I mean I
was in second grade and he was a
scientific principle with religious
interpretation I said to myself my god
that's right if we were to close the
oceans are boiled
if we were too far the oceans are freeze
we are in the so called Goldilocks zone
of the Sun now of course we have seen
four thousand planets orbiting other
stars and almost all of them are too
close or too far from the Sun so you
have two points of view either God
exists
and God so loves the earth that he puts
here just right from the Sun or we have
a crapshoot
what do you think well now that we have
found so many planets four thousand of
them we think that in that galaxy our
own backyard
there are billions upon billions of
planets on average every single star you
see at night has a planet going around
it every single star on average that
it's indisputable that most of them are
outside the Goldilocks zone so you can
still believe in God but that's not an
argument that clinches the deal so I
want to ask you about a bunch of obvious
things that you write about and get you
to define it for a generalist what is a
planet well a planet is a mud ball that
goes around the star and I say mud ball
because it doesn't release light of its
own it's dark and it orbits around the
Sun gaining energy and we think that
planets are very interesting because
they could have life because that's how
we got started and even in our solar
system we think that the planets may in
fact Harbor some form of life maybe
microbial life and so we look at planets
we look at stars to find out where the
planets are but we focus on the planets
because that perhaps is the habitat for
life in the universe
what's a star well a star is a gigantic
solar furnace it's a ball of hydrogen
gas that releases energy by converting
hydrogen into sunlight and so a star is
in some sense a gigantic hydrogen bomb
it obeys the same equations of Einstein
e equals MC squared where M is hydrogen
e is sunlight that comes out of the star
what is a comet well a comet is a piece
of ice it's like a dirty ice ball that
whizzes around in the solar system
they're only like 10 20 miles across
there they're not very big but they're
basically made out of ice remnants of
the original solar system which we think
once upon a time surrounded the the Sun
but now orbit in a disc what's the
difference between a meteor and a me
right well that flash of light that you
see whizzing across the sky is caused by
a rock that burns up in the atmosphere
and that's called a meteor either the
rock itself or the streak of light
however once it hits the ground it
becomes a mineral so we call it a
meteorite so a meteorite is a meteor
which has fallen from the sky
what's a galaxy a galaxy consists of
hundreds of billions of stars left over
from the creation of the universe the
Big Bang
they look like a gigantic disc a huge
simmering disk of stars our galaxy for
example is the Milky Way galaxy and the
nearest galaxy to us is the Andromeda
galaxy and we think there are about a
hundred billion galaxies in the visible
universe so believe it or not that means
we can actually count the number of
stars in the visible universe
100 billion galaxies a hundred billion
stars per galaxy and so that's the
number of stars in the visible universe
a hundred billion times a hundred
billion
what's an asteroid an asteroid is a
leftover from the creation of the solar
system we're talking about debris that
extends from the earth extends from Mars
out to Jupiter and we think it's a
failed planet a planet between Mars and
Jupiter that never quite condensed or
maybe got too close to Jupiter and got
broken up so if you had to pick another
place to live outside of the earth where
would you go I would go to another
planet now we've looked at all the
planets so far none of them are exactly
earth-like Venus we once thought was
tropical many science fiction stories
have astronauts sunbathing on the
beaches of Venus we don't know that
Venus is our evil twin just like the
earth closer to the Sun but temperatures
are 900 degrees Fahrenheit that's above
the melting point of lead and tin if you
were to walk on the surface of Venus
your feet would sink sink into molten
metals so you don't want to go to Venus
Mars are the closest it's a rocky planet
it's a frozen desert but it's the
closest planet we have to the earth but
further out
the moons of Saturn and Jupiter look
very interesting one of the moons of
Jupiter is Europa it has a liquid ocean
underneath the ice cover who would have
thought that you could have a liquid
ocean whose volume is larger than the
oceans of the earth going around that
distant planet called Jupiter NASA at
some point wise will put a submarine a
submarine under the ice to look for
life-forms under the ice cover we talked
about your second grade teacher do you
remember obviously must when you first
got interested in science I remember
that very distinctly I was 8 years old
everyone was talking about the fact that
a great scientist had just died and I'll
never forget they flashed a picture of
his desk on the newspapers and the
caption said something like this this is
the unfinished manuscript from the
greatest scientist of our time so I was
8 years old
I said to myself why couldn't he finish
it what's so hard that the greatest
scientists couldn't finish it it was a
homework assignment right why didn't he
ask his mother what could be so hard
that you cannot answer it I went to the
library and I found out his name was
Albert Einstein that book was the
unified field theory the theory that
would allow us to quote read the mind of
God so I said to myself whoa that's for
me I want to be part of this grand grand
expedition to finish that book now today
I can read that book I can actually see
all the dead ends that Einstein pursued
and we actually think we have it it's
called string theory I'm one of the one
of the founders of the subject
co-founder of string field theory and we
think we can actually complete that book
that Einstein set into motion the theory
of everything
there's even a Oscar movie Oscar winning
movie called the theory of everything go
back your childhood where were you born
and what were your parents doing at the
time well my grandparents came to this
country about a hundred years ago
from Japan
and my grandfather was actually part of
the cleanup operation in San Francisco
after the San Francisco earthquake so my
family has a long history in California
but in 1942 because they were
japanese-americans they were locked up
in at to delay a relocation camp for
four years behind machine gun and barbed
wire by the way in 1946 they finally got
out but they were penniless and we
settled in Palo Alto which is now ground
zero for Silicon Valley but back then it
was all apple orchards and alfalfa
fields and that's where I grew up
basically in a farm like environment in
what is now called Silicon Valley what
did your parents do after they got out
of the camp there was nothing for them
to do except menial jobs their money was
confiscated they were broke however
there was a certain cachet to being a
Japanese gardener so my father became a
rather successful gardener and he wanted
me to take over the business
I tried gardening for a while and after
that I said no way
I kind of find another way to to make a
living so when I was in high school I
decided I got to do something so I went
to my mom and I said mom can I have
permission to build an atom smasher in
the garage a two point three million
electron volt electron betatron particle
accelerator and my mom kind of stared at
me and said sure why not and don't
forget to take out the garbage so I took
out the garbage I got 400 pounds of
transformer steel 22 miles of copper
wire and I built the betadron atom
smasher my mom's garage I blew out every
single circuit breaker in the house
every time I turned it on my poor mother
must have said to herself why couldn't I
have a son who plays basketball
maybe if I buy him a baseball and for
God's sake why can't you find a nice
Japanese girlfriend why does he have to
build these machines in the garage but
that was a turning point because of the
science fair projects that I did in high
school I earned the attention of an
atomic scientist Edward Teller Ned
teller pretty much took me under his
wing arranged for me to get a
scholarship to Harvard he knew exactly
what I was doing I didn't have to
explain to him what antimatter was what
an accelerator was what a beta Tron was
he knew immediately and so he arranged
for me to get a scholarship and that
started my my life as a physicist how
did you meet him
well he came to Albuquerque New Mexico
for the National Science Fair people
don't know that but he was in the habit
of recruiting young scientists he went
to the National Science Fair where I met
him I was actually on television with
him in 1963 in Albuquerque at the
National Science Fair now when I
graduated from Harvard he interviewed me
for a graduate fellowship but at that
point he was very clear he said look I'm
looking for people who want to design
warheads hydrogen warheads your physics
would be very valuable
designing newer and better hydrogen
warheads he offered me a scholarship
he said Los Alamos Livermore MIT you
name it we couldn't we can arrange for
you to work there but you know my
interest then began to veer off in the
direction of when I was a child
wondering what was Einstein's unfinished
theory you see I wanted to work on an
explosion bigger than a hydrogen bomb I
wanted to work on the Big Bang the
creation of the universe itself and for
me a hydrogen bomb was just a footnote I
wanted to work on the creation of the
universe here's Edward Teller this video
goes back to 1974 one of the decisive
events was Condor which convinced me to
work on nuclear weapons was a speech by
President Roosevelt the day after Hitler
invaded the lowlands where he said it is
the duty of the scientists to contribute
the weapons which are needed for the
defense of freedom do you agree well
that's a point that he stressed to me
reckless he said look I'm recruiting I'm
recruiting for what the New York Times
later called the Star Wars scholarship
this scholarship propelled the brightest
young minds in America from high school
and college in the los alamos to create
the Star Wars program now we know he had
a checkered history many of the early
designs did not work in fact for this
Star Wars program but that was the
vision he had he already had a very
clear mission that science should be
used in the interest of national
security
you see those times were different from
today we had the Sputnik moment in 1957
when Sputnik went up it was practically
your patriotic duty to use science in
the interest of America because the
Russians will one day orbit hydrogen
bombs not just Sputnik but hydrogen
bombs will orbit the Earth and the
homeland will be endangered so that's
why a whole generation of young kids
became scientists and engineers and
technicians because it was the so-called
Sputnik moment so when you were growing
up when did you discover that you had
the brain to understand this stuff well
when I was a kid I read about Einstein
and my favorite quote from Einstein was
if a theory cannot be explained to a
child then the theory is probably
worthless meaning that every great
theory has a picture behind it that
children can understand Newton talked
about you know things moving in space
friction the motion of bodies Einstein
talked about clocks and meter sticks and
rocket ships things that children can
understand and yeah there are books
trying to explain space time to children
and I said to myself Wow
if the great ideas are all based on
pictures and you understand those
pictures then mathematics is bookkeeping
it's complicated bookkeeping you have to
learn how to do the bookkeeping of
course but it's bookkeeping it's the
physical principle the concept that
makes everything move now when I sign
was 16 when he was 16 he found that
principle when
sixteen years old he asked himself a
question can you outrace a light beam
now we would say well that's a stupid
question
I mean outrace a light B what are you
talking about it took him ten years from
the age of 16 to 26 and he finally found
the answer and he changed world history
he found out that you cannot outrace a
light beam that's a children's question
and I said to myself I can understand
these children's questions I just have
to of course at some point learn the
mathematics but it's the principle
that's involved and today we know of
course the speed of light is the
ultimate velocity in the universe
Einstein is a cop on the block
and he figured that out starting at the
age of 16 so all great theories have a
physical principle behind it that
children can visualize yeah but go back
to them as you went through that process
what were the milestones where you began
to gather the knowledge and you had
people that said if you want to do this
you got to go here who else had an
impact on you well to be very frank a
lot of people tried to give me advice
when I was in high school but I knew
that most of the advice was wrong
you see I tell kids today that you have
to have a role model because the wheels
been invented already why do you have to
reinvent the wheel if you want to become
a sports figure or a movie star the
wheels been invented find somebody you
admire look at their life history follow
the path so I said to myself I want to
become a physicist a theoretical
physicist I read about Einsteins life so
I knew exactly what I had to do and what
age in my life when do I have to get a
PhD when do I have to become a professor
when do I have to start to work on some
big physical concept it was no mystery
to me and so many young kids come up to
me because they get bum advice from
their high school teacher who simply
wants them to go to trade school or
learn something that that is a little
bit better than pumping gas so I say to
myself
tell the kids find a role model the
wheels been invented already so was
teller your role model I know it was
Einstein because teller made a very big
pitch for me to design what
and for me at that point in my life I
realized that its engineering the basic
physics of hydrogen warheads is well
known well-established as you know China
and and developing nations got the
hydrogen bomb practically in the first
try and so it was an engineering problem
I'm a physicist I wanted to look at the
physical concept of new undiscovered
things like why did the Big Bang take
place what was the energy source of the
Big Bang why did it bang to begin with
these are questions of cosmic importance
that are far beyond the engineering of
is simply assembling a hydrogen warhead
but again why were you able to figure it
out and most people are drowning all
this language and everything when they
would be back in high school well I
think unfortunately we have a high
school system that stresses memorization
stretches drudgery and does not
encourage the bright students to come up
for example in Asia they have the
expression the nail that sticks out gets
hammered down so if you're the oddball
if you're Steve Jobs if you're Bill
Gates you get hammered down but in
America we have the expression the
squeaky wheel gets the grease now I was
the squeaky wheel I wanted to get the
attention of my teachers in high school
that's why I built the atom smasher as I
found out most of my teachers couldn't
help me but I wanted to do it because I
said to myself this is something that is
doable I just have to get the basic
equipment the basic physics I understood
and so it was not such a big deal for me
to build an atom smasher what did you do
with it well I turned it on but the goal
was to create antimatter
that was the whole thrust of the science
fair project I photographed antimatter
antimatter comes naturally from a
radioactive source called sodium 22 put
that in a cloud chamber put it in a
magnetic field of 600 Gauss and the
beautiful tracks of antielectrons bent
in the wrong direction electrons bent
this way
antimatter bends the opposite way in a
magnetic field and I took beautiful
pictures cloud chamber pictures pictures
that our research quality in fact they
tell me and I went grand prize at the
National Science Fair and so I'll never
regret doing a science fair experiment
because that took me from a gardeners
kid to getting a scholarship to Harvard
and then beginning to work on the
unified field theory that's how it
started what are the rest that kids
think of you well they thought it was
nuts of course the teachers that I had
to work with I simply told them that I
had to cut transformer steel I have to
glue copper wire and they helped me but
they didn't know what was what I was
doing I mean they just knew that here's
this young kid who needs to cut four
hundred pounds of transformer steel why
in 22 miles of copper wire and I did it
on the high school football field how
big was this atom smasher that you had
well it was about this big consumed six
kilowatts of power the capacitor bank
was huge because they had to store their
six kilowatts of power and it gave us
his tremendous crackling sound when I
turned it on the magnetic field was so
powerful that in principle it would pull
the fillings out of your teeth if you
got too close to it yet to be careful if
there was a hammer or anything like that
in principle if I ran it on DC it would
literally grab a hammer from across the
room and fling it toward you that
happens that MRI machines today because
they to have a magnetic field of about
ten thousand cows now today we have a
big one a real big one outside Geneva
Switzerland
that's huge that's a Large Hadron
Collider that is basically my little
machine scaled up to the size of a city
and that is the leading scientific
instrument in the world today outside
Geneva
why didn't we build it well we had
designs for the super collider
to be built outside Dallas Texas in the
1990s but then of the last day of
hearings costs were rising and Congress
wanted to know should they keep on
budgeting the the super collider and
they cancelled it they gave us a billion
dollars to dig the hole a second billion
dollars to fill up the hole that's two
billion dollars to dig a hole and fill
it up
that's the wisdom of the United States
Congress two billion dollars to dig and
feel a whole fella hole now why do they
cancel it in the last day of hearings
when congressman ask a physicist quote
will we find God with your machine if so
I will vote for it so that physicist was
paralyzed he was a question are we gonna
find God with your machine so he said
something like well we'll find the Higgs
boson well if you could hear all the
jaws hit the floor of the United States
Congress ten billion dollars for another
god Thorne's subatomic particle the vote
was taken and the next day it was
cancelled since then we physicists have
bat our heads against the wall wondering
how should we have answered that
question will we find God with this
machine what would you say I would have
said this I would have said God about
whatever signs or symbols you ascribe to
the deity this machine the super
collider will take us as close as
humanly possible to his greatest
creation Genesis this is a Genesis
machine it will recreate on a
microscopic scale the most glorious
event in the history of the universe its
birth did that turn out to be the same
thing that happens what's the one that's
right that very same machine is now in
Switzerland and it found the Higgs boson
and we hope to find what it's called
dark matter which is the next form of
matter beyond ordinary matter but our
machine was cancelled because we didn't
know how to talk the language of the
average taxpayer that was a real lesson
we have to understand where the tax
payer is because in the old days we
would go to Congress and say one word
Russia Congress would then whip out
their checkbook and say how much how
much for the next atom smasher those
days are gone you can't do that anymore
I want to show some video of you in 1997
saying some strong things about NASA I'm
here to try to save the space program
from NASA bureaucrats NASA bureaucrats
are trying to fabricate new laws of
physics that I've never seen before in
any of my textbooks in any of the books
that I have published or PhD students in
fact if any of these engineers were to
submit that report to me for a course I
would flunk them why did you feel so
strongly I believe in the space program
but I think we have to do it safely
because why will the taxpayers turn
against the space program when we lost
the Space Shuttle we came within a
hair's breadth of losing the space
program the American people were saying
enough is enough seven beautiful
astronauts perishing because some
bureaucrat authorized the launching of
that missile and NASA wanted to launch
the Cassini mission a great mission by
the way which gave us gorgeous amounts
of information about Saturn with 72
pounds of plutonium and this split the
scientific community because on one hand
we wanted Cassini to orbit Saturn give
us those great photographs but the other
hand if that rocket were to blow up
NASA's own computer program estimated
that some of the plutonium could go to
Disney World now think about that for a
moment if you were a taxpayer and you
realize that this rocket to Saturn all
of a sudden cause the evacuation of
Disney World and you had to cancel your
vacations and cross Orlando Florida off
the tourist map you get really angry
right and so I said to myself it's not
worth it chances are it'll be a success
chances are we'll go to Saturn and get
glorious photographs which is what
happened actually but I said to myself
it's a gamble do we want to take that
gamble and perhaps lose the space
program I love the space program so much
that you have to save it from the NASA
bureaucrats and their attitude was
launched the sucker you say in your book
that 544 humans have been in space and
that 18 of those have died what do those
numbers mean to you it means that one
percent of the time it's Russian
Roulette one percent of the time you
don't come back one percent of the time
people ask me what I want to go into
space knowing that 1% of the time I'm
not going to come back you see these
people are test pilots they are
experienced astronauts they go through
the training they taken courses they
know the odds it's 1% we're 60 years
into the Space Age and we have not got
that number down below 1% misfire in
fact to Mars it's even worse 30% 30% of
our space probes never reach it to Mars
and so well as Elon Musk said himself he
would love to be the first person on
Mars but he doesn't want to be there on
impact so I agree with that we forget
space is not a Sunday picnic 1% of the
time our rockets blow up back in 2010
you were here on our program called
ndepth which is a three-hour program
it's available I reason I mentioned it's
available to our audience to go back and
and listen to three hours of you going
into some detail on some of the things
we're talking about and it would be
account I'm not a counter but it would
it would add information to people if
they want to if they want to find out
more of what you're there you're
thinking Arthur's Seat Clark this is
from 1964 and I want you to put him in
the context a little bit of video what
about the city of The Day After Tomorrow
say the year 2000 it will be possible in
that age perhaps only 50 years from now
for a man to conduct his business from
to Haiti or Bali just as well as he
could from London I am perfectly serious
when I suggest that one day we may have
brain surgeons in Edinburgh operating on
patients in New Zealand how's he doing
on his predictions well he's right on
the money now we have internet we have
telemedicine doctors in one place can do
surgery using robots in fact even beyond
what he said handle robots instruct the
robots on the other side of the planet
earth we have robots at Duke University
that communicate with robots in Kyoto
for example and different operations
that you can do in Duke University we
can also do in Kyoto University so
anything I think he underestimated the
the power of the Internet and he
mentioned you know being able to
communicate anywhere in the planet Earth
guess what Elon Musk just last week
unveiled a plan to create a planetary
internet thousands of mini satellites
thousands of mini satellites so that
you're on the top of Mount Everest and
there you are downloading the
Kardashians and so today you have to
have a microwave tower next to mine ever
is to do that but if satellites
thousands of mini satellites orbit the
earth then yeah exactly what arthur c
clarke said could become a reality
what is it theoretical physicists do and
he has free time well for Einstein it
was like playing the violin it was a
time for him to think back at his work
and to to rethink his strategy he also
likes sailing okay now for me well I'm a
professor and I realized that I like to
teach but I can board twenty kids
teaching a course but if I'm a radio or
television I could bore twenty million
kids so I say to myself wow that's an
opportunity to touch the minds of young
people because whenever I interview a
Nobel Prize winning scientist I asked
them when was it that that spark of
science began to germinate and they
always say when I was ten ten is that
magic year you have that epiphany you
went to the planetarium you saw your
first telescope you saw the moon for the
first time in the rings of Saturn you
saw a microbe in a microscope that
epiphany stays with you for the rest of
your life so when you're an elderly
scientists and you're tired and you have
all these obligations it's like a well
you draw water from that well
continually over the decades because you
remember you remember that epiphany you
had when you were 10 years old and that
keeps you going do you play the violin I
know personally I like to do figure
skating
how long have you done that well for the
last 15 years
one was a kid I always liked to watch
figure skating on TV but to do something
like that that's why they're complicated
but I realized as an adult that is
nothing but no Tony in physics and if
you aren't a physicist you understand
center of gravity moment of inertia you
understand the basics of figure skating
so I said to myself I can learn that and
so yeah if you see me spinning and
jumping at Rockefeller Center you know
that it's me on the ice so if I were 19
years old and I wanted to see you in a
classroom for that Mariga see now my age
but if I wanted to starting out and I
was interested where would I find you
and what would why would I be in your
classroom and how large would that
classroom be today well normally I teach
two graduate students and at that level
we're talking about a ph.d program you
are we talking about maybe five ten
students because these people are raring
to go and they're doing PhD level work
but the university the City University
of New York has so many young people at
the freshman level unwashed raw students
at the freshman level that they said
look you got to teach freshmen so I
decided to teach astronomy and I was
shocked I looked at the astronomy final
and it was memorized all the moons of
Saturn and memorize all the moons of
Jupiter that was the final exam and I
said to myself I don't even know the
moons of Saturn I don't even know the
moons of Jupiter this is a worthless
exam you simply look it up in a book I
wanted to know planetary evolution where
stars come from how they die how they
mature so I threw out the curriculum and
it decided to import NASA video tapes
about going to the planets and begin to
talk about planetary evolution planets
obey certain basic laws they're born
they mature and they die you can teach
these concepts because as Einstein said
you can teach principles to children
especially pictorial principles and so
that's why I decided to take this small
little astronomy course and make it
modern now we're up to like five hundred
kids the course is bursting at the seams
because people have a thirst if
presented well people will gravitate
toward it you know when I first did
television people said that quote
science doesn't sell on TV but I said to
myself well that can't be right because
a million people subscribed to
Scientific American another million
people described to Discover Magazine
and when there's a science special well
you can actually get 5 million people to
tune into that so there's an untapped
audience there and then when cable took
off we found it
yes there really are 5 to 10 million
people out there that will tune in to a
science program if and only if is
presented well with special effects with
a very cogent storytelling people will
gravitate toward it because we're born
scientists we're born wondering why the
Sun shines how often have you been
involved in a television special well I
work with BBC Discovery Channel the
Science Channel hosting specials for
them sometimes and of course Talking
Heads I regularly do Talking Heads for
different science specials you do radio
and where can people find your radio
shows and how often well I'm on every
week they can go to my website em kakou
org or Facebook we're up to 3 million 3
million fans on facebook on Twitter
we're up to 600,000 on Twitter and they
can find my radio schedule radio program
airs in about 60 cities across the
United States and you know it's
commercial radio I mean think about it
for a moment commercial rate we're not
talking public radio we're talking
commercial radio and the program is a
big success so it means that if
presented well people have a thirst a
real thirst to understand what's
happening in the world but it's never
presented well it's always presented as
memorization as they're learning stupid
facts and figures you're gonna forget
the next day you talk about Ray Kurzweil
in your book here is some video of him
talking about life expectancy and I want
your input on this people say you take
all these supplements and other pills
that's gonna enable you to live hundreds
of years and the answer is no that's
just to get to bridge to and bridge
- it's not far away according to my
models 10 to 15 years from now we'll be
adding more than a year every year to
your remaining life expectancy put Ray
Kurzweil's in the context and he has a
plan for himself I think any pills you
take a day I think he takes up several
hundred I talked to him once it's a
considerable number he also talks about
two kinds of immortality one is digital
immortality which is coming very fast by
the way Silicon Valley companies are
already offering a version of that now
and then there's biological immortality
now digital immortality takes everything
known about you on the internet your
digital footprint your credit card
records what movies you see what wines
you like to buy what countries you visit
your videos your pictures your audio
tapes and creates a profile that's
digitized which will last forever so
when you go to the library of the future
you will not take out a book about
Winston Churchill you'll talk to Winston
Churchill you'll talk to a hologram and
that hologram will have all the
mannerisms all the knowledge anecdotes
story everything known about Winston
Churchill and you'll talk to him
I wouldn't mind talking to Einstein I
would love to have an opportunity to
talk to an Einstein based on everything
that is known about the man we could be
digitized there's a Silicon Valley
company already offering to do this and
our great-great great-great-great-great
granddaughter may want to find out who
was their great-great great-great-great
grandfather because we've all been
digitized now - to paraphrase Bill
Clinton is this really you well it all
depends on how you define you if we
define you as a biological entity then
this is a tape recorder very
sophisticated but if you are the sum
total of all your memories emotions
feelings if that is you then yeah in
some sense you could live forever
because you've been digitized what is I
want your definition please for
artificial intelligence artificial
intelligence a machine that can do
anything that a human can do and let's
be blunt about this right now
if you compare artificial intelligence
to animals our most advanced robot ASIMO
has the abilities of a cockroach a
retarded lobotomize slow cockroach our
robots today can barely walk across the
room they can barely sweep the floor or
or turn eval but I foresee a time in the
future when they'll be as smart as a
mouse being able to run around find
mates really quick and smart as a rat a
rabbit eventually as smart as a cat or a
dog but by the time they reach the level
of a monkey they could become dangerous
that's at the end of the century I think
because monkeys have a self-awareness
they know they are not human they know
they're monkeys now dogs are confused
you see dogs think that we are the top
dog and they're the underdog and they're
part we're part of the same dog tribe
the dog pack so dogs are confused about
who they are but monkeys they know
they're not human once robots become as
smart as monkeys then I think we should
put a chip in their brain to shut them
off if they have murderous thoughts but
that's not for many decades to come your
own life did you have brothers and
sisters yes mm-hmm
how many I had one older brother and one
younger brother and what did they end up
doing well they're retired my younger
brother is a cardiologist and he's still
in private practice and yeah so we all
went to college and we all did what our
parents dreamed of and they wanted us to
be successful what did your mother do we
talked about your father
what did she do it well they passed away
my father was a gardener and my mother
was a maid because you know we were
always strapped for money I still
remember my parents arguing about money
and where should the money go because
you know we were flat broke during that
period of time and I still remember my
mother talking about college that
college is the key to everything and I
had this vision that college was this
city in the sky I still have that vision
that there's this there's a city in the
sky called college because that's the
way my mother
and so now we realized that she was on
to something and that is yes college is
a gateway a gateway to success in in
modern society how much of all of your
education and where did you get it all
was paid for in scholarships - god
that's right I got accepted to Harvard
and Harvard and also the Hearst
engineering scholarship that Edward
Teller founded so I was the beneficiary
of that and then in my ph.d program
there was money from the National
Science Foundation so luckily even
though struggling artists have a hard
time scraping together the next the next
meal in Sciences there is funding the
Natural Science Foundation the
Department of Energy will fund
enterprising young PhD students and so
that I think is is a good thing you know
there's a brain drain into the United
States because there is funding both
private entrepreneurs Silicon Valley
billionaires will sponsor startups and
there is a National Science Foundation
and the Department of Energy for more
speculative and cutting-edge kinds of
research so there is a brain drain into
the United States at the present time
go back to your ten year old example by
the way do you have children yes I mean
I - and what kind of work are they in
the older daughter is a brain doctor
she's a neurologist and she's actually a
professor now professor at Boston
University and in the other the other
one followed a different road she is a
French pastry cook she went to an
exclusive School where they trained in a
credit French pastry cooks and she's
done very well in Manhattan your mother
said she wanted you to find a nice
Japanese woman is that who you found
well your wife my second wife is
Japanese and so she my mother honey got
her dream however I should point out
that my mother eventually came down with
Alzheimer's and says very unfortunate
that she could not even recognize me
toward the very end she could not even
recognize herself and so I thought that
life in some sense is so unfair you
struggle so hard
you're young and you're always poor
always wondering where the next check is
gonna come from and then you lose your
memories you lose your sense of who you
are who your children are you know
sometimes life can be very unfair well
what are you thinking at this age I get
it that you're 71 yeah mm-hmm I mean
what are you thinking about how long are
you gonna teach and what happens to the
brain you must know a lot about that the
brain as you get older well I realized
that the body does of course decay but
the brain decays much slower you could
be sharp as a whistle even in your old
age Einstein was publishing very
important papers even to the the last
days of his life now when you get older
you say to yourself do I want to write
lots of papers that will get published
but are worthless that you know they're
nothing but dotting the the i's and
crossing the t's I'd rather work on big
problems now of course it's a danger
that nothing is gonna come out of these
big problems but I would rather work on
a big problem and fail then work on a
lot of little problems and and succeed
from a standpoint of financial
accomplishments what categories have
been the most lucrative for you
in other words teaching documentaries
radios programs speaking books well when
I first started to write books people
told me you're never going to get her
rich writing a book because of the fact
there is this cutthroat competition out
there and as Bill Clinton knows you can
make more money doing speaking at events
and keynoting conferences and stuff like
that and that's something that I enjoy
is something that I enjoy because you
get to engage people and talk about
things that are on their mind things
that are troubling them and so I get
invited to keynote conferences for
example is that's the best economically
they are speaking probably and if you
take a look at Bill Clinton and George W
Bush and people there on the circuit in
fact I bump into them regularly I've
been on several programs speaking with
Bill Clinton and how often do you teach
your class with 500 kids in it well the
university said
look whenever I teach I mean whenever I
have to go out and Keynote a conference
or something I disrupt the University I
have to find a substitute teacher I have
to make sure that the grad students can
can grade the papers and stuff like that
rather disruptive and so they made a
deal with me they said look if you if we
cut you cut your slack so that you have
more time for for speaking and stuff you
can spread the good name of the
university the university benefits you
benefit because you don't have to run
back to the college every time there's a
speaking engagement and that was a
win-win situation so they reduced my
teaching load now which is I think the
ideal situation how big is your
university it's one of the biggest on
the planet earth the City University of
New York has a quarter of a million
students it is huge
the State University of New York of
course services the entire state the
City University of New York services
well eight million people all together
that's the population of New York
Brooklyn alone would be the third
largest city in the United States if you
were to cut up New York City so CUNY the
City University of New York is gigantic
it is absolutely humongous here's some
you read a lot about this in your book
you talk about going to Mars and but
here's a motion picture
Star Trek 1979 it's not very long I just
want to show it and have you put the
movies that we see in this country again
in context with learning science have
you seen all these movies oh I love them
I'm a science fiction junkie so I
watched all the Star Trek films and all
the Star Trek stuff when I was a kid I
just really loved a gorged on this stuff
today however I do a lot of cringing
because I realize oh they got that law
of physics wrong oh they got that wrong
so a lot of times I have to suspend what
I know about physics and just let my
imagination roam and that's the way to
enjoy these films so I love these films
1951 The Day the Earth Stood Still let's
watch this one did you see this movie
yes that movie was very important
because up to then the paradigm was war
the
world's the bad guys versus the good
guys were the underdog were the good
guys
that flipped it totally 180 degrees the
other way all of a sudden we became the
enemy we were the enemy of ourselves we
are were our worst enemy and so that
movie was was incredibly important as it
shifted the entire focus away from
Martians invading the earth to looking
inward to looking at our own problem
that if we explore artist space if we
mess up the earth we don't want to mess
up Mars we have to get our own act
together and so I thought that motion
picture was pivotal because it shifted
the center of gravity of science fiction
what's specific and this is book number
9 for you I think 14 I think yeah they
listed 8 in their home front part of the
other ones are PhD level textbooks but
this one's called the future of humanity
and what was your goal in this book
versus the others well the other words I
talk about the future like a hundred two
hundred three hundred years in the
future but what's the pot of gold out
there what's the ultimate destiny of all
these things and so I said to myself
well you know as Carl Sagan once told me
we should become a two-planet species we
should become we should join other
civilizations in some kind of galactic
galactic civilization if it exists and
so as people pointed out to me the
dinosaurs did not have a space program
and the destiny of the dinosaurs was to
go extinct that was their destiny our
destiny is unwritten but 99% of all life
forms their destiny is extinction the
norm for mother nature is extinction if
you don't dig right under our feet right
now you will see the bones of the 99.9%
that no longer walk the surface of the
earth now we're different we have
self-awareness we can see the future we
plot we scheme we plan and so perhaps
we're going to evade this conundrum and
maybe survive but we need an insurance
policy that's why this book is different
from the other books because you're the
books talk about the steps but what is
the goal what's the pot of gold up
and I'm saying is that one pot of gold
would be to have an insurance policy a
plan B in case a supervolcano an
asteroid and other Ice Age wipes out
humanity on the earth or severely dense
our history so 20 this is 20 years from
now you'll be 91 you'll still be
teaching and speaking and you look back
at what we've done in these 20 years
what will it be and what will have been
responsible for it well in some sense my
goal in life that is what I want to do
is we physicists like to rank
civilizations by energy type 1 type 2
type 3 a type 1 is planetary they
control the weather type 2 is stellar
they control stars and play with stars
like Star Trek Star Trek would be a type
two civilization then this type 3
galactic they play with black holes they
roam the Galactic space lanes like star
wars now what are we on this scale we
are type 0 we get our energy from dead
plants but we can see that in a hundred
years we will be type one but it's not
guaranteed because we still have all the
savagery of our rise from the swamp just
a few hundred years ago we have the same
sectarianism fundamentalism nationalism
all the backwardness of our rise from
the swamp but I see that by 2100 we will
become a planetary civilization and so I
want to help speed up that process to
make sure that we don't let the savagery
of our rights from the swamp overwhelm
our destiny which is to become type 1
for example what language will this type
one civilization speak already on the
Internet English and Mandarin Chinese
are the two dominant languages and the
Internet itself is the first type one
technology that fell into our lap as as
we're still type zero so we see the
beginning of a type one planetary
civilization but we may not make it
Elon Musk just said that last month why
don't the aliens visit us there should
be a lot of type one civilizations out
there they don't visit us perhaps
because they didn't make the transition
to type one you have any
idea why over the years and it's been
that case since I was even aware of it
that we refer to aliens as little green
men that are going to land here someday
why is it why are they little green men
well I think it's part of our
subconscious because Hollywood gives us
these images as children and as
grown-ups we we access these ancient
memories of bug-eyed monsters for
example by the way I have some advice
for people that claim to have met these
aliens many people email me and say
they've been abducted by aliens from
outer space so they know they're out
there my attitude is the next time
you're abducted by an alien steal
something I don't care what this an
alien paperweight an alien ship an alien
pen steal something because there is no
law against stealing from an
extraterrestrial there's no longer books
that says you can't steal from an
extraterrestrial gasps has there been
extraterrestrials land on this planet
you can't rule it out I don't think so
but if you ask for hard evidence there's
no hard evidence either way and so there
is that possibility that in the past we
might have been visited they can't be
ruled out last video you were alive you
were young you were eight to ten years
old
this is 1957 October the 4th somebody
named Major John Glenn on a program
called name that tune what do you think
of the Russian satellite which is
circling the Earth at 18,000 miles per
hour well to say the least George
they're out of this world this is really
quite an advancement for not only the
Russians but for international science I
think we'd all agree on that it's the
first time anybody has ever been able to
get anything out that far in space and
keep it there for any length of time and
this is probably the first step toward
space travel or moon travel something
we'll probably run into maybe in Eddie's
lifetime here at least 50 Eddie would
you like to take a trip to the moon no
sir I like it fine right here
Major John Glenn was a test pilot then
and he had not gone to space how in your
opinion how we've done since 1957 well I
think NASA unfortunately became the
agency to nowhere it does spun wheels
went around the planet Earth the space
station was supposed to be the Gateway
for Mars and the planets and that became
a big turkey in out of space so I think
we've been basically spinning wheels for
50 years but last month just last month
there was this excitement this
electricity when the Falcon heavy rocket
blasted off because that was a moon
rocket the first moon rocket in 50 years
the blast off from Cape Canaveral and
guess who paid for it our taxpayers
money no a private individual Elon Musk
paid for a moon rocket and basically
gave it to the American people
for free this is unheard of five years
ago ten years ago if you were to say
that a private individual would create
his own moon personal moon rocket and
give it to the people of the world
people would think you were nuts but it
actually happened so we're in a new
ballgame now a new ballgame where prices
have been dropping dramatically where
the movie the Martian cost 100 million
but to go to Mars only costs seventy
million dollars so Hollywood movies
about Mars actually cost more than
actually going to Mars
that's how cheap space travel has become
India China China's gonna plant their
flag on the moon
it's a national goal for the Chinese
people so things have changed a sea
change from the 1960s prices have
dropped private entrepreneurs from
Silicon Valley are funding a lot of this
stuff and China India everyone's jumping
into the game we're gonna have a traffic
jam around the moon just got 30 seconds
if you what would you tell an
eight-year-old today watching you right
now and I'm sure they've seen you in the
audience's when you speak what should
they do to prepare to become a
theoretical physicist or a scientist
well I tell them keep that flame alive
that is keep that spark that inspiration
whatever it was that set you off in the
direction for me it was
trying to follow the works of Einstein
to complete Einsteins dream whatever it
is follow that star because that's going
to keep you going because there has to
be a North Star that inspires you
because yeah there's a lot of math you
have to know yeah you got to pay your
dues but ultimately it's that spark of
creativity and innovation that keeps you
going in spite of all the obstacles our
guess is Ben Michio Kaku and the title
of the book is the future of humanity
thank you very much for joining us my
pleasure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
