ladies gentlemen it's quite close to my
mouth
it is indeed dying I had a real honor to
be giving the 50th Eckersley lecture and
as you mentioned the salons brag giving
the first one is quite nice because
Lawrence Bragg and and I believe I'm
right he won his Nobel Prize for
something called x-ray diffraction
essentially proving that electron
diffraction rather proving the electrons
these particles that make up float
around atoms also behave like waves
essentially a quantum mechanical
behavior and these sort of diffraction
techniques are now used widely in
science and in physics chemistry and
indeed in biology so it's quite nice for
me to be giving this talk now 50 years
later which again is bringing I hope
together these diverse areas of science
so this is what I want to talk to you
about this evening I'll tell you about a
new somewhat speculative not necessarily
controversial area of science which
brings together various disciplines
which hitherto have been sort of
somewhat separate in their own in their
own silos certainly a school when you do
is studying a-levels you will choose to
do physics chemistry biology very often
you'll do all three but they are very
distinct subjects if you go and study
these subjects at university you can
often do combinations of them so you'll
see things like biochemistry biological
chemistry chemical biology physical
biology biological physics biophysics
any combination of the words that is
actually an another area of science with
their own applications and and ideas
well quantum biology which I will
introduce to you slowly over the next 45
minutes or so I guess it's somewhere in
the middle because it encompasses this
in a Venn diagram
overlapped between physics chemistry and
biology now quantum mechanics is a very
one of the most powerful I would argue
and biologists might might disagree
because they might say Darwinian
evolution is more important I would
argue quantum mechanics is the most
powerful most successful most important
theory in the whole of science because
quantum mechanics describes the building
blocks of reality of our entire universe
quantum mechanics is the provides us
with the laws the rules that tell us how
the the subatomic world behaves how
atoms fit together to make molecules how
the particles come together to make
atoms the properties of these particles
how they behave how they interact with
each other is all described by this
theory called quantum mechanics without
which most of modern technology that we
rely on and take for granted today
simply wouldn't exist we certainly
wouldn't have laptops we wouldn't have
mobile phones we wouldn't have CD
players and so on because all of those
ideas the whole of modern electronics
relies altum Utley on chips which rely
on semiconductors and we wouldn't
understand how semiconductors work
without an understanding of the rules of
quantum mechanics
indeed chemistry itself the how the
electrons arranged themselves around
atoms ultimately can only be explained
using quantum mechanics so where is the
domain of quantum mechanics well if you
start from something very an everyday
object like a tennis ball and I've got a
scale here for those who are
mathematically inclined you'll see this
is what's called a logarithmic scale
because it goes down in orders of
magnitude every line along this
horizontal axis is a tenth of the of the
previous scale so a tenth of a meter a
metre 10 centimeters the sort of the
dimensions of a tennis ball you go you
go down to sort of the millimeter scale
and you've got the eye of a needle you
go down smaller down to sort of a tenth
or
hundredth of a millimeter and you look
at large large cells smaller than that
bacteria even smaller a virus you get
all the way down to ten to the minus
eight ten to the minus nine and we have
the molecules of life themselves DNA the
double helix now ten to the minus nine
is known as the nano scale and nano
meter is one billionth of a meter
it's a naught point naught naught naught
naught naught naught naught naught one
of a meter and there's a whole area of
science called nanotechnology now that
is looking at developing ideas and
technologies down at that length scale
that is on the boundary of where the
quantum rules start to take effect you
go beyond that down to ten to the minus
ten of a meter what's called an angstrom
that's the domain of atoms themselves
and you can go smaller you can get so my
area of expertise is studying the atomic
nucleus and this is not drawn to scale
the atomic nucleus is ten thousand or a
hundred thousand times smaller than an
atom so it's way down the nucleus is way
down sort of further down that scale
much much smaller they talk about the
particles that make up the nucleus the
protons and neutrons the particles that
make up the protons and neutrons the
quarks get smaller and smaller but that
whole domain we can only describe and
explain if we follow the rules of
quantum mechanics
now that during that the the 20th
century quantum mechanics were developed
in the 1920s but from the beginning of
the 20th century people like Ernest
Rutherford first understood what atoms
look like Rutherford was the first
person to essentially appear inside an
atom and appreciate that it's mostly
empty space it has a tiny positively
electrically charged nucleus with
electrons buzzing around the outside and
that miniature solar system model of the
atom is something that we still teach in
schools around the world even though we
know now with the advent of quantum
mechanics that in fact that picture is
wrong these are not tiny
like tiny planets going around the Sun
electrons buzzing around the nucleus
nevertheless we've understood that these
particles that make up the nucleus the
proton from the neutrons are themselves
not fundamental they are also made of
smaller constituents the quarks and by
the early serve first part of the second
half of the 20th century it was
understood that all of matter all the
stuff that makes up all of us and
everything around us that we see is
ultimately made of four building blocks
this U and D stand for up and down and
imaginative names for the quarks the
make up the the proton Neutron this up
down charm strange top and bottom terry
pratchet put it very nicely here to one
of his Discworld novels he talks about
the different colors of magic he has up
down sideways and peppermint which is
nice he talks about the flavors of magic
that's right so so up and down quarks
make up the protons and neutrons that
make up the nucleus then you've got the
electron and then you've got another
particle called a neutrino which doesn't
really do much it just balances the
books but it's there and fills in that
last square but of course by the 1960s
1970s physicists were building bigger
and bigger accelerators and finding more
and more fundamental particles chemists
of course had from the big from the mid
19th century they had their periodic
table of elements and you can see here
this may be well it's not not even this
one's up to it you can see that the
elements we talked about 92 naturally
occurring elements but of course we can
make artificial elements heavier than
the heaviest naturally occurring one
uranium the 92nd element there are
what's called trans you Rannoch elements
elements whose atomic nuclei are bigger
than that of of uranium they have more
electrons around their the nucleus to
balance that that large nucleus link
element 112 is that the most recently
named cop
felicium after Copernicus so it's just
making more more elements but chemists
understood the classification of these
elements in terms of their their
chemical properties but it wasn't until
the advent of quantum mechanics that we
understood why they arranged themselves
in this way and it to do with the way
the electrons arrange themselves in
shells concentric shells larger and
larger around the nucleus obeying the
rules of quantum mechanics
well of course in physics bigger and
bigger machines this is this is a the
iconic picture of one of the detectors
at the Large Hadron Collider in CERN in
Geneva and you can see from the scale of
the size of the machine there's a
there's an engineer standing there just
to give you an idea of how big this this
machine is to detect smaller and smaller
particles you have to smash your beams
that higher and higher energy and big
bigger and bigger cameras essentially to
capture the action and now we know that
in in physics we have something called
the standard model of particle physics
listing all the particles that make up
everything in the universe so this first
column on the left that's those four
particles are told you all normal
matters made of up quarks down quarks
the electron and it's neutrino but there
are two other families with the other
types of quarks and other types of
relatives of the electron and then there
are particles that carry the force
between all these particles and then
there's the famous Higgs boson that was
discovered a few years ago and now of
course the Large Hadron Collider
starting up again and they're looking
for a whole nother mirror world of
particles called supersymmetric
particles you wonder where it's going to
end and things should get simpler and
neater rather more complicated but all
this success all these properties of all
these particles that have been confirmed
in laboratories the properties of of the
chemical elements the way atoms fit
together to make molecules and so
basically underpinning much of physics
and chemistry are the rules of
quantum mechanics physicists and
chemists may have been baffled by
quantum mechanics to begin with but they
appreciate now just how powerful it is
in describing so much of our world I
wrote a book on quantum mechanics many
things about 12 years ago now and I show
this not because they're supplied for my
book because that's a different cover
now anyway but because on the back I've
got this wonderful quote from Niels Bohr
the danish physicists who many regard as
the father of quantum physics if you're
not astonished by quantum mechanics then
you've not understood it you're meant to
be if you think oh yeah that's fine now
I get it
clearly you don't okay because you're
meant to think but how how can an atom
be in two places at once how can it
suddenly be there at one moment and
disappear and reappear over there like
magic because many of the phenomena
Dadda the quantum level do seem like
magic and yet they work and we know
beyond doubt that that is what's going
on this for me epitomizes what's weird
about the quantum world
okay this gear seems fine the tree seems
intact you know whether he can ever
father children I'm not sure but clearly
somehow his skis have gone both both
ways around that tree trunk that's what
goes on in the quantum world we see the
skier we see the tree and we see the
tracks we can never see the skier
actually carrying out that trick how he
does it because when we try and and
observe what's going on the contour well
we change things and it will not reveal
its secrets to us that's another one of
the frustrating and wonderful things
about quantum mechanics the act of the
of observing the quantum system alters
its behavior so sometimes people talk
about in quantum mechanics particles can
behave like spread out waves and waves
can behave like particles that doesn't
begin to get across just how strange
the quantum world is so the extent that
many physicists over the last 80 90
years
have told their students look shut up
and calculate just get on with it
quantum mechanics works if you want to
start worrying about how that scare whip
both ways around the tree go and do
philosophy where we're doing physics
here because quantum mechanics works and
it's beautiful and it explains so much
it doesn't stop many physicists from
worrying and being astonished about how
how actually works well all this has
gone on without biologists by and large
having to worry about things I do
biologists a disservice if I say that
they describe the molecules of life you
know the complexity organic molecules
it'll build up in complexity to so what
a call we call biomolecules using simple
balls and sticks so each one of these
balls
different colors mean different elements
so the white is hydrogen I guess the
black is carbon the red could be
nitrogen and they can build up very
complex models of these molecules
none of this requires any knowledge of
quantum mechanics these are classical
balls held together the bonds between
the atoms that make up the molecules
these sticks are just forces that are
described as these these connections
between them of course these days with
the advent of more powerful computers we
can create much more complicated
molecules than this
so this is a protein made of 100,000
atoms and you can see how all those
atoms will vibrate and interact with
each other that can be simulated very
carefully on a computer and it's very
accurate and very powerful and very
useful but by and large it doesn't
require any knowledge of quantum
mechanics so what what is all the fuss
about why am I suddenly saying well you
know physicists and chemists have had to
worry about quantum mechanics and it's
about time the ball just did as well
surely I would have to justify this
well if we think about quantum physics
as being some sort of foundational level
you know that everything that everything
relies ultimately at some point on
quantum mechanics quantum physics
therefore provides us with the rules
that tells us how atoms fit together to
make molecules it tells us how electrons
will behave how the bonds that connect
atoms together will behave so
essentially down at a fundamental level
surely organic chemistry must ultimately
rely on the rules of quantum mechanics
now organic chemistry if you scale it up
in complexity ultimately you'll get the
bio biochemistry molecular biology which
essentially is life so in some sense
it's not surprising it's obvious that
all living systems are ultimately made
of atoms so ultimately at some very deep
level the rules of the quantum world
must come into play so what after all
any object inanimate matter is
ultimately made of atoms as well and
therefore also subject to the rules of
quantum mechanics so why should life be
any different or any more special or
have some relationship with the quantum
world that is somehow more profound than
in a lump a rock there also is made of
of atoms that there whose electrons
massive a that the rules of quantum
mechanics but one thing first thing to
remember of course is that living
organisms are the only complex systems
in our macro world whose behavior can be
governed can be altered can be
determined by a single molecule namely
DNA no other no system in in the
lifeless inanimate world is affected by
the action of one molecule you need
billions trillions of molecules acting
together for for their behavior to be
visible to us on on us on on our
large-scale macro scale
but a single genetic mutation a single
alteration of a bond within a DNA
molecule can lead to a a genetic change
in a cell that can actually lead to a
difference in a living organism that in
itself doesn't tell us that quantum
biology is something we should be
thinking about but it's just a reminder
that maybe there's something different
about life when you compare it with non
life one of the pioneers of quantum
mechanics
Owen Schrodinger an Austrian physicist
who has a famous equation Schrodinger's
equation named after him
many people who annoy I don't know much
about quantum mechanics may have heard
of Schrodinger's cat the the thought
experiment that the Schrodinger came up
with he said what if he put up a cat in
a box with a vial of poison and some
radioactive material and closed the lid
set up an experiment such that after one
hour there's a 50/50 chance that that
poison has been released and killed the
cat
well if the release of the poison relies
on a quantum event say an atom spitting
out a particle radioactive atom spitting
out a particle in the quantum world you
can't know when it's going to spit out a
particle an alpha particle or beta
particle in fact it's after a certain
time before you look to see what it's
done the only way to describe that
radioactive atom correctly is to say
it's both spat out the particle and not
spat at the particle at the same time
and that's not just because to cover our
ignorance it turns out that is the only
way to describe it correctly you
wouldn't get your your the results of
experiment wouldn't match your
prediction if you didn't say that
but now with Schrodinger was saying is
hang on but fine by atoms being two
things at once both having emitted a
particle and not emitted a party at the
same time but what if that was connected
intimately to the fate of the cat before
you open the box what quantum mechanics
would
tell you as that cat is both dead and
alive at the same time and Schrodinger
even though he was one of the founders
of quantum mechanics was profoundly
disturbed by this so that you know that
that surely can't be right there must be
something missing in quantum mechanics
well that has sort of in some regards
been resolved now that the cat is never
dead no alive at the same time because
these strange quantum effects of being
in two states at the same time seemed to
be restricted down to the quantum level
that once you have many trillions of
atoms together to make up cats or even
to make up sort of Geiger counters that
will measure whether that particle has
been emitted or not then all the quantum
weirdness dissipates it sits or leaks
away very quickly turns out the quantum
effects are very delicate very easily
lost from our grasp so once you get to
level of a cat the decision has already
made either that atom has emitted a
particle or it hasn't either the poison
has been released and killed the cat or
it hasn't seen the reason why you never
see definite live cats at the same time
when you open the box is because the cat
has already either already either dead
or alive
of course Schrodinger never did this
experiment oh I I made a TV series about
ten years ago where I sort of did a
mock-up of this experiment and we had a
cat and we put it in the box
someone wrote in and complained and we
had to explain that a the BBC full
budget wouldn't stretch to real poison
and radioactive material be we wouldn't
do that to the cat and see this is
television you put the cat in the box
and you close the lid cut take the care
give it to its owner close the boss
again and start recording him pretend
it's in there that's telly so insane we
did we didn't the cat was fine
we called the cat Dawkins thought that
was right those were nice and nice touch
while Schrodinger so he came up with his
thought experiment he's a quite famous
equation that every physics student at
university has to use now and and and I
guess many chemistry students as well
the Schrodinger equation he came up with
that in 1927 26 27 he came up with his
cat in the Box paradox in the mid 1930s
but in 1944 he wrote a book called what
is life in which he asked this question
is there something special about life
that requires a helping hand from the
quantum world
it was very influential it's a very it's
a short book is still available
misprision it's a very nice read it
certainly influenced both Francis Crick
and James Watson the the guys who who
were discovered the double helix
structure of DNA and and certainly
Francis Crick was a physicist so he was
in a sense one of the first sort of
quantum biologists said that he was
using his knowledge of physics applied
to biology although he wasn't really
doing much in the way of quantum
mechanics he was they were doing their
balls and sticks models of molecules so
in a way quantum biology you could trace
it back to Schrodinger and his book what
his life
you can even trace it back earlier than
that there were many physicists in the
night late 1920s early 1930s who
arrogantly assumed that they've solved
all the problem physics chemists have
we've sorted chemistry as well now maybe
those poor biologists need that need a
helping hand and realize that actually
that was tougher than they might have
thought in them genetics and molecular
biology was also developing as a new
area of science back in the 1930s
and in fact a physicist by the name of
Pascal Jordan who is another one of the
quantum pioneers he was really a
champion of quantum biology an advocate
that quantum mechanics was important in
life
but unfortunately Pascal Jordan was a
Nazi and so at the end of the Second
World War the whole field of quantum
biology was somehow tainted by its
connection to this this this guy who you
know and he wasn't just a Nazi you know
because keeping his head down and and
and being happy to carry on working in
Germany no he was fully sort of paid up
fascist you know he he was linking
quantum mechanics with the Fuehrer's
ideology for the fatherland and so for
many decades quantum biology really went
quiet and people didn't work weren't
really of course it wasn't needed
biologist molecular biologists and
geneticists were able to make huge
advances it feels without any need for
quantum mechanics then about ten years
ago I guess some yeses yo and well in
fact take well in fact this is only five
years ago there was an article in the
magazine nature written by another ex
echoes Li super speaker Phil ball on the
dawn of quantum biology where he showed
that there were certain starting to
appear certainly phenomena in biology
inside living cells there seems could
only be explained using quantum
mechanics and these were and I don't
mean by this once you get down to the
level of molecules and atoms then of
course the core the rules of quantum
mechanics must apply in some sense
that's sort of taken as read that's not
interesting
no the weirder aspects of quantum
mechanics seem to be playing a part so I
want to go through a few of those
examples that are now getting physicists
chemists and bar
very excited because it seems the only
way to explain these phenomena and these
processes is using quantum mechanics one
feature of the quantum world which is I
think some of you will be familiar with
a something called quantum tunneling so
this is a computer simulation of a
particle an electron in this case which
is not a tiny ball hitting a wall and
bouncing back it's like a spread out
wave and the rules of quantum mechanics
if you look Kevin if we can just about
see but you can just see a well you
can't really can you you can sort of Oh
with the lights down you there we go so
the the brightness of that patch of
light isn't really it's not light it's
really it gives us the probability of
finding a particle in that location
where we to look so this is saying that
the most likely scenario is that the
electron will hit this wall and bounce
back again and and you get these lines
which is basically an interference
pattern from you know you know like you
would in a ripple tank you know water
when water hits a wall and bounce back
again the waves approaching interfere
with the waves bouncing back and you and
you get this building up crest and crest
builds up amplitude and Crestor trough
will cancel but you also get a small
probability that the electron can
magically find its way through to the
other side this never happens in in our
everyday world it would be it will be a
magic trick if we did see a happening
it's the equivalent of wanting to throw
a ball over a wall let's say a 10-foot
wall you'd have to give it enough energy
to get it over the wall and ran it over
to the other side in the quantum world
you don't always to get the ball the
other side you don't always have to
throw it high enough to get over the
wall sometimes you can just throw it for
more weakly so it sort of hits the wall
more often than not it'll just bounce
back and hit you in the face but
sometimes there's a nonzero chance that
it will
appear from your side of the wall and
reappear on the other you might think
well that's just theory that's just
gobble you've made that up but actually
the reason our Sun shines is thanks to
quantum tunneling the reason we are
alive today the heat the energy the
light from our Sun is thanks to a
process of thermonuclear fusion where
hydrogen nuclei quantum tunnel close
enough together in order to fuse to
stick together to make helium and in
that process of making heavier elements
the Sun has all this excess energy that
it that it radiates out so stars shine
thanks to quantum by a quantum tunneling
that's that's well known well I got
involved in quantum biology nearly
twenty years ago now when my colleague
at Surry John Joe McFadden came and gave
a seminar in the physics department
where he talked about the possibility of
quantum tunneling playing a role in
biology and most of my colleagues to be
honest
basically poo pooed the idea and thought
it was just a bit of a nutter I went and
spoke to him afterwards and from then
from that period on which sort of had
regular meetings to talk about where the
quantum mechanics might play a role in
biology we didn't take it very seriously
it was basically over a coffee or a beer
we didn't give up our day jobs we
published a paper in 99 or rather
speculatively on quantum biology but we
don't really do much more about it and
then with the things started to move
more quickly so that phil ball article
in nature alerted us to the idea that
there were scientists around the world
particularly in Chicago and in in
Berkeley in California who are doing
some very interesting experiments that
were proving things like quantum
tunneling effects in biology and so the
area that we got involved in is is
looking at DNA and asking the question
how DNA undergoes mutations so the
double helix if you zoo
in basically is made up of four
different molecules called nucleotides
their symbol is a TC in G and they
arrange themselves and connect together
in a very special way
well the the the runs of the ladder that
hold the two strands of the double helix
together are essentially chemical bonds
they're called hydrogen bonds and they
are essentially a harder an atom were
actually a proton because that's the
nucleus of our hydrogen atom
a proton that's sitting somewhere
between these two sides so that's that's
one nucleotide that's adenine a and
that's thiamine T and you have these
double hydrogen bonds that hold them
together so we modeled this on a
computer and so again balls of six
models but we use quantum mechanics to
describe what might happen to these
these white balls are the hydrogen bombs
the protons because those protons can
quantum travel from one side to the
other
they could also hop across they could
they could you know just jump across if
they had enough energy we wanted to ask
the question well what if they didn't
have enough energy to get across it's
like the ball not getting over the top
of the wall
could they quantum tunnel to the other
side so if you look at these two protons
here and here what happens if they jump
across like that don't bounce backwards
or forwards they can see so they so this
this top one is closer to this this atom
and then it jumps across to the other
one and vice versa because if that
happens and then the two strands of DNA
separates those protons are in the wrong
places and then when the DNA replicates
and makes copies of itself that would
lead to a mutation so we ask the
question whether proton tunneling can
can cause mutations in DNA and it's
still an open question as to whether
ongoing research is needed to answer
this question another effect in in in
to mechanics which is familiar to to
many physicists something called quantum
superposition this means this is like
the cat being getting alive at the same
time this is like the skier going around
both roots of the rube root both sides
of the tree at the same time a system
being in more than one state
simultaneously it could be an atom in
two places at once for example or an odd
electron spinning both clockwise and
anti-clockwise at the same time if you
can understand that you're cleverer than
me quantum quantum yeah what is it what
does it mean for it to spin clockwise
notify us at the same time well that
seems to be what happens in the quantum
world well in my era of nuclear physics
there's a particular isotope of lead
called lead 186 whose nucleus all these
red and blue balls are protons and
neutrons that make up the atomic nucleus
and that nucleus can exist in three
different shapes it can be a sphere it
can be Oblates which is a squashed
sphere or in the prolate rugby ball now
it doesn't exist as a floppy object that
changes its shape over time between
these three orientations it coexists in
all three shapes at the same time when
you look at it you do the equivalent of
taking a photo of it well it'll freeze
in one of them no I'm not doing anything
weird
I'm just here being an odd lates nucleus
you leave it alone look away and it's
then carries on with all the shenanigans
how do we know this happening if we can
never capture it in the act
well we know because there are other
things we can measure are the properties
of this nucleus we can measure that we
can only understand if it's in a
superposition of these three shapes at
once and there's lots of examples in
physics and chemistry of quantum
superposition we may not like it it may
be counterintuitive it may be weird and
mysterious but it happens well recently
quantum superposition has been found to
play a role in biology namely one of the
most important processes in the whole of
of the biosphere photosynthesis
synthesis is the the the process whereby
sunlight is captured and turned into
chemical energy that is used by a cell
to essentially create more biological
stuff more biomass and photosynthesis
I've now appreciated as a physicist
learning a bit of biochemistry is bloody
complicated this is the lot goes on in
photosynthesis well luckily the bit
about the bit that seems to involve
quantum mechanics is the very first step
how that particle of light that photon
is captured by a chlorophyll molecule
and delivered to the reaction center
within the cell that turns that lump of
light energy into electrical energy that
is used to break molecules apart and and
and and and be useful and it turns out
that that lump of energy the photon
doesn't just bounce around within this
complex of chlorophyll molecules this
forest of molecules to make its way to
where it's needed randomly it follows
all possible paths at the same time
that's the only way to describe how it
could possibly be a hundred percent
efficient and beautiful experiments
carried out in America a few years ago
by a guy called Greg Engel who's a
chemist used spectroscopy basically you
take a molecule like this in fact it was
a molecule system in bacteria because
bacteria also do your carrot
photosynthesis and zap it with laser
light pulses of laser light and then see
how that affects the molecule and how it
emits the light again and in a very
clever experiment and they showed that
their results could only be explained if
that light which was sort of you know
doing the job of this photon of sunlight
follows all possible paths
simultaneously so photosynthesis has now
become one of the prime examples where
you can only explain it using the ones
are one of the weirder aspects of the
quantum world what it means
we don't know yet still early days it
may be that you know there's no reason
why we shouldn't believe that life has
had long enough to evolve and find
whatever tricks it can to make these
processes more efficient and if it was
able it was able to borrow some trick
from the quantum world then why why
wouldn't it do that and if you can make
that so efficient using quantum
mechanics is there any lessons we can
learn from biology after all we'd like
to think that certainly within the next
few decades we'll be able to utilize the
sun's energy ourselves for all our
energy lead needs so the power at the
moment is very inefficient well how do
plants do it can we borrow any tricks
from from the natural world my final
example there are other examples in
quantum our final example is I guess one
the nicest it's the most speculative but
it's the coolest if it turns out to be
correct the European Robin so the
European Robin is rather distinct from
the British Robin the the the British
Robin has a a redder redder feathers on
his chest and on his breast and the
European Robin migrates so where the
British Robin basically stays here all
year round but the the European Robin
that lives up in in Scandinavia wants to
get away for the winter fly somewhere
fly is south somewhere warmer so they
migrate every year down from Scandinavia
down to the Mediterranean Spain even
sometimes down to the north coast of
Africa and many animals birds insects
marine animals migrate every year and
they use all sorts of tricks to find
their way to navigate while the European
Robin it was discovered in fact just
discovered by a German ornithologist
husband-and-wife the village goes the
way it finds its way is not through
memory not through hard wired genetic
you know the the the the root is somehow
imprinted in his brain is not
because it's following a map of the
stars in the sky all are all of which
are our techniques used by other
creatures it senses the Earth's magnetic
field
now the Earth's magnetic field is very
weak all right it's about a hundredth of
the strength of a fridge magnet and what
this bird can do it seems is somehow
sense the orientation of the Earth's
magnetic field and use that as
directional information not like a
compass in fact and doesn't sense north
and south it senses the angle of the
magnetic field you know if you had if
you have a magnet and use iron filings
and you can see the field lines going
from the north to the South Pole of the
magnet if you put them spread them on
paper and hold it over a magnet while
the earth is like a giant magnet and the
the field lines you can think of in the
coming out of the south magnetic South
Pole
coming round and going into the magnetic
north so if you're near one of the poles
the field lines of the magnetic field
are almost vertical into the ground but
near the equator those field lines are
almost parallel to the ground so what
the bird is able to sense is the angle
how close is it to the pole and how
close is it to the equator that's how
far is this true and and a lot of
experiments going back to the 90s I
haven't this is not quantum mechanics by
the way this is this is just as weird
but there haven't even got to the
quantum mechanics bit it's many in fact
yet another one of the Exley lecturers
Peter Atkins
chemist famously in the nineteen seventy
said anyone who thinks that the Earth's
magnetic field can mess with chemical
reactions aside living bodies is a
charlatan but it turns out mr. eckers
was wrong they do there are there are
some wonderful experience they capture
these Robins in mid migration in Nets
they put them inside these chambers the
darkened chambers and they put them
inside a cage with magnetic
oils called Helmholtz coils all right
which can simulate the Earth's magnetic
field first of all they put coils that
cancel out so they have the equal but
opposite magnetic strength to the
Earth's magnetic field so the birds
don't feel any Mack don't have any
magnetic information inside these
chambers they've got ink blots ink pads
on the bottom of the chamber so when the
birds walk on them they get ink all over
their their feet and then as they fly
and clamber up the sides of this sort of
cylindrical cone-shaped chamber they've
got blotting paper all round the side
and you see the footprints of the birds
afterwards the next morning when they
come down and without that the magnetic
coil switched on the birds want to carry
on their migratory journey so they will
fly by and large in the direction that
they would want to if they were free
heading southwards but if you switch on
these magnetic fields that cancel out
the Earth's magnet magnetism then they
fly in all directions they just
completely disoriented and then they
mess with them they they will change the
direction the angle of these magnetic
fields and change the direction the
birds will fly in so it was without
doubt that they are sensing the magnetic
field the question is how they were
doing it the only theory in town is that
there's a molecule inside the retina
inside the bird's eye that is act
activated by light called cryptochrome
and that is a it's a protein and inside
that protein a chemical reaction is
taking place now what's happening and
this is where the biochemistry gets very
complicated so I'll just strip it down
to this the simplest explanation a pair
of electrons are quantum entangled now
quantum entanglement is the weirdest
aspects of quantum mechanics because it
even Einstein didn't like it he called
it spooky action at a distance and he
hated it it's the idea that a particle
over here can instantaneously
communicate with a particle over there
so what it does that feels but again we
know that entanglement is a real effect
in the quantum world well inside this
protein in the bird's eye are a pair of
electrons that are quantum entangled and
the way they be
the way they danced together is very
sensitive to the Earth's magnetic field
so there's magnetic field this mechanism
gets switched on by light a photon of
light comes in hits the the cryptochrome
molecule not an electron from one atom
so it sits on another atom but they
still are inter connected somehow higher
this quantum entanglement and the
direction that the bird is moving in the
magnetic field effects had these
electrons behave which affects the
chemical reactions that go on inside
this protein ultimately sending signals
to the bird's brain telling it which
direction to fly at the moment that sort
of experiment is very hard to do how do
you how do you measure quantum
entanglement inside the bird's eye we
can try and study that molecule itself
and and we know there are key there
there's a chemical reaction called the
fast triplet reaction that would explain
all of this so it seems to work and
there is no other explanation for how
the birds make use of the the magnetic
field for navigation so we're in that
situation in science where we have have
a process that we can't explain we have
a theory that will explain it but it's
an outlandish theory that many people
are fired very hard to believe but until
they can come up with something else
that may be more you know less exotic
it's this is the only theory in town and
a lot of quantum biology is sort of
hoping that somehow we'll find a way of
proving it there many other areas so so
photosynthesis an example the earliest
examples of proton tunneling was was in
enzymes the enzymes inside cells
basically they just speed up chemical
reactions well it turns out that the way
enzymes can work so efficiently is by
constant tunneling of particles from one
place to another that was that was
confirmed back in the 70s and 80s it may
be the way we smell has a quantum origin
to do with vibrations of molecules all
those phenomena are still speculative
and we're still trying to find ways of
testing them experimentally and and
whether in fact their their true or not
as I mentioned my colleague John John
McFadden who gave the seminar the
Finnish Department and I was the only
one who who gave him the time of day we
spent many years just batting around
these ideas and then once we realized
that quantum biology was really kicking
off we thought we'd better write the
first book on quantum biology before
someone else does and so so we wrote a
life on the edge and it's essentially I
did the quantum physics and and John Joe
did the biochemistry and it was it was a
painful process so you know we'd write
half a chapter send it to him and he'd
sort of demolish it and so I didn't
understand that and write his stuff and
come back to me a just writing so but
what we outline in the book is all these
potentially exciting areas of research
in quantum biology we still I think
there's still a way to go to convince
many of our colleagues the quantum
biology is worth investing time and
effort in physicists think why why work
so hard looking for quantum effects in
biology they're used to working in
physics labs where you can control
everything
you call your system down to near
absolute zero you carry out experiments
in a vacuum you you shield it from the
outside world so it's not disturbed only
then can you test for these delicate
quantum effects and and see if you can
see see quantum the effects in action
this why they asked would you want to
look for quantum effects inside the warm
messy complicated and and and and busy
environment of a living cell but it
seems those quantum effects are taking
place there so how how are they
maintained there how are they not
dissipating away so quickly biologists
on the other hand are rather reluctant
to buy into controversy because they
don't they've not studied quantum
mechanics and by and large they don't
believe it well believe it they believe
it but they're you know they they're
quite happy not using quantum mechanics
because biology even molecular biology
has been so remarkably successful and
the whole area of genetics and genomics
and the synthetic biology you know the
way you can move individual bollocks
around move genes around put pieces in
molecular pieces on to other bits of bio
molecules and make them behave
differently all that is very very
successful and and ongoing and doesn't
need quantum mechanics yet so biologists
say well why do you why are you worried
about that the chemists were sort of
stuck some somewhere in the middle
between the Bartlett's and the
physicists they were what's all the fuss
about of course everything's quantum
mechanical and I don't know what you
okay why are you getting so excited but
of course the chemists are talking about
how everything down at the level of
atoms and molecules ultimately is is
quantum mechanical the quantum biology
is different it's it's saying yeah well
that's taken as a given what we're
interested in the weird aspects quantum
entanglement tunneling quantum
superposition that seemed so unexpected
that we should find them inside living
cells the field is only a decade or so
old and I think it'll take a few more
years before it grows we are at the in
fact only this morning I was at a
meeting at University College London
with other quantum biologists from
Oxford and Southampton and Surrey
talking about strategies how do we build
a network a community there are various
people around the country and in Britain
today who are working on quantum biology
but they're doing it as a sideline you
know as a not part of their day job
which is which they're getting their
research funding for how do we
coordinate the activity and go to the
government and the funders funding
bodies the Research Council's say Bond
symbology is an exciting area give us
some money to to do it because you know
we need the the students and the
postdocs we need the equipment and Andy
and the instruments to really test some
of these ideas
I suspect 10 years from now it'll but
it'll be no longer controversial it'll
be a very big and growing project but
watch this space thank you very much
thank you
Jim can you hear me yes
what does door kit and sink of this
field and of your book transfer I think
if he certainly enjoyed my quantum plane
quantum mechanics book my guide for the
perplexed cuz I remember him telling me
he was on a committee Rob mentioned this
that the Faraday prize the Royal Society
prize well Richard was on the committee
there and he said one of the things that
that swayed it for me was my quantum
mechanics book so he really enjoyed that
I don't think he has a very strong
opinion on quantum biology I don't I'm
not aware that he's poo-pooed it but I'm
not aware of him patting me on the back
saying wow that's really exciting to him
I fear I need to ask him the world of in
relation to accessing the world of
dowsing no oh I don't know you mean in
the in connection with any sensing the
just of geomagnetic that's right
magnetoreception
no I don't I mean I I'm very skeptical
that dowsing has any any real physical
effect but but I guess the question
should be asked that if there are
certain creatures the European Robin is
one the the monarch butterfly of North
America is another marine turtles
even with we think homing pigeons are
all creatures that navigate by sensing
the Earth's magnetic field so whatever
mechanism they have whether it's quantum
or not that senses the Earth's magnetic
field is that a mechanism that the is is
latent available in humans and are some
humans more more able to utilize it than
others but I think once you stray into
that one of the things about quantum
biology that we have to be very careful
about is it has to be rooted in very
solid science well we we are there are
certain processes like enzyme catalysis
where we know proton tunneling is
playing a role those who experiments
that carried out in the 60s and 70s by
Americans divorce and chance and there's
a group in Berkeley that it and there's
another group in Manchester now who is
doing experiments where you basically
lower the temperature of a biomolecule
below the threshold by which you can get
classical proton transfer leaving only
quantum effects that are playing a role
so there are certain effects certain
processes where we know quantum
mechanics is playing a role and and the
issue is simply how excited should we be
about that it may not be such a big deal
but what's happened in the past so one
example was in in there is in the 80s
when Roger Penrose and Hameroff proposed
the possibility that consciousness has a
quantum origin that there's somehow the
way our brains work is non computed non
algorithmic and they only early quantum
mechanics could explain the spark of
consciousness and they had some
biochemical mechanism to explain it
that's pretty much being discredited now
the notion being well look if just
because quantum mechanics is weird and
consciousness is mysterious doesn't mean
the two are connected
and so people working this field now are
very tentative in in in making their
claims you know but the ultimate would
be people to are quantum mechanics this
wonderful era that surely that must
explain homeopathy you know and that's
when you whoa okay we've now strayed
into pseudo scientific woowoo and and
and scientists are very very conscious
that you know reputations can be you
know your scientific reputation like
virginity
it can only be lost once so this this
with this to people with microphones now
so you want to go first and then well
I've I had a PhD student who finished
successfully he he got his PhD last year
looking at proton tunneling in DNA in
fact his findings were that it's a very
very tiny effect or would DNA mutations
you mean mutations take place in DNA all
the time but but there are it can happen
by accident just copying errors it can
happen ionizing radiation called
particles from space coming in and
hitting DNA and damaging it in any case
there are enzymes that will correct
mistakes
so if proton tunneling plays a role it's
a really tiny effect that just is is
just in the noise but I mean I'm now
I've got another student working on this
and in fact I've got a PhD student gonna
be starting in a few months looking at
what is it in in inside the living cell
how is it possible that quantum effects
like tunneling can main be maintained
for biological times because quantum
effects should disappear in ten
- 15 seconds femtoseconds and yet for it
to have a biological effect it has to
last 4 milliseconds so what is it that's
maintaining this quantum weirdness
keeping it going stopping it from
dissipating and the idea is you know is
something called decoherence and
environmental noise so it's a very
theoretical idea that could apply in in
any area of biology but you know down at
the quantum level what is it that's
making quantum effects stay having an
influence for such long periods of time
so it's a it's a rather mathematical
there if I'm interested is much rather
mathematical using physics knowledge the
stuff the sort of equations that I would
solve in nuclear physics but applying
them inside living cells I can hear you
and I'll repeat your question so what
stage should we start teaching by
quantum effects and by which I guess you
don't just mean you don't mean quantum
effects in biology but just quantum
mechanics well I think it's it's it's
never too early to to expose
schoolchildren to some of these ideas
because after all one of one of the
important things about science isn't
just that you know we have to teach them
than nuts and bolts they have to learn
the scientific method and the and and
all the facts and figures as well but in
order to infuse them and and build on
their passion for science it's
surprising how much you know youngsters
can can can can take on board and I
think it's not very often it's not the
case that we don't think that school
children are able to conceptualize or
take on board some of these ideas it's
probably probably the teachers feel less
than confident in getting across some of
these ideas
but yeah I think it is possible to two
together across some descriptive notion
of what the quantum world is like
without getting bogged down into
formalism and equations which of course
is way beyond school level I think it's
it's in the science level there's no
reason why you can't infuse them with
what what some of these ideas are
telling us about the world because it's
very important after all there's this
one there you should sort of wave your
hand Mina motion is more visible to
middle-aged eyesight are there any
practical applications to quantum
biology not as yet I mean the only one
that's the very often is touted and the
end it's a bit of a stretch but but it's
the idea of photosynthesis if if living
systems if plants and bacteria are
utilizing quantum mechanics to make at
least one of the stages and
photosynthesis much more efficient than
it would be without quantum mechanics
then can we use that trick ourselves in
developing more efficient photocells
in developing solar power you know we
know there's enough energy from the Sun
to power the whole world you know so
many times over its to how do you focus
that energy how how do you use it how do
you turn it into into something useful
well plants have figured that out but of
course there are lots of other you know
this is not new you know we're we are
trying to mimic the way life makes use
of the sun's lights and turn it into
energy and use it ourselves but maybe
maybe quantum mechanics might have
something to say in that in that field
so far that's you know you know whether
we can 20 30 40 years from now we're
developing magneto receptors that allow
us to really you know to find our way in
the Earth's magnetic field or either
what the hell we'd use there for but I
don't know
so yeah at the moment is simply blue sky
research this this one more than just
don't don't be shy you've got you stuck
your hand up now seeing you now I mean
this you can't
um it's almost yeah there we go and do
you think there are any future
applications for you mentioned DNA
mutations but what about cancerous
mutations yeah okay good that's that's
another area again it's one of those
areas where you sort of feel nervous
about saying too much but clearly the
mutations that make a cell turn
cancerous are many and and and very
varied and we're still trying to
understand them if any of those
mutations or any any step along the way
which if we could sort of deal with we'd
stop the chain would stop at a certain
cancers if any of those mutations relied
on proton tunneling and you could
somehow control the probability that a
proton would tunnel from place to the
other then then then understanding
mutations quantum mechanically would be
something very important in cancer
research one one example is that if a
particle can quantum tunnel but if you
make it heavier it's much more difficult
for it to quantum tunnel so if you
double its its mass its probability of
tunneling is reduced by much more than
just a factor of two it'd be like a
hundred times less likely so what you
could do is and what experiments are
being done so John John we found in my
colleague is proposing this experiment
it's called the kinetic isotope effect
or basically you grow say bacteria in
deuterated water heavy water so we're in
the h2o molecules it's not h2o is d2o so
where's the hardware and adam has one
proton and electron going around it a
deuterium atom has a proton and a
neutron
I'm going around it so it's twice as
massive as a normal hard run Adam if you
grow these these organisms in deuterated
water and they replicate then very soon
all the protons all the hydrogen bombs
or a large fraction of the hydrogen
bonds holding their DNA together are
actually deuterium bonds and if quantum
tunneling plays a role then it won't
happen anywhere near as likely if you've
got these heavy particles deuterium
replacing the protons so you know the
the buzz line there which is like the
worst you know Daily Mail headline will
be brilliant for this do to deuterium or
deuterated water heavy water will cure
cancer if quantum mechanics the worry
then you get too so so that's the if you
push speculations to the limit that
that's what we can get to bet that's not
the sort of thing that any serious
science scientists will put on a
research grant because it's so
speculative and it acquires so many
steps that we simply don't understand
properly yet our neutrino is affected by
quantum yes neutrinos are elementary
particles and therefore everything they
do would have to be described within
quantum mechanics
just like any other elementary particle
getting good exercise hi do you have any
anecdotes or knowledge or a way to
explain the idea of in quantum computing
where you measure the spin of a particle
which makes up a qubit to see what it's
holding so using quantum spin as a
computer memory do you have a way to
explain that because I'm finding it
quite hard to understand do you mean in
terms of helping to develop quantum
computers yeah well a quantum computer
so a normal classical computer it relies
ultimately on on bits of information
that's either 0 or 1 in a quantum
computer because a particle can for
example spin we don't talk about
clockwise anti-clockwise they say spin
this direction or this direction but in
the quantum world can spin both
directions at once
so if spinning one direction is the zero
and spinning the other direction is the
one in the quantum world a quantum bit
or qubit can be doing both the zero and
one at the same time so it means that a
quantum computer can pursue all possible
computations at the same time
simultaneously and using quantum spin is
one of the the main main ways the people
are pursuing research into quantum
computing there are other ways where you
have electrons sitting in different
energy levels simultaneously as well but
yes the the notion of a particle
spinning both ways at once is one of the
examples the people are seriously
researching into to develop quantum
computers and that quantum computers
will be coming online in the debt in the
next decade or so I'm pretty sure do you
think there is a moment would there will
be a moment at which human beings will
be able to understand quantum effect
rather than just have to believe them
well most quantum physicists will tell
you yes we do understand quantum
mechanics what they mean is we
understand the the the mathematical
framework it's a beautifully complete
and elegant mathematical construction
and it all works beautifully but you
know what is the interpretation of
what's going on do I think one day we
will yes I do I'm not so for those who
know anything about the foundations of
quantum mechanics I am NOT a Copenhagen
list most of you that won't mean
anything for the Copenhagen astiz
someone who subscribes to the view that
was put forward by those physicists
working in Copenhagen in nineteen
twenties Niels Bohr Verner Heisenberg
and Wolfgang Pauli which is they're
basically shut up and calculate you're
never going to know how the quantum
world does its tricks deal with it live
with it it works why should you expect
to to use your classical brain to
understand what's going on the constant
well I don't buy that I don't think
that's an interpretation I think NASA
off hidden the sand is the position but
then I'm also not that keen on one of
the other favorite interpretations which
is called the multiverse Theory namely
the in quantum mechanics the way a
particle can spin clockwise and
anti-clockwise at the same time is there
actually two universes in each universe
is spinning in one way weird though that
may sound many physicists including
people like Stephen Hawking think that
is the only correct explanation for
quantum mechanics
I don't know what the correct
explanation is well I do believe that
nature behaves in a certain way and if
we've got an embarrassment of ways of
explaining what's going on then that's
our problem not natures but nature does
things is somehow that particle gets
from here to here somehow something
happens and I don't think we have got to
the bottom of it yet I like to think we
will in my lifetime
if we are concerned about the future of
British scientific research which way
should we vote on June the 23rd all
right very good well quantum mechanics
tells you we cannot be in a
superposition of both we have to stay in
[Laughter]
