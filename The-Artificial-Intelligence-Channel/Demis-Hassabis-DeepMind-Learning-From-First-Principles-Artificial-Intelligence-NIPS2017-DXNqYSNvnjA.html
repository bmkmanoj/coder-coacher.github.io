learning from first principles and they
covered quite a few different things and
it's a little bit about zero latest work
at the a-list so ambition is to firstly
try to solve other if you solve
intelligence and then it's a belief that
if you're able to do that you should be
able to use it to pretty much solve
everything else or at least it should
affect us every aspects of our lives and
when we start to people and back in 2010
now we had this sort of philosophy
behind our approach how are we gonna
approach this will appease delicious
dish and really States intelligence
another number of climate issues and
just going to mention for the key axes
that we we use to sort of inform our
philosophy about how we would like to
approach building agenda intelligence so
for us the most important is committing
to this idea of learning versus
handcrafting solutions so we wanted to
build systems that learn for themselves
request patients directly from the more
data rather than being spoon-fed and
contrasted with solutions that the
program is the service economy secondly
there's the notion of generality so you
wanted system that was able to work
across a wide range of environments and
tasks and potentially out-of-the-box so
including potentially normal person is
never seen before and that's versus
specifically preparing profiteer system
to do it just with one
one of us third was this notion of
groundedness versus logic based systems
so with no believers that are true
thinking system auction cognitive system
needs to be really grounded in
essentially relative reality so you need
to be able to trace the origins of the
knowledge that is created all the way
back to the wall basic English rather
than in contrast logic based systems
which are sort of these ethereal systems
where this is one of the object them
floating floating kind of unconnected to
the actual Native American religions
living is this notion of active versus
passive learning so systems or systems
are more encompassing so for example the
classic point gets an input and then it
outputs a decision about that interest
but when we were off there East Asia
based systems that are active
participants in their own learning much
like Alison was mentioning earlier about
somehow children any vehicles as this
you were mentioning about hi and was
done to so these are so important when
thinking about and we committed to be
rethought the right approach was to be
in the left I'm extreme here although
these four axes and so taken together
that night gives you the idea of the
system that's a general-purpose learning
agents and that's what we internally
would eat more artificial general
intelligence that's what we're trying to
deceive now in order to do this we
actually look to neuroscience assistant
neuroscience and cognitive psychology
ideas including John Fetterman and
animal intelligence restorations or
algorithmic I gave her
there's an architectural ideas that we
can borrow and build our systems around
first attendant said over this type of
system was a system called decent rent
and we may see put together neat
learning and reinforcement learning at
scale to form deeply forces only which
is a subjective now call it and to try
and do something impressive with it in
terms of government how far you can push
the system so you go an internet
learning system and then it's regularly
agents that just takes guts and rewards
signal comes up on all the score for the
game and then has to figure everything
else of itself we use them games and
simulations as efficient actions are
testing and development design our
algorithms because we could run millions
of versions of these at once
in fact versus something like that easy
build robots and I first think that what
results as many of you nervous applying
this to Atari games a classic Atari
games with JT's I'm coming Billy one
system that could master all the
thousands of thousands of different very
different Atari games so we trained our
primary network system neatly which we
called ether n DQ network and basically
is a very large convolutional net that
uses the remote signal to to modify
inside these points and that
successfully plays maybe these dozens of
Atari games I already spent very long in
this works I wanted to understand rest
of time talking about next pieces I work
out for them is our system to play game
of Go so those of you don't know this is
what the drawing board looks like it's
played on the night of my ninety board
I take turns to play studies on earth
seasonable the name of any NGO is to
surround your opponent's pieces with no
pieces or to solve anything errors of
territory when you get to the end of the
game so this is their position at the
end of the game you may see can top the
amount of territory they used to mounted
and compare it to opponent's territory
there it has the most points once again
so in this case likely inspired just a
single point is very close game now go
is extremely simple game to learn
there's only two rules really and it's a
pretty elegant because progressing from
that simplicity comes incredible
complexity and one wave easily generate
that is the fact that there are 10 to
power - 70 possible or decisions below
which is waiting that there are
accidents observable universe so so
that's one of the reasons why I don't
think so far the computers to play
obviously the late nineties IBM this
deeply famously me Garry Kasparov at
chess and since then you know people
that next time he gives up trying to
apply those same techniques to the game
of God but really they were never able
to get further than strong answer
naturally let alone kind of world
champion so one of these problems is
this alumina search base so this 10 to
the power of the second possible
positions but actually any more
interesting bit harder problem is the
problem of try to create an evaluation
function so it was thought impossible in
fact it may still be possible to
directly write down an evaluation
function to the government that will
allow the computer system to determine
whether the partners issue
that's always very critical to the sorts
of traditional techniques I have Ibiza
so there is less significant go and our
contractors at the Emirates on our chest
is that there's no concept of
materiality all the pieces are the same
so there's no easy turistic to tell you
who's coming the winning another problem
we've got is that there is why doing a
constructed game or if chess is a
disruptive game
what I mean by that is that chest using
chess he starts off of all the pieces on
the board and that's a game with a lot
of pieces of the move so the game get
similar he's going the both start 17 and
you fill it up so you know if you're in
a midday position by the chest as though
in chess and all the information is
there and what's the point of even the
current board position but you know all
those who had the information gaming you
also have to protect for some time and
think about what might happen and in
order to figure out who's going to get
what's here actually it's a little
obvious from the current position the
sort of construction to go last
what kind of humans deal with this
definitely lets the end professional
don't pairs how do they do that
what if he talked a lot go players
they'll tell you that the game is
primarily one about intuition that's
what we do they rely it sneaks in
intuition rather than calculation which
is what Iron Chefs I was living there
explicitly calculate out particular
plans or ESCO
is much more about feel this move feels
right in this particular situation so we
thought this is a great challenge for us
and our learning systems we know they're
the traditional blue force systems work
we go and so that's why we chose go as
as a good target for us for the types of
learning systems he wanted to do so we
felt with these two problems by easy to
do new hand works so the first day we
network who call the policy Network here
or there the green we train it on a
hundred thousand to several hundred
thousand human names human and it's
against that we downloaded than the
internet and what we did in the policy
now is
to trend it to predict what the mood was
indisputable states plan and I got with
leaders like this to the extent that if
you give it any random or position and
here include then it will output a
probability distribution of how likely
it thinks humans going to play certain
moves in the current position so that
means you can basically look at the top
sort of three or five most likely news
rather than looking at all the 200
possible movies there are on average in
a particular position
so this narrows down the width of the
search but essentially abrasive reported
entry meaning I would say or as we
trained the second neural network on the
data produced by this class network pack
against itself um many minutes of times
and we took positions from those games
and we also use which ended up losing
ultimately and we trade the second thing
you'll never have the value networks
they're in pink to predict from the
current position who is likely the
winner and what was this sort of
confidence level over that so the random
and returns another real number between
zero and one zero meaning white very
encompassing complex and we won from
singleton classically and point five
their company basis and again we to
discuss virtual in Africa and we put it
together once in college research is
very important component the Oracle
system which called these to do networks
and then the each others don't run of
the legends of the game is going south
koenji is for Lisa go he's a legend from
the game which has eighteen well tighten
season think that was like kind of
science and I caught in there whatever
have done because eventually that's the
same some extra ones needs to occupy
Sinise he's ignorant apprentice cleric
across decades we had this one million
dollar challenge match our immunity is
done out in South Korea and you know it
was a huge event and
and really kind of an amazing spirits
but once the larvae experience and over
too many people watch the matches online
little TV at several surprise between
these dolls and alphago one-for-one and
this is sort of the claims being about
that came before his time so when I
spoke to several of the world experts in
computer go
the company is before we go out for go
they were all convicting them and in
their interviews there were at least 10
years right or the use of the current
methods a very amusing traditional
methods to to be able to text me
anywhere close to while champion so this
is pretty surprising for everyone but
also that what was more interesting also
just about that one but Paragon what
kinds of news is amazing what some ideas
about so because it was basically trade
from this notion of self play it
actually came up with new ideas and new
motifs that be discovered through
through that song play
denisa one famous example from the game
to do this is a second game after that
there is black and there's a second
alphago played this stone here on the
right hand side we can see indicated
that and rid of the water with the white
triangle and this was virtually shocking
for the commentators viewing this
Maximus several climbing YouTube clips
into their cat where they literally fall
off their chairs and the reason is
because this move is being played on the
fifth line
so there's 19 by 19 is pause and this is
we play souls on the fifth line now in
the opening set or parts of the game you
generally only play on the third and
fourth highest then playing on the fifth
body gives away a richly on the side of
the board from the fourth line which is
quite a lot of territory so it's quite a
lot points at the end of the day so it's
basically inconceivable
that's affirmative like this and if you
are an amateur and you play like this
will teach you to quickly correct you so
this is an original kind of unthinkable
move but yet though no reason in China
considered to be sort of part for me and
in Asia it simply kind of an awful but
it's interesting because it's like
objective part so you know maybe one of
us in this order to come up with a novel
wound by playing around and within this
position but the key thing is whether
it's a sort of musical movement
considered to be branding is whether
actually affected the outcome and real
world and that's why this truth examine
is considered so beautiful it was a
hundred days later these two stones here
in the bottom left-hand corner
i granted white radicals which are in a
bit of trouble because they're
surrounded by white stones that fights
into the bottom left-hand corner cut
that reflects a swirl damage to the end
of the board and perfectly connects up
with move 37 back stone and that's the
only position perfectly to decide that
quite a slice of me and that's why in
south america very split again so it's
elicited his idly it sort of design me
ahead of time there are few hundred a
few thousand rooms later that stone
would be in the critical position even
though it looks like a bad move locally
of course i should mention that weeks
ago himself was inspired to doing his
own genius move on
who's that waiting game for haven't got
time to uncover where that is but there
is actually a documentary now which is
directed by some already better
brilliant guy called red coast and now
it's they bore all sorts of students of
isis i recommend you can check that out
if you want to know more so I've talked
to you a bit about nutrition and a
little bit about creativity but what do
I mean by those terms
well I mean just I'm just happy that
this vocalizing
this encompasses all the all the
complexity for these times in but I
think these are these reasonable
operational definitions we can think
about so I think there is an intuition
that simply implicit knowledge that we
have must be required from experience of
course but it's not consciously
expressible or accessible so we can't
access it consciously ourselves and we
certainly can't express it to anyone
else
the second thing is you know you might
think is what only few visits that kind
of knowledge how do we know that it's
there but of course we can test it
behaviorally so we can verify the
existence and as long as the quality of
it howaya testing their behavior so
Kagura this is very easy I mean if the
entity normal person at a deposition and
we see what you can evaluate the quality
of the decision that they make
secondly what about creativity so again
there's many dimensions of creativity
but I think one reason to operational
definition is the ability to synthesize
knowledge that you already have in a new
way of producing local origin idea the
service of some kind of God and I think
surveillance only it constrains main ago
I think
alphago clearly demonstrated these
abilities and most professional players
who agreed so we continued with the
development of alphago because our
mission was not to just create a program
that was going to go but we wanted to
make greatest of all society of a
general 90 now and so the way I approach
is need one is to try and make something
work quite an internal way as possible
and then look at it in mathematics
after that speech the supplements and to
try and make it extract little bit
simplify it eventually makes it more
water so that's what we did we offered a
zero which is which is the latest it's a
required a question of Africa and we
wanted to repeat this part of the
bootstrapping for human later because
often you don't have anything the data
and it's also specific to that
particular thing so we started in this
case complete from random play with zero
knowledge and I have half an hour zero
players of Socrates applies learning
collectively from its mistakes and so
what we ended up with was an English
stronger more efficient and more general
rushing around for them so we change the
architecture a little bit we created a
julienne architecture so Africa's there
are only has one neural network which
likes to take two things so the policy
now ready met it isn't one we will
network and we think this is one of the
reasons why are those zeros don't them
because this results in better
organization and then it's actually
quite simple algorithm that so after
that place you know about 25,000 gamers
in one batch against itself and the
current full strength that it has then
we take all that new data and we train a
new policy network to predict that
version of alphago is loose what that
person would do
we're also training in value network
that there are that predicts the winners
from those games we gamers issues then
we put those two together into a new
iteration about and go astray
automatically and then we pitch that a
new Russian plays that are fueling the
don't question and if it winds up 55% or
more significantly better then they
replaces the old question as as the new
now generator of the next level basil if
it's not significant better than
continuing with the other question they
collect little decks up and they try to
train again after another 25,000 years
so this is the the curve of improvement
performances on the y-axis days time is
on the x-axis and you can see they're
just after three days alpha go after
their zero and it's a passenger version
of Africa that we played against this is
our so it's a really well tracking they
will kill my tracker never after three
days after the 21 things it needs the
best version of alphago that we are
created for after their master which $27
young top professional players and then
you'll notice after 40 days we stopped
writing the program but it still has an
asymptote so we never actually found yes
and so got this self improvement process
this lots of something kind of pretty
crazy like 5,000 meter but it's still
improving so it's as it goes actually
what the final optimal play and acetone
be and then we went back and look
through the different plays that the
machine was doing month ago Sarah was
playing at different time scales and the
fan that you know the guillotine expect
is playing on the total diameter over
the concentrating stone explaining the
stupid places like the corner on the
wall and then over time it starts
rediscovering the best
luxuries so after 36 hours 40 hours it's
not playing quite common what's called a
exactions which is the best light he was
about and then the the frequency of
those plays don't propagate as a
testable 72 hours and we think that's
because our girls decide that there are
actually better flexible approaches and
then intersections practice starts
effects in its own ones and these ones
there are being analyzed and utilized by
human players or professional dragon
world so in rainy the thing called after
the zeros we discover 3,000 years to the
knowledge that goes around for 3,000
years in sensitive past so you can be
more details about this is there are two
papers that we published last June this
year and then finally I want to talk a
little bit about our registration and
artha zero which is very important so
now we won't go from this and it's just
alpha zero a generic page playing and
you know some people steps forward I
think about even after those zero that
could play other even other games like
chess and show me so we appreciate could
but we decided to actually test the
species out and we we leaves officer oh
and we tighten it on line three the
three major personal information next
chess champion go show these economies
chatter straight pancake it is something
that we don't require let's hug to talk
about that missile so I'm assuming focus
on alpha zero today in Chester which is
the game I'll invest well when we start
to us off I talked to a few of my
friends from the chess world needs and
explore champions and they might not as
a question that's how far off do they
think from oxygen plane were the current
chess engines so as you all know
HSN is as far beyond human world
champion ever Bobby already divorced and
they've got really neither so the three
thousand or appeal and the cut
unbeatable right heel index and as
actually the Chester myself I think that
they're probably pretty close
lots of already one or two yeah she went
to be very hands-on thoughtful and
insert it's not it wasn't clear that a
learning system could be as good as his
hand crafted systems
given the amount of effort that gone
into building systems like they lost
twenty thirty years that the news desk
justice white probably the most one of
the most if not being most studied
American history of AI but so insulin is
further computer chess is winning at the
birth and the order of computer science
so people like children Shannon
advantage we're thinking about computer
chess or in the early days of computer
science and they are all kind of current
recipients of highly specialized systems
that have being obviously very
successful in playing chess and they use
African to searching a whole bag of
handcrafted Jewishness that it's
distilled form human grandmasters
so communicator stockfish which was the
program on the 2016 World Championship
this is the list of special case
jurisdiction extensions that their stock
fish has so gigantic difficult you know
masters specific types of techniques to
help it play chess and moves to help
loquacious there's no that we just
replace all of that in hand engineering
with self claiming for some money itself
payment upon research so there's no math
opening booking alpha zero
there's no ingame deck space no
heuristics at any point it just starts
him Heaney for random player and when I
wasn't as sure as chess player
this is work give it an important
openings and their games are and you
know sawfish plays a permanent
exhibition plays as given it's nearly
perfect but the only thing was he wanted
though obviously again than just a
motion to totality say that we would say
my parameters for all three games and
much to our surprise that you know was
the first time you try to run this that
we found that alpha zero be state of the
art chess programs in all three games so
in chess the big slot fish 28-0 didn't
is one game at 132 thoughts who needs a
little bit black and shogi it needs a
world champion the alwah learn to paint
and then you know we beat alphas urban
Africa zero and 1640 after three days
and compare Agartha three days ago
so alpha zero thickness of our stock
issues you know our strengths need four
hours they'll come in two hours and
alphago all the graphically the visit
operation in eight hours
so this whole thing all three games in
less than 24 hours don't thing is
location while it's a question of
compute power we we honestly don't think
it is I mean we use Google sensor
processing units all of them in the
cloud but that's quite a bit amount of
power but actually one way to measure
this easy way to measure this is how
many lose I searched her decision made
for zero and the human grandmasters you
know they search about 10 minutes or
tens of lose her decision
they may say ok Archer centers like
starfish has such tens of millions of
who's in each decision they make so
selfish about sentencing in in movies
type a decision and alphago 0 is why in
the middle of the spectrum in its using
about tens factors
Booth's her decision so it's right in
the middle so c1 is much less than than
those they've got jet engines obviously
it's still three almost magnitude more
than humans do but it's it's moving
towards the right direction or in terms
of water the right we did a quick
analysis we'll get into more houses and
that whole paper as a personal ability
like white paper is we looked at the
mechanism the discovered by alpha 0 and
I'm pleased to say that my favorite in
the English opening a lot that survived
this is a eight hours of training
whereas surprisingly some really popular
openings like in the bottleneck say the
Kings Indian defense was not really
favored by an officer at all at any
stage and if you leave out the zero on a
style it's not what I would say doesn't
play like a human they also have to play
like compute engines it's any placement
first almost alien brain or an officer
announcer we could analyze this is a bit
more but with have a few chests but also
look at this or including one on our
team and our concern as long-term
positional sacrifices and that isn't
really the thing checks because
sacrifices are most mean about tactics
so it was a crisis you maybe give the
Queen way because he thinks you
calculate now when we can check make
your opponent a few news later
so these are tactical sacrifices they're
quite unusual but they're they're
playing in this playlist you know world
channels like kneecaps help who's
famously doing those kinds of sacrifices
or where alpha zero does is it makes
sacrifices for some very long-term an
additional game which you know I was
surprised that chest have the capacity
to allow for things like long-term
positional sacrifices so it appears that
this is an actual NHS and I think the
reason more information we'll take on
that is that because it doesn't have a
concept the materiality so have a rule
telling it that groups of five points
the last of three points holes at one
point it doesn't know anything about
that so so it's been about everything is
kind of contextual it's Lou things like
this kind of position you know news
assets I have this world that can move
like this isn't that useful
whereas did my opponents all tonight is
really powerful this division so I'm
gonna swallow right and it doesn't have
to very become a summation more than
half of this system that tells me that
that it's gonna do to you points by
sorting the look for night now obviously
a stop nation there's kind of Champions
champions a crisis but we have to
calculate enough to see some end point
that they will get that ethereal rattle
there'll be some other compensation for
it whereas that the zero doesn't need to
do like any patient about retirement in
that material at some point now right so
the key thing here is that Richard Mills
like that there's the traditional
Chessington time can't be dynamically
balanced on situation right you can't
just say it's just have another if then
we'll say in this specific transition
this book is not worth my points select
three points it's always worth five
points in its hard-coded negative X's so
the initial is actually more for more
adjustment enemies though it may not
conceptually chatters in two minutes
this can be very exciting to learn of
the chest and I think humans can learn
from mr. because these ideas to change
it rather than tactical so we can we can
actually walk back into powering player
I just want to near the end I'm talking
about show you a couple of virtually no
chefs and as for the damn I love games
so so there's quite a lot game theory in
this in his talk but his position on
whether show
showing these kinds of long-term
sacrifices
so alpha alpha 0 is whitehead and
basically what is done is sacrifice
efficient you can see it has taken a
call and it's going to give away its
bishops and are sufficient that
institutions and seen the black Bishop
there the top left corner concern and
but it's a completely calm Aramis and I
think what's happened is it's decided
that that Bishop there the black house
is hemmed in by the corners isn't worth
very much so it's definitely worth three
points so it's companies even a maggots
Queen to be sworn off this is kind of my
burden off like if your bishop that Miss
Reno right now it's just gone
I mean so you've got one home for it so
you know he does not become your thing
and eventually will just really like
soft issue someone crashes around this
visual be completely and so an
officially you know as much as its King
it is number one some lettuce once it
midday life sacrifice since his middle
name analyst alpha zero just played this
night move to the corner the voltage
check the king and it Masek you thought
this night incredibly just for those
small fish to take night only and it
just can't be don't develop such pieces
and this is pretty many people showed up
and I showed that one of the
grandmasters this which couldn't believe
it so it takes point yet and then it
moves is Queen in other times it's ready
to have a meal incredibly this one in
place that's right back with the bishop
its have that physical Portland on
seasons right so you know I just think
you know there's a lot more here to
explore I just see this is kind of chess
with another dimensional and Derek has
far from self actually before we saw
gamma 0 results he was talking about
deep bloomers and anything some kind of
error and you fell after that because
it's a learning system equals it's high
please explain the type a system is some
kind of beginning so it's on ahead we're
talking and I know like Gary matsutake
later on to create some of his comments
imitations
obviously with this system you know
where I think this intelligence service
to a communist refused comment all space
so what you have to have is a clear
objective function and you have to have
even large amounts of data or efficient
simulator in this case to generate great
things out and this course decisions the
relax along things alpha 0 it can't
generate hypotheses or design
and it hasn't only player abstract
knowledge or causal reasoning creditors
so we receive all those things but I
don't want to say a capital back few
years ago in clean much everyone in this
room would have thought that these
results are kind of unthinkable and
assistant Israeli general you know he's
the the genuine games clinician and I
always dreamed about an electronegative
elements on my committed and we have it
now the piece of information yes
obviously we're not claiming this is all
about innovation for missile is a huge
challenges its brain learning the world
already lost the confirmation
uncertainty there's precious efficiency
if you want to talk about that one when
I remove these things that we're working
all those projects and we think that
they're very altered clearly formed
Czech intelligence but there's one kind
of a human efficacy XY dimension which
is that obviously humans it's not quite
right to say that let us take a from
those 0 and had 13 games and we worked
out the summer-like piece of the
jalapeno after 2000 games in their
lifetime and that seems like a huge
discrepancy but don't forget the humans
are coming to this which we produce
early partners already and also want to
transfer learning and more westerly
apprenticeship right so obviously that
reaches all three going on switch their
better selves destinations of many other
humans knowledged
on the game and they didn't talk where
they're going masters so I think in the
future in the cottage things actually
test you could actually make you think
about information test on the book in
the sense of you could have one note or
a question of alphago
zero that
that learners cheerleaders okay and
another version that once it's able to
read books
the reason book and inner self right and
then you can kind of compare how many
games of self babe
does that look worth so kind of before
sometime we were able to do that and
what our off the reason I think and
discuss a lot with my college series
though you know the minimum set of
massively general parts is what we're
after and obviously used to end you know
we're not we're not looking to just play
games in our systems
that's just our proving ground on a
testing ground and albeit a fun one
and really what we're trying to do is
acquire these like this you know one of
the greatest artists of doing that in
areas of health care to indigenized
actually makes sense and all sorts of
other things and for me the most
exciting thing we to try and acquire
some areas of science another it's not
quite limited in ways on this pension I
think there are really areas of science
that may require me to go to this type
of approach by drug design material
design and some aspects of biotech and I
think ultimately this is the area I'm
looking forward to as I welcome any
right is the power of humans machines
together
you know and humans and us and our smart
tools figuring out some complex
scientific questions I think human
ingenuity operates by ionic all I'm not
actually the that potential</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
