notions of reality wait till you hear
what Brian Greene has to say his new
book is about parallel worlds the theory
that our universe might be one of
several universes our universe may be
just part of a multiverse although the
idea of hidden realities may sound like
science fiction it comes out of very
advanced mathematics Brian Greene is a
professor of physics and mathematics at
Columbia University he's conducted
important research on string theory and
wrote a best-selling book explaining
string theory called the elegant
universe it was the basis of a PBS
series and a finalist for the Pulitzer
Prize Green's book the fabric of the
cosmos was also a best-seller Brian
Greene welcome back to fresh air so does
everyone compare the concept of multiple
universes to an episode of The Twilight
Zone you know not everyone but it
certainly is a case that the science
we're talking about is touching upon
things that science fiction has explored
has made use of in a great many
different environments so the kinds of
science we're talking about is in some
way bordering along science fiction and
that's what makes it sound both possible
and absolutely impossible to me at the
same time possible because I've heard
that story in fiction and impossible
because but that's fiction
but the wonderful thing about fiction is
if you look at some of the ideas that
have come out of science fiction
oftentimes they are just ahead of their
time it's fiction in the time that the
piece is written but some
science-fiction become science fact
so I'm having a lot of trouble wrapping
my mind around the concept of parallel
universes because it seems like a
contradiction in terms as you point out
in the book I mean I thought universe
meant everything I thought the universe
was Infinite and that Infinite was
beyond any amount that you could
possibly imagine
everything everything everything was
included in infinite so how can there be
more than one of those well to some
sense it is a question of language if
you define the universe as truly being
absolutely everything then you're right
to talk about more than one universe
would be a contradiction in terms the
reason why we have introduced a new
called the multiverse which basically
means multiple universe is is because as
we have studied physics ever more deeply
we have found that what we have long
thought to be everything is only a small
part of a grander hole only one piece of
a much wider cosmos and to really kind
of communicate that idea we've
introduced this new terminology that our
universe is just one of many universes
populating possibly a grander multiverse
and when you talk about many universes
there's lots of different theories about
what those universes might look like
right yes the wonderful thing about the
subject is that there's not one
monolithic notion of what a multiverse
would be as we have studied a whole
variety of different areas of physics
from relativity quantum mechanics
cosmology unified physics it seems to be
the case that whenever we follow the
mathematics of these deep theory
sufficiently far we bump into one or
another variety of parallel universe
idea and to me what makes it so
compelling is it's not that we
physicists are sitting at our desk
saying what kind of crazy idea can we
introduce into science now it's not like
that at all what we're doing is sitting
at our desks trying to do what we always
do which is trying to understand the
universe come up with theories that can
describe our observations our data and
when we follow those theories far enough
we come across some version that our
universe is one of many ok so in one
model of parallel universes of a
multiverse and one model I am
interviewing you right now in another
universe absolutely what's that model
and how's it going there but there are a
couple of variations on the multiverse
theme which would be compatible with
that idea the simplest is basically the
idea that you began with that our
universe may be infinitely big that is
space may go on forever and if that's
the case it turns out that you can
establish using pretty basic mathematics
that there's only a finite number of
different ways that matter can arrange
itself
so if you have an infinite expanse with
only a finite number of different
possibilities the possibilities have to
repeat I mean if you think about having
a deck of cards when you shuffle that
deck there are just so many different
orderings that can happen so if you
shuffle that deck enough times the
orders will have to repeat
similarly with an infinite universe and
only a finite number of different
complexions of matter the way in which
matter raises itself has to repeat so
our collection of matter right now with
you interviewing me that is repeating
itself out there in the cosmos but isn't
that a kind of earth eccentric notion of
infinity that like space is endless but
the ways that matter can organize itself
is finite I mean if space is endless
isn't there matter beyond our
comprehension
aren't there particles or ways of
organizing particles beyond our
comprehension you are right there are
potential loopholes to this way of
thinking we are definitely imagining
that the physics that we have understood
here on earth does apply everywhere
throughout the cosmos and the reason we
believe that is when we look out as far
as we can in the cosmos and that's
pretty far we can look out billions and
billions of light-years from Earth very
very far away everything we see seems to
be describable using the laws of physics
that we humans have been able to develop
and what we're basically saying is let's
therefore extrapolate and assume that
those laws really do work everywhere and
really every when and if that's the case
and the reasoning that yields this idea
that matter must repeat is something
that's a consequence of that mathematics
on the other hand isn't there another
theory of the multiverse that says in
other universes there are different laws
governing matter and space and time and
gravity and there might be principles we
don't even know about yes there there's
another variation on the multiverse
theme that comes from our thinking about
cosmology the origin and the evolution
of the universe that does yield some
somewhat more robust version of the
multiverse than the one that we're
describing and it's coming from
something called inflationary cosmology
now most people have heard of the
Big Bang Theory this idea of how our
universe began and a very very small
nugget that about 13.7 billion years ago
erupted with space and time being flung
out words matter and energy coalescing
into stars and galaxies over the course
of billions of years of cosmic evolution
but the thing that we don't often stress
enough about Big Bang cosmology is the
Big Bang leaves out the bang the Big
Bang Theory does not tell us anything
about what actually happened at time
zero itself it doesn't tell us what
caused that explosion that outward push
to happen and this new theory
inflationary cosmology is what fills in
that detail it tells us that there was a
configuration of energy in the early
early moments of the universe that could
give rise to something that sounds very
strange something called repulsive
gravity we're all used to the gravity's
attractive you let go of something it
falls to the earth earth pulls things
toward it but there's a kind of gravity
that does the reverse repulsive gravity
pushes outwards and we believe that in
the early early universe repulsive
gravity was in operation and that
repulsive push is what drove everything
apart now the reason I bring us all up
is when we study that repulsive push in
detail we find that it's not a one-time
event the kind of big bang outward push
there could be many big bangs many
outward pushes at various and far-flung
places throughout this wider cosmos
giving rise to different universes it's
like a cosmic bubble bath of universes
our universe is one bubble in this big
cosmic bubble bath so there were lots
and lots of big bangs one bang led to
another bang - another bang and each of
those bangs created a different universe
yes exactly and to get back to your
original question when you study those
universes and a little bit more
mathematical detail you do find that
their features can differ widely they
don't have to have the same kind of
particles we know about electrons and
quarks protons and neutrons those are
the kinds of particles we are familiar
with and those other big bang universes
they don't have to have those particles
they don't have to have the forces that
we know about the electromagnetic and
the nuclear forces for instance they
may not be an operation in those
universes other forces instead may take
their place
so in this repeating Big Bang Theory I
am NOT interviewing you in another
universe well it doesn't rule out that
there could be other bubble universes in
which the laws are very similar maybe
identical to ours so we could in fact be
having this conversation out there but
it allows for a wider variety of
possibilities because the laws can in
principle be different now you said
something that really baffles me you
said when we study those universes in
mathematical detail what do you mean by
that I mean we don't even know those
universes exist so when you say when we
study them in mathematical detail what
are you talking about well that is a
confusing idea I think for for people
who don't actually engage in the kind of
research that I'm talking about because
what we do is we sit down with equations
equations that describe space and time
equations that describe how matter can
move through space and time and using
those mathematical equations we can get
a sense of what it would be like to be
in one of those other universes even if
we can't actually visit or see or
interact with that universe in any real
sense that's the power of mathematics
and I have to say underlying everything
that we're talking about in fact
underlying everything I do with my
entire life pretty much is a firm belief
that mathematics is a sure-footed guide
to how reality works if that's wrong
then all bets are off
earlier in our conversation about the
multiverse the idea that there are
parallel universes our universe is not
the only universe you were describing
how in one model of the multiverse
everything that we are doing now is
happening in another universe
so the interview that we're doing now is
happening in another universe what is
the theory that backs up that model of
the multiverse well there are two I mean
one is I wouldn't quite call it a theory
per se but it's the notion that space
may go on for infinity and that fits
within the general theory of relativity
which is Einstein's theory of gravity
which is a
most relevant on the largest scales of
the cosmos and according to that theory
the universe could be doesn't have to be
but it could be infinitely big it could
also be that if you head out into space
you might sort of circumnavigate the
cosmos and return to your starting point
much like what would happen if you
walked on the surface of the earth in
one fixed direction you'd come back you
wouldn't keep on going forever in one
direction if that's the case then space
wouldn't be infinite and the ideas that
we're talking about wouldn't be true
there is another way that you can come
to the conclusion that variations of
this conversation are having a
realization out there in the cosmos and
that comes from a theory called quantum
mechanics a completely different set of
laws that are not as relevant at first
sight to the largest things in universe
they're relevant to the smallest things
in the universe yeah the quantum
mechanics is the study of all those
subatomic particles that make up matter
and this is where I guess the laws of
probability come in that's the key idea
the sharp break from the older classical
physics that arose when we learned about
quantum mechanics is that in Newton's
day his way of thinking about the
universe was you tell me how things are
right now and I will tell you with
absolute precision how they will be in a
minute or five minutes or an hour from
now it was absolute definitive
predictions quantum mechanics came along
in the early part of the 20th century
and said actually that idea is only
approximate that idea is not fully
correct when you study the universe with
greater precision you learn that you
can't make those kind of definitive
statements the best you can do according
to quantum mechanics is predict the
likelihood the probability of one
outcome or another so if you're studying
say the motion of a little particle like
an electron the math of quantum
mechanics might say there's a 50% chance
that the electron is over here and a 50%
chance that it is over there and that is
the best you can do in terms of
delineating where that particle will be
quantum mechanics says there's this
inevitable portion of the world that
described in terms of probabilities and
how does that connect to the idea of
multiple universes well
here's the puzzle the the idea that the
world is governed by probabilities is
strange enough when you actually do the
experiment to say figure out where that
electron is you always find it in one
location or another and indeed if the
math said there was a 50% chance it was
one place in 50% at another if you do
that experiment a hundred times then
pretty much 50 times you find it in one
location of 50 and the other so the math
is borne out by the experiments the
little dark secret that doesn't get
perhaps as much play as it should when
we study the mathematics of quantum
mechanics we still do not understand how
to go from the fuzzy probabilistic
description that the particle might be
here and it might be there we don't know
how to go from that description to the
single definite absolute reality that we
see when we do the measurement we never
find the particle partly here and partly
there we always find it definitely here
or definitely there how do we go from
the probabilities to the definite
outcome people have struggled with that
they continued to struggle that I've
struggled with this problem back in the
late 1950s a fellow named Hugh Everett
suggested a radical way to deal with
this problem he said the idea that only
one outcome happens in a given
experiment that's just not right he said
follow the math of quantum mechanics
take it very seriously and it is telling
us that there are two possible outcomes
the particle can be here or there
therefore what happens is there are two
universes and one universe that particle
is here and the other universe it's over
there and there's a copy of you in each
universe measuring that particle and
thinking incorrectly that that particles
unique location is the only reality but
in fact there are two of you thinking
that there are two realities two
parallel universes now I should say when
you frame this in terms of the position
of electron it might sound kind of
curious but it also might seem well not
that relevant to everyday life who
really cares about where one electron is
here or there but when you take account
of the fact that everything you think
everything you do everything you
experience amounts to particles moving
around inside your body moving around
inside your brain every aspect of
reality has to do with how particles
what we're learning from quantum physics
if you take the math seriously is that
every possible reality consistent with
the laws actually happens in its own
separate universe no are you convinced
by that no I'm not convinced by that not
yet I find it the most attractive way of
dealing with this puzzle in quantum
mechanics going from the fuzzy
probabilities to the definite outcomes
but when I study this theory in detail
mathematically I find various holes in
the mathematics holes is perhaps too
strong a word
I find various points in the mathematics
that I'm not yet convinced that this is
the right way of dealing with the issue
there are other physicists in the world
who have you were talking to them they
would say I'm absolutely positively
convinced there is no other way that
this problem can be solved this is the
right answer I have not gotten to that
point yet I find this a wonderfully
compelling idea but I'm not a full
convert so you know we've been talking
about this idea that we live in one of
several universes there are other
universes out there that we can't detect
but the math that very very very high
level math are showing that there really
might be other universes when you write
about this when you do research on it do
any of your fellow physicists or
mathematicians think that you've flipped
that you've kind of gone over to the
other side or is this idea of a
multiverse pretty commonly accepted in
your field I say it's highly
controversial but there are a lot of
people on both sides of the aisle it's
not as though it's a fringe theoretical
study with just a small number of people
thinking about the possibility that we
might be part of a multiverse there are
many researchers many top researchers
who are taking the idea seriously I mean
the reason why the people who are not
fond of this idea are critical of it is
quite sensible we're used to science
giving explanations of a different sort
than a multiverse can give we're used to
sitting down looking at data and coming
up with theories doing our calculations
and showing that our mathematical
calculations yield the answer that
agrees with what the experimenter or the
observational astronomer has found
that's the way science has progressed
for a very long time if we are imagining
we're part of a multiverse we're
changing in some sense the way in which
our theory and our observations affect
one another after all we can't see those
other universes we can't touch them we
can't visit them and that is
uncomfortable too many physicists and
scientists are used to the more
traditional way of doing science but if
it is true if you and others are doing
research now the will show we live in a
multiverse not just in a universe then
you're on the verge of a scientific
revolution this would be of course a
huge revolution it's a revolution in a
way that would complete a meta
revolution that's been in the making for
five centuries me a long time ago we all
know that we thought that the earth was
the center of everything
thank apprentice comes along and we
learn that no the earth is going around
the Sun and then later we learned the
Sun is one of many stars in our galaxy
one of hundreds of billions of stars in
our galaxy then we learned that our
galaxy is not the only galaxy there are
hundreds of billions of galaxies out
there if you take that Copernican
revolution further it would suggest that
what we have long thought to be of a
universe might also just be one of many
universes in a grander cosmos is there a
multiverse theory that you find most
convincing it's a great question and I
think it really does speak to what makes
the whole subject of interest to me
which is as I was saying before you
almost can't avoid having some version
of multiverse arise in your studies if
you push deeply enough in the
mathematical descriptions of the
physical universe and that to me is
really the hallmark of what makes us an
interesting subject I mean that the
stakes are very very high because there
are many of us thinking about one
version of parallel universe theory or
another if it's all a lot of nonsense
then there's a lot of wasted effort
going into this far-out idea but if this
idea is correct this is a fantastic
upheaval and our understanding which of
the
is most likely to be say tested in the
next few years which is the only way
that I'll be convinced of any of these
if they really can have some sort of
experimental support behind them is a
version of the multiverse that comes
from string theory and that's your
specialty that's the theory that I've
been working on for for now 25 years yes
and that's a theory that is attempting
to realize Einsteins dream of the
unified theory of physics that is in
essence one master equation that might
be able to describe the big the small
and everything in between and as we've
studied this theory we have run into the
idea that everything that we know about
again everything that we have long
thought to be the universe might
actually be taking place on a membrane
and the image that I like to have in
mind is imagine that our universe is
like one slice of bread in a much
grander cosmic loaf with the other
slices of bread being other universes
it's called the brain multiverse and
again it comes directly from the
mathematics of this attempt to realize
the unified theory that Einstein sought
but never found ok let's backtrack just
a little bit so the unified theory that
Einstein saw I never found that's a
theory that would explain both subatomic
particles but also explain like the laws
of gravity and speed and light and the
cosmos and make the large coincide with
the small that's exactly right what we
have found is that in the 20th century
there are two major developments in
physics one as you're mentioned general
theory of relativity Einstein's theory
of gravity it does a fantastic job for
big things stars and galaxies and so
forth the other development we're
talking about quantum mechanics and it
does a fantastic job at the other end of
the spectrum for small things molecules
atoms and subatomic particles the big
problem for 70 years is that each of
these theories does fantastically well
in its own realm but when everything
series confront one another they are
ferocious antagonists the math
completely falls apart
they might say when would they ever
confront each other one for the big the
others for the small but there are
realms in the cosmos
such as at the center of a black hole
we're an entire star has been crushed to
a very small size a star is big and
heavy you need a theory of gravity it's
been crushed to a fantastically small
size you need quantum mechanics and that
domain you need both of these series and
when you bring them both to bear
everything falls apart string theory is
an attempt to fix that how well we have
found rather surprisingly that a
seemingly modest change to our picture
of how the world is constructed allows
us to sidestep the problem in the older
days the older theories of physics we
envision that when you spoke about
molecules and atoms and subatomic
particles when you got down to the
particles the electrons and the quarks
inside the nucleus of atoms we envision
that those particles were little tiny
dots that had no structure no size they
were really infinitesimal if we change
that idea and envision that these
particles are actually not little tiny
dots but little tiny loops little loops
of string littles piece of strings that
can vibrate at different frequencies
that change from a dot to a string is
able to cure the mathematical
inconsistencies between general
relativity and quantum mechanics at
least on paper we haven't tested we have
not been able to test these ideas yet
that's the big issue but at least on
paper that modest change from a dot to a
loop cures the problem how does it cure
the problem that's a very interesting
and difficult question I'm absolutely
willing to give it a shot okay so first
let me just give you what the problem is
in a touch more detail
Einstein's vision of space was that it
was malleable was flexible sort of like
a trampoline that's a metaphor that we
physicists typically use so the reason
for instance that the earth goes around
the Sun is that the Sun sort of like
sits like a bowling ball on the
trampoline of space and because it
creates an indentation in space as the
earth moves its nudged around by the
curved surface of the warped space that
the Sun creates that's the way gravity
according to Einstein work
warps and curves in space now go to
quantum mechanics quantum mechanics on
the very small scales says there's
something called the uncertainty
principle at work and the uncertainty
principle basically says that you can't
ever fully know both the position saying
the speeds of all the particles of
microscopic realm so there's a certain
amount of chaos a certain amount of
tumultuous frenetic behavior happening
in the microscopic realm because you
can't ever fully nail down what's going
on the frenetic behavior of quantum
mechanics is very much at odds with a
nice gently curving space picture that
Einstein had for general relativity in
fact if you follow quantum mechanics and
examine a little patch of space magnify
it with a fantastic magnifying glass it
says that if you magnify space too
fantastically small scales weigh down on
small scale space is not gently curving
as Einstein had in mind it looks more
like the surface of a violently boiling
pot of water a completely different
image of space and one that makes
einstein's mathematics fall apart that's
the problem the wild jitters of space on
microscopic scales now how does string
theory fix that
it basically spreads things out when you
go from a point particle to a string
you're spreading it out you're spreading
that point particle out into a loop and
when you spread anything out you dilute
it similarly as you spread out the
particle to a string you spread out
space and the wild undulations of space
that were the cause of the problem they
get spread out they're still there but
when they spread they dilute they dilute
to a level that allows the math of
general relativity and quantum mechanics
to harmoniously coincide okay so I'm
really working hard to absorb all of
this and and now I want to take it a
step further and have you connect
everything that you've been saying about
string theory and a unified theory and
relativity and apply that to the
multiverse to the visual of the
multiverse that arises out of your
understanding of string theory and if
anybody understands string theory it's
you
well there are a couple of multiverses
that come out of our study of string
theory one is something that emerged oh
about ten years ago or so which was the
realization that within string theory
the strings that we're talking about are
not the only entities that the theory
allows it also allows extended objects
that look like membranes which are
two-dimensional surfaces there also are
three-dimensional surfaces within string
theory and so forth and what this has
opened up with in string theory is a
possibility that we might be living on
one of those gigantic surfaces and that
gets back to the metaphor that I was
mentioning before where we are imagining
our universe being a slice of bread in
this big loaf what that meant is our
universe is living on one membrane and
there can be other membranes floating
out there in space and that is what is
known as the brain multiverse that what
we have long thought to be everything is
actually confined to living on one of
these giant surfaces and there other
giant surfaces out there that idea
actually may be testable in the next
years at the Large Hadron Collider this
big accelerator in Geneva Switzerland
how would you test that idea on this
accelerator well if we are living on one
of these giant membranes then the
following can happen when you slam
particles together which is what happens
at the Large Hadron Collider protons are
slammed against each other violently
they're sped up near the speed of light
and you have these head-on collisions
some debris from those collisions can be
ejected off of our slice of bread off of
our membrane and be ejected off into the
grander cosmos within which our membrane
floats if that happens that debris will
take away some energy which means
there'll be less energy for our
detectors here on our slice of bread to
measure so if we measure the amount of
energy just before the protons collide
and compare it with the amount of energy
we record just after they collide if
there's a little less after and if it's
less in just the right way that would
indicate that some had flown off
indicating that this brain picture is
correct Wow okay so it must be so both
exciting and fresh
for you your your theorizing that there
could be other universes and it's
conceivable you could mathematically
prove that but you wouldn't be able to
get there to actually experience it with
your own senses yes so you can ask
yourself is it really worth thinking
about if it's something that is purely
intellectual it seems esoteric and
perhaps even standing outside of what we
want to call nuts and bolts science and
the reason why we are compelled to think
about these ideas is well one it's just
wonder isn't interesting but beyond that
there are a certain problems certain
problems that we have struggled with for
decades which when you reframe them in
the context of a multiverse theory some
of those problems simply evaporate and
that capacity to go from complete lack
of understanding in certain problems to
the problem simply going away when you
think about them in this other setting
is quite compelling one of the things
people love about space travel is that
it gave us Teflon and tang and all kinds
of you know like materials that are used
no it had practical applications in
addition to being like fantastic and you
know mysterious and and all of that are
there practically I think a lot of
people want to know are there practical
applications of the kind of really
abstract research that you're doing
really hard to answer I certainly can't
think of any because the stuff that
we're talking about is so far removed
from me everyday but what I think needs
to be said is if you were to have asked
that very same question to the people
that were developing quantum mechanics
in the early part of the 20th century
people like Niels Bohr or even Einstein
or Schrodinger I think they would have
said I don't see any application of
these ideas we're talking about atoms
and subatomic particles that's just too
far away from everyday life to really
affect anything that we do in everyday
life but now 80 years later 90 years
later the equipment that we make use of
the fact that you have a cell phone your
personal computer all manner of
technology that has an integrated
circuit relies upon quantum physics
without quantum physics there wouldn't
be any of that stuff
someone actually estimated that
something like 35% of our gross national
product comes from quantum physics which
is all just to say you don't know where
science will go 80 hundred years 500
years after fundamental discoveries are
made so this kind of signs if it's
correct and I really need to emphasize
this is cutting-edge stuff we don't know
that it's correct but if it is it could
have a major impact on the way we live
what got you interested in investigating
this
what kind of cosmological level of
physics was it the math itself or was it
a desire to find answers to really
profound questions there are people who
are driven from different angles some
are driven by the mathematics and it
just takes them wherever it does and
they just find it exciting to follow the
equations I'm not like that for me it is
the ideas I mean I love the idea that
what we're studying is something that is
so big so transcendent we're trying to
talk about not even the universe we're
talking about perhaps other universes
but all within a rational logical
framework that allows us to make some
definitive statements to me that's
enormous ly exciting to step outside the
everyday and really look at the universe
in these mathematical terms on its
grandest of scales what do you most hope
to learn in your lifetime I'd love to
understand how our universe began if
indeed there is one universe or if there
are many universes I'd still like to
know how this one got started and
associated with that is the most
puzzling question to me of all which is
what really is time what is the nature
of time I mean we all think about time
we all live within time but we're still
struggling to figure out what time
actually is and if our mathematics if
our theories could answer that I think
that would be a profound step forward
well Brian Greene has been great to talk
with you thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
