Ralph Merkle graduated from
Livermore High School see I went back
cool and proceeded to study computer
science at the University of California
Berkeley obtaining his BA in 74 and his
MS in 1977 in 1979 he received his PhD
in electrical engineering at Stanford
University with the thesis entitled
secrecy authentication and public key
systems his adviser was Martin Hellman
while at Stanford he Co invented public
key cryptography dr. Merkel joined Xerox
Palo Alto Research Center in 1988 where
he pursued research and computational
nanotechnology until 1999 he was a
principal fellow at Cybex and now a
senior research fellow at the Institute
for molecular manufacturing he chaired
the fourth and fifth foresight
conferences on nanotechnology was
co-recipient of the 1998 Fineman prize
for nanotechnology for theory and was
co-recipient of the association for
computing Machinery's we didn't go over
the pronunciation of this Keller nachus
Kalamata skip Morris Award for theory
and practice the 2000 RSA award in
mathematics and the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers
Kobus Austria award for the
revolutionary invention of public-key
cryptosystems which formed the
foundation for privacy integrity and
authentication in modern communication
systems and that's just a fraction of
what was available on Wikipedia the
title of today's presentation is science
long life and cryonics please help me
welcome dr. Ralph Merkle
thank you very much for that very kind
introduction yeah let me see if I can
fire up the slideshow here ooh there we
go
science long life and cryonics so before
I start off I'd like to point out that
there's a URL at the bottom it's my
domain name merkel comm slash talks and
if you go to that domain name you'll
find a list of talks in chronological
order and the most recent one
chronologically is is this one and
you'll find a link to the PowerPoint
slides so don't worry if you see any
lists or links there in the talk or any
references or anything like that
you don't have to frantically write them
down you can go off to the URL and
you'll find them there so just relax and
joy watch the nice talk there's anything
you say oh that would be nice for me to
look up later you can look it up later
so with that we'll start off and the
first thing I'd like to say is if any of
you want a nice introduction to cryonics
there's a very nice article written on
the subject by a guy named Tim Urban and
he specializes his blog specializes in
writing informative summaries of
subjects that he thinks would be
interesting that's what he does in his
blog and he goes out finds subjects that
he thinks would be interesting and does
in-depth research on them and describes
them from the perspective of someone
coming to the subject for the first time
and he does a very good job of this so
if you want to have a description of
cryonics from the point of view of
someone who's coming to it for the first
time and you want a good accurate
description of the subject I can
recommend this article why cryonics
makes sense by Tim urban on weight but
why
is his article so okay a quick summary
of what you're going to be hearing first
off I'm going to talk about arranging
atoms so that's science and technology
stuff then I'm going to talk about the
revolution in medicine that arranging
atoms enables now I'm going to talk
about how that revolution in medicine
will let us make cryopreservation how it
makes cryopreservation a sensible option
then we'll talk about what's involved in
cryopreservation what's involved in
waking up from cryopreservation and then
we'll talk about the organizational
issues involved in crowd preservation so
of all about is introduction now we got
into the meet the hard core technical
issues about what is it we're saying
today and with that I will now discuss
coal that's a picture of coal coal is
made from carbon atoms lots and lots of
carbon atoms
that's a diamond a diamond is made from
carbon atoms same carbon atoms different
arrangement of carbon atoms coal and
diamonds same atoms different
arrangement it makes a big difference
how atoms are arranged this is sand this
is technical stuff by the way this is
sad sand is made of silicon and oxygen
and impurities
this is a computer chip it's made of
silicon and oxygen and impurities again
same atoms different arrangement how
atoms are arranged is very important
this is a person not very healthy
they're in the hospital this is also a
person this is a healthy person again
same atoms different arrangement how
atoms are arranged makes an immense
difference to us in terms of our health
in terms of our wealth in terms of
everything we care about
well back in 1959 a very famous
physicist Richard Feynman gave a talk
and in his talk he asked the question
what would happen if we could arrange
the atoms one by one the way we want
them that would be a pretty amazing
technology we could change coal into
diamonds we could change sand into
computer chips we could make unhealthy
people healthy that that would be
something so that raises a question how
do we arrange atoms
well it's it it's easy you do it with a
scanning tunneling microscope of course
it's perfectly obvious answer how many
people have heard of a scanning
tunneling microscope oh good
over half not everyone's heard it a lot
of people have heard hurt it was
invented by Bennigan's Rohr who got the
Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986 for
inventing the scanning tunneling
microscope and the picture you see which
looks rather ugly is first scanning
tunneling microscope so what is a
scanning tunneling microscope well it's
a sharp pointy stick and you can see
that red thing at the bottom is a sharp
pointy stick and the sharp pointy stick
is moved over a surface and the blue
rectangular thing is the surface and if
you have a really sharp pointy stick
then the atom at the end of the sharp
pointy stick and as you can see and then
the circular blow-up the end of the
sharp pointy stick has an atom sticking
out at the end of it the atom at the end
of the sharp pointy stick almost touches
the atoms on the surface of the thing
you're scanning and if you
put a voltage across the tip and the
surface to apply a little voltage then
you get a little current flowing from
the tip to the surface and as you pull
the tip away from the surface the
voltage or rather the current flow stops
and as you approach the surface the
current flow starts up again so you've
got a way of telling whether you're
touching the surface or not and then you
can scan the tip across the surface and
you can tell what queer the bumps and
the surface are you can feel the surface
by telling where the current flow stops
and starts and you can scan the surface
and build up a picture and these are the
pictures you can get these are pictures
that were taken with scanning probe
microscopes or scanning tunneling
microscopes now in the upper left hand
corner you see the letters IBM spelled
out in xenon atoms all right how many
people have seen that picture before
okay fewer but you've still got a
several people have seen it that's not
only can you see atoms with a scanning
tunneling microscope but you've got a
sharp pointy tip and you've got atoms on
a surface you can dip the tip down and
you can push on the atoms and you can
push them around and some researchers at
IBM pushed atoms around on a surface and
they push the atoms around into the
letters IBM you'll never guess who they
worked for
[Laughter]
and you can also push atoms into other
shapes you can push them into circles
you can push them into other characters
and in fact in the lower right you'll
see some atoms pushed into the letters n
is T the National Institute of Standards
and Technology so guess who they worked
for so a lot of researchers have been
doing this they've been building
basically sort of nano advertising for
their companies and they've been
demonstrating that you can arrange atoms
at least in two dimensions on a surface
so this is opening up a whole new world
and it's been doing something rather
amazing it's been showing that you can
touch and move individual atoms and it's
been opening up something that
traditionally has been done at the
larger scale traditionally we have hands
and the way we build things is we hold
parts and we position parts then we
assemble parts and that's how we build
things that's our factories work that's
how we started out I mean originally
when we were back in the caves we'd take
rocks and bang them together and make
things using that early technology then
we've advanced since then but we've
never been able to do that with atoms
and now we can which is quite remarkable
and back in 1959 Fineman remember
Fineman we were talking about Fineman
Fineman said I want to build a billion
tiny factories which are manufacturing
drilling holes stamping parts he wants
to build little tiny thing
and now that we have a technology that
can move and arrange molecular parts we
know we can do it we're on the edge of
this new amazing ability we should be
able to apply at the molecular level the
lessons we've learned at the scale of
you and me about how to build things
which leads to the concept of a nano
Factory and on the next slide I'll show
you our best current gas of what a nano
you
so that's coming somewhere down the pipe
we're gonna have that in our future
and it will build know pretty much what
we want now what's the impact of these
things gonna be the impact of a new
manufacturing technology depends on what
you make well what are we gonna make
well we could make a lot of things and
it's some of the time I talk about lots
of things that we're going to make I'm
only going to talk about two things and
I'm only going to talk about the Nana
computer it's a little teeny debt and
the only reason I'm going to talk about
the Nano computers at all is because you
need to have some form of computation to
run the thing I'm mostly going to talk
about which is medical nanorobots
medical nano robots are what you need if
you're gonna have advanced medicine okay
so let's have one or two slides on
computing guess what we're gonna have
really powerful computers in the future
Moore's law is gonna keep right on going
for another few decades if you've heard
doom and gloom about Moore's laws coming
to an end
no it's not we might have to switch
technologies but Moore's law is gonna
keep right on going and the reason I
know this is that we've analyzed a
particular type of molecular computer
which has a lot more computing power
than anything that's been proposed today
and it's got well you can look at it but
what it boils down to is it's got
something like 11 or 12 orders of
magnitude that's roughly a trillion
times more computer power per unit per
watt
it's got about a trillion times more
computer power per watt than computers
have today and that's a whole bunch so I
won't bore you with all the details but
suffice to say we're gonna have a lot
more computer time computer power and
then I thought I'd show you some eye
candy isn't it pretty
it actually makes technical sense it's a
design for anatomically precise
component in a molecular mechanical
computer and it's a hydrocarbon design
little white spheres our hydrogen and
the black spheres beneath it our carbon
and it's a design for a molecular
mechanical device that will operate in
the near gigahertz almost a gear it's a
little bit slower and it will allow you
to compute using molecular mechanical
operations with very little energy
dissipation and it does so with
molecular rotary joints and if you want
to understand how it's working there's a
nice paper that goes into all of this
stuff and it's online and you can read
it and as equations and things in it so
it's all very technical and stuff so we
can build very small very powerful
computers that will let us run molecular
Medical nano robots so what's the
takeaway message we'll have a lot of
computer power and we can build
molecular computers that can run very
very small devices so that gets us to
the big message and the big message is
we will have medical nanorobots and what
our medical mineral pots medical nano
robots are very very small robots that
are much smaller than a cell that can be
programmed to run around inside your
body and inside individual cells to do
medically useful things
like make you healthy which is something
that all of us who are not in the pink
of health would really like I'll solve
this we're growing older would like to
remain healthy for a longer period of
time and there are various proposals for
various different types of medical
nanorobots that just gives you an idea
of the schedule there's a typical cell
which is about 20 microns in size by the
way the idea of a typical cell is an
oxymoron there's no such thing as a
typical cell all cells are very specific
and very individual but to the extent
there is such a thing as a difficult
cell there it is and on the left you see
some typical medical nanorobots which is
even more of an oxymoron because no one
has built any medical nano robots at
least so far so the concept of typical
medical nano robots is interesting but
nonetheless I have a picture which shows
typical cell on the right and some
typical or exemplar Medical nanorobots
on the left so what kind of medical
nanorobots might we have well first off
there's a respiro site what is a respiro
site well people breathe right I'm
breathing I inhale and I exhale and when
they inhale oxygen goes in into my lungs
it's carried into Monni circulatory
system goes around goes to my tissues my
tissues use the oxygen and then they
produce carbon dioxide carbon dioxide
goes into my circulatory system and goes
back through the circulatory into the
lungs and then I exhale and out goes the
co2
now this is normally carried by wine
blood and in particular Hema globin
carries the oxygen in and blood carries
co2 out and what respiro sites do is
they just carry oxygen co2 only need to
do a better job with it so respire site
might carry over a hundred times as much
oxygen as a as hemoglobin and because it
can carry over a hundred times as much
oxygen if I have a therapeutic dose of
respiro sites if I've been injected with
them so they float around in my
circulatory system I can hold my breath
for over an hour so I can inhale whole
little respiro sites get oxygen in them
and then I could do something
interesting like I could sit at the
bottom of a swimming pool for an hour
not breathing because I'd have all these
respiro sites they didn't oxygen and
they could release the oxygen into my
tissues and my tissues would be happy
and my tissues would produce co2 and
their Spira sites would soak up the co2
and the respiro sites would sit there
essentially this virus sites are very
small scuba gear scuba tanks is if you
want to think of them that way
so that's nice so there's something more
useful you could do with these things if
you are prone to heart attacks you might
be injected with therapeutic dose of
these devices and then if you actually
had a heart attack and your heart
stopped normally if you have a heart
attack the sequence of events is oh I've
had a heart attack bunk and you fall
over and you're unconscious and then you
know if you're lucky there people around
to grab you and haul you off and try and
resuscitate you and if you're not lucky
they don't but if you've had a
therapeutic dose of respond recites the
sequence of events goes as follows you
have a heart attack and your heart stops
and then you say Oh
my hardest stopped oh my and then you
call your doctor you say doc my heart
has stopped what should I do
and your doctor says well you you have
about an hour to get down to the
emergency room where we can look at you
and figure out what's going on you
better get moving because you know these
respiro sites only have a certain amount
of oxygen and then they run out so get
moving and then you go down to the
emergency room and they start trying to
figure out what's going on and that's a
very different scenario so if you have
respiro sites available if you have
respiro sites in your medical Arsenal
then you can deal much more effectively
with circulatory problems so that's one
example then we have micro befores just
as we have artificial red blood cells
the risk parasite we can have artificial
white blood cells the micro before micro
Avars will basically remove pathogens
from the bloodstream and they'll do so
again an order of magnitude or two
better than white blood cells well so
they remove pathogens more effectively
and more rapidly so they can clear
infections more quickly and more
thoroughly so again that's good and then
finally we have criminal sites another
major advance in medical nanorobots
basically as we grow older our
chromosomes suffer various forms of
damage and in general we have a number
of problems with chromosomes that are
well problems
medical problems and we'd rather deal
with and chromel sites are devices that
target specific cells and remove the
chromosomal material and replace the
chromosomal material with a fresh set of
chromosomes which is really useful if
you've got damage in the chromosomes for
whatever reason and if you have chrome
allo sites you can treat a variety of
ailments that are secondary to
chromosomal damage so that's something
which is really nice let me ask a
question this kind of technology is
going to be some number of decades in
development how many people would like
to have this technology developed within
your lifetime hands okay so that
normally when people talk about time
horizons they talk about you know
developing technology within two years
or three years if they're really
ambitious they talk about a five year
time horizon the timer isin for
developing these kind of timer these
kinds of technologies I think can
arguably be pushed out to a decade or
two or even three so I think we should
take a longer view in terms of
developing these things then we have a
more advanced technology which is called
a vascular that's an artificial
circulatory system I won't go into this
in much detail but the idea basically is
you replace the circulatory system with
a container transport system
this container transport system allows
you to transport things throughout the
body much more rapidly much more
efficiently and in a way which is much
more impervious to a variety of problems
it's a much more complex application but
it uses molecular machines to allow
transport of a variety of circulating
hormones a variety of circulating
metabolites and have much greater
control over what it is that is
circulating throughout your body and it
has a number of benefits and advantages
it's a much later stage in the
development of medical and a devices but
it is definitely something that would be
advantageous so with that as a sort of a
background on sort of the general
concepts let's go to a change in medical
imperatives
all of Medicine is based on the concept
that your tissues must prepare
themselves all of today's medicine is
supporting your tissue all of today's
medicine is based on the assumption that
the doctor and all of our drugs and all
of our surgical tools support your
tissues because ultimately only your
tissues can repair themselves
we cannot repair the molecular machines
the biological molecular machines that
exist in your tissues we simply don't
have the tools the finest surgeons
scalpel at the scale of a cell at the
scale of the molecular machinery in the
cell at the scale of proteins is this
huge scythe more suitable to rip and
tear than it is to heal and cure so
today loss of cell function results in
inevitable cellular deterioration so the
imperative in today's medicine is it
function must be preserved but we are
looking at a future where we'll have
medical nano robots and if you have
medical nano robots non-functioning
structures can be repaired or replaced
if you no longer have the imperative
that forces you to maintain the function
cell function can be restored provided
that cells structure can be inferred if
the cell is no longer functioning if
it's no longer metabolizing we can still
restore it we can still repair it
so we shift the medical imperative you
now have an imperative that says
structure must be preserved this has a
huge impact on medicine it changes the
game completely it changes it so
dramatically that cryonics makes sense
because we can repair tissues that are
no longer functioning so there's an
introduction to this this whole concept
and how dramatically it changes the game
I thought I would let you hear the words
of a neuroscientist David Eagleman as he
was discussing cryonics on a recent
you
so that's David Eagleman and his
perspective on cryonics is hey there's
information in the brain and we can
preserve it the other perspective is
there's a structure that we can restore
and perhaps you could think about
cryonics this way cryonics well you're a
book and if you're a book should we burn
you or wait and see if we can read your
damaged pages and that's the perspective
more specifically cryonics can be looked
at this way cryonics you enter I think
I'm losing my let's see if I get my
microphone here back I think I'm okay
it's working good okay
cryonics involves coming in at 98.6 and
then you are cryopreserved
and what is cryopreservation
cryopreservation is cooling you to the
temperature of liquid nitrogen which is
minus 320 degrees Fahrenheit which is
very cold and then keeping you at the
temperature for some number of decades
until we develop this advanced
technology I've been talking about and
then reviving you using this advanced
technology then restoring you to 98.6
and then off you walk into the new world
so that's cryonics so the question is
what does this whole process look like
when we revive you and the answer is it
looks like something that involves this
very new process this nanomedicine
process and that's basically it that's
the overview of the process it involves
what are basically stainless steel
thermos bottles so those Bigfoot doers
you saw is a Bigfoot Dewar on the left
here that's over 10 feet tall is topped
off weekly and it takes over 3 months
before the liquid nitrogen boils off so
you can stay in liquid nitrogen
literally for thousands of years with no
significant change so let me just go
through a couple of basic facts crab
biologists are often asked how long
cells can remain viable at minus 196
degrees centigrade the temperature of
boiling liquid nitrogen which is the
usual cryogenic fluid the answer is
clear more than a thousand years so this
is the consensus in the field of
cryobiology
this is highly uncontroversial once
you're at the temperature of liquid
nitrogen nothing changed
getting to the temperature of liquid
nitrogen involves some controversy as to
terms of how much damage occurs but once
you're there nothing changes now I'd
like to do it just go through some of
the literature on the subject there
actually was a kidney that was
cryopreserved and which was then warmed
and which supported a rabbit as the sole
renal support as I believe the
expression and as a consequence there is
how does one put it experimental
evidence that the cryopreservation of a
complex mammalian organ is feasible
because it's been done so that's one of
the indicators that this whole process
is possible the other thing I'd like to
do is just take a look at the scientific
literature in cryonics you know one of
the things you see every once in a while
is people being skeptical about cryonics
and I've always been somewhat amused by
this because you get these marvelous
quotes from people saying it's it's all
nonsense that it's not scientific and
the fact of the matter is if you do a
literature search on cryonics and you
look for articles on cryonics you find
that the actual articles that address
cryonics are all favorable and I know
because I've looked at the literature on
cryonics you can do it yourself if you
want you can go to PubMed for example
and just type in cryonics and see what
you get and here's what what you get
when you do that the bold-faced articles
are the ones that are assessing cryonics
from a technical point of view
mine is the the forth bold article
technical feasibility of cryonics it's
an article I wrote the other three are
articles other people have written which
are addressing various aspects of
cryonics the pale articles the the light
gray articles are articles that are
discussing cryonics but aren't technical
assessments they tend to be things like
the legal aspects of cryonics or various
editorials on cryonics so if if someone
asks you what is the scientific
perspective on cryonics as concluded by
the scientific literature the answer is
the scientific perspective is that it's
likely to work this despite the fact
that if you go and pick a random MD or a
random cry biologist or a random person
in most fields they will inform you that
cryonics is crazy
which I find somewhat amusing so my
conclusion is that yeah chromatic sort
of work and if you ask people who are
critical of cryonics okay what is it
about cryonics that would make it
unlikely to work they start giving you
very weird answers we're dancers life it
shouldn't work it's not something we
should have working people are meant to
die I always find that more interesting
a surprising number of people when asked
about cryonics say that people should
die then you get the the line of answers
that say well you see if your crowd
preserved there is no continuity of
consciousness and I always get very
by that one because technically speaking
when you're asleep there's no continuity
of consciousness but in any event you
get interesting answers and you don't
get a technical answer that says it
won't work because and you don't get a
clear technical answer that provides a
clear technical reason okay so getting
back to the technical literature one of
the questions that crops up is hey if
you cry preserve someone what happens to
memory ok good solid technical question
ok so that's been an interesting
question and the answer is it looks like
it's preserved and the reason we think
it looks like it's preserved are a
variety of lines of argument on that the
simplest is lower animals have been cryo
preserved and revived and their memory
has been preserved so that's an article
that's been published recently the
persistence of long-term memory in
vitrified and revived C elegans ok
simple experimental result that says
yeah the memory system in C elegans was
preserved by vitrification you also can
get in direct lines of evidence by
looking at the mechanisms of long-term
memory and there's a lot of literature
on the mechanism of long-term memory and
asking the question ok here's what we
know about the mechanisms of long-term
memory here's what we know about the
process of cryopreservation wood the
mechanisms of long-term memory
be preserved by the process of
cryopreservation and the answer is yes
the other question you answer by the way
one of the reasons that I think most
biologists get confused about this is
most biologists think that function is
critical and if you crowd preserve
tissue it becomes non-functional
and most cryo biologists will
immediately say well it's not functional
therefore the person is dead but if you
don't think that the functional criteria
is appropriate if you think the
structural criteria is appropriate and
you think that an external repair
mechanism can be applied you don't care
about the functional criteria you care
about the structural criteria at which
point you say well yeah who cares if its
system is non-functional if the
information is there if the memory
systems are there and we can repair it
hey we're okay
alright MIT technology review the
science surrounding cryonics it a very
nice article in which they discussed a
variety of articles on the science of
cryonics and said some nice things there
was a recent article on aldehyde stable
cryopreservation which said we have a
mechanism of cryopreservation where they
did not demonstrate recovery of memory
functionally but they did demonstrate
beautiful pictures in other words there
are two ways of addressing this issue of
recovery of memory one way is to revive
the system and then functionally
interrogate the memory system you see
hey can you remember something the other
way is to cryopreserve the system and
then take pictures of the system and see
if all of the things that we believe are
required in the memory are there in the
pictures and if you have very nice
pictures then neuroscientists start to
become happy you start to see smiles on
the faces of the neuroscientist when
they look at the pictures so there was
recently a cryopreservation method that
was called aldehyde stabilized cry
repairs
vision that produces smiles on the faces
of neuroscientists and in fact it won
the brain preservation prize and there
was a lot of publicity about that in
fact it was an article in Scientific
American where the headline was Ken our
minds live forever
kenna brains connect them be preserved
forever in this article was by Michael
Shermer which was very interesting
because Michael Shermer had been quite
skeptical previously which I thought was
very amusing his attitude towards the
whole process has changed dramatically
over the past decade or so so anyway
what we've been seeing is an increase in
the number of articles that are in sort
of the standard scientific literature in
cryonics we've been seeing an increase
in acceptance of the possibility of
cryonics by sort of the standard
scientific community we've been seeing
an increasingly obvious failure of
critical articles in other words it's
becoming increasingly apparent that
there are no valid technical criticisms
of cryonics and by and large things have
just been moving in a very positive
direction which I find interesting ok so
how do you revive people well standard
nano robotic cryopreservation revivals
scenario involves using medical man
robots operating at very low temperature
liquid nitrogen temperature for example
and carrying out initial evaluation
repair at low temperature one of the
things cryo biologists are quick to
remind people of is that when you warm
tissue damage occurs so the response is
don't do that carry out the repairs at
low temperature and you avoid the
problems that would be caused by
rewarming the tissue and therefore you
can carry out repairs at low temperature
typical scenario would involve
excavation of the circulatory system
installation of that vascular that I
mentioned which can operate at low
temperature quite nicely repair damage
in the city
move the infrastructure and warm the
patient so that's a brief outline and
you complete structural analysis and
repair down to the level of molecules
and atoms it's possible in principle and
in practice it will be feasible in
coming decades and I think I'll skip
some of this stuff and go straight I'm
running out of time here so to leave
some time for Q&amp;amp;A I'll go over to some
of the financial aspects of the
organization Alcor has a patient care
trust which as of December 31st 2015 had
ten point eight million dollars and we
had 88 whole-body patients and 55 neuro
patients which is 115 thousand five
hundred and eight dollars per whole body
patient equivalent which counts each
neuro patient is one tenth of a
whole-body patient because they occupy
one tenth of the volume and the draw on
the PCT is very close to the two percent
target by which I mean that we got ten
million bucks and it only costs us two
percent of that ten million dot box to
care for the patients on an annual basis
okay so that works out pretty good we're
pretty happy with that so that's the
basic financials and we have a an
organizational structure we have a
self-perpetuating Board of nine members
and the board members are a longtime al
corps members and board members expect
their successors will provide preside
over their revival sometime in the
future so for example I'm a board member
I am on the AL core board
and I and my fellow board members try to
make decisions that will keep the
organization moving forward and we
select new board members and we select
new board members in the full knowledge
that the new board members will be
presiding over the organization when we
are in the Dewar so we are very careful
about selecting new board members
because we want them to keep the
organization on track when we are no
longer able to do so ourselves so that's
one of the basic functions of board
members so the basic question after all
of this is pretty simple
yeah you see people are reading the
question yeah in a very literal sense
cryonics is an experiment and we're
gonna get a reliable answer to the
question of whether cryonics works
sometime in the future you know come
back in a hundred years and we'll give
you a reliable answer because the
correct experiment I mean if you really
want to get a experimentally correct
answer scientifically proper and all
that does cryonics work well you conduct
an experiment you select n subjects you
cryo preserve them you wait until the
future technology is developed and then
you see if the technology of 2100 can
revive the cry of preserved patients I
mean that's the correct experiment to
conduct to see if we can revive prior
preserved patients now there's a slight
problem with that experiment and the
problem is we cannot get the results of
that experiment until 2100 so the choice
that you get to make is whether or not
you want to join the control group or
the experimental group now I will tell
you that the outcome for the control
group is known with a high degree of
confidence the outcome with the
experimental group well I have a number
of arguments that say that the outcome
with the experimental group is likely to
be favorable and I've presented those
arguments but we don't have the outcome
for the experimental group yet and you
get to make a decision as to whether you
want to join the experimental group or
the control group based on our current
state of knowledge
and if you join the experimental group
and it works then you get to wake up in
the future and you get to see the
advanced technology that we're talking
about and the advanced medical
technology and I can guarantee that if
you wake up in the future there will be
advanced medical technology because if
we do not have advanced medical
technology you will not wake up so there
will be advanced medical technology if
you wake up and you will have a long and
healthy life because there will be
advanced medical technology so that's
the story that's cryonics and that's the
choice that you get to make today and by
definition you do not get the results of
the experiment so you do not have the
experimental outcome with which to make
the choice you must use other data to
make that choice there is other data
available but you don't get the results
of the experiment you get to participate
in the experiment
that's what cryonics is all about ok so
let's move out
thanks for the talk
since I hold the microphone I like to
ask one first question yeah very brief
what kind of animal is C elegans in the
Sheila Khan's or the nematode is a
little small thing it's small enough so
you can actually cry out preserve it and
revive it and it's functional so you can
test its memory okay so basically one of
the requirements if you're going to do a
functional test of memory is you got to
be able to revive the organism in order
to test the memory sure so that's one of
the requirements all right hey questions
let's start over here yeah do you freeze
people like right after death or can you
take somebody who's near death and would
it be better to go ahead and sort of
execute them in a very way that is
cryogenically compatible does it costs
you know to have that done and how much
is that per year to maintain it you know
you pay for it yourself and how does
that work okay so what's it cost and the
answer is typically it's paid for with
life insurance the cost is 80,000 for
neuro which basically is you freeze the
brain and the brain comes in this nice
package called your skull which provides
protection so we take the whole head
that's 80,000 bucks for insurance or you
can have the whole body and that's
200,000 bucks and then there's annual
sort of fees and like I say typically
it's done with life insurance but you
know if you're not able to get life
insurance other arrangements can be made
trusts or whatever and as for the
legality we have been operating under a
very simple rule cryopreservation takes
place following legal death now as you
are probably
the law and reality go their separate
ways on many occasions and this is one
of them when you are declared legally
dead this can occur at a point when you
can in fact be revived this is the
purpose of DNR orders do not resuscitate
orders so if you are dying and you have
requested a DNR orders then at the point
in time when your heart stops then you
can be declared legally dead and the
cryopreservation process can begin even
if you could be revived so if you so the
most favorable circumstance for a
cryopreservation is you are dying you
know you're dying you have advanced
warning you go to a hospice near alcohol
a friendly hospice near Alcor and Alcor
is able to initiate the crowd
preservation protocol on declaration of
death which occurs with cessation of
heartbeat and the process rolls forward
and I won't go into the unfavorable
scenarios because they range from they
range
and then one gets into this whole debate
about how long can one go before it's
just not going to work and this gets
into a a whole set of discussions about
at what point is the memory in the brain
lost mostly people think or believe that
the brain is dead six minutes after its
circulation stops this is clearly false
because there has been experimental work
where cats for example have been revived
after an hour of cessation of
circulation and furthermore once you
shift from the functional criteria to
the structural criteria the requirement
that you revive the tissue simply
becomes irrelevant and you start to ask
questions like when is it that the
memory subsystems have become so damaged
that the memory structures themselves
lose coherence and there's a lot of
discussion about this but this seems to
be preserved for several hours before
there would be a substantial risk of
loss of the memory subsystems but
suffice to say there's a lot of debate
on that subject to questions what is you
mentioned neuro body versus whole body
freeze yes brings up the question of and
if I understood you correctly in neuro
body you only freeze the brain so what
good is a frozen brain if the rest of
the body deteriorates you replace it in
other words right now medical technology
is already talking about replacing a
liver or a heart or an arm or a leg and
if you simply continue with that trend
an existing medical technology you
rapidly reach a point where replacement
of
everything will be feasible the one
organ that we cannot replace is the
brain for obvious reasons so there's
really no reason to keep you know this
thing thing not just organs but skin
flesh everything I mean possum I'm
signed up neuro and then my other
question is when you mention the memory
question I was hoping that you would
also mention the follow-up question in
my mind which is decades later when you
come back life is not as you knew it
everything is going to be completely
different most importantly the people
you know so unless them unless the
people you know are also frozen along
with you and then all the changes in the
world it's kind of like I've heard that
when people are in coma which is only a
few weeks not decades when they wake up
they have complete confusion like they
don't know where they are but so what
about that aspect of it okay so thank
you one of the big reasons that people
say yeah I believe it'll work I don't
want to do it and in fact this is it's
surprisingly common and the core
arguments go as follows look if I'm
cryopreserve I'm gonna wake up in a
world where I'm useless I have no skills
I don't know the people my friends are
all dead
my family is all dead you know why
should I do this I mean life is bad
enough as it is and the response is
fairly simple there couple responses the
simplest is hey sign up your friends so
that's that's the first one for example
my wife is signed up and I have friends
in the cryonics community I have a lot
of friends in the Kranitz community so I
expect to wake up and hey I'll punch
friends in the chronic community
the other answer is that it's not going
to be that bad you know I mean a lot of
the people who are involved in cryonics
basically think that being alive is
better than being dead because being
alive is worth it even if you wind up
traveling to this new country called the
future it's better than not being alive
than not being not having that as an
opportunity in other words how do I put
it if you are traveling to a new country
you know it's it's sort of like hey do
you want to go to another country do you
want to go from Europe to America is
that worth it is it worth it to become a
pioneer in the country that's part of
the attitude and also part of the
attitude is just it's not going to be
that long in other words one of the
things going on is people think oh it's
going to be centuries before people are
awakened and I don't think it's gonna be
that long if you look at the rate at
which technology is advancing its
advancing fast enough that we're looking
at a few decades not a few centuries and
a period of a few decades all of your
younger friends are going to be there
first off I can go on but anyway if you
look in the Alcor website you'll find a
FAQ which addresses this quite directly
but your answer the answer is yeah a lot
of people are worried about that they
don't want to wake up in a future where
they don't have anything oh yes and the
other thing is there's also the Alcor
model trust so you can take your money
put it in the Alcor model trust and wake
up with a pot of money and the miracle
of compound interest will make you
wealthy
that's look seriously there are people
who have told me they don't want to be
Cryer preserved unless they can keep
their money they'd rather wake up they'd
rather die than wake up poor and that
that was the key thing that that was it
that was their concern two questions the
first is what happens supposedly that
alcohol get bankrupt what will happen
with all these bodies that are not
waiting to be resuscitated okay so the
risk
so basically financial stability okay a
couple of answers first alcoho around
since 1972 and we've managed to live
this long secondly we take that very
seriously as I say we've got a
self-perpetuating board to provide
organizational stability also the
patient care trust is established as a
separate trust and it has funds in it
which are purely for the maintenance of
the patients so that money that I
mentioned is not all of alcor's assets
that's just assets for maintenance of
the patients and that's a separate pot
of money which is purely dedicated to
keeping the patients car preserved and
that trust is a separate organization
with its own board and that trust if
anything happens to the rest of ELQ or
that trust can be broken off as a
separate organization and go on by
itself so the answer is yeah we worry
about that you know and we do the best
we can to make sure that no matter what
happens the patients will be revived if
you look at the our core mission
statement first item on the mission fish
mission statement is keep the patients
who are quiet preserved in crowd
preservation okay my second question is
instead of this very complex process to
repair a whole body because the body
will have a lot of things to repair
could we not preserve the DNA a complete
genome and then it working the facts a
lot you know yeah the problem is of
course this person will be born again
and will have to relearn we have no more
memory probably but that of my question
the answer is yeah if you want to do
that you don't need Alcorn it's a lot
cheaper to take a DNA sample and just
you know put it in an envelope or
wherever and just wait for the
technology to advance the point where
that DNA could be used to well we're
running out at will I do that and thanks
for a great talk and we'll can you can
sit at the speaker's table in the back
and people can ask anyone wants to ask
questions I'll be around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
