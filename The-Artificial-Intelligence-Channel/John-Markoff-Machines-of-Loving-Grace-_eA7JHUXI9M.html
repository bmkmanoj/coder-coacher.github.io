literary culture we hear from author
John Markoff talking about the history
between humans and computers in his book
machines of loving grace the name of the
book is machines of love and grace the
quest for common ground between humans
and robots and I got into this book I
guess there's a specific reason and a
broad reason you know I had been
reporting on AI and robotics in Silicon
Valley for the New York Times for a
decade and it just became an
increasingly hot hot topic the whole
world became interested in robotics and
AI and they were having an impact which
they hadn't had before you know the
field had always failed until it didn't
fail and it began to succeed and then
specifically I'd written an earlier book
called what the Dormouse said which was
about the prehistory of the personal
computer stuff that happened but around
right around Stanford between 65 and
1975 that led to the rise of the
personal computer industry and the and
the modern internet and while I was
doing that I noticed right at the dawn
of the era of interactive computing sort
of 1962 there were two labs that were
created equal distant from Stanford
actually one was started by a man by the
name of John McCarthy and he was a well
known computer scientist at that time
and he'd actually coined the term
artificial intelligence in 1956 and he
came to Stanford and he created the
Stanford artificial intelligence
laboratory in 1962 and his goal was to
create a set of technologies that could
essentially replace a human and he
actually got money from the Pentagon
from this think tank called the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency which
was sort of the blue sky think-tank for
doing advanced military research and in
his first sort of proposal he said he
thought he could create a thinking
machine in a decade it would take ten
years to build this what's called strong
AI so at the same time on the other side
of campus there was another laboratory
started roughly the same year by a guy
named a Douglas Engelbart you probably
know Engelbart because he invented the
computer mouse and his project was
called the augmentation Research Center
arc and his goal
named it intelligence augmentation so
rather than replace the human he wanted
to extend the human so on one side of
the campus you had AI and on the other
side of campus you had ia and I looked
at that and I thought it's a really
interesting dichotomy but it's also a
paradox because if you admit a human or
if you extend their capabilities you
need fewer humans and so the book is
really my effort to kind of square the
circle as much as it's possible I'm
actually sitting in front of a early
pioneering where they're called
platforms and its name is shaky it was
probably the world's it was the first
first truly autonomous robot it was
built to allow a new group of
researchers to do basic research in AI
and out of it came a whole host of the
technologies that almost everybody uses
today for example you can draw a line
from shakey and the original research
done beginning in the 1960s to
navigation systems though the kind of
stuff you use in your smartphone to to
navigate with and speech recognition
some of the first speech recognition
research was done on shaky as a control
mechanism and it it at the time it
didn't do much it would move a little
bit and then it would have to look at
the world that would move some more but
that's where it all started so the two
fields artificial intelligence and
intelligence augmentation have really
sort of gone their separate ways and I
think it's it's basically the reason
they haven't talked to each other is
they have different values the
engineering groups you know the AI guys
they're in love with robots they're in
love with these systems they're not
thinking deeply about the consequences
they just want to I mean they want to
perfect these systems and use them in
powerful ways and in some cases make
money from them but oftentimes they
simply want to push the technology as
far as they can and then don't think so
much of other consequences I've found
that the ayase iead developers really
think clearly about what the ethics are
of these systems and what the role of
people is and I think that's one of the
reasons there hasn't been a lot of
communication as engineering disciplines
they have entirely different values now
I think
I give the field a fair amount of credit
because as the machines have gotten more
powerful even these guys over on the AI
side have realized that something is
happening here that can really change
society and they're starting to think
about it and many of them are basically
realized and we have to make ethical
choices and they're making the right
ethical choices let me give you an
example such an Adela the CEO of
Microsoft has called his company an ia
an intelligence augmentation company he
wants to use he says AI technologies to
extend humans rather than replace them
what's interesting about the way AI has
sort of Excel it accelerated into our
lives is that it comes in at consumer
price points now and we don't even
notice it you know going back to 2010
2011 Steve Jobs put Siri at the very
heart of the iPhone and now hundreds of
millions of people use Siri you know
hundreds of millions of people use
Google home hundreds of millions of
people use Cortana hundreds of millions
of people use Amazon echo it just kind
of slipped in there and so that's one
example
ai is underneath the fact that machines
can increasingly listen to us and
understand there's software that Google
Offers for free called Google Translate
which allows you to give it a document
in any number of languages actually
Microsoft has a very similar service and
it'll give you back a pretty good
translation not perfect but good enough
which is really quite remarkable if you
get in a modern car you know I have a
two-year-old Volvo and it has a camera
in it that has AI technologies inside it
it is able to follow lands it's able to
make intelligent decisions comfort cars
like the Tesla have even more AI
software there is a company called
mobile AI which is an Israeli company
that supplies camera and sort of AI
technology to many car makers and over
the next five to ten years I mean cars
will increasingly I don't know if
they'll completely drive themselves but
they'll increasingly do things that will
perhaps protect us from our mistakes and
making cars safer now that would be an
example of an AI a use
of AI technologies to make us safer
rather than to replace us and you know
there's AI technologies and modern
cameras that basically sort of correct
and improve your your your foot your the
photograph you take without you even
knowing about it so everywhere even in
modern weapons increasingly AI
technology is being deployed there's a
sort of a growing debate in society over
whether AI systems should actually make
killing decisions but increasingly
they're going to be able to so the
entire range of human behavior is now
being used by these these these new
types of devices going back as far as
1950 when computers first came on the
scene about every decade and a half as a
society we start to get anxious about
our relationship to machines and it's
usually about whether they'll take our
jobs and clearly up until now most of
that automation has happened around
blue-collar jobs over a long period of
time going back you know farther than
the buggy whip machines have replaced
human labor what's interesting about
this next shift is that machines are
beginning to replace intellectual labor
and so people have seen this and over
the space of three or four years has
become an intense debate in our society
about the rate of change and some people
have made the case some computer
scientists believe that the technology
is moving quickly enough that people put
the date at 2045 that there will be
machines that are powerful enough to do
all human jobs I think that is wildly
optimistic
there are lots and lots of points at
which you can say machines are starting
to have an impact on society but and the
economy and on jobs but you have to
remember there was a well-known
economist whose name was John Maynard
Keynes who in the 1930s wrote about
automation and at that point he said
technology replaces jobs it doesn't
replace work and that's been true up
until now and some of the engineers are
saying this time it's going to be
different this time it's going to
replace work
I think that's yet to be proven one of
the really striking points that gets
overlooked at right is right now in
America there are a hundred and forty
five million people working that's more
people at work than have ever been at
work in America in history so we've had
30 years of personal computers and all
kinds of technology flowing into society
and there's still more jobs now when I
say that people come back and they say
yes but the labor participation rate is
declining that's the you know the
relationship to the site of the size of
the working population population and
the number of people at work and I've
looked at that very clearly and it's
true it's not at a historic low but it
is low but when you started to pick it
apart and say why is this happening why
are people dropping out of the workforce
it's not about technology it's mostly
about things like my generation the baby
boomers are starting to retire and there
are other reasons and it turns out that
technology is way down in the stack and
if you look around the rest of the
workforce that's basically what's
happening tasks are being taken over
machines jobs will change they won't go
away the question of whether we will be
transformed as as a species by a AI is
one that we need to start thinking about
right now Alan Kay is a computer
scientist who was one of the pioneers of
personal computing and I think he has a
really good way of thinking about the
way we might either shape or be shaped
in turn by these systems he talks about
the fact that you know we're
increasingly living with these
conversational systems that talk to us
and we have to make a decision about
whether we're going to be their masters
or whether they're gonna be our masters
or whether we're going to be partners
and I actually think that's a human
decision but increasingly we're going to
be talking to these machines and taking
advice from them one of the things I
actually worry about in terms of how
humanity might be changed by this
technology and relatively near-term I
come from a generation that didn't want
to take instructions from anyone and now
if you're downtown in San Francisco
where I live half of the people are
walking around the street looking at
their palm of their hand that's just
this now that can't be the end of
so something's got to come after that
but right now that's the way we
interface with these machines you know
there's a generation of young people who
take life instructions from the palm of
their hand they whether it's which
Korean food to order or who to marry and
I think that that is potentially an
insidious change right now for example
there's a kind of robotics called cloud
robotics one of the amazing things about
internet-connected robots is in
principle if you teach something to one
robot or one robot learn something they
can all know it instantly and humans
don't learn that way I mean you know
getting information from one human to
another takes a while but if we're all
interconnected I mean think about the
Obama administration in 2014 started
with something something called the
Obama brain initiative and the goal of
the Obama brain initiative is not only
to simultaneously read from a million
neurons in the human brain but it's to
be able to write to a million neurons in
the human brain and that raises the
possibility I mean it was it's been
totally science fiction but people are
starting basically to to touch on the
idea of control maybe it's passing
information but think about us all being
connected as a species much like the
robots I mean this this has been totally
in the realm of science fiction and now
we have to think about it and you know
the term cyborg a cyborg is a part human
part machine it was a term that was
coined by NASA in 1961 and you also seen
Star Trek probably and know about the
Borg resistance is futile you will be
assimilated I think we have to be really
careful about the way we connect this
technology to us if we're gonna offer
humans intellectual prostheses you know
things that it's important that they be
able to take them off because I think
our humanity is about our independence
and if we're all interconnected it might
be some better thing but it won't be
about humanity I got into this book
thinking about the question of what's
our relationship gonna be with these
machines a decade from now and how can
we make it a good one
not a destructive one and I came away
from the book thinking it's not an
open-and-shut case but the the reason to
be optimistic is it's a human choice how
we design these machines and I think we
can we can we can go in two different
directions you know we can make machines
that are incredibly destructive we can
make machines that surveil us take away
our privacy kill us or we can we can
build machines that that you know care
for aging humans help surgeons do a
better job help lawyers make better
decisions so there are two directions
and the reason I'm optimistic is it
comes down to a human choice and I think
that there's a possibility the machines
may make society much better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
