next keynote speaker and the story as
far as you're concerned begins in 2010
when three young entrepreneurs founded a
company which turned out to be at the
forefront of something that is going to
affect all of our futures artificial
intelligence the algorithms that enable
and develop machine learning deepmind
was bought by Google four years later
and now deep mind health is building
clinician led technology in Britain's
National Health Service it has led to
headlines such as Google wants your
health records but if we are serious
about harnessing the power of an era of
big data this is technology that we all
need to understand so please welcome the
co-founder of and head of applied
artificial intelligence at deep mind
Mustapha Suleiman
thank you very much good afternoon
welcome everybody so first and foremost
I wanted to extend our thanks and
gratitude for an incredible conference
so far to her Highness this has been a
really exceptional 48 hours for me to
hear about such a diverse range of
opportunities and challenges that we see
in the system today very excited to be
here so welcome and thank you to her
Highness over the last couple of days
we've heard an interesting range of
challenges at the conference of course
we're all very familiar with the
challenges of our aging population with
the fact that all of our patients now
are actually on multiple comorbidity
pathways simultaneously and all of these
treatments are increasingly complex and
increasingly expensive and of course the
patient let's not forget is at the heart
of all of this she's demanding more and
more she expects more and more as we
heard on the panel just now we have the
most cutting-edge beautiful applications
to share photos to play games to read up
about the news and yet when our
clinicians are saving lives on the front
line day-in day-out they're struggling
with technologies that are in some cases
decades old in some cases not used in
any other environment apart from health
care if you consider fax machines and
pages as we do in the near HS and of
course another one of the challenges
that's been raised is the opportunity to
really rethink the way that we do ethics
and governance her highness introduced
this question in the opening plenary and
so did that the professor Lord Ossie of
course this is something that's very
close to our heart a deep mind and
something we think very deeply about
many of the strategies that have been
raised are very interesting and very
novel being taken from other sectors
from other areas of academia and from
other applications of course our focus
is not just on hospitals or on direct
care in primary care but on healthy
populations as a whole on behavioral
insights what can all of these things
contribute to health care we're all very
familiar with the opportunities
presented by much more accountable care
organizations
of course the long-term promise that big
data and precision medicine offers us of
course we'd like to see much more
radical investment in the sector and
much more targeted return on investment
to our health professionals need much
more education and that's something that
we've heard about a great deal but I
want to argue to you today that in fact
all of these opportunities actually
require us to rethink the way that we
capture the data that describes the
complexity in our healthcare systems and
in doing so aim to capture both the
right piece of information at the right
time but also with the right underlying
serving infrastructure and that
technical question sits at the heart of
I think all of the future innovations
that we'll be able to make over the next
10 years but before I go on to talk
about that let me start by telling you a
little bit about deepmind technologies
the company that I started with my
friends about six years ago our mission
is to solve intelligence sounds pretty
grand sounds pretty wild in some ways
but in fact there's a very simple
intuition that sits behind this ambition
everything that you see around us our
culture our music our politics our
family structures everything is the
product of this intelligent brain that
sits on my head the wisdom that arises
our ability to make good predictions our
ability to simulate the world everything
is a product of our human intelligence
and so if we could somehow distill some
components that make up this
intelligence if we could take the
essence of our intelligence and distill
it into an algorithmic construct one
that can benefit from incredible access
to large data paralyzation from compute
perfect memory storage that we get in
silicon perhaps perhaps we could use
some of these insights to try and make
the world a better place and that's what
motivates my team our deepmind
technologies how can we use cutting edge
machine learning technologies to try and
tackle some of the world's most complex
problems and this is what really sets at
the heart of our mission general-purpose
learning algorithms these we believe
have the potential to learn directly
from lorenz raw
experience by interacting with the
environment not with brittle rules that
have been designed by intelligent human
beings that are very strict and rigid
and can't adapt over time and we do we'd
like to use these methods to try to
address some of the incredible array of
pressing social challenges which I think
are overwhelming us today we're running
up against hard limits whether it's in
climate or energy transportation systems
or the production of sustainable foods
that feed the world or of course our
healthcare systems groups of the
smartest experts in the world today are
struggling to tell us what we should do
to improve our system and I think it's
incumbent on us to try to use some of
these methods directly first and
foremost to solve some of these tough
social problems at a heart we're very
much a research organization but we've
tried to build over the years a hybrid
organization that takes the very best
from research with its focus in academia
as we do on very long term hard problems
and combine that with the principles
that you get in a company which make
companies often so effective the pace
the scale the agility the commercial
focus but all the while underpin that
with a social mission with the values
that you often find in the public sector
or in a charity and this is so important
to us being able to hire some of the
most talented researchers in the world
the best people want to work on the most
meaningful and socially impactful
problems and that's why we've managed to
bring together a group of 250 machine
learning and artificial intelligence
experts PhDs postdocs tenured professors
now the largest AI research lab in the
world so what does it look like to build
general-purpose learning systems at a
very high level
our agents learn knowledge through
interaction with the world so think of
an agent as a recommendation engine or
as a braking tool in a self-driving car
and the agent gets to operate in some
environment with respect to some goal
it's able to take a set of actions and
then it can observe how the environment
has consequently changed as a result of
its interaction it observes how the
state has changed
and it looked for reward in that
environment and in doing so just as we
do through behavioral learning or
reinforcement learning it learns to
build a model of what is rewarding or
effective in the world simply by
associating the past set of behaviors
that it led that it took in a run up to
some rewarding action with the
subsequent action that was rewarding in
the first place so we trained our agents
a couple years ago in what's called the
Atari testbed so these are the
old-school 1970s and 80s Atari games
that many of you might remember a
hundred or so different games and all
the agent is given is access to the very
raw environment so these are just the
pixel inputs and it's wired up to the
action buttons but it's not told
anything about what they do so all of
the knowledge and intelligence is learnt
purely from scratch with zero pre
programming so we don't tell the agent
anything about these environments and
the goal is simply to maximize the score
so the best way to think about this is
literally a robot standing in an arcade
looking at the screen watching the
frames as they come in 24 frames per
second and trying to associate the
pixels that it's seen in the last few
seconds with the rewarding action that
it stumbled across so let me show you a
video of what this looks like this was
running at one of our early agents and
playing the game of breakout the agent
controls the paddle at the bottom of the
screen that you'll see bouncing the ball
up and down to knock the bricks out and
this is after a hundred or so games when
the agents still pretty poor
it hasn't really learned much about the
game but after about 300 or so games the
agent has learned to move the paddle to
hit the ball in order to get score and
it does it pretty well this is basically
as good as its human I mean this is
pretty much better than me but the
interesting thing is after about 500 or
so games we thought we'd leave it
training and it learned a really
interesting strategy which was to make a
tunnel and funnel the ball up the back
to get maximum points with minimum
effort and this was really interesting
to us because it was the first time that
we had trained a system to teach itself
what was rewarding so in some sense the
system had discovered new knowledge that
we hadn't programmed into the system it
was teaching us that this was a
rewarding strategy and that was very
exciting to
we were lucky enough to be awarded with
a nature paper for this and we were made
the front cover which many of you will
know in the research world is the
highest accolade that all of our teams
are motivated to try and achieve earlier
this year we extended the same work to
the classic game of go you might be
familiar with 19 by 19 board with black
and white stones one of the most
complicated games that man has ever
invented far more complicated than chess
we trained a system earlier this year to
play against the world champion and
again we were lucky enough not only to
beat Lisa dole the world champion in
Korea in a live match watched by 280
million live viewers which is bigger
than the Super Bowl but we were also
lucky enough to get our second nature
front cover
so we demonstrated that these sorts of
methods are beginning to show signs of
promise and obviously we're very
motivated to try and find opportunities
to apply these things in the real world
and that was why we started deep mind
health it's quite incredible we looked
at many different application areas but
none seemed more sort of struggling with
technology than health care none seemed
to have a margin for improvement that
was as striking as the opportunities
that we see in health care and so let me
tell you a little bit about why I think
digitalization is absolutely critical
when it comes to delivering safe and
high-quality care this is an academic
overview a diagram a theoretical view of
what it looks like for a patient to go
through a single pathway in this case
the patient has been admitted with a
right upper quadrant pain and is
actually at risk of appendicitis and
these are all of the steps that need to
happen in the hospital in order for that
patient to be discharged in a healthy
way but of course the challenge is as
we've just heard on the panel that
patient also has all sorts of other
underlying comorbidities which lead to
other complications which mean that this
patient's actually on four or five
different pathways in this case they've
had an allergic reaction to the
antibiotics
they've also contracted an acute kidney
injury and there's been a wound
infection and so this doctor now has to
manage this patient with so many
different pathways but of course she's
also responsible for eight other
patients and each of those patients has
cause of different pathways and so our
doctor now has to think about the
clinical best practice for each one of
those pathways and coordinate the
intervention accordingly so all of the
steps need to be taken in sequence and
that's incredibly challenging for a
single human being to be able to
remember but of course she's not acting
alone she needs to coordinate with the
porter or the nurse or the consultant or
the manager and each one of these
members of staff needs to be called on
at the right time to participate in this
workflow and so trying to streamline
that process is incredibly complicated
if you think about it in theory there is
in fact an optimal way to carry out this
sequence of activity be initiating the
blood test at the right time or carrying
out a chest exam or changing that
cannula just at the right time and not
letting it be delayed and so the numbers
on the diagram that you can see here
actually reflect the theoretical optimal
pathway that this patient will these
number of patients should experience all
of this care and how to allocate the
tasks both to digital systems but also
to humans that carry out those tasks so
in some sense this gives you an
intuition for the complexity of the
system each one of these members of
staff is operating in a fairly
self-organizing way and in fact that
just represents what's happening within
the hospital ecosystem in the broader
ecosystem the patient is of course going
to the pharmacy going to the emergency
department visiting her general
practitioner and so on and so forth and
so when you actually map the entire
system complexity it's much easier to
see how overwhelming it is and I think
this is the role that artificial
intelligence has the potential to play
helping us to manage these complex
pathways but of course if you can't get
access to the data and if you can't
collect and store the data in exactly
the right format it becomes impossible
to intervene in the system in a coherent
way and so the primary thing that we're
working on at the moment is to expose
all of the data in an open and
interoperable standard and that should
mean that all of the databases that
exist behind the system speak the same
language we think that's what will
enable the transformative clinical
applications that the panel have talked
about front end apps that
under 30 small medium businesses are
developing but of course we also think
that it will enable us to deliver
actionable analytics and derive novel
insights and this we think will be
powered by advanced AI research so let
me tell you about some of these things
first of all how do we build an open
innovation ecosystem well in the
hospital today at least in the NHS there
are on average a hundred and sixty
different database languages many of
which don't speak to one another and so
it's really difficult to share data
across the entire system
it's very siloed and that means that
each clinician has to go and log on to a
very painful slow desktop based system
in order to access the different piece
of information they're looking for at
any given time and so what we've been
building is a unified health database
that it's that is exposed or represented
back to the various different
applications that we might like to build
so you can imagine through an open
application programming interface that
we can deliver cutting-edge clinical
systems a patient portal and in fact all
sorts of real-time analytics both for
research and for direct quality service
improvement so one of the clinical
systems that we've been developing using
this data infrastructure is called
streams let me tell you a little bit
about streams by introducing you to our
patient Robert Roberts just been
admitted yesterday with right upper
quadrant pain and here we see our nurse
Jamie on his mobile phone taking Roberts
temperature he's now able to enter
robert's temperature automatically on
his mobile device and immediately that
generates a raised news score an early
warning score that sends an alert to our
junior doctor in this case Sarah who
while she's on her way to visit Robert
knowing that this patient is in need of
urgent attention because he's at risk of
deterioration she's able to look him up
across the system and our system now
searches across any consultant or ward
or specialty and all she has to do is
type in Roberts name at the top and
she's presented with an overview the
first stream all of the urgent clinical
information that she needs to digest
before she sees Robert so in this case
we see that Robert has a number of
allergies what what has he been
mitad under for the current episode what
are his past diagnoses or past
procedures and what kind of medication
is he on and what of the past
observations have been so now Sara is
able to quickly glance through this
information and get a better sense for
Roberts condition if we swipe across to
a new stream of data we can now see in
chronological order every unit of
clinical activity that has happened to
Robert during his admission we can see
that in the last couple of minutes
Robert has just been activated for a
sepsis alert it looks like he's at risk
of an infection and we now have a 25
minute timer counting down to alert the
right clinical intervention if she
scrubs down she can see that his Bloods
have been ordered and they're just about
in the clinic if she swipes across she
can now see another stream of data a
different perspective here we have all
of the blood results the ureas
electrolytes here she's tapping on the
Kratt in value because she knows that's
important for acute kidney injury and
she can see that in the last 24 hours
he's actually seen a spike over the 24
hour baseline so she's been able to
review all of this information including
the radiology images where she's able to
pinch and zoom and share it with a
colleague and all of this information
has been digested before she actually
gets to Roberts bedside and now she can
spend much more time in direct care
examining him face to face now that
she's had an opportunity to do that she
can start to think about escalating his
care it looks like he has an
appendicitis so she immediately texts
her consultant surgeon and alerts in
this case Maddy her to the case and to
the condition whoo-hoo let's Sarah know
that she'll be coming down to review the
patient and in fact that we should
consider taking the follow-up action now
that Maddie's taken a look she can
actually prepare the patient for surgery
so here you can see at the top Maddy is
able to tap on prepare this patient for
surgery and immediately a whole series
of tasks are disseminated across the
organization whether it's to the porter
or to the healthcare assistant or to the
nurse or the junior doctor we know that
we have to make this patient nil by
mouth we have to get intravenous fluids
access we need to administer antibiotics
and we need to get sent could the
consent of the patient etc etc and now
after the patient's operation Maddy is
able to continue to
monitor the patient's condition and
review the observations in real-time and
continue to coordinate care but of
course all of this is happening at the
micro level a whole series of alerts and
notifications are sent to individual
clinicians so that they act at the right
time ideally preventatively but of
course what we really want to be able to
do is better manage that pathway how do
we program that pathway so that we can
send a whole series of alerts to the
different members of staff at the right
time
here we see a desktop-based view that a
senior clinician would use to set up a
series of automatic blood tests
automatic reminders to trigger imaging
for example to allocate and assign
responsibility to various different
members of staff so the right person
takes responsibility we know that the
vast majority of patient error actually
happens because of poor coordination
when a met when a patient slipped
through the net someone's forgotten
about them and so what we really want to
do is set in place a safety net that
sits underneath that patient pathway so
that the right person is able to catch
the patient at the right time in advance
and of course we're able to provide the
appropriate guidelines or clinical best
practice as prompts and reminders to the
members of staff when they're carrying
out a particular procedure and of course
this represents a great opportunity for
machine learning systems some of which
we're beginning to start work on for the
future but underneath all of this sits
the conventional analytics dashboard so
here we have a view of all of the wards
in the hospital we can look at all sorts
of useful information like the number of
beds we have available the number of
staff we have on-call how many early
warning alert alerts have been triggered
how many tasks are open how many
cannulas need to be replaced we can take
a different stream of data not just
looking at the ward we can look at a
specific condition in this case we're
going to look at appendicitis which our
patients do I have in admission today
who do have appendicitis do they need
their lines changing have they been
taken care of at the right time which
prescriptions have been allocated so now
we have a meta view by condition or by
ward or by specialty or by member of
staff this is the data that we need to
do quality service improvement and of
course that's exactly the kind of
information that's going to be
interesting to the hospital CEO am i
hitting my targets how many beds do I
have
available how do I redirect my
ambulances to my colleagues and this for
a minister perspective I think is
exactly the sort of thing that we need
to build in order to deliver an
integrated care model where we can
actually see how all of our hospitals
are performing in aggregate where our
ambulances are what's happening at
primary care and so on and so forth
artificial intelligence is obviously why
we founded the company and that's what
we're really motivated by so let me tell
you very briefly about some of the
things that we're working on to apply
machine learning today one of the big
challenges that we face in the UK is a
lack of radiologists and so we've been
working very closely with the Moorfields
Eye Hospital to see if we can help to
make sense of some of their
three-dimensional eye scans in this case
what you're seeing here is an Oct scan
optimal coherence tomography it creates
a very rich picture of the pathologies
that you may have in your eye and we're
particularly interested in macular
degeneration and diabetes one of the
challenges as many of you will be aware
is that something like 30% also in the
UK and in the u.s. of our population are
actually obese and if you're a bit if
you are obese then you're massively more
at risk of diabetes and if you do have
diabetes in fact you're 25 times more
likely to suffer some kind of sight loss
and yet the remarkable thing with this
sort of sight loss is that 98 percent of
the most severe forms of sight loss are
in fact entirely preventable if you can
get in there as early as possible so
we're training machine learning systems
to accurately identify where in the
image the particular diagnosis actually
sits and in doing so we can actually do
that in seconds rather than hours or in
some cases days and we can send an alert
to the right clinician to contact the
patient and provide sight saving
preventative treatment in the form of
injections and other forms of early
intervention another example that we're
working on this time with the University
College London Hospital is that of CT
scans it takes a super qualified
intelligent human being on the order of
4 to 5 hours to prepare a patient for
radiotherapy treatment in this case
they'll actually sit at a computer with
a pen and label up each one of the
pixels or voxels
where the radiotherapy needs to be
targeted this is a very painful treat
process that takes a very long time and
in fact in the UK there's actually a
backlog because we don't have enough
clinicians we don't have enough
radiologists there's a approximately a
10x shortage of radiologists in the
system so if we can do this in mere
seconds then we can provide a prompt or
an aide to the clinician to then
validate the labeled areas that we
provide to that radiographer and
therefore speed up the process in
preparation for radiotherapy planning so
in summary I sort of wanted to leave you
with the idea that we're very much
committed to working on some of the
toughest global problems we build
transformational machine learning
technologies and we've made incredible
progress across the field over the last
six years or so but we really recognize
the obligation and responsibility that
we have on us to steward the
technologies ethically and we invite
everybody to contribute to that
challenge and support us hold us
accountable and help us to do a better
job of effectively improving the systems
that we all care about we recognize also
that we'll need to be as innovative and
a speedy with our governance as we have
been so far with our technologies and
we're doing a number of things that you
can see on our website that are trying
to push the envelope on this if you like
and trying to invent novel forms of
governance that can respond quickly to
the kinds of technologies that we're
developing thank you very much for your
time I appreciate it very much
Thank You mr. buck may I ask you one
thing before you go it is such an
exciting future that you're talking
about and yet in many hospitals the
notes are still on paper rather than
electronic it feels a world away yeah I
think that's a really really good
question particularly in the UK I think
much of the incredible work that our
frontline nurses and doctors do is using
pen and paper and in fact pen and paper
is what's responsible for you know
patients slipping through the cracks
care not being coordinated on time notes
being lost and the key issue is that we
aren't able to act preventively when
we're using paper because that only the
individuals who go and access that paper
can actually do something about it what
we want to do is to digitize the system
so that we can act proactively and get
in there as early as but you'd have to
do the building blocks of all the
individual systems before you can really
you know achieve the full potential of
it absolutely their enormous number of
really innovative developers out there
and we want to do our best to make the
data available to as many other
developers as possible so that the
hospital commissioners can actually
create a competitive a genuinely
competitive ecosystem around the
development of these new technologies
okay it is very exciting thank you so
much your work mr. Fussell Avari thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
