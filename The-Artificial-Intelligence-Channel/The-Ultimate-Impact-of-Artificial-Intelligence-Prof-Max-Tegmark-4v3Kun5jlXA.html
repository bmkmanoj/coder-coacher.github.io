back here in Canada the only country on
earth that has the same religion as my
native Sweden ice hockey it was quite
the stunner to open this tote bag and
see whoa my book there so we've had a
lot of fascinating discussion at this
conference about the impact on AI mainly
focused on the relatively near term I
want to take your big step back here is
the book title suggests talking about
the ultimate impact on on life itself
from artificial intelligence let's begin
here
let's see if we can get some audio as
well channel ignition sequence so raise
your hand if you actually saw the launch
of Apollo 11 when it happened yeah that
was pretty amazing in this mission was
not only a success but also inspiring
showing that when we humans manage
technology wisely we can do things their
ancestors could only beam up so in this
spirit I want to spend the rest of my
time here talking about another journey
powered by a technology even more
powerful than rocket engines and where
the passengers aren't just three
astronauts but all of humanity so let's
talk about our collective journey into
the future with artificial intelligence
my friend then my co-founder a young
Colin who helped give you Skype likes to
emphasize that it's crucial not just to
make technology powerful but also to
figure out how to control it
and to figure out where we want to go
with it and those are gonna be the
themes of my talk I said that we're
gonna take a step back here's a big one
during the past 13.8 billion years our
universe is transformed not just from
hot to cold from dense more rarefied but
most importantly from really boring to
really interesting even coming alive
where beings feeling pleasure and pain
and pondering the mysteries of AI here
in Toronto today this picture is
humbling in the sense that even though
Toronto and this conference is very
action-packed on the grand scheme of
things life is still and almost
imperceptibly small perturbation on a
seemingly lifeless universe right but
this picture is also inspiring because
we realize now the technology and the
laws of physics tell us that it doesn't
have to remain that way at all in fact
by explaining in chapter 6 of my book I
feel that science fiction writers even
have still underestimated how easy it
actually is for life to spread
throughout the cosmos because they
weren't taking artificial intelligence
into account when they wrote all these
and so there's a huge upside not just on
earth but also on the cosmic scale for
life to flourish in the future if we get
it right with AI I called the earliest
life 1.0 because it was really dumb
couldn't learn anything in this lifetime
I call us 2.0 because we can learn which
in nerdy eh speak will be expressed as
that we can design our own software if I
want to have legal skills I can decide
to go to law school and upload all these
knowledge modules and now I can do other
things like people I know which can
design not just at software but also
it's hardware of course doesn't exist
yet but we seem to gradually be heading
a little bit in that direction we can
get artificial knees cochlear implants
pacemakers and stuff like that so coming
back to rocket metaphor let's start by
talking about the growing power of AI
you've had many wonderful examples of
this here so let me just bliss through
it at a very fine level I define
intelligence simply as the ability to
accomplish complex goals the ability to
accomplish complex goals I give this
very broad definition because I really
hate carbon chauvinism this attitude
that you can only be intelligent or
conscious or whatever if you're made of
carbon atoms I want to give this broad
definition so that it includes all forms
of both biological and artificial
intelligence when a guy Kasparov got his
posterior kicked by IBM's deep blue some
two decades ago right the intelligence
of this machine was programmed in by
humans who knew how to play chess and
the computer one mainly because it could
think faster and remember more than he
could in contrast when google deepmind
dethroned humanity and go it was very
different to year two weeks ago we saw
how alphago zero
able to blow away three thousand years
of human acquired go wisdom in three
days without any human input whatsoever
because the machine just figured it all
out
learned it for itself a nice
illustration of deep reinforcement
learning in action is mind agent
learning to play the game of breakout
and what I find so fascinating here is
you have to remember this is a very very
simple system neural network which has
no idea what a paddle is or a ball is or
anything if what a game is it just gets
sent sent as input a bunch of numbers
just tell you what the colors are of
each pixel on the screen and sends
random commands without knowing what
they do try to maximize its score and
eventually starts getting better it's
already better than I am doesn't miss
the ball hardly ever and when you keep
training it eventually it actually
starts to exhibit what I feel seems kind
of intelligent that discovers a strategy
in particular that the folks who did
this if you believe mine weren't aware
of that if you keep aiming the ball at
the at the corner can drill a hole there
and once you've done that you just
brutally rake in the points and look how
it just ruthlessly keeps exploiting this
over and over and over again again
completely tabula rasa right knowing
nothing going into it and now you might
say well this game world of go or or
breakout here is way simpler than the
real world so how far can you push these
sort of techniques well here's another
thing that big mind did that last summer
trying to teach robots to walk and this
will happen here again had no idea what
walking was the members
videos of walking or the concept of
walking it just sends random commands to
determine the angles of all the joints
here and was rewarded every time this
thing moved a little bit forward the
hang of it
rediscovering all sorts of ways of
locomotion not just humanoid figures but
all sorts of other shapes so this sort
of progress really begs the question
right how far can this go if you're a
robot or any high is that the pole all
of them your world can be thought of as
a game as well right you think of the
stock market as a game and in many ways
machines already outplay us there how
far can we go I like to think about it
in terms of this landscape of skills
this is a picture I drew it but inspired
by a Hans Moravec look and the elevation
here represents how hard each task is
for a machine to do the sea level
represents how good machines are at
doing it right now so the progress in AI
we've heard about it this conference
means that there's a global warming
going on here in this task space where
the sea levels are rising right so
obviously we don't want to have comment'
our kids that they look for jobs right
on the shoreline because they're gonna
be the first to be flooded and the
question is what's gonna happen
eventually some people including many AI
researchers I very much respect think
we're never gonna succeed with AI of
replicating all human skills and some
mountain peaks here will forever be
above the water but a lot of other
researchers are also respect where do
you think they I will succeed and
eventually and everything is gonna get
flooded in fact this is a more common
view in the polls that have happened
where most people but the median answer
for for when machines will be able to do
everything we can sense the be maybe few
decades from now so more likely than not
it's gonna get flooded now where does
this leave us well if there is even a
serious possibility of this we have to
talk of course about all I want to steer
this technology to make sure we're
excited about where where this takes us
so let's talk about control of AI
steering things in the right direction
it was the help of this that we found
that the future of life Institute that
was mentioned in in
my introduction and you see we have the
word steer here even in our mission
statement we are optimistic that we
humans can create a inspiring future
with technology it's long as you win
this race between the growing power of
technology and the growing wisdom with
which we manage our technology but we do
feel very strongly that this is a big
gift so to win this wisdom race we
actually really have to change
strategies in the past we've always used
a strategy of learning from mistakes we
invented fire screwed up a bunch of
times invented the fire extinguisher we
invented the automobile
oopsie a bunch of times invented the
seatbelt the airbag the traffic lights
and so on and now traffic in Toronto is
pretty safe but needless to say as
science progresses and technology
progresses it's going to get evermore
powerful and at some point it's gonna
cross that obvious threshold where one
mistake is one too many right we don't
want to have a little oopsie and say oh
we accidentally had a dip in global
nuclear war Babel in Russia because you
screwed up but that's okay we'll learn
from his face and be a little more
careful next time now it's much better
if you have a really powerful technology
in particular a superhuman AI to plan
ahead and get things right the first
time and work really hard for this some
people tell me max don't talk like this
this is a Luddites terrible dream I say
this is mongering this is safety
engineering why was it that the Apollo
11 mission to the moon worked that I
showed you in the beginning it's because
NASA very systematically thought through
everything that could go wrong when you
put three dudes on top of 100 meter tall
vehicle full of highly flammable rocket
fuel and launched them into somewhere
where no one could help them there was a
lot of stuff that could go wrong does
that mean the master was doing scare
mongering no that was a safety
engineering that led to the success of
the mission and that's exactly how I
would like us to approach the future of
AI as well and really think things
through and get things right because if
we do the upside is enormous
very inspiring one of
things we've done with the future of
life is do this organize conferences to
help bring the anti community together
and think really hard not just about how
to make the technology more powerful and
a bit more powerful rocket engines
metaphorically but also how to develop
this wisdom to steer the technology well
and the output of our last conference we
had this year in the Silla mark was
these 23 Asilomar principles which have
been signed now by over a thousand AI
researchers around the world many of
whom are in this room here and many of
the leaders of the other top companies
for example in AI and I want to spend a
third few minutes highlighting four
takeaways of this that I feel are really
worth remembering
number one ban lethal autonomous weapons
all Sciences can be used either for new
ways of helping people or any ways of
harming people if you ask somebody today
what they associate biology whether they
will be much more likely to save new
medicines and cures rather than buy
weapons right why is that
it's because the biologists actually as
a community came out real strong and
said we want an international treaty
against bioweapons and they succeeded
and and they're very happy for that
mouth is almost all the funding into
biology is actually there's much more
funding going into new medicines than
bioweapons today similarly the chemists
pushed really hard as a scientific
community to get an international ban on
chemical weapons and even though there's
been a lot of cheating on it
it's succeeded Ramat spectacularly and
stigmatizing chemical weapons the point
that Assad in Syria even gave him up on
apparently did not get invaded right and
the AI community today this is quite
strongly saying we've met they simply
want a high in the future to be known
mainly as new solutions not new ways of
just anonymously killing people really
cheaply and creating a really a race to
the bottom for AI so that's one another
one is to try to ensure that vast surge
in wealth the growth of the total
economic pie can be used to make
everybody
better off so that we end up in the
future that looks more like this on the
right and that on the left and it's
really particularly to talk about this
in Canada where there seems to be a lot
more sympathy for this kind of thinking
than the south of the border that the
role of society is actually partly to
actually look after people and make sure
everybody gets better off and I was
particularly heartened that even Justin
Trudeau himself came here today third to
win this wisdom race we really need to
invest in AI safety research there's a
lot of tough technical questions we need
to solve raise your hand if your laptop
ever crashed how did that feel the maybe
annoying yeah but that's probably not
the word you would use if it was the
self-driving car you were driving down
the freeway on or if it was the software
controlling your power grid or your or
the US nuclear arsenal or something like
this right there and unless we can
really get our act together with both
robustness in general and also cyber
security all that's awesome technology
we're building to be half than used
against us or just malfunction and screw
us over so this is something that the
short term which I think we've been
waking flippant about and they're also a
number of really interesting a safety
research questions they're crucial in
the longer term let me show you a very
short video on this topic super
intelligence related safety research
will artificial intelligence ever
replace humans is a hotly debated
question these days
some people claim computers will
eventually gain super intelligence be
able to outperform humans on any task
and destroy humanity other people say
don't worry AI will just be another tool
we can use some control like our current
computers so we've got physicists and AI
researcher max tegmark back again to
share with us the collective takeaways
from the recent Asilomar conference on
the future of AI that he helped organize
and he's going to help separate AI myths
from AI facts
hello first off max machines including
computers have long been better than us
at many tasks like arithmetic or weaving
but those are often repetitive and
mechanical operations so why shouldn't I
believe that there are some things that
are simply impossible for machines to do
as well as people say making many
physics videos or consoling a friend
well we've traditionally thought of
intelligence is something mysterious
that can only exist in biological
organisms especially humans but from the
perspective of modern physical science
intelligence is simply a particular kind
of information processing and reacting
performed by a particular arrangement of
elementary particles moving around and
there's no law on physics that says it's
impossible to do that kind of
information processing better than
humans already do it's not a stretch to
say that earthworms process information
better than rocks and humans better than
earthworms and in many areas machines
are already better than humans this
suggests that we've likely only seen the
tip of the intelligence iceberg and they
were on track to unlock the full
intelligence that's latent the nature
and use it to help humanity flourish or
flounder so how do you keep ourselves on
the right side of the flourish or
flounder balance what if anything should
we really be concerned about with super
intelligent AI heroes what has many
caught by researchers concerned not
machines or computers turning evil but
something was settled super intelligence
that simply doesn't share our goals if
heat-seeking missile is homing in on you
you probably wouldn't think no need to
worry it's not evil it's just following
its programming know what matters to you
is what the heat-seeking missile does
and how well it does it not what it's
feeling or whether has feelings at all
the real worry isn't malevolence but
competence super intelligent AI is by
definition very good at attaining its
goals so the most important thing for us
to do is to ensure that its goals are
aligned with ours as an analogy humans
are more intelligence and competent than
ants and there
we want to build a hydroelectric dam
where there happens to be an anthill
there may be no malevolence involved but
well too bad for the ants cats and dogs
on the other hand have done a great job
of aligning their goals with the goals
of humans I mean even though I'm a
physicist that I can't help think
kittens are the cutest particle
arrangements in our universe if we build
super intelligence we'd be better off in
the position of cats and dogs than ants
or better yet we'll figure out how to
ensure that AI adopts our goals rather
than the other way around and when
exactly is super intelligence going to
arrive when do we need to start
panicking
first of all Henry super intelligence
doesn't have to be something negative in
fact you forget it right I might become
the best thing ever to happen to
humanity everything I love about
civilization is the product of
intelligence so if AI amplifies our
collective intelligence enough to solve
today's and tomorrow's greatest problems
humanity might flourish like never
before
second most AI researchers think super
intelligence is at least decades away
but the research needed to ensure that
it remains beneficial to humanity rather
than harmful might also take decades so
we need to start right away for example
we need to figure out how to ensure
machines to learn the collective goals
of humanity adopt these goals for
themselves and retain the goals as they
get ever smarter and what about when our
goals disagree should we vote on what
the machines goals should be should we
do whatever the president wants whatever
the creator of a super intelligence
wants but the AI the sign in a very real
way in the question of how to live with
super intelligence is a question of what
sort of future we want to create for
Humanity which obviously shouldn't just
be left to AI researchers as caring and
then socially skilled as we are so that
leads to the very final point I want to
make we really need to think about what
sort of future we want why did the
rocket launch that we opened this with
happened in the first place it was
because of the positive vision of the
future JFK said we do this the other
things not because it is easy but they
cause it is hard I call a God you know
and this galvanized people and
transformed America from a little bit of
a tech backwater if you're really a
leader in
and technology because people had an
exciting shared positive vision right I
don't think at students walking into my
office at MIT for career advice I always
ask them where do you want to be in the
future and if she says to me oh maybe
I'll be in a cancer ward maybe I will
have been run over by a bus
that's a terrible approach to Career
Planning I want you to come in with fire
in your eyes and say this is where I
want to be then we can do this kind of
safety engineering sort of discussion
and figure out what are the obstacles
that have to be overcome to get there
but you need to have that positive
vision but we as humans behave just like
this fictitious silly students I went
and saw the new Blade Runner movie with
my life there the other day just yet
another this topic this top dystopian
vision of the future
almost everything we see in media where
people try to envision the future is
dystopian we need to envision positive
futures where we want to go with this
and I'm not just talking about saying
out cure or disease X grow GDP by 4%
I mean feeling more detailed visions
that's why in my end of the chapter of
my book I put a lot of energy into the
specimen exploring a wide range of
possible societies you could have have
these sort of conversations about where
you want to go because if we can develop
really positive visions of where we can
actually end up with AI we're much more
likely to get there and that'll be
awesome thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
