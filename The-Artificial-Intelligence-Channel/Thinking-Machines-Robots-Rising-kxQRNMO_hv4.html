Danijela ruse will be our first speaker
than Moshe Party and then Manuela Filosa
hello again so I'm just going very fast
and you had me this morning for quite a
long time so as a roboticist I really
would like to encourage all of us to
think of machines as tools incredibly
powerful tools but nevertheless just
tools and I would like to make the
observation that people just assume that
robots will put people out of jobs and I
would like to pose the question of what
if robots could actually make many more
jobs and better jobs and in particular I
believe that by combining robot robots
with AI we can give factory workers
extraordinarily fine granularity for
controlling what they do in in factories
and we might be able to move
manufacturing and production from
today's model where we have fixed
products that get designed with fixed
templates and get manufactured offshore
to a situation where we have templated
products where the products can be
customized and designed in your own home
and fabricated locally that's one point
my second point about robots is that we
already see the benefit of bringing
robots to people so we are all betting
on a future with autonomous cars
I believe that autonomous cars will be
most valuable in low complexity
environments in on private ways the
technology is ready to be deployed in
environments like that and if we could
put autonomous robots in in our
retirement communities for example our
parents and grandparents will have much
higher quality of life in their
retirement now the same technology for
autonomous driving can also mapped on it
can also be mapped onto wearables and
with that we can enable blind people and
people who are visually impaired to
experience the world in richer ways and
possibly even enter the workforce
at different levels and they're able to
do now and I'm but of course there are a
lot of challenges and so the technology
is actually not ready for primetime so
in particular I would like us all to
remember that crunching large data is
not knowledge making complex
computations is not autonomy correctness
is exponentially harder as we get closer
and closer to the 99.9 percent limit we
want also data crunching is easier than
perception which is easier than
perception class action which makes
robots and finally tasks with physical
contact are much harder than tasks like
driving or like flying or swimming where
you are not in contact with the world so
with this I would like to leave you with
a quote from 1962 that still rings true
to me thank you okay so we hope they're
an amazing lunch talk about in China but
we had little we had little discussion
of what are going to be the societal
consequences of such massive deployment
of Technology and I must confess that
for the sales 30 years of Melissa's
career there was my modus operandi I'll
develop technology other people should
worry about the consequences but five
years ago about five years ago I decided
maybe I have a moral responsibility to
to what the consequences are and so we
hear a lot now AI there is almost no day
we don't hear something about the in the
newspapers in the media about AI threats
a issues so let me try to put kind of a
taxonomy on it the one you hear
unfortunately the most about is
singularity in super intelligence and of
course I can spend a lot of time just
talking about this but I rather not
other than put an epitaph epitaph I just
read recently describing super
intelligence is the idea that it smarts
people and I'll say no more about it
but are some very very serious issue
that I think we need to face and
probably the biggest one is what kind of
decisions are we willing to delegate to
machines so it comes up for example the
issue of lethal autonomous weapon
systems ok should we have as they call a
killer robots that stay that's the other
phrase you hear should we autonomous
weapon system people talk about robot
judges maybe human judges are flawed
should we delegate judging to machines
it's a big decision they have to be made
based on not just issue effectiveness
but also on philosophical issues at the
same time I will be very clear that some
some there will be the Y deployment of
AI technology and we've already heard
some reference to the fact that we need
to think about transparency and explain
ability accountability verifiability a
general chess talk about fairness which
i think is equally important issue and
there's another party issue people
forget this machine do not operate in
vacuum they operate in human society and
we have much less control over the human
part than we have over they over the
machine part so you can think of what
happened in past 10 years with massive
deployment of AI Google and Facebook
deployed the eye on a massive scale and
I would say the first round of
algorithms versus humans humans want and
we have seen the recent later how
basically people who wanted to figure
out how to manipulate AI systems and a
final point is about the impact on the
labor market which is the major topic of
a of this meeting so I'm going to put
one two slides about just numbers this
is not about the future the future is
here this is labor force participation
this is how many people participate in
labor force this refers to men who
affected more more by with women the
pictures more complicated because 1960s
first of all the end of the workforce
and you can see here that men have been
dropping out of the workforce now for 50
years so this is not some air in the
future this is about technology today
and it gets even scarier when you go and
you look at it by education and you see
the people whose bachelor degree also
have been affected but the group has
been most affected a
people with high school degree or less
and dare to talk we're talking about
sixty seventy percent of the population
so if you look at it you realize it
means that right now
one in five men with high school degree
or less is not working is not in not or
not working not in the workforce and if
this is not a crisis I don't know what
the crisis is thank you very much so I'm
just going to tell a little bit about
something that not many people talk
about which is mobile robots robots that
move around so this concept of having
mobile that room move around and I think
that none of us has seen this morning
any robot moving around in our spaces I
walked into MIT could not see any robot
I came down here no robots anywhere many
cell phones for sure many laptops but no
robot anywhere and we have been trying
to understand how to put together this
sensing these thinking and this
actuation for an eternity I've been at
Carnegie Mellon University for thirty
years and I still work on this problem
of putting these all together usually in
my talks when I talk I assign as the
homework if you do not have by yoruba
URL I mean I don't have a an interest on
Roomba but there is like Rob Brooks
there then you have to say I always say
buy your Roomba if you don't have you
pay the $900 you buy the best Roomba you
can control it from your cell phone it
cleans any time you're home but it moves
it's remarkable to have something that
moves by itself your refrigerators don't
move by themselves your cell phones
doesn't move by theirselves your cars
don't move by themselves yet but the
Roombas do and so that's very important
to get that experience for your children
for yourself to understand that AI can
be in a mobile platform so we have been
trying to do this at Carnegie Mellon
yesterday this cobalt robots up there
who are navigating in the building
distributing candy as a Halloween treat
and by themselves I tell you I was in my
office all day and these things were
roaming around thought stopping at the
right place telling
people would you like some candy yeah
thank you
happy Halloween bye-bye and it was a
robot it was not a person it was a robot
with its perception with its
decision-making where should I go how
long should I wait at it people opens
the door and it's action
it actually was moving down the
corridors and it came back when it
needed to be charged fantastic so we
have to get to the AI level to AI and
robotics at that level so this is what I
pursue and I want to just say two things
it seems that we are always thinking
that robots will be these fantastic
creatures that can do it all we have to
acknowledge that robots like humans you
and me have limitations and will always
have limitations they will not be able
to process all the image they might not
be able to open all the doors of the
buildings they might not be able to
understand everything you say that's
perfectly fine but I just think that you
need to accept that they can ask for
help they can learn and they can be
instructed so it's another paradigm is
this thing that these creatures will be
around and will be able to interact with
that at that level
finally in these kind of like world in
which AI will not just be on our cell
phone or our cameras but will be also on
the mobile creatures around us we have a
challenge having these humans interact
with these AI systems in a new way this
is AI systems when they stop in front of
my office I want to know where did you
come from I mean the it arrives in front
of my office what I'm going to do next
why are you late and so we need from an
AI point of view from a research point
of view to have this autonomy which we
cannot follow we describe to us we be
verbalized being questioned how often
did you do this how many people were in
the kitchen all sorts of questions that
we might have about our physical space
and this is what we have introduced
different levels of explanation to
enable this a giant robots to verbalize
their experience so that these humans
and these AI robots can interact better
this is great let's see how much time
they're giving us we're watching the
number go up
okay that's great so was it let me now
remember help remember at the time was
it 2015 when the DARPA autonomous robot
Grand Challenge rescue robot ground it
was had been two years now two and a
half years so what struck me about that
Grand Challenge was that all of the
robots were teleoperated there that
there was there was you know a year
before that Andy Rubin who was Google
robot assisted that Pied told me he
planned to have his Japanese subsidiary
at the point where he would be able to
push a button and it would complete all
of the tasks and of course that Japanese
subsidiary didn't enter they became a
supplier to the other component people
but so if that was ground truth two
years ago that all of the entrants were
teleoperated have we made meaningful
progress since then about Tom I thought
I I believe we have made tremendous
progress i I will before going to the
DARPA challenge I would like to talk
about driving because we have much more
history for driving the first autonomous
car was in in Germany I believe in 87
and then no hands that no hands across
America project was in 1995 and then we
had the the DARPA challenge project in
2004 and 2007 it really does take a very
long time for for the robotic technology
to mature to a point where we can get it
out of the lab so I would say that since
2015 we have tremendous progress we made
tremendous progress in a number of ways
so we have seen a lot of advances on
soft robotics and with soft robotics
manipulation interaction with the world
gets easier because the soft bodies are
much more tolerant of uncertainty and
and so we have also seen great progress
in perception and we have seen progress
on
and generally with all the investments
in in the area we have seen significant
results in terms of enhancing the
capabilities of the robots but these
robots are still not ready to get out of
the lab and be autonomous where you push
the button and they do anything you want
so yeah III think that I completely
agree though there are like
demonstrations or of these kind of
capabilities that have been more
deployed probably than others in some
sense he's cobalt robots at Carnegie
Mellon that go around like four
kilometres and kilometres they are not
very smart in terms of being alerted if
someone is lying on the floor this thing
does not call 9-1-1 it just doesn't
which is very disturbing and that's the
PhD thesis of several of my students now
they navigate well they are capable of
reliably avoiding obstacles they know
their routes but they are completely
oblivious to whatever happens around
them so in that sense you know we have
to dramatically make them more robust
more intelligent but when you see young
lagoons technology is about all these
deep learning or scene understanding my
hopes are really high that we can't put
much more into these noble creatures
that move around avoiding obstacles to
now understand much more of their scenes
and now from a mathematical point of
view we'll figure out how to have
multiple models how to switch between
them and how to actually understand the
complexity not just of the physical
space but the physical space combined
with this kind of like awareness that
makes probably all of us more
intelligent than just navigators but but
we have to remember if we go back to the
focus which is Futura fork
we don't need complete autonomy to have
major impact on worlds so take for
example autonomous vehicle probably the
first deployment will be with
long-distance tracking okay
because it's much more easier to do than
to deal with cars in the middle of
Manhattan for example
and suppose you don't have full autonomy
suppose it is telling a patellar
operator but one Operator can oversee 50
trucks no not yet not yet but but the
point is we don't need full autonomy but
there's this thing called the handoff
problem I can imagine the difficulty of
handing off one to one autonomous
machine what happens if your hand after
50 autonomous well all you need to do is
very often is to slow down a movie to
decide all right I mean you don't need
to deal with all the situation these are
if you think about if you have you may
have special lanes but the point is we
can argue exactly when it's going to
happen but you don't need full autonomy
to have major impact on the label I
think it's it's what you're describing
is a really hard problem and the way I
think about I think about robots on
roads is in terms of the speed at which
they're moving the complexity of the
environment through which they're moving
and the complexity of the interactions
so we can do what you are proposing
perhaps with very slow moving in our
vehicles moving maybe on factory floors
or moving in in areas where we really do
not have to react very fast but I really
do not see the the trucks on the
highways and anytime soon in fact I made
up I made a bet last night that they
will not be on roads before 2020 until
only 20 20 20 so past five years of work
we will see what we are but five years
is a really long time
no five years is a very short time I
disagree with you many people are
focused on the autonomous robots outside
the cars I like to think about
autonomous robots indoors like mixed up
with you man's in shopping malls in
airports in hospitals in schools helping
people move around in nursing homes the
whole kind of like Twitter of Robotics
robots there are just around they don't
solve big problems they are just around
and event
it's not a question of whether we
actually need automation is yet it will
exist there type of automation whether
we do need it or not it's part of our
human nature to have invented it did we
need electric electricity when we have
candles probably not but it's just part
of what we are we invent we create we
enjoy we make progress so I have a
friend whose job is to head robotics at
Google X right now and his challenge I
like to ask you if you were gonna give
him instruction what is the next product
robot in the home after the Roomba if
you were gonna say what's the next
product it seems like it's not clear to
me it's a pretty hard bar to the next if
it happens to move around if it has to
be mobile holding folding laundry I
would love to have a robot that will
fold the laundry so this is the dishes
out of the dishwasher but also just a
robot that's in the house I'm cooking
dinner for some guests is the one that
welcomes the guests at the door serves
while I say how many times that they are
finishing something for dinner and the
guests are coming and we are all like oh
the appetizers Manuela I would let the
robot cook and I will be together I
would like to switch the examples I
would like to talk about a robot that
it's possible for us to have today and
this is in fact an indoor robot and it's
a robot that all the physical therapists
in our area would like to have so today
when physical therapists work with a
hospital patient they have to walk to
the hospital beds they have to get the
patient in a wheelchair push the patient
often to 300 yards to the gym they
exercise in the gym and at the end of
the session they have to do the whole
thing all over again
these physical therapists would love to
not have to to do the empty part of
their job which is to walk back and
forth to the hospital rooms instead they
would love if they would love it if
patients could just show up in
autonomous wheelchairs and we have the
technology for autonomous wheelchairs we
can completely enable that so this is an
example of an indoor application that
that does not put the physical
therapists out of a job but quite on the
contrary gives the physical therapist
and the patient much more quality time
together
no I think also in nursing homes I once
talked with a person in a nursing home
who was afraid of leaving her room
because she to go to the dining room
which he perfectly could walk but she
thought that she would forget her way
back to her room and there is a lot of
people that have disabilities that
eventually if a robot would just guide
this person and guarantee to bring this
person back so we could invent all sorts
of like in particular navigation not to
just talk about the manipulation tasks
that could be of use to populations that
have limitations or to make other jobs
much easier and do you think that would
be done with the robotic could be done
with a disembodied AI like a Siri
offering guidance without some things
you may want embodied because as Cindy
Brasil has shown and many other people
sometimes the embodiment makes the
interaction be more natural more
fruitful but again some things might
just be able to be on a cell phone or
also on the real robot yeah but I want
to disagree with Daniella again to say
and we some other speakers say oh this
will have enabled the physical therapies
the more quality time this one able the
teacher to have more quality time this
happens not in my world in my world
everybody's under Mendel special of
productivity how many patients do you
see per hour how many students are you
are you handling and if you have
automated let's say
you know grading exams I'm not convinced
that what will happen is it will give
the teacher more time for personalized
interaction or it will rule to say okay
now you can handle more students because
we have offloaded the grading form you
or the physical therapist okay now you
can see more patients per hour because
you don't have to walk to the hospital
so automation leads to speed up then
that's what you think
you know Automation is in an abler what
we do is it is our choice okay automated
is an enabler we can decide it we will
have an able teacher to give have more
quality time with students or physical
therapies more quality time with their
patients or we can decide it we need a
few teacher and few physical therapies
that's our choice it's not technology
that's on us actually it's totally on a
stand if I would say this actually
raises a very interesting questions
about what are the business models that
we will introduce to to take to allocate
prosperity to people and I think that
there is we have an opportunity to
rethink how we allocate the benefits
that come from technology I would say
that in January we did a study we did a
transportation study where we looked at
the impact of ride-sharing for ride in
New York and we showed that 14,000 taxi
drivers who are now supporting 400,000
rides everyday could be mapped onto
3,000 right drivers provided that people
agree they had to share and they don't
mind if they get delayed by two or three
minutes to get to the destination we can
actually put bounds on what the delays
are and so the first reaction to this
work was Wow we put 11,000 people out of
a job well an alternative interpretation
is to say let's change the business
model there is the same demand in the
system and that means that the the taxi
drivers can make the same wages working
fewer hours the business owners can make
the same profits but now the the benefit
is that the taxi drivers have shorter
shifts
and the community-at-large benefits
because there are fewer cars there's
less pollution so generally the whole
community the whole city benefits so
it's I like to share this example
because it really points to new ways of
thinking about how we allocate
prosperity you enable the taxi driver to
have more quality time with the
passengers we always think about this
problem of labor and this is the topic
of our discussions today and I'll keep
thinking that eventually the fact that
we invent new technology the fact that
we create new computers new robots will
open jobs and creativity to many people
I mean imagine people designing now the
new robot understanding exactly the
functionality creating more apps it's
like a kind of endless endless space
think about the day that printing book
came out all the way to fax machines to
all sorts of like menus on I mean look
how many things came from just books if
you think about the 1400s I mean who
knows how far we'll go but people I have
a lot of belief in human mind to be
extremely creative and to around this
technology create an enormous amount of
jobs probably that we cannot even
foresee today my grandmother my
grandfather never thought that I will be
swiping a cell phone I mean what is that
thing of doing like that with your
finger on some cell phone it was
absolutely inconceivable for a couple of
generations before that this was going
to be something that people would be
doing so think about letting people be
creative letting people be letting their
talents have a value maybe even in the
new job economy it's going to be more
about your talents
what can you do rather than what you are
forced to do and I just want to say one
final thing about this I wonder how many
of these people there
eventually robots and AI technology will
displace from their jobs love their jobs
and every money they think while I'm
looking forward to going and cleaning
the bathroom and all these other tells
rooms who is like looking for that but
it's the only thing they can do but why
can't we invent self-cleaning bathrooms
I mean we can and so what I'm trying to
say is like this the quality of life of
people eventually will be very much
tuned to their capabilities to their
interests and maybe from an economical
point of view that will be worth - if
you do what you like very well you began
man yellow by asking where the robots
were and isn't it the case if you look
at the sense that the robots that most
of the robots today in America are in
the automobile industry which which took
me to Daniela's point about flexible
automation and once upon a time when
Tesla was bringing up the X factory in
Fremont I got the tour and it was a
beautiful line but it was a very Detroit
like line and it was a line that only
made s's and they said oh maybe in the
future we'll make X's and it looks like
they're having trouble moving over to
making threes so but you raised the
possibility of this much more flexible
manufacturing world and it looks like it
may not come from the automobile
industry where it will come from
somewhere else but it has to come from
the science community I mean we have to
invent the algorithms and the systems
that allow us to think about modularity
design that allows us to automate the
design and the fabrication and that
allow us to kind of mix and match and
there are so many technologies that are
being developed there's so many advances
that are directly impacting this this
kind of vision 3d printing and all sorts
of rapid fabrication technologies but
also our ability to automate design and
our really our ability to go from from
concept from the idea of what with this
object you're trying to build might do
to an actual design and to an actual
instantiation of that design now I'm not
claiming that we have fully solve that
problem but we already have proof of
concept systems
that I imagine in some number of years
will become much more robust and ready
to be deployed in applications
I need addition we are developing about
the technology in which we will may not
have to actually program these things
but we can't have these algorithms in
which we instruct through language in
which they talk back to us through
language and everything gets converted
from actually natural language to motor
controls in some kind of like machinery
that we built
so these learning by instruction and
these interaction through imitation and
through feedback is also something there
to do a lot of research on ok I'm gonna
respond to the line of technology
creates new job which is of course
technology always creates new job but
this doesn't count unless the people who
lost a job get new jobs otherwise it
doesn't help us and what we have seen it
by the decline of labor participation
labor for perturbation for men is that
people are not widgets they don't easily
move there is an issue of can the app
skill can the change the skills easily
what is the level of pain the new
industry some people say if if you have
my page not worth my taking this job is
it the issue of pink collar jobs that
are traditionally female jobs and boss
day on day on the supply side men are
reluctant to take the jobs and employers
are reluctant to hire them there is the
issue if I lost my job in in Duluth and
the new job is in Manhattan I not be
able to to make the move done lots of
barriers so just saying there are new
jobs it does not solve our problem
there's a second question I would ask
you because you kind of left me hanging
you talked about this dramatic decline
of labor force participation but you
really didn't say why and it wasn't
actually not because of capital or
technology but because of the flight of
these manufacturing jobs to low cost
human labor so it's not like where most
of the jobs went it's actually very very
complicated and it's very hard to
disentangle all the different factors so
it's very clear that because of particle
globalization many very local industry
fled United States but on the other hand
total money future volume has continued
to rise so we have new industries but
this industry has very often very
technology there
capital-intensive and are not hiring the
same number of people or this again if
you go and tell the people now from
Appalachia you have a job for you in
California they don't always want to
move em it's complicated people are not
widgets and so somehow our labor markets
are not as efficient as they ideally
should be according to new classical
economics and we have technologies in
flexibility and inefficiency okay we're
one last question
at lunch KY few sort of laid out a map
for self-driving cars which was farther
in the future than most people in
America seemed to be comfortable with
these days I mean I think he talked
about 15 to 20 years in America and 10
years in China are you guys comfortable
with you know the self-driving cars as
not as research projects but as an
industry being 15 years away in America
it's a long time that's not 2020 to say
that that talk and that the courage is
shown for example the payments all of
these that we knew it's really amazing
how much the embracing AI is something
that may provide benefits to society is
inspiring to me was very inspiring to me
to hear these not saying all the
horrible things that can yeah I can do
taking jobs and but embracing it as
let's make these be something of benefit
to society of benefit to humanity so I
thought that was very inspiring and I
completely agree and I actually believe
that we will see advances in autonomous
product in China faster than than in the
US because right now we are limited by
by regulation and by the the scope of
technology of technology I think right
now we can have level for autonomy as
products in other words we can take
autonomous driving technologies and put
them in closed environments where we do
not need regulation and where things
don't move very fast and and where we
don't have complex interactions and it
will take some number of years to go
from where we are now to level 5
autonomy I would say that whether
driving in weather is a big challenge
nobody can do
I would say that driving in high levels
of congestion is a really big challenge
so again it's speed of the vehicle
versus complexity of the environment
versus the complexity of the
interactions if you imagine if you
imagine a graph with these three axes we
are close to the origin and we can we
can head in different directions and it
will take it will take an interesting
seven to ten years
I really do expect it coming so if it
comes in ten years we have a lot of time
to rethink the trucking industry so
we're out of town I have the last one
you can have the last sentence we have
too much regulation or the hottest topic
on the table right now is do we need
more regulation okay so thank you all
you know one thing that Caillou didn't
mention is that one thing that the
Chinese are running out of now is people
in China they'll be lucky if the robots
come just in time there they're actually
aging more quickly than many other Asian
nations it's the same everywhere yeah
well not in Africa and Middle East yeah
but everywhere else yeah what they
cannot do they can do each other we are
out of time thank you very much
