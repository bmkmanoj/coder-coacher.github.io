coming and thanking all of you in the
audience for attending this very
interesting event and I've been asked to
start with a very brief overview of my
research and how it connects to today's
topic to provide some context of my
interests so as already mentioned I've
been studying the changing nature of
careers and the employer employee
relationship over the last four decades
and a lot of my work has focused on
documenting the shift from long term
jobs where there was an expectation that
you would work mostly with one employer
and look for internal promotions to the
shift to shorter term work and
expectation of careers that would span
multiple employers this may seem like an
obvious trend for you
surprisingly and most everyone that I
talked to thinks that this is an obvious
trend but actually when you look at
government labor for statistics both in
the US and Canada it's proven to be
actually quite difficult to find
evidence of this trend in the past and
there's many other researchers who have
previously concluded that there's not
much happening here so my most recent
research actually shows that there is in
fact evidence of a trend toward short
term jobs that this was actually being
masked by a separate conflicting trend
and so this move towards short-term work
is relevant for today's topic in two
ways one is that technological change is
likely a cause of the shift toward
short-term work more rapid technological
change means that skills become obsolete
faster and so there's less of an
incentive for employers and potentially
even employees to develop and maintain a
long term employment relationship I
think the the AI seems to pretend an
even faster pace of technological change
and so my research on how workers are
adapting and developing new career
strategies in the face of this change
gives us some insight into the future of
work the second part though is that I
don't think that technological change is
the sole reason for the shift to
short-term work other factors include
the rise of global competition the
increasing power of shareholders which
tend to focus more on short-term profits
the declining power of unions
and this has led to an increasing view
of workers as a cost that needs to be
minimized and so my second connection to
this talk is I worry a little bit about
the context in which AI is being
developed and implemented and how this
might impact these trends so with that
background we're gonna back up a little
bit we'll be getting to these topics but
we're gonna start with a much more basic
question which is AI is often quite
difficult to define what exactly is
artificial intelligence but one
definition that I saw that I liked quite
a bit was that AI is whatever on the
horizon that as soon as a as soon as the
technology becomes reality it seems a
little less mysterious a little less
intelligent and that the it's that
cutting edge that seen as artificial
intelligence and at the moment that
cutting edge is machine learning but
even more specifically deep learning
that you've been very central and so
could you describe hopefully in as
little technical language as possible
what is deep learning and how is it
different from previous evolutions of AI
so machine learning of course was they
are the beginning of the appearance of
AI if people have been working on a tie
since the 50s and or the the phrase that
was coined in the 50s and and very early
on people realized learning was probably
going to be an important component of
official intelligence but as in several
waves of of interest in machine learning
techniques the first way was in the late
50s early 60s and it kind of died out
for for a number of years and then we
appeared in the 80s and then died out
again and now it's reappearing under the
name of deep groaning so what deep
running is the reason is called deep is
SP is by contrast with previous machine
Ani techniques that you know we can call
shadow but there would be unfair
essentially the traditional machine
learning techniques do relatively simple
computation so instead of programming a
machine directly by writing a sequence
of instructions like in traditional
programming you you you write a
relatively short program which has lots
of parameters that are adjustable and
then you train the machine to
find the setting of the parameters that
will get the Machine do what you want
and so a typical example is you want a
20 machine to recognize speech or
recognize objects in images you collect
lots of images of say cars and airplanes
and you show an image of a car to the
machine you wait for it to produce an
answer and if the answer is different
from car then you tell it you got the
wrong answer here is the correct answer
and it adjusts the internal parameters
so that next time you show the same
image the answer will be closer to the
one you want and then you show an
airplane and then show a car again and
show you an airplane again and every
time you just the parameters a little
bit and eventually all the parameters
converge to a configuration that will
allow the machine to recognize any plane
from any car or you know dogs or cats or
tables or chairs and people so in the
past the the part of the machine that
was able to train this way it was
relatively simple and much of the work
had to be done through engineering by
constructing a way for the machine to
represent the images for example in such
a way that their learning algorithm
could actually do something with it and
that required a lot of manual
intervention a lot of skills and sort of
engineering it was very expensive and
brittle and then deep learning what
being deep running is is basically a way
to automate this part so instead of
having a piece of the system that is
handcrafted and a piece that's trained
the entire system is trained and it's
called deep because the you can so
conceptually see the system has been
composed of multiple layers of
processing so the image is fed at one
end and any gets processed by sort of
these multiple layers and a DNA produces
an output and all those layers are
trained from end to end simultaneously
that's why it's called deep running the
what what this technique has brought to
the table is the over the last five
years or so even though the the basic
techniques are very old they there are
30 years old or 25 years old but over
the last five years because of the
increase
the power of computers and be because of
the availability of large datasets on
which to train those systems we've seen
an incredible improvement in the
performance of image recognition systems
video analysis systems speech
recognition systems and text
understanding systems text translation
language translation system so all of
those systems now deployed by all the
big companies use deep running when you
talk to your phone and the phone cannot
recognize as your your your query or
your search query if you're on Google or
or whatever it's a deep learning system
that understands your speech when
opposed from one of your friends who's
you know it's posting in a foreign
language you don't understand
it's posted on Facebook and that is
translated automatically in the language
you understand that's also done by the
iconic system all the work on
self-driving cars that you hear about
these a lot of companies are very
excited about the possibility of having
autonomous cars that will use is deep
running and we're gonna see a lot more
applications of this in the near future
and so one of the differences from
really very other different approaches
to artificial intelligence in terms of
machine learning as a more general
principle is that you're not telling the
Machine this is what a car looks like
you're telling the Machine here's a
bunch of data and you figure out the
pattern that defines what a car is and
it's learning that's what it means by
its learning that's right and then the
deep learning is just allowing that
learning to be much more complex than
before yeah basically to feed the
machine directly with the raw image so
an image to a computer is a table of
numbers right it's the value of the
pixels and whether there is a cat in
that picture when it comes to you as a
bunch of numbers it's very difficult so
it's also very difficult for the
computer to figure out so those deep
learning systems is a particular type of
architecture called conditional Nets
which is about mentioned that had
something to do with a long time ago are
designed to essentially process the type
of data that comes to you in the form of
an array whether it's an image or a
video or text or or something of that
that
nature and what what the systems are
based on is very much inspired by a
little bit of you know the neuroscience
and biology it's a it's kind of a very
tenuous inspiration a little bit the
same way
airplanes are inspired by Birds right I
mean that birds are proof of the
existence of heavier-than-air flight and
they inspired the early designers of
airplanes and it's a bit of the same
thing with those deep learning systems
which are sometimes sometimes we call
them deep neural Nets because they are a
little kind of inspired by how the brain
is structured and people sometimes refer
to deep learning as being a black box
system so what does that mean and why
why does that come up that way so the a
lot of the applications of deep learning
are applications that had to do with
perception so things that are you know
in the human mind are subconscious right
we cannot explain how we how we
recognize images and in fact that's
precisely why we cannot write a program
to recognize images because we can't
really formalize how an image has been
is being recognized how a particular
object is being recognized so so a lot
of the tasks that those systems are
doing I kind of you know below those
verbal level if you want that we can do
the conscious level that in sort of
similar human tasks and so the same way
it's very hard to you know ask your taxi
driver to explain to you why you know he
turned the wheel in a particular way at
a particular time it's hard to ask a
neural net to tell you why it made this
particular decision but it's not really
a black box in the sense that you know
we it's a computer program we can
analyze everything that goes on inside
we can figure out you know how to change
the input to change the outputs its I
mean there's a lot of things we know
about this so this this notion of black
box is a bit of a legend actually yeah
but and but one part of it is sort of
that it's not geared toward explaining
how the world works it's geared towards
learning how the world works and it
doesn't necessarily provide an
explanation yeah that's right so the it
would be in a separate process to train
a system to provide an explanation at
what stereo II after the system has made
a decision
by default the systems are you know just
perform a prediction and and you know
explanation made may come later and one
thing you wanted to comment on was that
you think that these machines are not
necessarily advanced as advanced right
now as people think right so it's very
easy to get a little confused when when
the machine does a particular heat at a
level that is above human performance
like you know those systems can do you
know they can you train them to
recognize images and they can recognize
you know obscure species of plants from
the shape of the of the leaves or they
can recognize you know breeds of dogs or
species of birds right and most people
can't do this I mean some people who
would train themselves to do this scan
so in a sense the performance of a
system is superhuman in certain very
narrow area areas and it's it's very
easy to assume then that they have the
same kind of intelligence that humans
who are capable of doing this but they
don't they're just trying to do this
particular task and and if you change
the situation just a little bit they
will probably not not do a good job so
we can do what's called narrow AI at the
moment but not generally I if we don't
have machines that we don't even have
the basic principles to build machines
that are as intelligent as you know it's
a rat or a cat let alone a human and
what's missing there is that the the
process I described previously for
training a neuron that is what's called
supervised learning so it's the the
scenario by which you you know you show
an image or a text to a machine and then
you tell it what the correct answer is
so it's a little bit like like showing a
picture book to a small child and you
know here's another 20 and say it's an
elephant and after a few example the
examples of that the concept right so
it's like this except we need thousands
of examples of each of the each of the
categories for in most cases there is
the most of the learning that humans and
animals do is not of this type we we
learn most of what we know about the
world by just observing or by
interacting with objects and and that
kind of learning we don't quite know how
to
we have some ideas we all of us are
working very actively on trying to find
who has to make this work but it doesn't
quite work and until we find ways to do
this we're not going to have truly
intelligent machines and you know it's a
necessary condition to make significant
progress towards general intelligence
but it's not it's not a sufficient
sufficient one either so we don't know
what the next obstacle will be after
that so you might take a quite a long
time before we have truly intelligent
machines so you've already mentioned a
few applications of artificial
intelligence so at the moment artificial
intelligence is mostly being used of
deep learning to learn a very specific
and narrow task because we just
discussed so what are the common
characteristics of those tasks that that
that at the moment deep learning is good
at learning what do you what are they
what do you need for that task in order
to be able to train AI to do I didn't
potentially do it better so the thing
that for which those techniques work
well are you know anything that a human
can learn to do unless then I mean can
learn to do in a long time but then can
perform in less than half a second or so
so things that don't require a lot of
thinking and reasoning and and kind of
running over so the you know perceptual
tasks are of this type if you if you if
you look at a scene
neuroscientist tell us that you can
pretty much tell which objects are in
your visual you know visual field in
less than 100 millisecond about you know
a tenth of a second or so so any tasks
that animals and humans can do relate to
me quickly like this those those things
are pretty good for what that translates
into is tasks that for which you can
collect thousands or millions of
examples and and that those examples
have been labeled by humans so you know
what output is required to correspond to
particular inputs so you need a lot of
data produce and often that means
something that's that's done a lot sort
of repetitive right but not necessarily
that you can it have to be able to
explain it right that's the advanced
right
the deep learning and how about what
jobs what might characterize the kinds
of tasks that are very unlikely to be
learned by artificial intelligence
anytime in the near future okay so you
have to put horizons and it's very
difficult because as I said before you
know we might make some progress towards
general intelligence and in my opinion
that will take you know a few decades so
we have some time but but before that
before that happens so with the
techniques that we currently know about
and there are you know extensions that
will occur in the next few years the the
the type of task I think that I can be
automated are the ones for which we have
lots of data etc for if there is an
obvious mapping from input to output so
there is sort of an easy decision to
make that doesn't require a lot of
thinking the baby that requires to take
into account a lot of different
variables then those systems can
actually do a better job than humans and
they they would be more consistent about
the decisions they make they won't get
tired so for driving a car for example
if we can drive if we can build systems
of this type they can drive cars you
know accidents due to inattention for
example will be reduced by a lot so that
would be opportunity to save lights with
with AI similarly for very promising set
of applications of image recognition
techniques commercial nets in particular
is for medical image analysis and so I I
think you know in the near future
there's going to be automated system
that can essentially process a lot of
medical images and sort of eliminate the
simple cases and then send the the more
sort of tricky ones or difficult ones
suspicious wants to the to the
radiologist and the doctors who then
will be able to concentrate on the
difficult cases so jobs that have more
exceptions tasks somewhere exceptions
tests that are not as routine maybe
somewhat creativity although that's
debated in the long run yeah right so
there is actually quite a lot of work on
training neural nets and deep learning
systems to
to to create and I would see many you
know similar creation but ultimately I
think what those systems are going to be
used for our are so assisting creation
so it's going to be what I will do is
that when you have a system that can you
know turn a rough line drawing into a
painting in a particular style and we
already have technology like this it
would just allow a lot more people to be
- to be creators you know the same way a
lot of software that we you know they're
available now for music composition and
creation is available and that has
multiplied the number of people who can
you know use their their creative juices
and produce music without necessarily
being good you know good musicians and
go play an instrument so I think I think
this is going to be a the effect of
amplifying human creativity and I think
human creativity and human to human
communication is what is going to become
more valuable in the future and so I
wanted to discuss one example because
I've been looking into it myself
personally which is using the you said
some companies or you've been doing now
of what's called artificial intelligence
to evaluate resumes and to recommend the
best job candidate and what do you think
about that application yeah so there's a
number of applications that a number of
companies large and small have wanted to
apply to I mean I wanted to use machine
learning techniques for they're not
necessarily deep learning techniques by
the way a lot of them use very simple
machine learning techniques that were
around 20 years ago and the the problem
with this is how to make sure that the
decisions are unbiased perhaps less
biased and the human decisions that
there are otherwise made and also those
systems generally are decision aids so
they don't actually make the decision
they produce outputs that are then
interpreted by humans to make the
decisions and so these are situations
where you want the system to actually
produce explanations
so any decision about people's lives
like you know your job do I give you a
mortgage do I you know I'm a judge do I
let you go on bail those are things that
affect people's lives that's you know
situations for which you want
explanations out of the system and so
the you know there's been talks about
the fact that no one less and deep
running are are are so difficult objects
from which to generate explanations III
don't think that's the case I know it's
there are any more difficult than more
than super techniques it just more
difficult because they produce more more
accurate answer it's basically but one
of the dangers of the deep learning and
depending upon the application is that
it's it's trained on real board real
world data and therefore one has to be
very cautious about the data that it's
being trained on right so it's not going
to be better than a human it's going to
reflect whatever those human decisions
that it's trained on is trained to so if
you use past hiring data to train your
algorithm for hiring then that data will
reflect any biases that were in the
humans reflected in the humans that
created that data in the first place and
so eventually I think we discussed it
might be possible to try and fix some of
that but at least at the moment at its
most basic level it's it's learning the
real world at its best and its worst at
the same time well so there's sort of
two remarks on this the first one is you
you certainly you can actually get
machines that are better than any
individual person who has generated the
data because the data generally is
produced by an ensemble of people and I
use wisdom to the crowd to some extent
right so individual variations are kind
of smoothed out when you have a large
data data set you know for multiple
people so that's one point the second
point is there are techniques that
people are working on I wouldn't say
they are completely kind of you know
recipes that everybody can apply but
there are there is quite a lot of work
on trying to sort of D by us data in a
way that if there are certain variables
I
you don't want to be you don't want to
use you don't want your system to use
not only that but you don't want the
system to use other variables are
correlated with it there are techniques
that try to remove the information about
those variables from the systems and so
in the end you might get a system that
is less bias than any human actually
doing the same task so you know one
decide whether to give a mortgage to
someone you don't want to use ethnicity
for that it's actually illegal in those
countries but you also don't want to use
the information you know in the address
of the person there is hidden
information about the ethnicity in
certain countries because people cluster
and so how do you eliminate this
information there's quite a bit of work
on this and I think I'm I mean I'm very
hopeful that there's going to be methods
and sort of good techniques to do
systems of this type that actually are
considerably less biased than
corresponding human decisions so as I
mentioned earlier I am interested also
in the context in which AI is being
implemented and there's two aspects to
that one aspect is that it does seem
like a lot of AI research is being
funded and conducted inside private
companies including your employer
Facebook and is this should this be a
concern does that influence the the
kinds of applications that companies
that AI is being put to use for so first
of all I should say that it's true that
some companies have invested massively
in AI research but still the majority of
good ideas come from academia many of
them from from here from what we all
from Europe and Joe's lab Mira
and the the the an interesting
phenomenon has has occurred in the last
years which is that most companies that
are involved in AI research actually
practice open research so it's certainly
the case at Facebook where all the work
that is done at Facebook where research
is published and most of the code is
distributed in open source and the
reason we're doing this is because we
want to we don't think a is a solved
problem of course and it's going to take
the entire research community to
make significant progress and so by
opening up our research we're sort of
you know helping the community as a
whole to make progress in directions
that we think is important and that had
kind of ripples ripple effects in other
companies so Google became more open and
they were in the past Apple even started
publishing papers which had never done
before so it's producing a bit of a
cultural change in the attitude towards
towards research and you know it's a
it's an old tradition you know
practicing working researching companies
you know was was the world in the in the
70s and 80s with Institute's like
institutions like like Bell Labs where I
used to work and you know Microsoft
Research in recent years Xerox PARC you
know various other companies so after
the upstream research has been done and
you publish papers and you invent a new
technique you compare it on public data
set and you show that it works well then
it goes into product development and
that part is generally not not published
and it's you know trained on internal
data and everything but but the basic
ideas are all published so looking more
specifically within the context in which
AI is often implemented within a company
there's a paper that I often have my
students read that was written by one of
my former advisers and looked at the
implementation of a technology that it
turns out actually he were part of
developing which was check scanning
software and banks and in that paper
they had an interesting contrast where
they looked at two different departments
where the technology was introduced and
in one department they would had been a
job or one-one position did four
different tasks the computer replaced
one of those tasks and the result was
that they actually broke up the rest of
the tasks into individual tasks and that
ended up with some pretty unappealing
jobs one of the jobs was literally
taking out the staples and ordering the
checks and the order to give the
computer another job was just typing in
the the numbers that the computer
couldn't read interestingly in contrast
the the other Department they consulted
with the workers ahead of time they
actually had more specialized jobs
looking at different types of exceptions
to check problems and
consultation with the workers they
actually did the opposite they combined
several tasks together they created more
more complex more interesting jobs and
actually the use the computer to take
away the most frustrating and annoying
part of their job and so the take away
from that and it actually emerges quite
a few times in social science research
on technology is that the technology
itself is not a determinant of how it
impacts work that how its implemented
and how its developed beforehand and put
into place within the company makes a
big difference as well and so we were
discussing before and it seems like you
took at least that consultation view one
have been with with radiologists so I
wanted to speak a little bit about that
that practice yeah so I think what
happens in the situation so I think the
situation you're referring to with check
reading
yoshua bengio now in the early 90s were
involved in the aditi NT valve ads and
developing a check reading system and
this was deployed widely by a company
called NCR which at the time was a
subsidiary of AT&amp;amp;T and by the late 90s
we were not connected with a project
anymore because the company has split up
but by the late 90s the the system that
we developed was reading on the order of
20% of all the checks in the US and what
it was doing was essentially was a large
machine that you put a stack of checks
and it would kind of read the checks
extremely quickly several thousand per
minute and and it would accept to read
about half of the checks so half the
check with the other Mikey right and and
never seen by by humans within this Bank
and then the other half would be sent to
the talking about so you know I felt a
little bad because you know that's you
know half of the people being out of job
but in fact no they weren't our job but
what happened is that this entire
process can lower the cost of processing
for the banks and the employees ended up
doing other tasks that were actually
probably that's frustrating than you
know sitting at a screen reading checks
all day and so how about your work with
the radiologists have you done about
with it so radiology so this is not
working and deeply involved in some I
could use I'll consider be more involved
than I am with
Medical image analysis but I think we're
going to see a similar phenomenon where
the simple cases are going to be handled
by automated systems and that will allow
the it will not reduce a number of
radiologists that are required there's
been talks in the press about the fact
that the job of ideologies disappear I
don't believe this at all it's gonna
make the job more interesting and it's
going to allow the radiologists to spend
more time on the cases that are
difficult and to not miss cases that
they might miss because of inattention
or because of fatigue or things like
this you know I've sat next to
meteorologists looking at MRIs and CAT
scans and they you know they sit all day
in front of a screen in the dark room
looking through slices of photos and
then you know writing reports and kind
of you know pointing at things and after
a few hours of this you your attention
is diminished so so I think what what
those automated system will will do is
shorten the turnaround time so you'll
get a faster diagnosis improve the
reliability and make the job of
radiology is a lot more interesting I
think so the part though that I want to
push on is the the part that you sat
down next to the radiologists right how
often is that the practice that an AI
researcher says I have an idea of a task
I'm gonna go and actually meet the
people doing that task and sit down with
them and talk to them about what they
like and don't like about their job and
how can I make it better is that the
common practices that usually an AI
Brookshire says I know how I can how I
can do a task and they go ahead and do
it and they don't really think about the
worker okay so I think it's pretty rare
for sort of an AI scientist in academia
to do this yeah but it's not rare for
people who actually want to deploy AI
technologies in the real world so you
know there is kind of a whole chain of
research and development right where the
basic research might have been done 20
years ago and then you know it only
became practical in the last few years
which is what happened with deep yawning
and there's no still of Kinetico
research and and basic research on this
then there is a whole lot of people who
want to apply this technology to various
things and they they have to talk to the
the users of the technology to figure
out how to best
can I build it so that it actually
serves the purpose so it's pretty rad
that you're successful by not
investigating in advance right although
there's a difference between talking to
the radiologist right in talking to the
company that employs the radiologist so
our the question is whether these
companies are consulting with the
company in what they want or they're
actually consulting with the worker and
how to make their job better I don't
think you can do this over the dead body
of radiologists right but radiologists
are quite powerful for talking about
another another type of job where the
workers maybe have less power than them
I mean I think a lot of radiologists
actually quite enthusiastic about this
the they don't see this necessarily the
threat they see this actually as an
opportunity and and I mean there are I
mean this is this is certainly going to
affect radiology I would I wouldn't want
to say revolutionize because it may not
be the case might be gradual but this is
gonna have a big effect on medicine in
general and radiology in particular I
mean people are you know the objectives
that a lot of us are trying to to
optimize is you know saving lives making
life better and things like this I mean
most people have this you know behind
their back you know behind their their
mind in the back of their minds as what
they want to do with their lives or
otherwise they wouldn't have picked this
this kind of profession perhaps now
perhaps our employers don't have this
motivation but they can't do it without
their employees so so as we discussed
I'm very interested in careers and I
make this somewhat personal I know you
have three sons and so I'd be interested
to know what kind of career advice
you've given your sons in terms of since
you know have a probably a better sense
of what's coming in the future than
other people do what how have you
advised your son's in terms of being
successful right even or yoga son
finished his studies a while ago so you
know my advice at the time might have
been different yeah
although the younger the younger one
actually studied did a science so that
has to do with machine learning but I
teach you the okay so the first thing I
need to say is it's a terrible
confession which is that I'm not an
economist obviously I'm a scientist I'm
a geek but an economy so what I'm gonna
say is to be taken with a grain of salt
but but thinking about how automation
changes the value of things you can take
a very simple example you can you can go
to a local electronics store and buy a
blu-ray player for 46 bucks maybe 50
Canadians and it's very cheap it's an
incredibly sophisticated piece of
technology it uses inventions that
didn't exist 10 years ago like you know
h.264 MPEG compression and blue lasers
and things like this very very
sophisticated and it's you know
basically 50 bucks now if you want to
buy a handmade ceramic ball the
technology is about ten thousand years
old but you want to be handmade you know
and design and handmade it's gonna cost
you at least four million dollars and so
what it tells you is the difference
between sort of the authentic human
experience versus the stuff that's made
automatically by machines essentially
even though there is a lot of human
knowledge that goes into it
in the end the production and the
marginal cost is very low so I think
that difference in value has increased
over time and you're gonna see a
continuous increase in the difference of
value of things that have so as antique
human touch and things are essentially
done by machines which is going to
become very cheap the price of this is
just going down another example of
similar example is that you know you if
you are a pro fan or just fine like I am
you you can you know download your
favorite piece of music for you know a
dollar or maybe $5 if it's a long one
you want to go to an opera performance
even though the r-prime ID suits dies by
donors or governments it's gonna cost
you about two hundred bucks the best
seat is you know we'll go for 800 bucks
so again the difference is the authentic
human experience so things that have
direct human to human
education where there is a communication
of human emotion our things are we going
to give a lot of value to and things
that can be automated is I'm just going
to become cheaper so we're gonna give a
lot less value to material goods a lot
more value to human experience and it's
already the case so you told your sons
to become opera singers no one of them
what is one of them studied law lawyer
seconds a mathematician and third one is
actually majored in economics and also
study computer computer science and data
science you know and again this was
before a bit of what you know what all
the events that occurred recently about
but I think well what I would recommend
people is to learn things I have a long
shelf life so and and sort of
specialized not specialized but sort of
things that make you unique so if you
have a particular combination of skills
that don't exist very often if you learn
things that have a long shelf life like
for example mathematics and physics you
know that's not gonna change very much
and you would think that because
computers are good at computation you
know scientists would be useless but
that's not the case at least not for a
very long time so you know we might talk
again in 30 or 40 years and things might
be different we figure out what to be of
more intelligent machines but I think
ultimately there will still be you know
AI systems will be out of service
there'll be an amplification of
intelligence and not a replacement
the same way or you know the the complex
part of our neural cortex is actually
subservient to our reptilian brain and
you mentioned once before
philosophy why why is philosophy a a
good thing for somebody to study oh so
this is yeah I mean it's another
confession to make I actually came
became interested in machine learning
through philosophy I was an engineering
student but stumbled on a book that was
debate between
Jean Piaget the
cognitive scientists and and Noam
Chomsky the linguist and it was
basically a nature nurture debate where
trance key was arguing that language is
essentially innate and Piaget was saying
no there is some structure but we
actually learned and I found that
fascinating and there was an article in
one of those in this book one of the
people arguing for Piaget side was
gentleman by the name of Seymour Papert
and he was a mathematician MIT and an
computer scientist and he studied in the
60s the perceptron model and he was
talking about the perception on a
mission that could learn and this was
the first time I heard about this and I
was fascinated and looked at the entire
literature that's what got me hooked in
domain and how important do you think it
is that everybody becomes sort of
technologically literate is that going
to be an important skill in the future
well it's already the case right I mean
we we are considerably everyone in this
room we run the world is considerably
more technology sophisticated than the
average person you know 30 years ago or
50 years ago or so that goes with the
time but do we need to know does
everyone need to learn how to code so in
the sense that learning to code is
another way of so reducing a complex
problem to a simple set of instruction
which is sort of a very basic skill that
people need to have you know it we used
to say write in so classical education
European education in the mid 20th
century you had to learn Latin why it's
not clear or even had to learn math even
if you know ultimately you're in math
basically has replaced Latin or for that
purpose but it's you know basically to
sort of build your mind right and know
how to think and coding is one of those
things that make you think about how you
reduce a complex problem into simple
operations and things like this so it's
not like everybody has to be a
programmer or computer scientist but the
the basic skill of that is required for
coding I think is a very good skill to
have yes so thinking about how we should
prepare for
future let's start with educational
institutions since we're both from them
how how do you see educational
institutions as potentially needing to
adapt and change with technology in AI
in mind in the future so the the first
thing perhaps is that the the
technological progress is accelerating
and it's an educational institution are
known for their conservatism and there's
no change
I'm shocked by that I'm sure everyone
hears jokes as well so I think it's
gonna be increasingly difficult for
academia to keep up with technological
transitions and you see certain schools
you know the transition for example the
the the success the recent success of a
int pruning some of the more
conservative schools actually completely
missed the boat on this the the schools
that are the most innovative in that in
that respects other one that took a
chance and invested in this area that
includes you know state model and
includes McGill and includes NYU were I
teach but some of the best known names
in the in the business in the u.s.
actually falling behind a little bit
they're trying to catch up now so I
think you know institutions will help
you find ways to to to combat excessive
conservatism in that in that respect but
also I think concentrate on not
necessarily teaching students what is
useful right now but what can be useful
for the entire career so people are
because of fast technological changes
it's already the case I mean you know
much more about this you know people
don't see the same job the entire career
right the change the change career
pretty pretty often and so you know
people need to learn the basic skills
that will allow them to to learn so it's
learning to learn it's not running
things it's running to learn really
becomes more important than anything
else and then finally what do you think
government or society more broadly what
can people be thinking about it should
be thinking about now to ensure sort of
the more positive rather than the more
dystopian future so again I have to have
to say I'm not an economist now and I'm
certainly not a politician but I think
it's more of a political question and a
technical question so clearly the
progress of technology is seems to be
causing a increase in wealth and income
inequality and governments will have to
find ways to correct for that and you
know it sorry it's already happening
it's not due to AI yeah there's nothing
special in that respect I mean people
think there is some qualitative
difference about AI that will make it
even quantitatively different from other
technological progress I don't actually
believe so I think I think it's it's
sort of the same phenomenon that we
observe you know technology so you know
going back to the first Industrial
Revolution when you know most of the
population in North America and Europe
was working in the fields and you know
60 years later or a hundred years later
it's 2 percent and yeah those those
transformations occur it's not that the
number of jobs decreases you know new
jobs are created that it's a lot of
people today you know working jobs that
didn't exist 10 years ago so so you know
and I'm not worried about the fact that
the job judge will be taken away by
robots that's not the issue
someone said I think we're not gonna run
out of jobs until we run out of problems
I think it's you know interesting remark
but certainly the concentration of
wealth and an income is a problem that
governments will have to deal with it's
a political issue it's not a technology
collision and figuring out how to
there's also losers right and I think
what we sometimes miss is how do we deal
with losers and an interesting aspect of
careers is often that we do have a lot
of upfront
investment and those skills and when you
lose your job at age 50 that's a much
bigger challenge and I think public
policy we haven't quite figured out how
to support those those people who
doesn't make sense to go back and learn
a whole new skill at age 50 and a big
challenge yeah absolutely so I was so
this is something I was actually more
worried about in the past and I am now
after talking to a number of economists
actually participated in a meeting that
was sponsored by the CEO of the Canadian
Institute for Advanced Research and NBER
National Bureau of Economic Research in
the US that took place in Toronto a few
weeks ago with a bunch of very
well-known economists and it's something
I understood there which is that I was
worried that as the technological
progress accelerates more and more
people are left behind because their
skills are not in phase with the skills
that are required by the new economy and
so you have you know what it's been
called technological unemployment right
people who don't have the skills that
are required for the new economy and and
as technology accelerates you might get
more and more of those people left
behind but the thing is a lot of
economies who have studied the history
of this say that the diffusion of
Technology in the economy and in society
the speed at which the technology if you
penetrates the economy is actually
limited by by how fast people can learn
about it so if you think about computer
technology right it appeared in the 70s
or so but it's not until the 90s that
you started seeing a increase in
productivity in the economy there was
sort of a Jain curve where you know
initially the technology was disruptive
so the productivity can went down and
then 20 years later it went out and you
know for a number of years and they say
that the same thing might occur with AI
so the the qualifier is what they call
the GPT general purpose technology which
is something that well it really
surprised me when I heard this but
something that will sort of penetrate
all corners of the economy and change
just about everything that goes on but
that process generally takes 10 to 20
years and it's limited by how fast
because people can learn the skills that
are required so the fact that
people can't run this the skills at
infinite speed is the is the main factor
that limits the speed at which the
technology is deployed and so that
limits the amount of people that will be
technologically important so the theory
is that that the technology will slow
down until people can catch up
that's right now okay thank you very

is hella gay mister Helghast dissing
general partner and CEO of tandem
launched a consumer electronics company
he's a technologist and an entrepreneur
hello thank you very much for the
dialogue and the insights at the very
beginning you talked about the
distinction between so the the generally
I that everybody is dreaming off when
they talking often in the public space
about AI and the you know the deep
learning techniques that we currently
have that the more for short-term
analysis of information what what do you
see as the path to what general general
AI and specifically what role do you
believe deep learning will play in that
in that transition if at all given its
limitations so I think deep learning is
certainly part of the answer part of the
solution so the basic idea of deep
learning is it's a bit like the way you
build a deep learning system is that you
have sort of a toolbox of basic
functional blocks and you assemble them
into a complex circuit if you want it's
called computer graphic but it's the
same thing it's basically a circuit and
then each of those boxes parameterize on
you train the machine to do a particular
task that idea that you can build a sort
of architect a circuit of the complex
parameterize function and you train them
on data it's not going to go away so
that concept of deep learning is not
going to go away that's gonna be part of
the solution we're almost certain of
that
now what we need though is a different
paradigm for learning I briefly
mentioned this so it's currently three
paradigm for learning one is called
supervised learning which I talked about
another one is called reinforcement
learning reinforcement learning is
basically a scenario where you don't
tell the Machine the correct answer but
you only tell it whether it did good or
bad and so it's a much weaker feedback
that you give to the machine it's much
harder for it to learn anything
it needs more trials to learn things and
then there's a third scenario that's you
know some people call and supervise
running or I called predictive learning
where is the learning that's more
similar to what humans and animals do
where you learn how the world works by
observing the world and by acting in it
and the it's it's the third type that we
don't know how to do and that's the path
I think to to artificial general
intelligence AGI until we clear that
that obstacle I think we're going to
have a we're going to be limited in the
applications of it Ovi that we can we
can build now the analogy perhaps I
could use is that this is the first
mountain that we see that we have to
clear but there might be 50 mountains
behind that we're not seeing yet and the
history of AI has been in the you know
in the last 50 years or 60 years has
been one of considerable underestimation
of the difficulty of the problem so a
lot of you know AI researchers said oh
we're gonna have machines as intelligent
as humans in 20 years and that was back
in the 60s or you know we're gonna you
know have a summer project for a couple
students to solve the computer vision
problem right that was in 1964 you know
we only started partially solving it in
the last few years so so you know people
underestimate how difficult it is we see
this first obstacle of unsupervised or
predictive learning and many of us are
working on this at his book asha banjo
is working on this a bunch of his lab is
working on this our people are working
on this in Toronto and various other
institutions so this is a you know well
recognized as a problem you know people
used to think that you could do
everything with either supervised
learning or enforcement running and I I
don't believe that's the case
okay our third question asker is ms
Alexandra Duvall a fourth-year become
student at the days of tell faculty of
management and co-president of the
McGill Data Network
hello thank you again as a student I'm
and this was touched upon in the
discussion but I was hoping to elaborate
further as I am a student and so
students now are graduating into jobs
that didn't even exist when they started
University so I just wanted to elaborate
on the advice you would have for
students on how to prepare for this
dynamic workplace both inside and
outside their education yes why
partially answer that question before
but I think you know learning learning
basic knowledge that has a long shelf
life and that you need to learn when
you're young and that means you know
very basic things like mathematics and
physics you know I'm I'm a geek so
that's that's why I say you know there's
other things that you need to learn as
well you know critical thinking and
philosophy and things of that type but
but things that that you need to devote
a significant amount of brainpower when
when you're when you're still still
young because it's harder to learn later
and the the operational skills of things
that are required but your your current
you know your potential employers
it was very less important to learn when
you it's cool because you can you can
pick this up once once you start your
job so in the context of computer
science where I know you know you can
take a course on you know mobile device
programming or something you know
program an app on on iPhone or Android
and you know it might it might lend you
a job quickly but it's almost certain
than five or ten years from that they'll
be completely useless and so you know
the skills for this would be required to
be completely different and so you know
will be much better to take a course in
applied math or in you know operational
research or optimization or or you know
differential equations or something like
that you know something where there is
some basic methods that you that you
learn and you may not think they are
connected with anything practical but in
fact they teach you had to think I give
my students a speech about this at the
beginning
but I'm teaching them critical thinking
and not just learning the the particular
materials there's been a lot of emphasis

I I got most of your conversation my
focus is almost there
I'd like to tell people I'm an American
so I have an excuse for not my French
not being perfect
so are there already labor unions and
representatives of labor in partnership
in that group or is that something you'd
like to have involved okay so I I I
can't I can't I don't actually know that
list of all the members right now but
you know for example in the US the ACLU
is a member UNESCO is a member and you
know a number of companies across the
world so it's not just you know it's not
an American thing it's it's it's
worldwide and you know involves partners
from all kinds of different types of
organization that you know well have
something to say about this and will
participate in committees and
discussions and do you feel like that
that organization is gonna be successful
and influencing the development of AI
more broadly are people taking it
seriously well so it's it's just a
beginning you know we just named a
executive director in fact it's not it's
not yet officially announced I think
it's gonna be officially announced in
two weeks or so but so so it's just the
beginning and we're starting to set up
committees the activities are discussing
I think exam be successful to the extent
that it brings together the the people
who are you know who can bring something
to the the kind of reflection where
we're talking about the the thinking
around around those questions and to the
extent that the the partnership can make
recommendations that are practical
either for companies are involved but
social organizations of various kinds
that are involved you know that defend
you know privacy for example or civil
liberties or things like that or you
know liberal unions as well as
governments governments need to be
informed and you know there's very
little you know scientific culture in
governments in most countries and so
there is I think a duty to inform the
you know the people who might need to
make decisions about this great I want
to ask him one to join me in thanking
