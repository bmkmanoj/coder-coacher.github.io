this fantastic conference I will talk
about artificial intelligence worker
replacing technological change and
income distribution so as a bunch of
people have already observed this
morning artificial intelligence is just
a continuation of a long process of
automation but what we argue makes it
critically different it's not only the
continuation but in some sense also the
culmination of a long process of
technological progress because it
carries the risk that we humans become
entirely replaced so that's why we have
as the second line in the title of
worker replacing technological change
which contrasts with what Hicks in the
1930s described as labor saving
technological change and as a number of
people have already observed and we also
believe it very strongly
the primary challenge posed by this type
of worker replacing technological change
will be one of income distribution
so when Keynes wrote in the 1930s about
the economic possibilities of our
grandchildren what we had in mind was a
combination of technological
possibilities and utility possibilities
and we thought let's go back to basics
and let's decompose those a little bit
so let's start by considering the
arrival of a new technology that
replaces workers and that's asked the
question what is our standard of living
necessarily decline so the first
observation that we wanted to make which
at some level is very obvious but it's
still a critical observation that often
gets lost in our debate is that if the
world was first fast for the non
economists it means if the world was
free of market imperfections then
technological change would always be
some
wonderful because in a first best world
where all markets are functioning
including all insurance markets
everybody is perfectly insured against
any new technologies and so that means
an expansion in production possibilities
automatically implies that everybody
will be better off now one beautiful
thing about this is that in that kind of
world there will also be political
unanimity about technological progress
if everybody shares in the fruits of
technological progress it's not going to
be politically contentious and there
will be none of the kinds of discussions
that we have these days about a real
distributive effects of technological
change now in the real world risk
markets especially with respects to
technological change are clearly not
perfect and I would almost say that
behind every great innovation lurks an
equally great imperfection in risk
markets the majority of workers replaced
by machines did not write insurance
contracts against being replaced and
what that tells us is that there is a
natural rule for redistribution which
emulates missing insurance markets
rather than interfering in markets so I
think this is something critical if we
are free market fundamentalists and
believe the market always gets it right
and then we observed well there are
these missing insurance markets then we
should have no reason to object to a
proposition let's make up for them and
let's redistribute as if we had those
insurance markets now what are the
reasons in practice why those insurance
markets are missing I have listed two
here given my co-author of course
information problems including the
difficulty of describing the future
state space we cannot really write a
contract on something very easily before
it has been invented
but also providing incentives for
innovators if they were to completely
insure away all their returns from
innovation then maybe some university
professors including probably most of
the people in the room would still
engage in innovation but maybe not all
the innovators in for example Silicon
Valley now one critical distinction
between those two is that information
problems like describing the state space
are something that makes it easy to deal
with innovation after it has occurred
because then we know in which state we
are but very difficult to write x and 2
contracts on the other hand if we talk
about providing incentives for the
innovator those incentives are equally
distorted by ex ante or ex post
transfers so if we tax the innovator
exposed it destroys incentives just as
much as if we fully insure away all the
returns to innovation okay so given that
we don't have these wonderful insurance
markets let me look at a case tool so
again we have our worker replacing
technology and now let's assume that the
world is first best so no market
imperfections exposed after this
innovation has occurred which was not
insured and let's assume that
redistribution is costless so then what
we can observe is that utility
possibilities frontier in that economy
will unambiguously move out so remains
there always is scope to make everybody
better off even if competitive wages
will decrease so for the non economist
this graph here which represents utility
possibilities frontier shows us the
welfare of different types of agency we
have assumed workers and capitalists we
have assumed a change that brings it
from an equilibrium easy arrow to an
equilibrium a one in which workers are
worse off but capitalists are better off
but we can trace a utility possibilities
frontier through those lines which
presents all the points that we could
reach by a redistribution and we can see
that we can easily enter this cone of
Pareto improvement from the new
equilibria even if we redistribute from
the capitalists award winners to the
workers who were the losers of the
technological innovation so that means
in that kind of world
redistribution can make everybody better
off and if it does there is still
technological unanimity there's still
nobody who will object to technological
progress now if the world is first best
but redistribution is limited or costly
then the constrained utility
possibilities frontier which is now
constrained by the costly redistribution
may actually lie inside of the old
possibilities frontier and that's the
case that we have depicted here so given
the set of institutions for
redistribution in that economy there may
be no scope for making the workers not
lose out now if that's the case then
from the perspective of the workers and
I guess that's what Larry objected so
vehemently yesterday it may actually be
desirable to limit technological change
and there will be a lot of resistance to
innovation among those who lose out so I
think we economists set ourselves too
easy of a goal if we just say well
technological progress can make
everybody better off we have to ensure
that is actually also happening now the
important question is how costly is
redistribution so this is not a theorem
now but we believe that almost surely
the distortions introduced by
redistribution are sufficiently small
that we could still achieve a Pareto
improvement and oftentimes those changes
in institutions have to go hand-in-hand
with changes in the rules of the games
that effect the sharing of the Bennett
it's of innovation like for example
changes in intellectual property rights
so let me focus on a fourth case which I
believe does not reflect the situation
of AI but which is important to
understand and keep in mind when we
evaluate technological innovations if
the world is not first best so it means
if we have various market imperfections
like aggregate demand problems
monopolies information problems and so
on and so forth the utility
possibilities frontier may actually move
inwards even if the production
possibility frontiers move outwards and
that may be true even with costless
redistribution so this is one of those
theoretical results that Larry was
objecting to but I think it is really
important to appreciate to see how
important our institutions in our market
imperfections are in determining whether
and how big of a benefit society will
derive from innovation so more generally
the first best utility is possibilities
frontier is the outer envelope of all
conceivable constrained utility
possibilities frontiers which reflect
all the conceivable institutional
regimes in an economy and all the market
imperfections that we may potentially
suffer from in the economy so what do we
mean by institutional regimes that
includes whether we have explicit tax
and redistribution systems universal
basic income intellectual property
regimes but even things like social
norms for example giving donations and
then in terms of market imperfections
some of the significant ones involve
information and frictions market
arrangements but also when we talk about
technological progress rigidities in
factory allocations or in prices that
determine how easily factors and
products reallocate so changing any of
these institutions or market
imperfections
has an effect on workers welfare in
general and in general it may be
desirable to use a package of changes to
all these institutions to ensure Pareto
improvements after technological change
has occurred a last and fifth point to
this kind of general analysis and
technological progress that I want to
emphasize is that we don't have a first
welfare theorem for innovation generally
speaking the private returns to
innovation in an economy differ from the
social returns and what that implies is
that privately optimal innovation may
shift the utility possibilities frontier
inverts
even with costless redistribution and
that there may be benefits from
intervening in the innovation process to
generate Pareto improvements for example
by making it less labour saving or
things like that again in AI it does not
strike us as being an obvious example
where this will be true but I can think
of examples for example financial
markets if we think of high-frequency
trading that may actually generate
Pareto deteriorations
so with a critical question and that's
what my remaining couple of minutes will
be about is what public policies can
ensure that everyone is better off I
will spend a little bit of time on
talking about redistribution in a first
best economy to emphasize that it really
shouldn't be all that hard I will talk
about an economy where is the
redistribution is costly so Costas is
unavailable and then end with some
broader remark now we are also at fault
like a number of other speakers were not
explicitly talking about whether these
policies are likely to emerge in the
political out in the political process
and as a number of people have indicated
that's some cause for concern but I
think even the first question what
policies do we need deserves extensive
analysis
so let's start with looking at worker
replacing technological change in a
first best economy let's assume we have
a production function f of capital and
labor and labor consists of human and
machine labor machine labor can be
produced at some cost gamma so let's say
we have invented a technology to do that
and what you can see here very clearly
is that human and machine labor perfect
substitutes so this technology is worker
replacing in the competitive equilibrium
wages will be determined by the marginal
product of labor
so let us post two questions what does
worker replacing technological change do
to wages and what can policy do about
that first a proposition that looks
exclusively at the short-run before any
of the other factors in the economy have
adjusted adding a marginal unit of
machine labor reduces human wages but
increases the returns of all
complementary factors in a serosa manner
we can see that very easily by
differentiating euler's theorem
basically what happens if I add one unit
of machine labor that unit will earn its
marginal return but then there's also a
redistribution from labor to capital
which now becomes relatively scarce and
the gains of capital are exactly the
losses of the existing stock of Labor so
what that tells us is we have this
redistribution which is a pecuniary
externality in the absence of these
missing risk markets that we had but I
want to emphasize is that the windfall
gains for the complementary factor
owners are like unearned rents they have
just been lucky they haven't done
anything to earn this higher return and
compensating workers simply undoes those
windfall gains and this is true no
matter what the complementary factor no
matter whether it's land
or capital or unskilled versus skilled
labor or entrepreneurial rents so policy
can undo this redistributions by taxing
the windfall gains and let me also
emphasize if we can distinguish between
previously installed capital for example
and new capital taxes on previously
accumulated factors that suddenly earn
an axe excess return our non
distortionary so that means there is at
least in principle a role for a Pareto
improvement and for having costless
redistribution I will jump over a bunch
of things now it turns out if we have
worker replacing technological change
just like the paper on growth in the
morning has emphasized there may be
quite significant economic change
because the biggest constraint on output
which is the scarcity of Labor is
suddenly lifted and that may lead to
something like a singularity -
exponential growth driven by a factor
accumulation and in that case the human
wage would actually be unchanged but the
human labor share would go to zero so
that outcome isn't too bad for humans
but where it gets bad is if there are
scarce non-reducible factors in the
economy and if that's the case then the
non reputable factors will limit growth
human wages will fall the owners of the
non reproducible factors like which
could be land or energy and so on will
make all the gains but the beautiful
thing is that non reproducible factors
cannot be distorted if we tax them
because they're non reproducible so
taxes on them are like lump sum taxes
and again there is scope for Pareto
improving redistribution so we have a
whole bunch of other results but let me
jump to our conclusions what we have
emphasized is that worker replacing
technological change can still be under
ambiguously positive
in a first best economy or if it is
coupled with the right form of
redistribution that undoes this
pecuniary externalities that arise when
we add the innovation to the economy the
scope for redistribution is facilitated
by the fact that the changes in factor
prices create windfall gains on the
complementary factors and that should
make it relatively easy to achieve
Pareto improvements however market
imperfections and limits and
redistribution worsen that calculus so
where Pareto improvement can no longer
be ensured but and that may lead to
resistance from those in societies who
are losing but a broad set of second
best policies is desirable including
changes in intellectual property rights
and with sufficient instruments a Pareto
improvement should be possible and
innovation should always be desirable
for a society thank you this is a very
good paper I thought I could imagine it
becoming the definitive sighted account
of AI income distribution and the theory
of the second best let me just discuss a
few possible extensions one is to
consider the distribution of consumer
surplus in the model more explicitly so
the action here is in the production
function but if you think of AI as being
produced at declining or zero marginal
cost consumers will get a lot of output
for free or very cheaply as kind of a
trickle down cargo cult and once you
take this account once you take this
effect into account it could be much
more egalitarian the outcome think of
Africa getting cell phones and now
smartphones at quite high rates and I
think it's even possible that economic
growth of the future the distribution of
consumer surplus effect will outweigh
the what happens inside the production
function effect if software is the
binding and strain you should be more
optimistic if you think it's somehow
hardware that's the binding and strain
maybe that's more likely to be constant
or increase in cost when deep blue beat
cost
are off that was 20 years ago but
there's actually been no chess game with
as much hardware as IBM brought to 1997
but the software is much much better
second possible extension is to think
about how IT interacts with
international trade so this is a
domestic model one effect of IT is
simply that it enables more factor price
equalisation it enables successful
businesses to become larger you manage
an international empire by cell phone
and by email and by other technologies
but if you imagine artificial
intelligence and other technologies
progressing further it could be that
wage differentials are no longer a
reason to locate abroad at all so you
could have a reshoring of say American
or West European manufacturing this
would boost the demand for janitors here
in the United States their wages would
go up it could be the big income
distribution effect is that artificial
intelligence will be much worse for the
poorer countries who can now not
industrialize through age differentials
and it may do just fine for people who
have really the lowest wage jobs which
can't be outsourced at all people just
doing physical labor reshoring as IT
progresses could boost their wages and
that in egalitarian outcome is harder to
address because it's across borders in
terms of the policy prescriptions not
the presentation but I felt the paper
offered to many of them I would suggest
to the author to avoid the temptation of
now more than ever ISM so there was a
list of seven or eight policy proposals
most of which I agreed with but I think
the radical one is the Henry Georgia sty
dia to tax unimproved land and natural
resources and I would just focus on that
once we see that as the critical
recommendation it also helps point our
attention to an actual real-world
example and gives us a way of unpacking
some of the political economy
considerations so think what are the
countries today where the citizens of
that country hardly do any work well
some of the oil-rich monarchies brunei
would be one example qatar would be
another where people get a lot of money
from the government which doesn't tax
the resource of oil but it owns the oil
or the natural gas
we then see when you think about
countries like Qatar and GRU and I
redistribution is a tricky concept if
the whole economy is redistributed I
fear it's not like Norway Norway without
oil would be more or less like Sweden in
terms of standard of living Brunei or
Qatar without oil would be much poorer
when so much of GDP is being
redistributed through politics I wonder
if this is compatible with our notions
of democracy it could just be the
political forces that control the oil
they make an upfront offer to the
interest groups that might oppose them
and in essence cement their control
they're pretty stable there are sort of
two-thirds trying to be benevolent but
they're also using a lot of that money
to achieve their own ends religious
ideological whatever it may be but it
seems they don't really have the thick
middle class upper middle class running
the government investing in the Civic
society social capital that I think is
probably required to sustain Western
liberal democracy so these worlds where
we're redistributing optimally according
to economic theory they might be non
democratic worlds that might in some
ways make them self reversing or not
very sustainable or it may make them too
sustainable but they become sustainable
just by always buying off the opposition
looking also it's a sum of the Gulf
states it raises the question like what
is it we're redistributing so in simple
economic models right it's cash makes
sense to redistribute cash in a wide
variety of circumstances but if people
really are not working I tend to think
one thing we need to redistribute is
status that's harder to do I'm not even
sure what kind of model to put that in
much less how to do it we mean we may
need to redistribute the notion of
having a meaningful job it's possible
that government jobs will supply this
but it's also possible those will
distrust straight people and be boring
and be very low status so you know can
the rest of the world say the way some
academics to fool themselves into
thinking their job is really important
maybe that's one of the norms we need to
produce some of the distribution effects
in this new world where there's a lot
more artificial intelligence they may
cross gender so you already see like the
bottom third of males in terms of
education or skills have
taken a very high penalty in the sense
that I think for women we have not seen
as the case and but on the other hand
care of the elderly which is increasing
and importance both as a job and
something you do at household production
who takes care of the parents who takes
care of the children arguably we're
headed toward a future where the stress
gap between men and women increases and
it increases in a way that it's
unfavorable for the women probably we're
not opposed to sending highly stressed
people more income but I'm not sure that
you're sending more income does that
much to relieve the stress or the
general idea that in these stranger
future-oriented worlds what
redistribution is or has to be is
something quite different from what it
is in the simple per Asian model I see
that as a big frontier issue where we
economists really haven't done much work
at all and then you combine that with
political economy the political economy
probably works much better if you can
redistribute status and a meaningful job
if it doesn't you get very high rates of
diabetes obesity lots of political
discontent and again you already see
this in a variety of countries in the
world
this isn't just science-fiction in terms
of the general topic you know how far
will a I get one thing that struck me
hearing a lot of the presentations not
this paper in particular but I think
there's a bias not just noise but a bias
when you get together academics and tech
people to talk about AI and I've been to
a bunch of AI conferences and usually
it's a mix of tech people and academics
and what they have in common is what
they produce can be multiplied very
rapidly you can reproduce research
companies such as Facebook or Amazon
they have scaled up very quickly
but if you went say to a university and
for purposes of diversity invited the
following few people to a conference
like this I'll say George Mason or I
teach the person who is in charge of
planning University facilities what will
expand and how you will get other people
on campus to agree with it the person in
the university who handles FOIA requests
they're very busy the person in the
university who raises money to help keep
the university going
from their perspectives I think the
prospects for artificial intelligence
are really quite limited
they tend relative to us to be bearish
about artificial intelligence
productivity statistics we know are low
that maybe undervaluing gains but if you
look at quantities how if quantities
been moving labor supply real investment
those are iffy but not extraordinarily
well that to me suggests the
productivity slowdown is real and maybe
less of our economy is prone to
artificial intelligence then it feels to
a lot of us who are in some very
particular sectors but anyway paper I
thought was great extensions needed we
need to think about redistribution and
political economy in deeper ways and I'm
a bit more optimistic than the authors
because of the consumer side thank you
so comments and questions we'll start
with Joel and then men well issue of
redistribution and the kind of cost that
it has historically speaking you know
we've witnessed an enormous amount of
redistribution in the last say hundred
hundred fifty years which probably has
prevented from some Marxist apocalypsis
of happening and that's of course the
fact that we haven't actually done much
in redistributing income by taking cash
from some people and giving it to others
instead we have provided this in terms
of goods and services because of in
general instead of the welfare state and
so a whole bunch of things that for 1880
everywhere were provided privately
education to all level health and all
level old-age insurance at all levels
we're slowly provided increasingly by
the states beginning with the famous
Bismarck reforms of the 1880s and oh
through now how costly has this been and
so there's a bill by my colleague of
mine who comes to London called growing
public who actually shows and this is
quite a startling thing that actually
the welfare state has been a free lunch
I can't
actually fully reproduce his human human
is not going on love euchromatic but
basically if you think of the
establishment of the welfare state as
redistribution effort the costs may not
have been so bad and one of the reasons
that I have done extremely well you know
states is very well first aid but always
has the welfare state monkey and which
is why probably a lot more resentment in
the u.s. to technological change than
the result but I think what would happen
and Josh is thinking about this as an
example redistribution that really
worked don't people don't give people
cash give them health insurance give
them you know you know crash to PhD
education that all of that's all of its
free all of the subsidized and you know
that that's probably the best way of
doing it yeah I I want to avoid some
skepticism about some statements a and
on that you make made in the
presentation about almost surely and
easy to in order to implement these
redistribution schemes in terms of
avoiding distortions and so forth you
know it sounds a kind of a easy and
unfeasible and and the fact is that it's
not and they you know people have
commented on that and there you know
many reasons for that the obvious ones
are that the those that you want to take
from they also have disproportionate
political power so they are going to you
know essentially prevent what you want
to do as far as they can and the system
is you know is responsive to that
particular democratic systems so that's
a I think and the other mechanism is
States tax avoidance and you know there
has been a paper recently at the NPR
working paper on who was it that they
they looked at the
a huge amount of recent data including
the Panama papers and so forth and it's
stunning I mean to see the extent of a
tax avoidance you know which is
concentrated here today at the upper end
of the tail of the distribution and so
when you see that we realize that even
if the political wheel was there to you
know the things we will see from out so
it's very unfeasible ready to do that so
I will again urge to think of inclusion
rather than about redistribution okay
so essentially and and I repeat that you
know I am very skeptical of our ability
to redistribute Indian in your sense I'm
much more sympathetic to what you were
saying well but the fact is but even
that has become increasingly difficult
more and more countries and so you know
think of you know widening ex ante you
know the scope of the beneficiaries of
the processes not by paying them off but
rather by including them in the in the
process and EH one more last observation
you know we we speak we spoke so much
here about the perfect ability of the
machine but there is also a huge margin
to improve on human beings just by you
know early on kind of having something
close to equal opportunities which we
are so far from okay
so there are huge margins there and we
need to you know to to pay attention to
that and invest in that and that in my
view will obviate the need for later or
not obviate completely but lessen the
need for redistribution so I actually
want to build on that since Larry
Summers isn't here anymore we know what
what he would say since he said it in it
in advance which is that there's real
political economy issues Public Choice
issues and and I think in a way you set
yourselves too easy a task by reminding
us that you could do risky tribution and
get to the first best and so I would
give you a much harder task
you guys are you and Joe very smart so
maybe you can you can make some progress
on it which is you know really grapple
with what are the ways to do this
redistribution Tyler brought it up a
little bit as well in a ways that can
maybe mitigate or address some of the
public choice and political economy
issues you know they're there you can
you can redistribute money which we sort
of implicit what you're doing or you can
do it in kind as Joel was saying people
talk about pre distribution you can
change the IP regime and so that you
know should Mark Zuckerberg get the
first fifty billion and then
redistributed or should we do it another
way you know there are a number of
mechanisms that you could put in place
that might be and to make it even harder
that might be specific to the AI
revolution that would be really
interesting to have you kind of flesh
out which ones are likely to be better
off to go after but I you know you don't
have to do that in your your comments
but maybe you can you can you can start
touching and pointing the way of how you
would grapple with that much harder but
more more relevant part of the of the
task yes please
I grew up in the country of communism
when it was truly communism in the sense
that everybody has a job the wage is
almost the same it's thanks to kind of
an extreme redistribution system however
we observe you in that system that's the
incentive to keep up with technology to
push forward the productivity frontier
is very much lower than in other kind of
societies so I'm wondering to what
extent that should be factored in when
we're talking about workers being
displaced any other comments
ok so just before Dave you can come up
for the last paper and just before we
begin the final paper a couple of notes
so first off a oh pardon me yes thank
you very much to Tyler for all the
stimulating insights what if you're
allowed a second sentence I both very
much agree with most of the other
commenters who emphasize the practical
difficulties of distribution and in fact
the entire part of the presentation that
I jumped over was about those practical
difficulties so I can use the remaining
half minute to expand a little bit more
on that one thing there is a beautiful
tax to reduce if it would be carbon
taxes because it takes care of two
social evils inequality and
environmental pollution and a bunch of
other fixed factors fall into that
category a second thing that we
emphasize very strongly is that a lot of
jobs in the service sector which is the
sector into which the economy is
evolving don't have wages there are
markets determined
which is in for example healthcare
education and sectors like that - an
important extent determined by public
policies and that gives us actually a
wide range of possibilities to affect
the level of redistribution a little bit
because we all agree that in practice
you don't want to have these lumps and
