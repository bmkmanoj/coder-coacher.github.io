for organizing this session and inviting
us to present here it's an honor to
present to all of you about our field
about what we're working on and quantum
computing so we're really excited about
Chrome computers because we really think
that they're gonna help transform what
it means to compute and what we can
compute so I'll give you a little
introduction around what it means to
compute with a quantum computer so we've
definitely seen an evolution and
revolution in terms of the types of
computers we have so we can actually
trace back early computers to this
mechanism which actually was used to
compute right it would roll and count in
that sense and that was in 100 BC and of
course we've seen quite a transformation
since then from something that's really
not programmable towards something that
you could begin to ask to do a
particular function right with Babbage's
Difference Engine in the 1800s
and then towards a programmable machine
with the ENIAC in the mid 1940s and of
course now and today we have you know
large large supercomputers such as this
one that was developed in 2012 by IBM
and of course we have even faster ones
than this
now today but the question is you know
what's going to be the next computing
devices and computing machinery that
will allow us to do problems and solve
problems on them that we otherwise
couldn't solve with a digital machine
with for example the Sequoia or the T&amp;amp;A
or one of these fast supercomputers so
are there problems we're moving to a new
technology a new way of storing
information a new way of computing are
there problems where that actually helps
and of course we're here to tell you
that the answer is yes with a quantum
computer we hope to solve problems that
would take far too long
on these other machines definitely far
too long on a mechanism but far too long
on the supercomputer so some problems
are very hard to solve with even
supercomputers so here is a 2048-bit
number and this number was pulled from
the RSA challenge so if you could tell
me the two prime numbers that were
multiplied together to achieve this
number then you can win a lot of money
actually RSA I think used to give
something like seven hundred seven
hundred thousand dollars if you could
actually find the prime prime factors
for such numbers so this is this is a
hard problem and in fact it will thought
to be hard right so the best the best so
here this is actually the mainstay of
e-commerce today every time you put your
credit card on the internet it's being
encrypted encoded and it's being encoded
using RSA encryption so if you can you
know save what these two numbers were
then you could really use that algorithm
you had to break all of encryption today
that's pretty powerful and what I'd like
to tell you is that a quantum computer
can do that oh that running off the
screen it's a hundred seconds but ten
seconds that works almost as well so
classically if I were to try to solve
that problem I just showed you on our
supercomputers today it would take
roughly 1 billion years that's very hard
it's very you know heartening because
with putting our you know all of our
information on the Internet
I want to make sure no one can actually
steal my information so this is a nice
security guarantee but then if I told
you well actually we're we have a
machine that could break it in 100
seconds no longer secure right so RSA is
not secure against a quantum computer
there is a quantum attack that can break
that crypto system and our
say is the number-one crypto system in
use today
it will take by the way over a decade to
change all of the software that's
running RSA so we need to think about
post quantum crypto systems now here's
why
so with breaking RSA on the x-axis we
have the number of bits in the key so we
saw a 2048-bit number on the y-axis we
have the time to factor to find those
two prime numbers of that and bit number
the green lines represent two possible
clock speeds of a quantum computer
running Shor's algorithm so Shor's
algorithm is the quantum algorithm that
allows us to break RSA it was invented
in 1994 by Peter shor who's now MIT and
the red star represents the 2048 bit
number that we just looked at where
you're looking at a billion years
classically so those two yellow
identified lines represent the best
known classical approach which is the
number based on the number field sieve
it's it's sub-exponential slightly sub
exponential time but we get an
exponential improvement between the
quantum algorithm and the classical
algorithm thus going from say a billion
years to a hundred seconds so there's a
fundamental different scaling here and
in quantum computing what we want to
identify is where else can we get such
improvements you know such gaps in the
best-known classical method and a
quantum quantum approach so Fineman
tells us to look
hi I think everyone has shown this photo
during this conference that's it's great
I actually select it before the
conference so but we actually have a
real reason to - to speak about fine men
[Laughter]
here so Richard Fineman an amazing
physicist right and he talked about the
physics of quantum computers and most
people actually in reference to quantum
computing speak to some of the talks he
gave in the 1980s around using a
computer to simulate physics but you can
actually trace back to his talk even in
the late 1950s around you know already
he was speaking about computers that
could take advantage of physics and
alluding to actually simulating physical
systems on a computer that is based on
for example quantum mechanics right and
so that really started thinking around
quantum computing you know he mentioned
information is physical matters made of
particles you have many paths and we
should take advantage of this type of
computation you know a computer that
naturally sits in this large Hilbert
space to solve problems that sit in a
large Hilbert space and already today
when you look so he was talking about
simulating physical systems using a
quantum mechanical computer a quantum
computer so already today when you look
at how much were how much compute time
we are devoting to simulating physical
systems it's it's a lot you know almost
half of supercomputing time today is
devoted to solving these types of
problems that's a lot of time and that's
only the problems that we think we can
solve on a supercomputer so a quantum
computer opens up a realm of possible
problems that we're not even trying to
solve because we know they're too hard
to solve on supercomputers today so we
have a real possibility of opening up a
space of problems that are already hard
to solve and take
a lot of time so here's an example of
what with what we're talking about so
one example is to find the ground state
of a molecule say ferredoxin ferredoxin
is used in energy transport in
photosynthesis and this molecule was
chosen by I ARPA in a Grand Challenge
recently in terms of costing you know
what would it take how much time would
it take to find the ground state of this
molecule on a quantum computer so if we
look at this problem the classical
algorithm it's you know it's basically
intractable you're you can't expect to
see the solution to this problem in any
reasonable amount of time it's
exponential time to solve this on the
quantum algorithm so what's interesting
about this problem and this really
points to the need for good software
optimization good compilation tools and
good mathematical bounds the quantum
algorithm you know there was a
polynomial time algorithm for this
problem for several years then it in
2012 we sat down and costed the you know
the time to actually solve this it's
polynomial time that's great so everyone
said hey we have another application of
a quantum computer it's polynomial time
but then you could say what was the
degree and you know what are you raising
to that degree so the degree is 11 right
n to the eleven and n is typically 100
now that's a lot of time and so while
this was a practical quantum algorithm
it's not really practical for a killer
application so that algorithm would take
24 billion years even on a quantum
computer with some reasonable assumption
about a clock speed we actually use
software and better mathematical bounds
really dove into this problem and the
over the course of several years lowered
the degree it's just something between 3
and 5 so now you're looking at basically
an hour to find the ground state on the
quantum computer this makes it more of a
killer application so initial
applications of a quantum computer you
know going beyond just say
the ground state of ferredoxin we can
use this to study reaction mechanisms so
nitrogen fixation
we'd like to better produce artificial
fertilizer in an efficient way something
like three to five percent of the
world's natural gas goes into the
haber-bosch process a process you know
invented in the early 1900's uses large
temperatures large amounts of pressure
you know it's it's in that sense
inefficient it's using a lot of natural
gas can we find a catalyst we know
bacteria do this well can we find a
catalyst to make this reaction more
efficient that's a great problem just
look at on the quantum computer
carbon capture is a similar type of
problem looking for a catalyst to help
extract carbon from say you know an
ambient environment and then in material
science quantum computers are great at
studying materials we want to identify a
room-temperature superconductor we can
begin to study say the Hubbard model
with more sites on a quantum computer
and there you know that has the
potential for say lossless power
transmission and the joke in our field
that has a potential to help us design
the next quantum computer because you
know if we had a room-temperature
superconductor we wouldn't have to put
our quantum computer in these cold
dilution refrigerators and then we're
also looking at applications of quantum
computing a machine learning there we do
have speed ups but one could ask you
know does using a quantum model of
classical or quantum data does that help
and what can we do there and we have
some early results already but I'd say
this this work is just at its beginning
okay so a quick three minute
introduction to qubits so how does the
computer work you know what's actually
different in a quantum computer than in
your digital computer in your laptop
your cell phone so in your laptop and
cell phone and digital digital machines
we have binary encoding everything is a
bit it's in the state zero or it's in
the state one on a quantum computer you
can also achieve super
so a quantum bit we refer to it as a
qubit can be simultaneously in 0 &amp;amp; 1 so
already you can see that this begins to
give you an internal parallelism that
you can hope to take advantage of in a
quantum computer so the information is
encoded in the state of a 2 level for
example 2 level quantum system when it
have 0 and 1 superposition
now this can in a machine this could be
for example looking at the ground in
excited States of an atom or you could
encode this say in the spin or in
polarization of a photon for example so
there's several ways and you'll hear
from Sergei one technique of encoding
quantum information in a physical system
now we can also compute so we have this
way to encode information we have a bit
classically we have a quantum bit
quantumly that takes on this
superposition and then we can actually
compute so you know classically we think
about a logical operation you might
think of it as a truth table you know
not would be flipping the bit from 0 to
1 and then from 1 to 0 and you can build
up circuits of ands and ORS and nots and
X ORS you know design your logic in that
fashion we can do a similar type of
design quantumly but we have some
restrictions so namely every operation
needs to be reversible with the
exception of measurement so we need
reversible operations and this leads us
essentially to a unitary matrix
representing each of our quantum gates
but we can also perform for example a
not gate and here you can see the matrix
representation of the knot and that
vector represents our qubit so you can
you know in a layer of abstraction
represent quantum computing as matrix
vector multiplies write and matrix
matrix multiplies if you want to
visualize this a classical bit can be 0
or 1 and we think of a quantum bit
sitting on this what's called the Bloch
sphere so
zero would sit at the North Pole one at
the South Pole and any quantum operation
a single cubic quantum operation
essentially rotates your vector to a new
place on the surface of this sphere and
that's your operation so I could rotate
for example if I had a state a quantum
bit in the zero state I can rotate that
half way down to zero plus one over the
square root of two and that's a gate
called the Hadamard gate or I could
actually flip the bit and do a naught
operation that takes zero all the way to
one and so on but the real magic comes
in that we can actually build a multi
qubit state and this takes on a
superposition of all of the numbers
between 0 and 2 the N minus 1 so here we
have nine you know for example nine
cubits and in nine cubits of nine cubits
state we store you know zero and one and
two and three now all the way up so all
of these numbers are stored
simultaneously in this nine qubit state
and this is where you start to get some
of this parallelism of course there's so
you know 250 interacting qubits to store
that would require 10 to the 80
classical bits so you can begin to get a
feeling for how powerful this is so n
interacting qubits would take 2 to the N
classical bits of information to store
designing quantum algorithms is
challenging we have a no cloning
principle we can't just copy quantum
information so we have to be careful in
how we protect our algorithm in how we
encode our algorithm and we also have an
input-output limitation quantum
computers aren't great at handling big
data right they're not great at give you
solution per se every page on the web we
have to measure and this means it's a
probabilistic it's a probabilistic
machine your algorithm will be
probabilistic so when you measure you
get one of the states with a probability
related to its amplitude so if you want
to you know several answers you'll have
to measure several times or if you want
no success you you may have to run it
several times in general at Microsoft
also think about programming this
machine and so we actually do have a
software architecture that we've
developed that allows you to simulate
quantum algorithms in advance and
optimize them and this is in part what
we use to achieve some of the reductions
in the cost in the case of quantum
chemistry that I showed earlier and this
is released actually on github and it
allows you to program a quantum
algorithm optimize it and then actually
simulate it and then eventually run it
on real hardware so in general you'll
hear today from our two other speakers
from Sergey and then Arum about the
hardware and then also the applications
in more detail we hope you know quantum
computing will have impact in privacy
and security in energy landscape as I
spoke about with room temperature you
know the possibility for finding a
room-temperature superconductor we
should be able to use it to help you
know impact the state of our environment
with ways to do nitrogen fixation and
carbon capture more efficiently we're
hoping you know for applications and
machine learning and in general we
envision a quantum computer sitting as
an accelerator in the cloud right this
isn't something that's going to sit on
everyone's laptop so here's a picture of
Charlie Marcus's lab and the inside of
this dilution refrigerator where the
quantum chip sits at the very bottom and
with that I would like to turn it over
to Sergey who's going to speak more
about quantum hardware</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
