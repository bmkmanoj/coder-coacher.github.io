my brain be replaced by nanotech hmm
these are the questions inquiring minds
want to know
this is these are the questions MIT
professor Marvin Minsky has been trying
to answer for well over 50 years now one
of the best-known artificial
intelligence experts in the world he had
some very definite ideas about the
future of artificial intelligence and
computing joins us right now from
satellite via satellite from Boston
Massachusetts
professor Minsky it's so good to have
you welcome to the show oh nice to meet
you leo
it's a real honor to meet you you've
started this AI stuff in 1951 is that
when you built snark yes it was around
then it was a learning machine that
simulated 40 neural synapses and I
connected them at random and then you
could train it to do various things by
rewarding it when it did the kind of
thing you wanted it to but sometimes it
worked and sometimes it couldn't and it
took about 20 years of developing
mathematical theories to find out why it
could learn some things and not others
the MIT artificial intelligence labs of
almost 50 years old now is this taking
longer than you thought or did you
expect it to take this long or even
longer it's a complicated question
because how long things take depends on
how many people work on the right things
route and progress was very fast till
about the till around 1980 and then it
slowed down and it's hard to think of
reasons for that but as far as I can see
what happened is that in order to make a
machine very smart it has to have many
different ways to do things but most
researchers would pick one way and try
to show that that could solve most
problems so now we're in a new phase
where we're trying to see how can you
make a machine that knows how to do
things in many different ways but also
has the knowledge to know which one to
use for which kind of problem oh that's
interesting instead of saying well we're
gonna be deterministic or going to do a
neural network you have a variety of
techniques the machine can choose from
exactly some people want to use a
genetic algorithm or as you said a
neural network or statistical
methods but each of those are good for
certain kinds of problems and not others
and talking to the young people one of
the things we don't know is which kinds
of problems how do you classify problems
so that you know which ones could be
solved this way or that way and we're
very weak on that that that's what will
make the machine smarter when we get
that kind of knowledge is it a failing
of humans or a failure machines I think
that one of the problems is that that
people haven't really tried versatile
ways of programming so most programs
will only do one thing and then when you
want to do something else you have to
switch to another program the other
thing it might sound surprising is that
people debug programs too much and if
you debug a program to fix everything
that's wrong with it it's going to end
up very rigid it'll just do that one
thing and so I think you should stop and
make a higher-level program which knows
what it's good at and what it isn't and
learns and then then you can move
sideways and for something that the
program isn't good at it would know when
to switch well that makes sense because
after all in our own evolution it's the
bugs in effect that have allowed us to
grow and expand and go in new directions
isn't it art it's the mistakes
that's right evolution is the trouble
with evolution though is it avoids the
most common mistakes but it wasn't until
we got larger brains with memories that
you could remember large numbers of not
so fatal mistakes right so the average
person probably knows 10 million or 20
million things not to do one of your
colleagues Ray Kurzweil is a big fan of
the singularity I know that's something
that people are talking a lot about now
where the the human brain and the robot
brain cross pads and in terms of
intelligence do you believe in such a
thing oh I think it's bound to happen at
some point because we're evolving slowly
and computers are evolving very rapidly
but it's only the good science-fiction
writers and a few futurists like Ray
who see how large these changes will be
the trouble is this singularity won't
happen just because of Moore's law just
because of time what has to happen is
some particular area of research has to
show how to do it so it's easy to say
that in the year 2030 computers will be
a billion times faster than now so
they'll be smart but I don't think
they'll be smart unless you find the
right ways to program them and then I
think the computers we have today could
be people at most things interesting I
guess it comes down to what is smart I
mean do we even know what our brains
work well enough to know what smart is I
think it's 50 or or so different kinds
of skills for example some people think
that there's something magical called
consciousness right and if you look at
my book you'll see a list of about 30
quite different things that you're
likely to use the word conscious for but
each of them is an interesting technical
problem and there's lots of work to do
to get machines to be smart so you don't
feel that in terms of consciousness or
intelligence brain of human brains and
mechanical brains are on parallel tracks
you believe that in fact that we could
converge at some point oh well the
question is are there really any very
different ways to think than the way we
do it it seems to me what what our
brains do is something very elegant for
easy problems with a lot of data we do
things in parallel for hard problems
where everything depends in the
complicated way on what you've done
before we have to do things serially so
the front of our brain is a serial
computer and the most of the rest or
parallel computers and you know it's
taken a couple of hundred million years
to evolve this so it might take us a
couple of dozen years to evolve it in
our computers that's not that long I
guess if you think about that in that
term at all will there come a time when
I'm starting to put mechanical things
nanotech or something in the brain to
supplement the brain I'm sure that
that'll start to happen pretty soon but
what I really look forward to is when we
can
do the opposite and transfer our brains
out of these flimsy bodies into into
some hardware that has fewer bugs and is
easier to replace the motherboard when
you have two I like that idea I could
use the RAM replacement right now and
has the pathetic thing in modern
computers is that it's cheaper to
replace the whole motherboard than fix
three gates that are making the trouble
happened absolutely absolutely true
that's a little bit the case with us too
I'm afraid we've always you know since
are you are there's been a fascination
in the last century with robotics and I
think this is gonna be the year of the
robot movie there's at least three in
production right now our robots about to
become humanoid in the next a decade or
so I think people are going in the wrong
direction on robotics what happens is
almost all the energy all over the world
is has been spent in building very
stupid physical robots that go around
and do things that anyone year old can
do yeah and whenever I need somebody
doing that I tell them to quit the
hardware and work on the theory of
theories about how to make it smarter
because then you can make a very clumsy
robot and it and program it to be
graceful
professor Minsky what a joy and a
pleasure it is to talk to you a man who
has been thinking about thinking for
more than 50 years and what a
fascinating subject it is I appreciate
your time well let's build that pleasure
to be here to read more about the
amazing Marvin Minsky's ideas and
research go online to the screensavers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
