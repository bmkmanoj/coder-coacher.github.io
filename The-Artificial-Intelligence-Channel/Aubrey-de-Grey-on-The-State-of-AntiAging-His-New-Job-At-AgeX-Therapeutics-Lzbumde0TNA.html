hello my name is Michael West and I'm
the co CEO of bio Time and CEO of Ajax
therapeutics today we'll be discussing
Ajax and in doing so I'll be making
certain forward-looking statements that
have associated risks and uncertainties
and so we refer our viewers to our
filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission for more detailed information
about the company with me today is
Aubrey de Grey
he's Ajax therapeutics vice-president of
new technology discovery welcome Aubrey
thank you very much for having me oh why
don't you tell our viewers something
about yourself well so I just of many
years standing there not quite as many
as you and I have for some time now
being the chief science officer of a
public charity if either one c3 based
just south of here in Mountain View
which works on very much the same kinds
of things that both I'm an AJAX work on
we're interested in developing new
therapeutics that are able in principle
to actually postpone the ill health of
old age far more effectively than
anything that exists today and we are a
non-profit because we have tended to
focus on things that are particularly
early-stage but our goal has always been
to move things along to a sufficient
level of proof of concept that we can
essentially kick-start an industry that
phase projects can be spun out into
startup companies that will attract
investment from all over the world we
believe very much as you've always
believed that the that the anti-aging
industry based on technologies that
really work which is what we're trying
to create is going to be by far the
biggest industry of all time and so as
we now get to the point where these
projects these research programs are
getting to that point it's an
extraordinarily fantastic opportunity
for me personally
to finally be working personally and
officially with you rather than just
being friends as we have been for 20
years I think that you know Mike you've
you've had a really pivotal role in the
anti-aging world for a very long time as
by far the most effective advocate of
true anti-aging research within the
private sector and I feel very proud to
have been able to bring other projects
forward so that they can complement in
the private sector now some of those
things and working directly with you in
Ajax is going to be a very big part of
that so that's the Sens foundation that
you were speaking of those Research
Foundation that's right we're a
relatively small organization we only
have a budget of about four million
dollars per year but we pretty
efficiently we have our own headquarters
and laboratory in Mountain View where we
do some of our projects and we also fund
work extramurally so to speak in
Blaine's like the buck Institute up in
moraine and also in very few
universities and so your involvement in
Ajax's as a part-time employee at thirty
percent time employee right yes my
primary role is going to continue to be
as the chief scientist at Sens Research
Foundation but I believe that having
this dual role will further emphasize
and accelerate the pipelines that speak
the right the ability of offense
Research Foundation to exist if the kind
of engine room of this industry of
course there will be no formal
association between sense Research
Foundation and Ajax in the sense of any
kind of you know pipeline between the
two because that would actually
contravene 501c3 rules but the emphasis
that it gives to have the personnel
overlap it's definitely going to I think
emphasize how strongly this whole
technology this whole body of technology
is moving into the private sector in a
manner that investors can really take
seriously now so you've been in the
field of aging researchers we say
gerontology for quite a while now why is
now the right time
in your mind I'm yeah there's a sense I
out there more than a sense that we're
in the verge of a revolution in
biotechnology and medicine focusing on
the problems of Aging why now people
have been growing old for a long time
this is certainly true yeah I mean and I
think for you know since well before we
were born there have been people like us
who have understood that aging is
ultimately the world's foremost medical
problem and therefore the world's
foremost problem period however of
course the phenomenon of aging is such a
fantastically complicated one that
progress in actually understanding it
well enough and figuring out a
sufficient variety of ways to manipulate
the body and so as to postpone the ill
health of old age that's been a big big
challenge and each of us in the field at
the coalface have been seeing the
incremental advances that scientists are
making and we've been excited by that
ourselves but at the end of the day the
real answer to your question the reason
why now is the time it's not an answer
that we as scientists are giving it's an
answer that investors are giving
investors have a particular sense of how
long a timeline to actual products
actual profitability they want to be
interested in and we are now in a
position of succeeding people like us
essentially first foundation and of
course you yourself succeeding in
demonstrating to investors in rigorous
ways that many of these technologies are
actually at that point I used to live on
the East Coast and they talk about
Nor'easters they are the perfect storm
to storm fronts merging together and it
seems to me there's two forces at work
here one is this surge this tidal wave
of the baby boomer some 76 million
Americans you know causing this
upwelling of demand for the problems of
Aging in the second though is the power
of medical technologies to address
complex problems like aging you know
back in the 60s some of us remember
President Nixon declaring war on cancer
the problem was medicine didn't have
medical research didn't have the tools
really back then you know the molecular
tools we have today to decipher the
riddle of cancer but if today you know
we had a president declaring a war on
cancer I think there's a consensus don't
you think that we could really do
something about cancer today and are
doing something about cancer of course
but don't you think that these two
factors the amazingly powerful medical
research technology of today than this
demand together make this perfect storm
a real opportunity to build significant
value for shareholders by attacking the
core biology of aging itself not just a
new pill for stroke or heart disease I
couldn't agree more and I think there's
another dimension to it as well which is
the increasing understanding especially
in certain parts of the USA so they can
very famous for it I guess of the value
of taking on a visionary investment a
high-risk high-reward investment the
people who do that tend to be the people
who make the most spectacular profits in
the long run if they're not scared of
some failures because they know that
when they do hit the check but it's
going to be a real jackpot
I believe that there is still at this
point a challenge from any more
conservative investors more risk-averse
investors in getting into this field but
those are the investors that are not
going to really hit the big bucks with
this industry the ones that are going to
really capitalize ten years from now
even 15 years from now are people who
have the vision to get involved at these
early-stage companies these early-stage
technologies that are going to change
the world so let's that's in the short
time we have here today talk about three
of our strategic choices for initial
product development within Ajax so as I
mentioned the the smart way to approach
this and ok claim that were the smartest
in the world but we certainly have given
this more thought than the average
person in the industry is going at the
heart of
itself the central mechanisms of aging
and so bio time provides this platform a
pluripotent stem cell technology we
think these cells are important because
they are naturally immortal cells and
products you make from them and we can
make all the cells of the human body
sort of replacement parts for the human
body or all born young the same way
babies are born young and for the same
reason by the way and so out of all of
the to over 200 diverse cell types we
know we can make from pluripotent stem
cells using our pure stem technology
which are the greatest payoffs the
greatest opportunities for aging in
chronic degenerative diseases of aging
where what some 80% of health care costs
in the United States are currently
expended the first that we've chosen as
a major area of focus are brown
adipocytes which made me many of our
viewers have not heard of new cells
recently discovered in humans that we
believe can correct this imbalance that
we see in metabolism in aging cells that
when they're lost in the normal course
of aging can throw that balance off
causing weight gain where when we're
young we normally we're trim but also
can cause an imbalance in the metabolism
of glucose so it can lead to type 2 or
adult onset diabetes Brown adipocytes
currently not available for human
therapy what do you think you know from
your your background research in
demographics of Aging how big of a
problem is metabolic disorders in aging
I really think that it's inspired choice
on your part to go this way out of the
200 choices you had to look at Brandel
at the side precursors as a a really
prominent place to go at an early stage
and one reason for I think they were
such a great choice is because the
problem that you just mentioned
of insulin resistance and impaired sugar
metabolism if something that is
certainly an age-related problem type 2
diabetes mainly affects the elderly but
it's a problem which has a much better
prospect of being corrected on its own
than most of Aging which is so
intertwined you know there are quite a
few drugs out there that have some
impact on Kentucky diabetes already this
is an approach which could be very much
more effective than anything that's
around today the other reason though
that it makes such such fans is because
it does actually as you say have a big
part to play in the more general
phenomenon of aging these things
interact a great deal no part of aging
is really an island to speak and that
certainly brings me always to think
about the systemic environment of any
cell if you put cells however young they
are in isolation into an old body then
they face a real challenge in actually
doing good and the Vernie a certain
extent to which that challenge can be
addressed simply by putting an awful lot
of their selves in sometimes one's got
to do it but other things at the same
time so in the way that I've always
thought about aging for 20 years as very
much a divide and conquer problem where
we need to do a panel of different
things at the same time I'm immediately
you know driven to think in terms of
other kind of adjunct therapy that I
don't approaches that can be perhaps
co-administered along with brown adipose
are precursors so as to further
synergize and further amplify the impact
and the benefits that could be could be
achieved we know for example that the
systemic environment what's going on in
the blood it has a great deal to do with
how effective certain stem cell
populations can be there's a lot of news
of course all the time about the
potential of platt of young plasma for
example to rejuvenate old people and
this is you know very legitimate science
we've funded some of it ourselves and I
think that this kind of thinking whether
it actually leads to particular
combinations of products in the end is
going to be the way in which we really
solve the problem of Aging in the next
decade
well let's talk about the number one
killer coronary disease cardiovascular
disease many of the people watching this
video I'm sure had loved ones that had
heart disease I lost my father from a
heart attack there was never a greater
man to walk the planet what a loss and
yet how ridiculous this is it's it's
plumbing you know blood vessels need to
feed the tissues with blood flow and in
aging you have that plumbing goes awry
and the heart muscle cannot get enough
oxygen enough blood flow and you lose
the life of a loved one the number one
killer
so during embryonic development when
when the body's first formed there are a
unique population of vascular forming
progenitors they as the body is
developing they can sense where blood
flow is needed and they move in that
direction and build the vascular tree
out of nothing
we have those vascular progenitors maybe
filed patents on them along with their
Brown adipocytes of course and and so
one of the products slated for
development in Ajax are vascular
progenitors for as we say ischemic
disease the poor vascular ization we
have you know the older we get you know
your leg falls asleep what rarely would
have happened when we're younger it
happens with increasing frequency its
vascular aging is a big problem your
thoughts on on the nature of that
problem and you know how that product
could fit in and be used in treating you
know an aging population yeah I think
that the problems of an aging
vasculature and aging heart are actually
perhaps an even better example than the
situation that look at a fad of the
heterogeneity of ageing of the
multi-faceted nature of it so there are
many different ways in which the heart
fails during aging
there's bathra sclerosis where coronary
arteries become gunked-up with fat and
that happened as a result of essentially
white blood cells being poisoned by
cholesterol but then is a completely
different process called arterial
sclerosis which involves things like
calcification and of course stiffening
of the walls of the major arteries
causing hypertension then there are less
well understood and less well known
things like amyloidosis which you know
is actually waste product accumulating
not even inside cells but in the spaces
between selves and weakening the ability
of the heart muscle to do its job
there's another type of cell that's
actually you guys might end up being
really interested in in Ajax and we
might work on it's a new product which
are the pacemaker cells in the sinus
node this is a type of cell that most
people have never even heard of but if
you don't have the many heart just
doesn't beep because the brain can't
tell it to beat and they turns out the
large majority of those cells are lost
by old age so we might want to get into
replacing those with cells that can be
generated using pierced and sometime
soon you know these are the kinds of
things that I we're always thinking
about in this area and I believe that
certainly getting a foothold in the
vascular aging space is a very good
decision for Ajax starting out so much
to talk about and so much to do such a
great opportunity so let's just touch
briefly on what has for some years now
been a top-secret project as we say a
skunkworks project in bio time but we're
you need to talk about and that's
induced tissue regeneration or ITR and
so the for those that are not familiar
with us early in human development when
the body's first forming there's an
ability to regenerate tissues if they're
injured and so the classic example you
know is his skin and the beginnings of
human development if you do a full
thickness cut in the skin you and I
would heal that in a sense with a nasty
scar but when the body's first forming
it regenerates scarless lee
how amazing it would be if we understood
how that worked and so four people have
bad body burns or have surgery but let's
extend that to the whole body the heart
scars after a heart attack you know the
brain scars in a sense a Glee addicts
car you know after a stroke it cannot
regenerate if we could unlock that
ability to regenerate again what a brave
new frontier that would be of course
that's what we believe we've filed what
we believe may be the first important
patent applications in this emerging
field of medicine
could you give our viewers some
perspective on how you think ITR might
fit into this toolbox for aging going
totally yeah so ITR is kind of in
essence a much more systemic concept
than the use of individual esm derived
cells and that certainly is an important
contrast but I think it's probably worth
emphasizing that this does not in any
way mean that ITR would be any kind of
substitute for everything else there's
no way I think you know I have already
understood that there's no way there's
ever going to be one single treatment
that will completely universally address
all aspects of the ill health of old age
nevertheless Lee yes the the tissue
specific approaches that exemplify both
um technology and the ITR technology
which will be kind of more pan organ
pans issue these things are sure to
complement each other very powerfully
and I will go further I would say that
you know ITR
is a concept that goes beyond scarring
scarring of course is something that is
a natural and very desirable reaction to
acute injury in the sense that the
further the necessity is to heal the
injury really firstly you're going to
die of an infection or something else
but of course cleaning up that
collateral damage later on at the body's
leisure I said to speak is something
that doesn't get done I think we've got
to remember the concept that this ITR
process
may very well also address what you
might call micro scars things that we
don't really see are scars but I just
caused by much more diffuse generalized
problems of individual cells dying and
getting in the running or individual
self getting into a bad state all of
these things I think are going to go
together the stiffening of tissues
fibrosis happens in the body of age okay
so the weave we walk through or briefly
some of the initial product areas of
focus of age x the brown adipocytes the
vascular cells and then this important
new field of IT are put it together with
your reviewing what's going on out there
there's competition to Ajax some of
these companies you know may be going
public in the coming year there's a lot
of buzz about what biotechnology will do
going forward and aging
how would you for our viewers compare
that the platform that we're doing here
at Ajax to some of the other things
being done in the world
well if main thing I would say about
that comparison is that from an
investor's point of view it's rather
different field than most and this
really kind of comes back again to what
I was emphasizing earlier about the
divide and conquer nature of Aging the
fact we're gonna have to do lots of
different things that fact of our
biology essentially imposes on the
industry a much greater requirement and
incentive to collaborate and synergize
and work together than rock rather than
to compete I mean of course in this
industry just as in any other the will
be successes successes and there will be
failures but I think that there will be
many more successes than there are in a
typical industry where everyone's
competing with everybody else because in
this case the actual logic of the health
phenomenon on the ground is going to
dictate a lot of collaborations
absolutely well thank you re for taking
some time to brief our our viewers on HX
and its plans going forward and
hopefully we'll have future videos that
update our investors on on our progress
absolutely or person is going to bid a
lot to work with you and AJ likewise do
it
