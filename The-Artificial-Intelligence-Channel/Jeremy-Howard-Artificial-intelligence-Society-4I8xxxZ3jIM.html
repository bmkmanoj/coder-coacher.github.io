technological revolution that promises
to deliver spectacular benefits or
depending on who you speak to terrible
consequences for Humanity it'll probably
help us live longer and many scientists
believe it will be capable of making
better decisions than ask me humans
this week on Lateline we're exploring
some of the big questions about AI what
it means for the future of jobs for
democracy and for the kind of society we
want to live in tomorrow at 8:30 join
late lines Mago O'Neill for a one-hour
special on ABC called the AI race let's
take a look on the AI race you'll see
humans take on the robots that might
replace them now always need to be
experienced people on the road from
turkeys to lawyers artificial
intelligence is coming actually it's
already here I didn't realize that I
would just be able to tell you how it is
the exact answer to your question
Automation isn't going to affect some
workers it's going to affect every
worker and we let the generation most
affected take on the experts I think
that um the younger generation is
probably have a better idea of where
things are going to the older
generations will challenge your thinking
about AI
there's lots of AI already in our lives
you can already see it on your
smartphone every time you use Siri every
time you ask a Lex or a question every
time you actually use your satellite
navigation you're using one of these
algorithms you're using some-some AI
that's recognizing your speech answering
questions giving you search results
recommending books for you to buy on
Amazon they're the beginnings of AI
everywhere in our lives we don't think
about electricity electricity powers our
planet the plow is pretty much
everything we do going to be that you
walk into a room and you say room lights
on we walk into you sit in your car and
you say take me home Jeremy Howard is
not a doctor but he can help diagnose
patients with cancer faster than a
radiologist he's in Australia -
Australia n-- data scientist and
entrepreneur but he lives in the US
where he's become somewhat of a rockstar
in the field of artificial intelligence
at the age of 18 he was one of the
youngest recruits ever to make it at
management consultants McKinsey and the
World Economic Forum dubbed him a young
global leader for his work in making
commute computer learning more
accessible to the public
Jeremy Howard joined me earlier from San
Francisco Jeremy Howard welcome to
Lateline thank you machines can now see
read here right they can even make
decisions now that we've taught them to
think for themselves is there anything
they won't be able to do yes there are
some things that they won't be able to
do but they're perhaps not the kinds of
things that first come to mind our
expectations around what computers can
and can't do were based on our
experiences with using them which is we
tend to think of them as being pretty
dumb and inflexible that's changed
thanks to a technology called deep
learning as you can see as you mentioned
they can now see they can now read they
can now hear and understand to a
significant extent the kind of stuff
that they can't do is things that are
uniquely human things like caring for
people providing motivation playing
sports stuff like that but the vast
majority of the stuff that people do day
to day as part of their jobs
I think it's all in the process of being
automated it's a scary thought well it
didn't be scary in a sense the idea that
we could spend our days doing whatever
we most want to what to be terrifically
exciting for all of us
most people have jobs which aren't
really that interesting and they'd
rather win the lottery and not have to
work every day of their lives so I don't
think it need be scary I think it could
be a great outcome not given we need to
earn a living to survive
well Dewey if if really computers can
get to the point that they can do most
of what we need to do we'll be in a
great situation where our needs are
being met by machines leaving us a lot
more free time to do what we want to do
okay let's discuss some of the specific
examples already in advance development
driverless cars they look set to very
soon replace humans in Freight in
transport taxis ubers I imagine though
their potential is fairly limited given
that machines won't necessarily be able
to load luggage into the boot of a car
or necessarily help an elderly or infirm
person get in and out of a vehicle
I think autonomous cars and autonomous
trucks it's a very big deal they are
going to make a big impact on congestion
on pollution on people's day-to-day
lives the idea that you may have to
manually put your own luggage in the
boot doesn't sound like the end of the
world if they the car then handles the
next hour of driving for you so
certainly in trucking there's plenty of
time and work taken up at each end but
the actual time of driving the truck
from one end of the country to the other
is still the most significant source of
employment the thing that takes at the
time so this technology has allowed you
a data scientist to start up a medical
company when in fact you have no medical
training whatsoever tell us what it is
you're doing exactly and why patients
should trust you so patients wouldn't
trust me we're providing tools to
doctors and then it's up to the
doctors to decide when and how best to
use these tools yeah I have no
background in medicine whatsoever and
it's certainly a bit of a terrifying
prospect to go into a totally new field
but I could see that medicine was not
taking advantage of the big jumps in
recent a I advances and I also knew that
there's a shortage of about 10 to 20 X
of the number of doctors that are needed
in the developing world so a lot of
people are dying and unhealthy totally
unnecessarily so the idea that I came up
with was to say well what if we use the
kind of tools that Facebook uses to
decide which ads to show you or Google
users to decide how to organize your
photos to help doctors decide what
treatments to give you and how to
organize your diagnostic materials and
amazingly enough it turned out to work
really well and what's been the reaction
of doctors fantastically positive I was
really pleased because a lot of people
gave me the understanding that the
medical industry is very conservative
and would try to get in the way but I
found the absolute opposite it turns out
that doctors get into medicine for a
reason which is that they want to help
people and when they look at what the
technology can can do and they can see
that they can help more people more
accurately I've had a lot of really
great reactions from all of the doctors
I've worked with can you give us a sense
then of just how many jobs as a
percentage of an economy like ours might
be lost and over what time frame so at
the moment in developed country
economies such as Australia the number
of people working in the service sector
is about 80 percent or more and the vast
majority of those jobs are right through
automation if you look at the top five
jobs in countries like America and
Australia they tend to be things like
food preparation cashiers basic filing
and these the kind of jobs which
previously computers haven't been doing
mainly
because computers can't see so it's very
hard to do through preparation if you
can't recognize which way around the
tomato needs to go when whether it's got
a bad bit in it and so forth so these
are the kinds of jobs which are like
truck driving are in the process of
being automated in the next few years so
what happens to those people who rely on
that employment well that's the big
challenge the the final end State
ideally could be a really great
situation where we all get to spend our
time doing what we want but the
difficulty is that to get from here to
there could be awfully disruptive we've
seen something on a much smaller scale
like this before which was the
Industrial Revolution and for decades
huge numbers of people found themselves
in very difficult situations and now
that changed because over time people
were able to move into these new jobs
that came along but I don't think that's
going to happen this time and so I think
the the way that the economy and society
works is going to have to change to deal
with this can you conceive of a time
when machines may well be more
intelligent than anyone on earth and if
your answer is yes then what are the
ethical implications of that in terms of
protecting our systems of government and
the economic models that underpin the
smooth functioning of modern democracies
like ours I really don't know the answer
to that question it's it's just very
hard to see in advance what a technology
could do that it's not doing now so I
find it much easier to understand how
it's going to impact the economy in
terms of the things that it can do
pretty much now and that's going to be
quite extraordinary in terms of both the
number of people and jobs that are
displaced but also the opportunities to
help for example medicine in the
developing world food food production
and so forth so the idea of kind of well
what if computers get to be super
intelligent I just I think we're
answering that question involves kind of
skipping over questions
much more current and much more
important right now in my opinion back
to the first part of that question can
you imagine a time when machines are
more intelligent than us with all the
catastrophic implications that may well
imply or do you think regulatory
frameworks will ensure that doesn't
happen I don't think there's anything
you can do to regulate the development
of artificial intelligence because it's
something that a single comparison can
do on their computer in their Red Room
so I don't think this is something where
it's about regulation it's really about
understanding how do we need to look
after people that are impacted by this
technology rather than trying to stop it
from changing our our education systems
actually keeping up with this pace of
technological change in other words are
we preparing children for the jobs of
the future and the kind of economy and
industries within that that will
confront them when they leave school no
not at all
it's it's really sad actually how just
basic computer science is not a priority
in most schools basic data analysis and
statistical techniques not generally
taught until you get into university and
even then it depends what course you're
doing so for example the the legal
industry is already in the process of
changing dramatically a lot of legal
discovery is being done using automated
systems it's becoming a very data
analysis intensive industry for the
people that are coming through school
now and thinking I'd like to be a doctor
or like to be a lawyer they need to
realize that they're going to be moving
into data analytics intensive industries
and preparing with the you know
appropriate kind of computer and data
analysis backgrounds and yeah in
Australia I haven't seen that being a
priority and it's certainly not the case
here and in the u.s. either Jeremy
Howard a brave new world indeed thank
you very much for enlightening us on it
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
