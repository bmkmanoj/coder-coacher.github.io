I've been thinking about information for
years way back when I was a graduate
student in Oxford I first encountered
information theory and wrote a little
bit about it in my dissertation and
realized there was a huge gap between
information in the everyday folks sense
and information in the Shannon Weaver
sense which I explored briefly in that
book and just left it dangling and
didn't know what to do with it
but it's been sort of haunting me over
the years and more recently I've
returned to the subject and seen if I
could take advantage of some of the
other changes of perspective I've had
over 50 years and sure enough I think
now with the help of a few other people
I've got a pretty good pretty good bead
on information in both senses and how
they fit together that is sometimes
called somatic information information
that's about particular things and then
Shannon Weaver information which is just
a measure Shannon
we were it's not just a measure but it's
often quite acceptable considered to be
it's like a bucket a bucket of what some
bucket of information how many quarts
how many pints how many bits what the
bits can be about anything and now the
question is how does the Shannon Weaver
sense of information ground or fit with
the understanding information we talk
about when we talk about disinformation
we're being misinformed or being a very
well-informed person and how does this
all fit with the philosophers favorite
topics of belief and knowledge and so
forth and there's a tradition info
Sippi which says well let's look at the
root case which is Tom believes of that
P for some proposition P Tom believes
that Larson pitched the only perfect
game in World Series history to take a
threadbare example so here we have a
case of a person tom who has a belief
and the belief is captured presumably by
this proposition with its a sense of
English in this case but one is to
understand that that sentence of English
is just standing in for something more
abstract roughly the same way that a
numeral Roman or Arabic stands in for a
number the numbers abstract the numeral
ISM is a symbol so the English sentence
is a is an expression of a proposition
and so phosphorus have been very eager
to get a good theory of propositions and
I played with that stuff for years play
worked struggled with that stuff for
years and grew and more and more
dissatisfied with it and wrote a piece
oh my gosh 2530 years ago called beyond
belief which was my attempt to put that
tradition pretty much to bed and to my
satisfaction I did I go back to that
literature the so called propositional
attitude task force so named by the
participants somewhat jocularly and here
it is that was nineteen eighty-something
they wrote that and here it is all these
years later and they're playing the same
games puzzling over the same examples
and they're just as far from a solution
as ever as far as I can tell so I'm not
sorry that I turned my back on that
but I still hadn't answered the
questions that I wanted answered so
having turned my back on propositions I
thought what am I gonna do about this
well the area where it really comes up
is when you start looking at the
contents of consciousness which is my
number one topic and I like to quote
Maynard Keynes on this he was once asked
you thinking words or pictures he said I
think in thoughts wonderful answer but
also wonderful uninformative what the
hell is a thought though how does it
carry information is it like a picture
is that iconic in some way does it
resemble what it's about or is it like a
word which refers to what it's about
without resembling it and so forth and
our third fourth fifth and looking at
information in the brain and then trying
to trace it back to information in the
genes which must be responsible for
providing the design of the brain that
can then carry information and other
senses you gradually begin to realize
that all this dust I am with Shannon
Weaver information theory there's a way
of seeing information as a difference
that makes a difference
to quote Donald the Chi and Bateson
earlier or Luke I think maybe was first
and so ever since then I've been trying
to articulate with the help of David
Haig evolutionary biologist at Harvard
just what meaning is what content is in
ultimately in terms of biological
information and that in terms of
physical information the information of
Shannon and Weaver and there's a chapter
in my latest book called what is
information which is now I stand by it
that is under revision I'm already
moving beyond it and realizing there's a
there's a better way of tackling some of
these issues but the key insight I think
is that we simply have to get away and
I've known this for years I haven't just
seen all the implications of it we have
to get away from the idea of there being
the pure ultimate fixed proposition
which in which captures the information
in any informational state this this
goal of capturing the proposition this
attempt at idealization that
philosophers have poured their hearts
and souls into for 100 years just wall
don't even try so now I'm coming around
to think well why did that have such a
hold on us and I think that it's really
quite obvious once you start thinking
this way we and only we among all the
creatures on the planet developed
language and language is very special
when it comes to being in information
handling medium because it permits us to
talk about things that aren't present to
talk about things that don't exist to
put together all manner of concepts and
ideas in ways that are only very very
very indirectly anchored in our
biological experience in the world
it's compare it for instance with a
vervet monkey alarm call that vervet
sees an eagle and issues the eagle alarm
call and we can understand that as a
signal alarm signal and we can see the
relationship of the seen eagle and the
behavior on the part of the monkey and
the behavior of the on the part of the
audience of that monkey's alarm call
that's a sort of nice root case now
suppose we start asking well what
exactly does that monkey call mean does
it mean low look out there's an eagle
that's up there or does it mean
just jump into the trees what does it
mean just Oh help help help
how would we put that alarm call into
English don't try this is the trick
don't imagine that the way to have a
theory of meaning and interpretation is
to treat it as a theory which has as its
goal the reduction of everything to some
canonical sort of proposition now that's
a very powerful idea which is I think
just a big mistake it it's powerful
because for instance it allows you to
say things like this we can have a
sentence in French Lucia in why a
sentence in English the cat is black a
sentence in German cat ceased Schwarz
and they all mean the same thing there
is one and only one proposition which is
expressed differently in different
languages and so you listen this is a
way of giving us a signpost to this
object of the proposition so
propositions are supposed to be
idealizations rather like numbers or
vectors or some other the abstract
formulation and it looks at first very
powerful and for some purposes is very
useful but it takes you away from
enlightenment I think because it gives
you this false sense that you haven't
understood something really until you've
figured out how to articulate how to
point to how to identify the proposition
that a particular meaningful event has
no there's all kinds of meaningful
events that that defy
putting in terms of any particular
proposition that doesn't make them not
meaningful you have to turn the whole
thing upside down this is what I call
David Hague strange inversion and start
with the simplest imaginable case like a
bacterium that responds to a gradient in
its environment and that response has a
meaning well what does it mean well in a
way don't ask it has meaning because the
response in one way or another is
relevant to the well-being of that
bacterium if it's if if it's responding
to food by moving towards it that's
that's its meaning and it's not more
precise than that and we have to get
away from the idea that that's a merely
figurative or metaphorical case of
meaning it's as real as meaning ever
gets and then we start then with dead
simple cases of meaning the meanings of
the actions of bacteria and the like we
can getting simpler than that and talk
about the meanings of the of the of the
structures of proteins we can get we can
get very simple and treat those as our
atoms those is our basic units and then
we see human meaning in books and
newspapers and on television meaning
that's linguistically bound as very
important and a very very very special
case which has many properties that
other kinds of meaning don't have but
not as the foundational case but rather
as the exotic cases of meaning the cases
that create theoretical illusions of
various sorts such as the hunt for the
Phantom propositions now you tell some
philosophers well I'm very interested in
meaning and interpretation I don't think
propositions are going to play much of a
role in that many philosophers would say
well
then you've got to be wrong they're so
wedded to that perspective which they
learned in all of their classes and I
was myself wedded to it to a significant
degree now I'm moving away from that and
it's paying off not just in thinking
about information in biology and
information in what I call the
intentional stance was obviously ties in
very nicely with that but very
specifically with how to talk about the
content of states of consciousness or
other states of the brain which are not
all pictures almost none of them were
pictures and they aren't all words and
many of them are but that's not where
their meaning resides and so we are
freed up to think about how neural
states and transitions can have meaning
quite elaborate meaning without it being
expressible in any sentence now I mean
I've been hinting at this in various
ways for years a number of years ago
more than a decade ago I had an example
of somebody saying Joe has a thing about
redheads but what did I mean by a thing
about redheads well it was a thing
there's a thing in his brain and there's
about redheads in what sense well
whenever redheads were the topic this
thing became active and it biased his
cognition his emotional state he just
had a thing about redheads okay so now I
have this thing it's not a proposition
if you ask what exactly what is the
proposition that it expresses or stores
in memory don't ask there's no there's
no proposition what's true of it is it's
this thing physical thing which has the
curious
of being relevant to redheads in that it
becomes active whenever the topic is
redheads whether redheads are seen or
talked about or remembered or imagined
this thing becomes active now
that's an example of a crude example of
a neural something or other which has
meaning in the mind of a particular
individual but defies translation into
any propositional format and then the
worst fourth the Philosopher's
fascination with propositions was
mirrored in good old-fashioned AI the AI
of John McCarthy and early Minsky and
Newell and Simon and Shaw and it was the
idea that the way to make an intelligent
agent was from the top down what you do
is you you have a set of propositions in
some proprietary formulation it's not
going to be English but it's going to be
well maybe Lisp something like that
where you define all the predicates you
define all the operators and then you
have this huge database which is
beautifully articulated and broken up
into atoms of meanings which have the
meaning they have by being part of the
system they're part of you stipulate
their meanings and then you have a
resolution theorem prover that sits on
top of that and this is how we're going
to generate a thoughtful creative mind
it was a very attractive dream to many
people and it's not quite Dead Yet and
this early attempt in AI image went
through into that well into the 80s
gave us many wonderful things and I
think that it's important to recognize
how much that we now take for granted in
AI and in computers grew out of the
explorations of the good old-fashioned
AI pioneers but it hit a brick wall
McCarthy and Hayes discovered the frame
problem there were other intractable
issues and then Along Came connectionism
and then more recently has come in
reinforcement learning and deep learning
and people have moved away from this
ideal of a canonical expression of
specific propositions as an in axiom
system I used the term good
old-fashioned AI or go Phi which was
coined by my like dear friend John
Hoagland in his book artificial
intelligence the very idea and he was an
early and influential and knowledgeable
critic of the field and he deserved the
right to come up with a music name good
old-fashioned AI while it was still
going and when it was still regarded
this as very promising by many people he
was already foreseeing its demise
correctly in many regards but the fact
is that the fruits of good old-fashioned
AI are all around us in fact the
Internet is largely based on good
old-fashioned AI when when people talk
today about semantic search as opposed
to string search they're talking about
going beyond what you can do with the
methods of good old-fashioned AI which
is string search till the cows come home
and going deeper and getting it the
semantic meanings of what's out there
but of course those are the semantic
meanings that the philosophers
to capture with their notion
propositions and if if that's just a
fool's errand as I now think then one
has to acknowledge that semantic search
the Semantic Web can never be anything
more than a useful approximation and
that we should be very keen to recognize
that and recognize that we're not going
to get canonical clear provable
semantics out of most of what's on there
you can get some because some some areas
of inquiry some data sets are
wonderfully well articulated and
organized and it's just built for that
kind of exploration but most of the web
isn't and that's the way it's going to
continue
that's where deep learning etc comes in
because and especially Bayesian nets and
so forth because these are tools for
finding by amazing sort of neo-darwinian
methods extracting meaningful pattern
from all of this diverse material and
the beautiful thing about it is they
extract meaningful pattern without
knowing what the meaning is and that
takes us back interestingly enough to
Shannon and bits and differences that
make a difference even when you can't
say what difference they make you can
say they make a difference so what deep
learning is now doing is coming up with
competences which we're sort of
unimaginable just a few years ago
because they don't depend on Gulf I type
comprehension they don't depend on being
able to deduce from axioms that this has
to be the meaning of this or this has to
be the meaning of that they're not
deductive
if you go to Google and search for
something they will search for exactly
the sequence of letters who put in
unless now it's getting better if you
think it's better in that it will and
try to guess what you really want to ask
about and if they think if it thinks
you've misspelled something it will try
an alternative spelling a lot of people
who object to that because they want to
do research which depends on actual
string search but the technique that
Google the techniques that Google and
others are developing for going beyond
the string and trying to suss out the
intended meaning of the search this is
new territory and we should view it with
some real caution and and be careful
that we know when it's being used and
when it isn't because it may very well
misinterpret what you want and you'll
never know unless you can somehow appeal
back behind the screen and see what
what's actually actually going on
well those methods are the methods that
are intended to make the web more
semantic in that you can look things up
by meaning not just by strict name not
by just the symbols in the string so
these are these are related these if all
of these issues are related the nice
phrase is the difference that makes a
difference obviously the difference is
everywhere this grain of sand is here
not there was grain of sand is a little
different shape than that and so forth
and some differences however have roles
to play in larger circumstances and it
may be the butterfly that flaps its wing
as it causes the hurricane
so forth and so on if we want to have a
general term for differences that make a
difference
then those are the that's the
information really in the in the Shannon
we were sense in that it can give rise
to a correlation which can then make a
further difference in further the
differences in further differences I've
talked about in dirt historical facts
those are differences they don't make a
difference
my stock example is this some of the
gold in my teeth once belonged to Julius
Caesar or none of the gold in my teeth
ever belonged to Julius Caesar not a
single out now one of those is true I
don't know I doubt if that's the
difference that makes a difference I
doubt if that information exists in the
world today it could it could I mean we
actually can prove that some things
belong to some people that have been
dead for centuries we have a an
informational chain but it's a way of
thinking about information which is sort
of maximally simple and shorn of many of
its usual connotations of codes and
signals and languages and the like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
