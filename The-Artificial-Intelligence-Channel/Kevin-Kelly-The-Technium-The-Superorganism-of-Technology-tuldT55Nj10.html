myself I think what I find really
uncertain is to understand how far we're
going to share when we're going to stop
sharing how far we're going to allow
ourselves to monitor and surveil each
other kind of a covalence so I'm not
really that conceive that there's no end
to how much we can track each other how
far we're going to self track how much
we're going to allow companies to track
us and so I find it really difficult to
believe that there's going to be a limit
to this and so to try to imagine this
world in which we are being self tracked
and Co tracked and tracked by
governments and yet accepting of that is
it's really hard to to imagine so the
question I'm asking myself is how does
this work how how can we have a world in
which we are all watching each other and
everybody feels happy so because I don't
see any counter force to the forces of
surveillance and self tracking and so
I'm trying to listen to what the
technology wants that technology is
suggesting that it's that it wants to be
watched that that that what the internet
does is track just like what the
internet does is to copy and you can't
stop copying you kind of have to go with
the copies flowing and I think the same
thing about this technology is the
suggesting that it wants to monitor it
wants to track and that you really can't
stop the tracking so well maybe what we
have to do is is work with this tracking
try to bring symmetry or have areas
where there's no tracking you know
kind of a temporary basis well I don't
know but all I'm saying this is the
question I'm asking myself is how are we
gonna live in the world of ubiquitous
tracking I I think that I call myself a
proto peon not a utopian I believe in
progress an incremental way where every
year it's better than the year before
but not by very much it's just a micro
amount and that over time we have
progress so I I believe in progress but
I don't believe that there's any kind of
state of a world without problems
brought on by technology I think every
new technology creates almost as many
problems as that it solves and so for
most people that that statement would
suggest that the technology is kind of
like a wash it's kind of mutual because
if you're creating as many problems as
it solves then then it's just that it's
it's a 50/50 wash but I think the
difference is is that the difference in
in my proto peein view the versus say a
neutral view is that all these new
technologies bring our new possibilities
that did not exist before including the
new possibility of doing harm versus
good so so a way to think about this is
if you imagine the very first tool mates
a stone hammer that stone hammer could
be used to kill somebody or it could be
used to make a structure but before that
stone hammer became a tool that
possibility of making that choice did
not exist and so technology is
continually giving us ways to to do harm
and to do well it's amplifying both it's
amplifying our power to do well and our
power to do harm but the fact that we
also have an a choice each time is a new
good that that's a good that that in
itself is an unalloyed good the fact
that we have another choice and that
additional choice tips that balance just
tiny
in one direction towards a net good so
you you have the power to do evil
expended you have the power to do good
expended you think that's the wash but
in fact that we now have a choice that
we did not have before and that tips it
very very slightly in the category of
the some of good so I think over time we
are generating new technologies we're
producing all new problems most of the
problems we have today are techno genic
meaning that they were created by
technology in the past most of the
problems in the future are going to be
created by technologies we're creating
today so technology is a means of
producing new problems it's a means of
producing new solutions but the fact
that we have a choice between those two
is what tips the bounce very very
slightly in the favor of the good for
the long term so I think over
civilization scale we have this net tiny
incremental accumulation of these
choices over time and that tiny
accumulation is what we call progress
you know if you'd have one percent
compounded annually that can be very
very powerful it doesn't seem like very
much what's 1 percent but when you
compound these accumulation of choices
and options over time that's what I call
that's what civilization is it's the
slow accumulation of a very tiny
increase in new choices over time yes
technology will at times obliterate some
choices but the net gain over time is a
small advantage in new choices and
that's what I think civilization is it's
an accumulation of increasing choices
and I think that's why people move from
cities to I mean move from countries
into the cities there are lots of
reasons but I think in the end that the
main the main motivator is a pulling of
people moving to a city because it has
more choices and options than they had
in their beautiful country home and I
think that's what the future is doing
the same thing with pulling people from
the past
to the future because very few people go
back the other way and live like their
their ancestors because the future has
more choices and possibilities and I
think that is what in the end given
everything else about technology that's
what it gives us that's that's why we
keep making this stuff it's not really
to sell more things it's not really I
mean it's about all those things but
primarily what it is is is what we're
doing with technologies were many new
possibilities that did not exist before
I think I think there are I think there
in technology there's two strands
there's evolutionary change in there's
developmental change just like in our
own bodies most of what we experience as
individuals is developmental so while
we're growing up we start off as an ache
and you become a blast yes and then we
could become an embryo and become a
fetus and then newborn and so that that
trajectory is is is a very determined
and it's developmental and then there is
also within us there's these other
forces of mutation in our genes which
are more evolutionary and I think a lot
of what we see in technology is actually
not evolutionary is actually
developmental meaning that if we were to
look at a thousand or a million
different planets with sentient life and
civilizations we would find that there's
a kind of develop a general
developmental course for the the course
of technology on a planet in the sense
that you would have a natural occurrence
of you know pottery before you have
electronics you know whatever it is that
they're certain precursors to certain
technologies and I think the same thing
is happening right now on the growth of
this connected world that there is
certain developmental stages and part of
this is a kind of as a cyclic thing
where
there's a period of openness and then a
period of consolidation and in a period
of then the next Rev of that is open
while things kind of said a lot and then
that becomes consolidated and there is a
sort of respiration cycles and I think
we've been through several of those
already one of them was kind of female
and the openness of email and then you
had these kind of closed copy serve and
and prodigy in Al and then there was
this blossoming of the web which was all
first and open very chaotic and with
with very few rules and then there was
consolidation and we have the closed
kind of cultivated curated worlds of
Facebook and Google+ and then the next
stage will likely be again a very open
and wild and crazy and chaotic place
while things are being sorted out and
that would likely itself collapse again
into more enclosed and proprietary
systems as people figure out what it is
that they want to do and I think people
tend to right now to think that the
future of the web is web - oh it's like
a better web well when we when the web
was first coming out I know I went back
to the early issues of Wired and time
all the time magazines and news weeks
and the newspapers trying to find out
what people thought the web was gonna be
before it was and what generally people
thought including to some extent myself
was it was gonna be better TV it was
like TV - oh that's what the web was to
us was you know five thousand different
sources giving you the specialty
information about you know there would
be a horse channel and a dog channel and
a calf Channel and uh and a salt what
would or aquarium channel and all these
things would be coming down and there'd
be providing all the stuff and you could
get it all in your home but of course
that missed the entire real evolution of
the web which was that it's all going to
be coming most of the content would be
generated by the people using it so the
web was not better TV was the web and
now we think about the future the web we
think is good
the better web it's gonna be web - oh
but it's not it's good to be as
different from the web as web was from
the TV and so I think in in that next
stage it's also going to be a very
frontier like situation where there is
there's openness there's lawlessness
there's land grabs there there is a
sense in which great uncertainty and a
new wealth and the resistance of the
established players trying to bend
things in their direction and then the
next step after that will be collapsed
and consolidation of that frontier ago
if we went back if we took it we were
sent back with a time machine back even
20 years and reported to people what we
have right now and describe what we were
going to get in this device in our
pocket which is you know we'd have this
free encyclopedia and we'd have this
street maps - most of the cities of the
world and we'd have box scores in real
time and stock quotes and weather
reports the PBS or every manual in the
world and we'd make this very very very
long list of things that we would say we
would have and we could get on this
device in our pocket and then we would
tell them that most this country was
free you would you would simply be
declared insane they say there's no
economic model to make this how what is
the ax-cut what is the economics of this
it doesn't make any sense and it doesn't
make any sense and and it seems
far-fetched and nearly impossible and I
think that the next 20 years are gonna
pay out we're gonna make this last 20
years just pay all that that we're just
at the beginning of the beginning of all
these kind of changes I mean there's a
sense in which all the big things have
happened but I think nothing big has
happened relatively yeah
and that all the that in twenty years
from now we'll look back and say well
nothing really happened in the last
twenty years I think that the issue of
managing attention on the web and the
server overwhelming ocean of information
that we're generating and this
relentless firehose of new stuff making
it very difficult to for anybody younger
all to kind of pay attention to a long
form is it's a great challenge and and I
think it's also uncertain which way will
go is it is it sort of something
inherent in this new technology that's
going to make this always difficult or
is this again a phase that will go
through and people will get tired of it
and return back to things I think I
think we don't know we could go either
way and I have I would have arguments
for both sides the the argument on the
side that there is still an appetite for
long formulas is to is to think about
the the appeal of some of these long
cereal movies like gloss which is a
hundred plus hours of very complicated
narrative that if you presented that
again twenty years ago nobody anybody in
TV or movies would have told you that no
one's gonna pay attention to a hundred
plus hour movie but but you have these
very long serials and with a continuous
narrative thread through it and and
they're very very complicated with many
different plant lines and people love
them so there's there's an example of
things becoming more complicated and
with recording more and more attention
so I you know will books be able to
regain that that place or a long
narrative like books I don't know but I
think part of it is a change in in the
format I mean I you know I know that my
kids and all their friends none of them
not only don't read book
but what's interesting to me is that
they're not watching television and the
regular broadcast variety and they're
not even even movies aren't central to
them
what's central to their if you if you
look at them and watch or listen to what
they're talking about they're discussing
what they saw on YouTube that's that's
the center of the culture and you know
that's very that's a very kind of bleak
prospect for people who really want to
go deep with ideas but I think that's
not I don't think that's really a
statement about the short form of it
right now I think it's a statement about
the accessibility of it the
digestibility and and I actually think
that we could see in a YouTube that was
better and improved tablets new forms of
animation rendering understanding
actually how we learn I I think there's
great potential in there to have a new
form for for deeper understanding that's
not the kind of flat book and it's not
the kind of linear TV show or a video
it's it's something else and again I
think we're going to be surprised right
now because we think that the choices
are either it's its TV which doesn't
seem to work for conveying information
movies which don't seem to be that much
better books which had a great
reputation in pass and are no longer so
popular it's we had we are going to make
something other we're we're going we're
gonna use technology to kind of arrange
how we present deep ideas and have
people spend the time necessary to to
master them I I don't think it's a
matter of these either gonna be books or
video that the neither those are gonna
go here's something else I think
interesting everybody who's watching me
right now you and I we thought we all
spent
for maybe more five years with
deliberate study and training to learn
how to read and write and that process
of learning how to read and write
actually has rewired our brains we know
that from plenty of studies of literate
and illiterate people from the same
culture that reading and writing changes
how you have how you how your brain
works
and that was only came about because of
three or four or five years of
deliberate practice and study and I
think that we shouldn't expect
necessarily that the real mastery of
these new media is something we can just
by hanging around you know you can't
learn calculus just hanging around
people who who know calculus you
actually have to study it and it may be
that for us to really master a
particularly master the issues of
attention management critical thinking
learning how technological devices work
and how they bite back all this
technology may we be something that we
have to spend several years being
trained to do and so um it may not maybe
you can't just learn it by eye you know
hanging around people who do it or else
just hanging around trying to learn by
osmosis it may require a training in
teaching a techno literacy and that
learning how to manage your your
attention and and and distractions is
something that is probably going to
require training III think that that you
know the the technical literacy goes for
not just consuming the media but also
creating it and that we're in this we're
in this era the prosumer there's this
toffler's term of of the people who
consume it also being that produced
people who produce it and that you're
both producing and consuming at the same
time and I think the whole maker
movement is another great evidence that
we're in this kind of pursue Moreira
where
some of the artificial divisions that we
had in the kind of industrial society
where there was producers and consumers
and they were separate camps were build
it more back to a previous error or the
hunter-gatherers where people made the
stuff that they consume and I and I
think in a curious way this technology
can offer us more access to that I I
think certainly most of the things we're
going to be producer going to be made by
robots and automation but we can modify
them and we can change them and we can
be involved in the co-production of them
to a degree that we couldn't in the
Industrial Age and that's true not just
for media and liquid and tangible things
but also for tangible things and that's
the that's the sort of the promise of 3d
printing and robotics and all these
other high-tech material sciences which
is is that it's going to become as
malleable using the internet and AI and
connection the physical world will be as
malleable for us when we have help of
these tools as the intangible world has
been and that n and so that error of the
prosumer can return but I think to do
that again this is not going to happen
by osmosis I think it will take training
I think it will take teaching it will
take education will take a literacy a
techno literacy to learn how this work
how this world works to learn that these
technologies have bite back that they
have feedback that they have issues to
learn that there's restrictions and
there's costs and all this stuff that
this is many um you know for a long time
economist studying the new economy had
its saying that you know you can see
everywhere you can see computers
everywhere except in the
tivity sistex in the sense that that
they were there it took a long time and
we're still in that process of seeing
the payoff from computers and so there
there are there are while there's
internet speed of life which is going
very fast we are biological beings and
there's generations of investment
infrastructure that will take a long
time to pay off and so III think that in
a certain sense were it'll take us
another generation before we actually
understand what the web is so so so so I
so I do I do think there is a huge lag
between the arrival and our use of
something and our complete understanding
of it and what its role is what it means
and its effects plus and minus and so
and I think that gap even when we speed
up just going to remain that is still
going to be there still gonna be a gap
between our our placement of it and our
acceptance of it so the acceptance comes
first but I think this is actually
important because that's you know I did
a study of technology looking at
prohibitions which don't work they
they're always postponements we can't we
can't regulate technology by prohibiting
it we have to only regulate it by use we
have to use things in order to steer
them or rearrange them where we assign
them we can't we can't manage our our
technology by not using it by
prohibiting them by outlawing I think
that it's important that we understand
that the proper way and the best way the
most efficient way for us to manage and
regulate and control our technology is
not by surrendering it and giving it up
relinquishing it or prohibiting it the
only the primary way we want to do this
is by engaging with it being constantly
vigilant and
working with it using it and through use
that we can actually steer it so I think
there's a couple couple really long-term
trends going on which is in in
civilization in society which is that
over time more and more of our
activities as students became monetized
the money they did in and money is
really kind of not really about values
about it's a type of communication
that's the kind of excitement right now
about Bitcoin Bitcoin has many things
but among the many things that it is is
a it's it's a it's a illumination of
money as communication so just like you
couldn't encrypt communication now you
can encrypt money you can make it
anonymous you can do all these things
that we used to do with communications
and that we can deal with money it
happens off to be you know speculative
and and other things but but the
important thing is is that it's kind of
communication and that kind of
communication of monetization is
entering more and more of our life and
so used to be that you know granny would
teach the recipe to somebody and now
granny charges money and then you know
would be babysitting and things that you
would do in a kind of a sharing economy
would become monetized but one of the
things we saw with this new technology
was a return to the kind of bartering in
exchange without money that had existed
before but then of course the immediate
response try to monetize that sharing by
others and so I think over time I would
expect you know in two hundred years
that monetization would have crept into
more of the world but also the options
to remove oneself from that in some way
would also continue to expand that we
would have more choices about whether we
want to monetize our attention or not
whether we wanted to monetize what we
shared or not and that that again is
this idea that what we're doing
he's expanding the possibilities so
monetization is going to happen and
there the second reason why I think
monetization will creep in is because we
are using this technology to basically
invent new ways to collaborate and we
had kind of a limited number of ways to
do that say in the past errors you had
government which was one way to
collaborate and just to do things on a
social scale and then you had
corporations and neither of those were
sufficient and then you hit the market
which was this other kind of institution
that was also monetized and I think what
we're doing right now is we're trying to
invent other forms of collaborative work
other forms of doing social enterprise
and some of them are other forms of
businesses and some of them are other
hybrids and we have nonprofits which
often very monetized
and we have these other collectives like
Wikipedia's and Linux's and open-source
which are kind of not you have Burning
Man is style things of zones so the the
real excitement I think is looking for
ways to collaborate together some of
which will have money involved and some
of us will have a deliberate refusal of
certain aspects of money but I think um
to lump them all together as kind of
consumerism in corporate ISM is not
really gonna be useful IIIi think I
think it's better to understand these as
as the this detecting I'm trying to
explore the different ways in which you
can arrange peoples work and the credit
and and and the sustenance that flows
through them to keep them going and and
people are very I think very eager to
try
forms of transactions and forms of work
that aren't in the old model that still
work and so money is involved and money
will always you know propel things but I
don't think that that is really the best
way to think about what's going on
because it because if you stand back
it's just a much more interesting
variety of being of things being tried
one is one of the kind of effects of
this network economy in this network
grow that you make is that it's very
common to see these network effects to
kick in where you have you know the more
get more and they grows bigger and
bigger the more you have the more
attractive you become and the more
people will you get and the more people
you get the more attractive it is and so
you have these explosions these
exponential explosions of networks which
is how Microsoft get really big its how
Google's getting big and Facebook and
they're all operating the same thing but
what I always told people was that this
kind of natural monopolies first of all
it was natural it was it was has nothing
to do with coercion of scalping
customers it was it was a phenomena that
all networks show that there was going
to be these winner-take-all things but
that the same forces that moved him to
making them very large will also help
them unravel just as fast and so these
are these are these are temporary
successes in a certain sense and that
that just as fast as they can grow they
can collapse just as fast blackberry and
so I think I think we should be too
envious of that kind of scale income
because it's a very ephemeral thing and
it's a very natural thing and a very
ephemeral thing and the other thing
about this winner-take-all phenomena is
is that at first there's a kind of we
have a natural reaction saying well you
know winner-take-all the zone can be one
winner but here's here's what technology
is doing technology is actually
increasing the number of races in which
you can win so
there's more more niches and more and
more places in which the technology
creates new waves in which one can win
so there isn't a finite number of
winners there's an infinite number of
winners as long as you're not trying to
win someone else's a race and so the the
way everybody can become a winner is is
is that you keep increasing the number
of ways to play even though you have
these winner-take-all phenomenons so
there's only gonna be one probably one
search winner but there are so many
other ways to race and and and and and
to win other than it's a search and in
most of the cases you know trying trying
to compete against a winner is not good
at succeeding this kind of dynamic what
you want to do is you want you want to
kind of make up a new way I think I
think the current and fashion with
Twitter and to some extent Facebook is
is people kind of exploring this mode
but I it again if we it will remain as a
pasta as an option for others but for
everyone in the future and so will
blogging and so will writing books and
so will youtube and so on I mean what
we're doing is we're increasing the
modes and right now there's a huge kind
of flurry of activity is people kind of
explore what can you do with Twitter and
that's what's going on and then we'll
kind of learn what we can do with
Twitter and it will be in the context of
what we can do with blogging in books
and other things I don't think it's
going to I think in ten years from now
where I can have any conversations about
Twitter just like people aren't really
talking about blogs now it's it's just
it's going to kind of work its way
through and will understand that it's
another option in this kind of growing
spectrum which will increase because in
ten years to another is gonna be
something else that everybody's gonna be
doing and people will will talk about
the girl taste with Twitter right people
were just only Twitty
and I think that right now people are
trying to figure out what can you do
with it what how far can you take
Twitter how far can you go just twinning
and I think that's a wonderful thing to
to kind of explore even socially and so
it doesn't mean that the whole world and
the whole media world is only gonna be
twittering I think that's that's really
short-sighted because these things don't
go that way what happens is they become
another option in the spectrum that
people have and you know it's look how
fast blocks came in god they didn't
actually go away there's still blogs
there but they're they're just in that
in that little pallet of things that you
use together and some people were better
at than others that was okay so I'm not
so upset by it there is a lot concern
about you know teenagers playing 40 or
50 hours wasting time on a game or
commenting on reddit or whatever and
what what it turns out is is is that you
know they talk about addiction internet
addiction which I don't really believe I
mean I think there are occasional cases
but most the time it's done it's young
people who are becoming obsessed about
something and they're and I think in
that obsession is a tremendous force
because I think real creativity comes in
when you're wasting time and when you're
fooling around without a goal and I
think this kind of obsession has a
little bit of that sense where you're
just doing things because you're
compelled to without a goal and I think
that's we're often real exploration and
learning and new things come from and so
I'm and I think even as a society we can
have temporary obsessions with something
that we will work through and I think
that's one way in which the society can
that can explore an idea call them fads
whatever but I think tour more I think
they're actually more productive than
just being a
think of them as a fad I think of them
as kind of a compulsion that is trying
to explore something right now there was
a compulsion about how do you what can
you do with hundred forty characters and
we'll kind of work through that and
we'll say well here's what you can do
but that's about it I think the Internet
is sort of the world's largest copy
machine what with the net does is it
copies things when you're send a message
to anybody else that's being copied in
between take a picture and you posting
it it's being copied all along the way
and so anything that can be copied will
be copied on the Internet and anything
that touches the internet it'll be
copied so it's oh that's what it wants
that's what it does and so you you have
to have an economy based around things
other than copies because copies are so
prolific that they're valueless they're
worth nothing so you don't want to
protect them you want it you want to
earn money through generative x' and
other things other than copies things
that are hard to copy that's how you
make money and I think the same thing is
true about tracking I think the internet
wants to track just like it wants to
copy things and I think it's gonna be
very very difficult to prevent this
thing that we're on all the time 24
hours 7 days a week from tracking
because it want it's all the
technologies from sensors to
quantification digitization
communication wireless connection all
this stuff wants to track and so it's
going to track we're going to track
ourselves we're going to track each
other government corporations are going
to track us and I think we can't really
get out of that and I think what we can
try and do is
civilize and make a convivial kind of
tracking and I think there are some I
think some things we can try in that
department and one is maintaining
symmetry so so we want to have covalence
rather than surveillance we want we want
to be able to watch who's watching us
track who's tracking us
tract what they're tracking track how
accurate it is corrected if if needed
and and benefit from it in a kind of a
peer-to-peer way I think that's a much
more likely regime that could be
productive than having a one-way
asymmetrical surveillance which is
they're tracking us we don't know what
they are looking at we have no benefit
from it we can't correct it you know we
don't even know who they are and so
that's the that's the negative side
that's the to me that the harmful side
of it I know but I think there's other
things we can do besides the symmetry
and I think I do think we need
regulation and when there may have to be
portions of our lives that are private
and so in combination with this I think
we can manage this ubiquitous tracking I
don't think we can stop the ubiquitous
tracking so I think in terms of the NSA
I think what we want is you want to say
yes okay you're tracking us but you know
if there's a watchlist
we you have to be countable and you you
have to there has to be it can't be
secret and outside of any kind of
accountability we have to have it be
symmetrical we have to understand why
it's there what the rules are if it's
incorrect we can correct it there has to
be ways to appeal with all this kind of
stuff and so that's the kind of world
that I think would make this a
productive type and in terms of
corporations which are doing the same
things there has to be more of work at
making it transparent both ways so that
if we're going to be transparent in our
owns we have to be transparent with what
happens with this information and I go
along with what Jaron Lanier says which
is there should be benefits it should be
Co benefits in that sense of if my data
is being useful to others and I should
be actually benefit from that
there should be mechanisms to try and
make sure that that that the data that I
am allowing to be tracked and that I am
even self tracking myself when it's
beneficial that I partake in in that
value so again there has to be that kind
of symmetry and I think if we understand
that then I think we'll be a lot further
along and making this productive I think
what's not gonna work is trying to
prohibit this tracking because I think
that's like trying to prohibit things
from being copied I just don't think
it's gonna work so I actually think that
the leaks are inevitable and I think of
leaks is sort of like when would this
way us just have a policy of Smokey the
Bear zero-tolerance for fire and so fire
was bad there was no good fires and that
you you know you were scolded into
preventing forest fire well what that
did was that it's suppressed the
wildfires instead of built up this huge
Bank of flammable material so when a
fire did come in it just destroyed
everything and I think that's what the
NSA and three-letter agencies are
experiencing is is that they're trying
to be secret and you can't be secrets
when everything again the internet wants
to copy stuff they're running on the
internet it's going to be copied and so
rather than kind of trying to suppress
the leaks they and then having this once
every 10 year wildfire conflagration
consume them which is what they're
having with Snowden they should be
themselves allowing and permitting and
managing these revelations themselves
and kind of control burns and so they
should actually have a department of you
know intentional leaks or something
where they are working with agencies
like WikiLeaks the stuff which they
eventually will have to do so that's the
curious thing is that in fact the
agencies are now working with the
newspapers to manage these why don't
they do that before instead of now where
they're in a lower position they need
them to be active
about this and I understand that they
have to work with these agencies to
dispel and dispense these leaks so that
they don't build up into this terrible
terrible fuel bank that's just gonna
blow up when it does because it will
they will have leaks you cannot run
anything on the Internet and not have it
being copied and so I think the the the
the what you want to do is you want to
have you want to manage your leaks and
work with them and not consider these
things as treason you want to want to
have a whistleblowing program of which
Edward Snowden was and they should treat
this in a responsible manner as actually
doing something that they should be
doing and helping them in a certain
sense clear out this Deadwood and remain
legal and do things aboveboard and have
the support of the public behind them
fifteen years ago are both the new
economy book which was talking about the
way that the economic world was shift
unfortunately it was released right at
the peak of the dot-com era and
everybody at that time believed even
without reading the book that it was
talking about the dot-coms I didn't even
use a word calm I wasn't interested in
comms I was talking about the
reconfiguration of the economic
landscape due to this these network
effects due to the fact that you had
copies proliferating due to the fact
that we had a shift from places to
spaces due to the fact that we had the
free and we had two numbers that were
not common in business before now
becoming essential free and infinite
zero and infinity we're now parts of the
equations as you thought about things
price is going to the free infinity
being the sense of the scaling potential
of a network and I think all those
things I was talking about took a long
time to kind of play out but they're
actually more more valid now and
I'm having the book translated into
Chinese and I just read it the other day
and I there's almost nothing I would
change about it it's up for a couple of
examples of companies that aren't around
in 15 years like what one of the things
I was trying to say in the new economy I
said it in the first couple of pages was
that um you should run your business as
if it was a software company no matter
what your business was basically the
software would eat everything that that
the the dynamics of the intangible world
of code would really become the dynamics
of everything that this stuff is
software and code and information would
become the primary avenues of wealth
whether you were in chemicals or
transportation healthcare you know
farming whatever it is that these were
going to become dominated by these
intangibles and so therefore
understanding how the economy of
intangibles worked was essential and
that's becoming very very very clear now
and it's so so the new new economy now I
think that we're headed into is one
where it's being run by big data which
isn't intangible
so that's the that's the real real
revolution happening right now I
actually think it's a buzzword but I
think it's actually justified as being
something you should pay attention to
because I think we're in the period now
where we're data huge dimensions of data
and the variables in real time is really
the fundamental element for making
wealth for for capturing moving
processing enhancing managing data and
rearranging it is just as we used to
rearrange atoms now it's all about
rearranging data I think that is is
really what we see in the next 10 years
I think that's what these networks are
going to do is they're going to kind of
release data from language to make it
machine readable and we combine it in an
infinite number of
is that we're not even thinking about
but to do that will require a set of
tools that we don't have right now so I
think this data is operating in the
realm of Zilly onyx so we're beyond the
last prefix we had of you know the X
Yoda Lada it's it's we don't even have
scientific prefixes for the the the the
orders of magnitude of this data that
we're gonna be generating and having to
manage in real time and I don't think we
even have mathematics right now to do
this at the level of you know 10 to the
23rd or whatever it is that we're gonna
be headed toward and and that that is
both an opportunity and a challenge for
business I think it was Jacob Appelbaum
I can't remember his name at Facebook
who said that the best minds of his
generation we're trying to get people to
click on ads and Neal Stephenson's and
others the science fiction writer have
tried to suggest that we all should step
up and think big and not just be
concerned with these very kind of
commercial and pedestrian and immediate
and next quarter concerns but really
think out it's a generational or
civilizational scale and I and I applaud
that a hundred percent I think there is
a tendency right now to short-term
thinking to be concerned about something
that will work and scale up within 5
years or whatever and I think that is I
think that is a bad habit for us and I
think there is in in the culture right
now a definite short-term bias that is
unproductive for the long term and it's
hard to convince people to take that
long-term perspective because the future
is so uncertain it's like not just like
the world could end but even if the
world in end you know are people who are
still gonna carry things in their pocket
in ten years will will
you know well Wi-Fi even be around why
should I try and you know master this
and so I think and the the uncertainty
of the future is really working against
taking long term perspectives and yet
they're they're evermore needed and so
III do think that that we I think if I
was a young person I think daring to
transcend the short term daring to think
about something that might take 10 years
to do like Elon Musk is doing with his
electric cars or his crazy super tunnels
and stuff or going to the moon again or
Mars
I think these really should be our
people like that should be our role
models because we have we have the the
capability to do that but it requires a
certain kind of discipline to know to
first all those immediate rewards and go
for something that will take ten years I
think there's a lot of art being made
now and some of the best art I mean III
would say that some of these serial TV
programs you know the loss the wire will
go down in history
next to Dickens and Shakespeare I think
they were comparable I think they're
comparable in their achievement and I
and I think you know there will be
university courses and professors
specializing and studying them with just
as they have you know Dickens experts
and so I think I think we are producing
art and there's lots of room to do that
although maybe our society is not
honoring the the artists maybe as much
as it once did but I think it's I don't
think of art as kind of like opera and
you know maybe even poetry the Nobel
Prize for poetry should go to Bob Dylan
because that's the poetry after needs
since songs it's
lyrics and so I I think people are doing
art in our society is producing art but
sometimes they maybe it's not called
that it may take a while for us to
recognize it there's no reason why you
can't have great artists making web
pages and so but I think sometimes our
definition or an image of an art artist
is somebody who is outside a little bit
who is maybe doing things speaking truth
to power in some ways provoking the
society in a certain direction and I III
think we need those but I don't think
they're gonna be outside of the the
cultural medium I think they're going to
be working inside it to be effective and
so I do expect the artists to be working
on an iPhone and a tablet in some sense
of sooner that's a really great question
is how one can protest against the
system when it seems impossible even to
communicate without it or some senses
you know be a modern person without it
you could say well the Amish are
protesting at some census so they're out
of it but their protest is very feeble
III think I think it it will be hard to
to do that but I do know something about
differences in and it's not just how do
you protest outside the system it's like
how do you remain different because I
think going back to what the new economy
is powered by new the new economy is
powered by differences the difference
that makes a difference as the Bateson
definition and but it's not just
difference is connected difference
that's so like you know the aboriginals
and some
remote Amazon drugs will have a very
different viewpoint of the world they
have a set of knowledge it's that's
that's separate from science its
semantic knowledge and it's very deep
and consistent within there within our
system but because it's not connected to
us
it doesn't really this doesn't really
affect the rest of the world the real
key is to remain different while you're
connected so the problem with being
connected is it tends to homogenize
everybody so everybody wants to kind of
you know there's there's pressure to be
the same if you're connected and then we
see that with you know me you go to any
large city around the world and there is
a kind of there's a uniformity of what
that downtown may look like but so
connection tends to drive things to
uniformity but the the value the power
of being connected is by remaining
different so there's this conundrum this
dilemma of remaining different walk
connected because if you're just
different but not connected there's no
power then that's actually easy to do
but can you remain different while
connected so you're a little bit
different you're different into certain
degrees yet you're you're part of the
uniform standard so it's like you don't
want to make up new words that don't
mean anything you want to make you want
to write a book that uses the standard
words in the dictionary so you're gonna
make you're gonna be different while
connected you're connected to the
English language but you're gonna be
different with those and so I think
that's the challenge for artists or even
protestors to some extent even those who
are trying to some you know to change
things is that you want to be connected
and yet remain different and I think
that's a tremendous trick and a
tremendous challenge and requires a
certain art in your life but I think
that's what it will be is is different
while connect so the question is is in
this kind of network economy which is
basically being run by commercial
enterprises rather than say the
government
which presumably the government would
have a I mean somebody's always gonna be
the boss so if it's not commercial
assisted government and it's and you'd
have the same problem about if you were
a protester or if you were doing things
it's like you can only do things that
the government's gonna allow you to do
the government feels that you are
threatening to them you can't say
anything they'll put you in jail and so
Gandhi in the civil disobedience people
were you know worked within the context
of the laws of the British Empire
knowing what was acceptable and what
wasn't they were always kind of playing
that edge now we have we corporations
have a lot more power and will continue
to have probably more power in a network
economy and so there we're kind of like
you can only do things that are kind of
viewed within the terms of agreement
with the corporations and otherwise
they'll kick you off and you know
they're all the time you know taking
down material closing email accounts
preventing PayPal payments and which we
saw with Wikipedia is there are there
other ways around that though well
actually in a certain sense I think
there's more avenues to work around that
than there is to work around a
government you know if if the US
government decides to go after you
you're there's really no way to escape
if Google's the science closed down
there we actually we do have other
technical avenues you can actually still
have an email you can still send
somebody something that you wouldn't be
able to do if the government was running
this enterprise and so in a certain
sense as onerous as it is to have
corporations running and there and there
may be less accountable in a certain
sense that's still better than I think
than having only in the government run
it which kind of what you see in China
so I'm going to China you know twice a
year or more in Asia a lot
yeah Korea I'm going there I married
into the to the culture and I think I
think the average American doesn't
really appreciate how fast things are
changing in these countries changing in
the sense of moving from being a very
recent resource intense copy culture to
you know moving to intangibles and
service economy and trying to be
innovative and I think I think that that
transition will come maybe as a surprise
to people sooner than that most people
think and already you know the military
power will come with it and the serve
supremacy had Johnny the kind of
exceptionalism of America it will be
challenged and I think this is actually
good for the world
III I think I think it will require a
recalibration of America's role in in
the world and and I think this will
actually be a benefit for Americans and
for the rest of the countries and the
peoples of the world
Freeman Tysons bit of a challenge about
whether the universe as a whole was
ultimately fundamentally at its essence
discrete or continuous was it was it
really Edison's was a sort of binary in
a sense of information or was it analog
in a sense of waves and wavicles and
and was continuous if it was if it was a
unbroken unquantified field and I I
don't have any intuition one way the
other and he is a better judge of that
but I do think it could make a huge
difference in our understanding of the
world
I would I would bet that the digital
wins that that I mean if I had to make a
bet on which way it is I would I would
suspect that it's that it's a binary
digital world in the sense that it's
this information based I don't think we
know what information is I think it's a
huge mystery and but but I think that
over time will begin to recast and
translate physics in terms of
information and I could be wrong but if
I had to make it bet I would bet on the
digital the universe is digital this
this pen is seems very simple but it
actually probably took a hundred
different technologies to make this pen
technology technologies of plastic ink
ball bearing metal and each of those
different technologies probably
themselves required another hundred sub
technologies to support it and of course
there's a kind of a circular way in
which pens might be necessary to make a
ball bearing in the same way that
electricity is necessary to make a
generator and a generator may be
necessary to make the wires of
electrical system hammer requires handle
the head
and the saw requires the hammer to make
the saw that cuts the handle so there is
a sense in which all this is very
recursive and that there is a network of
different supporting technologies and
that the whole web of all these things I
call the Technium so the Technium is
that largest network of all the
technologies working together to support
each other and while this pen is
definitely not alive there is a sense it
was the Technium as a whole exhibits
lifelike behaviors in the same way that
you know the Uni or neuron doesn't
really think but the network of neurons
in your brains can make an idea and so
I'd look at the network of all the
technology in the world
past and present as forming a system
that seems to have its own urges and
tendencies like any kind of of a system
it will have certain ways that is biased
to and that those biases are inherent in
the system and doesn't really matter who
is living or not it's it's a systems
bias and so the question I've been
asking is what are the biases of the
system of all the technologies in the
world together and if we can understand
what those systems what those biases are
then we would have some idea of where
it's leaning towards and where generally
wants to go and not surprisingly since I
see this as a lifelike system I also
think that its origins is is in life
that it that is in a certain sense this
system this tech Technium is an
extension of the same forces that
self-organized into life and that is
continuing through the Technium so that
it is inherently not anti life it's
actually very much derived from and
compatible with living things and that
it's doing in terms of the cosmos the
view of the cosmos is actually
continuing and accelerating the things
that life and evolution
we're doing on the planet and so it's
moving in certain directions and I would
say that if we were to make a list of
kind of where it's going is not a
destiny but a kind of direction that is
moving towards more complexity it's
moving towards more sentience or more
mind it's moving towards more
specialization it's moving towards more
energy density and it's there's a whole
set of things that life is also moving
towards and that if we want to imagine
where light with what technology will be
in a hundred years or thousand years we
can go down the list and say it's going
to be more complex than it is today
there's going to be more minds and
artificial Minds everywhere it's going
to be whatever we make today we're going
to have more specialized versions up in
the future that it becomes more butanol
or dependent on other technologies and
that we ourselves our society but will
become more mutualistic so these are all
some of the things that I would say
technology wants because the system
itself is biased in these directions
inherently outside of what humans like
us want they're interesting thing about
about China ancient China because
ancient China if you read through the
history almost every single major
invention of the world was invented in
China first and sometimes it took
hundreds of years for either to make its
way to Western Europe or to be
reinvented in Western Europe and that
includes you know paper printing the
steel gunpowder or the compass rudder
you know suspension bridges whatever
there was there's it's almost everything
and for a long time trying to lead the
world of civilization because it it was
able to make these things long before
anyone else but there was one invention
that the China did not invent and it
would turned out to be the most
important invention
and that was the invention of the
scientific method so there's a there's
still a question about why China did
invent that invention but that invention
was invented in the West and because of
that one invention the West suddenly had
the power to had a method for inventing
new things in finding new things that
was so superior that it just blew past
all the great inventions of China
invented so many more things because of
this the power that's one invention and
that invention the scientific method is
not a single thing it's it's actually a
process with many ingredients and the
scientific method itself is actually
been changing so in the very beginning
was very simple a couple of processes
like controlled experiment having a
control being able to repeat things
having to have a proof and we tend to
think of the scientific method as serve
up a whole as fixed in time with a
certain you know character but in fact
lots of things that we assume or we now
associate with the scientific method
we're only invented recently some of
ammonius as recently as 50 years ago
things like a double-blind experiment or
the invention of the placebo or random
sampling were all incredibly recent
additions to the scientific method and
in in 50 years from now the scientific
method will have changed more than it
has in the past 400 years just as
everything else has so the scientific
method is still changing over time it's
an invention that we invent and they
were still evolving and replicating it's
a technology it's a it's a process
technology but it's probably the most
important process in technology that we
have but that is still undergoing
evolution refinement and advancement and
that we are adding new things to this
invention we're adding things like a
triple blind experiment or
multiple authors or it's quantified self
where you have experiments of N equals
one we're doing things like saving
negative results and transmitting those
there's there's many many things
happening with the scientific method
that itself is a technology that we're
also changing and will prove over time
and that will affect all the other
technologies that we make my definition
of technology is anything a mind
produces and so I think III have a very
broad scope of technology and I would
say that the first technologies actually
came from animals as soon as we had
minds they began to produce so in a
certain sense a collective mind of a and
he'll mix or tournaments can make a
skyscraper it's kind of like the the
external phenotype
you could have birds weave they do weave
they weave nests beavers engineer dams
and that just as we you know had an
external phenotype that we made with our
own minds we made technology and tools
it's anything that is being produced by
our minds and that would include not the
individual works of art but the the
technologies of art and painting and
symphonies these were all in some senses
technologies in in the sense that they
are products of our mind and not just a
personal expression but but something
that's useful and so I think that
intangibles like a calendar are
technology software Allah sees the
technology infrastructures like roads
and in a library these are these are
technological inventions and so it's a
very broad definition saying that things
that Minds produce in and I would
suggest in the future when we have
robots in a is that the things the
inventions that these minds will make
will also be
technologies and so that's what
technology is I don't think there's any
difference between a tool and technology
it's and this is what tools are tools
are technologies and so my book of cool
tools is a book of technologies which
can be intangibles and processes they
don't have to be hardware it's useful
stuff things that are useful and the
best tools or tools that enable other
tools there are possibilities and I
think of technologies as possibilities
that unleash future possibilities and
those are the great tools the thing
about Google is that it
Miep it's this way I think one of the
things that science does is is it's a
really curious thing that every time we
use science to try to answer a question
to to be the question we use it to to
give some answers to give us some
insight but invariably that insight or
answer provokes two or three other new
questions that's that anybody that works
in science knows that they were
constantly finding out what they don't
that they don't know more that increases
our ignorance and so in a certain sense
while science is certainly increasing
knowledge is actually increasing our
ignorance even faster so you could say
that the chief effect of science is to
the expansion of ignorance and in a
curious way Google is all about answers
and so you could say that Google is sort
of increasing answers over time but
what's interesting is that answers are
becoming cheap
almost free and I think what becomes
scarce in this kind of place that we're
headed to is questions a really good
question because a really good question
can unleash new questions and so in a
certain sense I think what becomes
really valuable in a world like Google's
running are great questions and that's
that's something if for a long time
humans will be better at than machines
machines are for answers humans are for
questions and so I think the world that
Google is constructing the world
three answers that that's having
interest not going to be very
significant or important having a really
great question will be where all the
value is Google's about answers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
