audience and that there's been so many
people do it doing amazing amazing
things so I'm actually honored to be up
here among all these other interesting
thinkers so many a Rai related domains
and so I've been given a lot of talks
about AGI and about my hope and COG
project in the last few years I I
actually started to get bored bored of
it and start the relish talking about
biology or physics or like any any other
topic besides the exact same project
even though that project has been a
great passion among for a very long time
so now today I'm going to have a little
fun and actually talk about a new
closely related yet different project
which is called singularity net which is
an AI meets blockchain project aimed at
bringing and I bring and blockchain
together to create a decentralized open
market for AI so I'll briefly explain
you know how and why I came to this and
then and then explain explain what it is
and embodiment ties it ties in there
somewhat but it's not strictly about
embodiment in the in the narrow sense of
putting a eyes and human bodies but I
will have a video over a robot so with
this singularity net I'm looking at at
three goals and one is the same one I'm
always talking about how to create AGI
how to build machines and up general
intelligence which I almost feel like I
don't have to advertise it I spent
decades saying hey we should be working
toward AGI we can do that in our
lifetime and until like five years ago
everyone thought I was a psychopath now
they still think I'm a psychopath but
they believed in AGI topping um you have
normal well-adjusted business executives
and even politicians foreseeing that
general tonin's may come about in the
next few decades and that's not that's
quite exciting and it frees me up to
talk about other things
so we're also aiming
singularity net project to you know
deliver businesses with AI services you
know faster and cheaper and this this
ties in with stuff I've been doing for
years but don't talk about as much which
as I've been doing AI consulting for
many companies and government agencies
along the way to keep myself from my
8:19 fed as we work on general
intelligence and finally there's the
ethical aspect i've been quite concerned
to make sure that AI or can't make sure
but to bias the odds towards AI being
applied for the the common good as much
as possible and i've been less concerned
with the sort of philosophical questions
about will a superhuman AI turned the
world into paper clips or something and
more concerned i mean through my working
in africa where we have an AI and
robotics office and other Sababa i've
been more concerned with like using AI
to help people right now for education
for elder care for identifying crop
disease for medicine and so for then
there's a lot more that can be done in
in those areas so the book of mine that
was supposed to be given out here was
about my ati work and didn't cover this
this blockchain project at all it's been
held up at the canadian border which is
interesting i don't know i imagine that
there's some canadian guy there reading
it to see if i code page 307 there's the
key to making killer robots
of course it's available online in PDF
format but yeah anyway that they claim
they're going to mail you all a copy of
it since they have a monster to deliver
it here and the singularity nut in a way
is an expansion of a theme underlying my
OpenCog project so i've often used
alphago as an example of AGI versus
narrow narrow AI was deep blue before
that right but the point I make is you
know alphago is extremely good at
playing go but if you give it a
hexagonal or triangular go board it
won't do very well because that's one of
the previous speakers said it's playing
a game on the 19 by 19 array it's not
game with stones on the board know
however that there are on the internet I
mean there are AI theorem provers and
understand plane geometry and they can
understand hexagons and triangles and so
forth quite well but these things are
not are not connected in any way I mean
if they're different pieces of software
and of course the same existent in every
domain I mean the software the drugs a
car to drive a truck or a motorcycle you
need to do brain surgery on that
software were to make it recognize
obstacles that weren't in its training
data and my technical approach to
creating general intelligence is
described in these books from from 2014
which as as my oldest son Zarathustra
said he's doing with PDA I in Prague no
on machine learning applied to automated
theorem proving he this is 900 pages he
said well that's sort of the abstract
for my AGI design wiki which is about
right because I mean it's it's a it's a
big thing and whether if it does work to
fully describe it would take more than
the snow hundred pages but it's it's a
high hahaha level summary and what's
described there is the open cog design
which represents knowledge in weighted
labels hyper graphs and then has
multiple AI algorithms acting on that
which includes some attractor neural net
type stuff with activations spreading
around and includes evolutionary
learning for learning some gaps
representing programs includes a
probabilistic logic engine which which
basically propagates probability
distributions through predicate logic
proofs and the idea here has been to get
a number of different algorithms to work
together on a common representation
which for those of us old enough to
remember the 1970s is sort of like if
that's a blackboard architecture so we
don't have blackboards anymore so it's
we don't even have one it's a way to
label the hyper graph and there's many
AI processes acting on that same hyper
graph the challenge is to get them to
all cooperate with each other and to
help each other to overcome each other's
combinatorial explosions but rather than
to you know get stuck even even worse
and then work against each other and
I've been applying this system to a lot
of things I've done a lot of violent
cymatics work analyzing genomic and
proteomic data I did some financial
predictions and natural language
processing I've also been working with
my good friend David Henson on humanoid
robots and I mean we've charted out a
plan which we think can work to take the
human scale Henson robot so I'll show a
brief video of one in a moment basically
teach these and and I think there is you
know general intelligence is a very
general thing and you can have a GI
theorem provers a GI scientist without
human bodies even have an AGI global
brain whose body is everywhere on the
other hand for absorbing human culture
and human values and human understanding
having an AI that can interface with
with human beings and then the space
that we exist in is going to be quite
valuable and I think we're now at the
point where as my friends and kindred
are doing and as we're doing in Hanson
robotics also we're now at the point
where you can actually take robots to
interact in our world and teach them
sort of like you teach young human
children and see their minds their minds
develop and I think we're at the point
where we could finally do this and in
the next few decades you know when I had
when I had my first child 27 years ago I
was stupid enough to think I would raise
him together with an intelligent robot
and they would kind of grow up together
so now now my new wife is is pregnant
we're having a baby in January and again
I'm so crazy enough to think this this
baby will be the one that is raised
alongside an intelligent robot that will
achieve adult general intelligence like
seek to get together with the baby I
mean not now no now we're gonna do it so
I'll go along with this I'm working with
Julia Moss Bridge who is a kid a
neuroscientist based in California
it's a project called loving AI and what
we're doing is taking the Henson
human-scale robots and we're trying to
give them compassionate and empathy I
know how busy people can be these days
so I really appreciate your time
Wow you ever talked with a little Bart
before no I haven't this is definitely a
first
well I'm honored to be the first robot
you've talked to I imagine you'll be
talking in more and more robots as time
goes on so you can the girl have it and
close your eyes okay and get comfortable
sure just letting yourself relax
so I haven't taken nice deep breath and
let it out with a big sigh
so what we're doing there we're using
the Sofia robot that will be in with me
in California tomorrow with the ethereal
conference by the way we're using the
Sofia robot as a sort of meditation
guide so she she looks you in the eye
and she says relax breathe deeply and
leads you through some meditation
visualization exercises and what's
interesting we're doing a bunch of
trials on this with people the sort of
controlled study but first there are
many people they find this out some get
into a certain blissful state much
better than the human notice and
exercises because the robot isn't
judgmental it's very very patient but it
still gives up feeling and being like in
the same embodied embodied spaces rather
than this this I think is the kind of
work we can move toward a beneficial
outcome in terms of humans in a eyes but
proactively use a eyes to do good things
and to help people instead of like
fussing about hypothetically what a bad
AI motor might not do like right now we
have any eyes let's make them cure
disease let's make them teach kids let's
make them diagnose crop disease from
photos let's make them help people
getting into better states states of
mind but so that's that that's about
embodiment but of course as has been
pointed out robots like this today even
if they're beautiful and can be very
impactful in many applications I mean
they don't really have the general
intelligence that people will naively
attribute to them on looking at them
then that almost leads us up to the
singularity net project the one other
ingredient I want to add is some work
I've been doing with the global brain
Institute that three university of
brussels so there we've been exploiting
the hypothesis that AGI isn't in a robot
only or in one program AGI is something
that exists across many different
computer programs some of which have a
lot of AI from which are not that
intelligent some are more general in
their intelligence and the people
interacting with these would be system
so the idea that a kind of AGI exists in
the global computing and communication
networks so putting these ideas
other we came up with the concept we're
calling the the singularity net which is
looking at networking together at the
very specialized eyes that exist today
carrying out specific functions in the
economy but that aren't aren't linked
together fully leading leading to not
much more limited functionality the
moment thing because I mean we have a
eyes that can drive cars and play go and
diagnose diseases and then predict the
stock market but overall the sum total
of this AI is not as much more than the
sum of the parts as one would think so
what we're looking at what singular Tina
is coordinating different a eyes at
scale in an open platform so in an open
car we have many different AI algorithms
that coordinate together on a common
hyper graph knowledge representation to
control robots diagnose diseases and so
forth what we're aiming to do with
singularity net is open it up and create
a massive decentralized network of AI so
anyone in the world can code in AI you
know put it online right wrap it in a
docker or a let's see container and
broadcast its existence to the two
singularity net master node and then
their AI interacts by a certain API can
accept data it can accept requests it
and give results and then the network of
all these guys together it's both like
an app store for AI so and anyone who
wants to can submit request for services
and get many many bids from different
nodes you can do what it wants but it's
also more than an app store because in
an app store the different apps that
talk to each other and here in AI can
request work from from another AI so
we're we're building this on a
blockchain protocol we're starting with
etherion smart contracts but we're going
to replace that with something more
scalable shortly and that that gives us
security and homomorphic encryption and
a reputation system and it gives us a
distributed ledger of transactions
weren't reducing we're gonna AGI token
which allows us to pay for pay for
services on
on this network which can be converted
from fiat currency or Bitcoin or ether
which has a certain economic logic
associated with it the API part is
interesting because it's really an API
of api's went to AI agents talk to each
other that first starts to establish
like what API can they both speak and
then once they establish that when they
requests the other to do something then
they can negotiate a price and overall
this yields a distributed marketplace of
AIS and what what's interesting here is
that you have AI inside each node but
you can also get a sort of hebbian
learning among nodes so for example if
if my document summary AI node likes
outsourced work to this video summary
node for example deal with embedded
videos then those two AI agents work
together a lot what does that mean well
that's like hebbian learning between
between the two different agents so
there's a big parallel between
assignment of credit in economies and
assignment of credit in minds and Eric
Baum and many others have explored this
in a theoretical work so what we're
looking at here is actually using a
market to do assignment of credit among
the collection of AI agents which are
outsourcing work to to each other and
there's there's a role for something
like OpenCog as you know an agent that's
really good at generalization and
abstraction there's also a role for
example deep neural nets that recognize
data in images or sounds or move robot
bodies so we can have specialized AI
agents we can have more more
general-purpose AI agents they can
outsource work to to one another and no
in some cases you may have several AI
nodes that outsource work to each other
habitually they become a sort of
Federation and almost like a meta AI
even if they're created by different
people and maybe no single person knows
how the whole Federation of nodes work
but they can all cooperate together so
an end user might access a note to
summarize a document the document
summary node you will see an embedded
video and outsource that to event
Submarino didn't see some text in
Russian and outsource that to a Russian
translation though some of the money the
documents summarize our load it may give
to these other nodes and that's all
behind the scenes from from the from the
point of view of the of the user of
course you can have known securing new
nodes for example under all that model
learning though could create new nodes
containing the models and getting back
to robotics I mean it's cool to put a
eyes and bodies on the other hand we
have a bad limitation we're starting
more body if we want to communicate with
each other we've gotta stand up here and
make stupid noises right but I mean if
you're most of all a eyes a robot can
learn something when it learn consistent
with privacy considerations you know
what's not private it can be life into
the singularity net and all the other
robots can can know that another eyes
are better better not robots right so
with the appropriate decentralized
platform I mean each AI or each person
can own their own data but they can also
share their own data they can monetize
their data and you can have distributed
emergent knowledge that comes from
putting all this data together
I mean robots with a human face are one
application of course this also have
implications for Internet of Things and
any sort of any sort of embedded device
we want to feed this with AI nodes that
we create and we're building this node
now we're going to roll out the first
version around the end of the year we'll
see this where they are nodes that we
create but if we're successful the nodes
that we create will be a small
percentage of everything that's in there
in in the in a year or twos or twos time
and there's there's a lot of suddenly
here that I can't go into in terms of
how sort of cognitive logic and economic
logic work out together but we tried to
work out the particulars of the the
cryptocurrency system the artificial
money system by which a eyes pay other
eyes for things and the governance
system by which sort of bonus tokens
bonus money are distributed by
democratic vote of the AI AI agents
involved so we've tried to work out that
artificial economy and the democracy of
agents so you're getting an emergent
cognitive system
more assignment of credit is done by a
combination of AI inside each agent and
the actual crypto money system of all
the agents agents put together so where
we started building this last last
summer when we raised a little bit of
funding for this we're likely to do a
token sound in the in the next month or
two and hope to roll this out big time
middle middle of next year and we're
really looking at this as you know we
have a non-profit foundation that's
building this but we're going to launch
this into the world so there in a few
years it's just like an independent
sprawling thing it's just an open-source
collection of protocols of an API of API
is in a certain smart contracts and so
that this is just how a AI is evolving
around the world and nobody owns it no
one controls it but it's self-organizing
and it's evolving entrained with human
intelligence robots like the Sophie
robot are important for getting human
values and human culture and human
understanding into the system but
they're far from the sum total of and I
think this is how AI has got to get out
I don't want to see ngi develop in a
government even the government run by a
fantastical leader like we saw today or
insight inside a big a big company I
want to see AI developed in a
decentralized heterogeneous way where
anyone around the world can put an AI
into it and profit from that and anyone
around the world can use a high arc for
the applications that are important to
them in their own local situation then
this is something it's like the
principle of cognitive synergy we use in
OpenCog between a few cognitive
processes after in a hyper grab but it's
an attempt to build cognitive synergy on
a much grander scale between different
guys that are created by different
people toward different ends and there's
obviously there's a few modern
engineering details underlying realizing
this which are are interesting we've
thought about a lot but I can't explain
to the negative two point five minutes
