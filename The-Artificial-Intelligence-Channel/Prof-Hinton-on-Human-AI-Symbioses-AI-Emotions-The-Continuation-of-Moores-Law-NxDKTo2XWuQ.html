question there's a question over here hi
hello professor Anton I've got a
question just after watching your slides
on the on the language of thought are
you suggesting that you'd be able to
have machine or algorithms that are able
to understand or could you train these
nets to understand human emotion or
simulate emotion similar to those that
human beings simulate in the Red Sea why
not I don't see anything special about
emotion in that sense we can already get
computers that are pretty good at
reading the emotional expressions of
faces but most people say but a computer
couldn't have an emotion and I think
that's just a misunderstanding of how
natural language works you could have a
state of activity inside this big neural
net in the computer such that if the
computer was an exercise in self-control
it will get out there and punch you and
that will be a cross computer and it
would be a genuinely cross computer then
another question I was wondering how do
you see the the commercialization of
deep learning playing out so is there a
commercialization so I see it as a
thoroughly good thing okay but I mean is
it gonna be an API that you would
basically download and train for your
specific task or or is it just gonna be
something that big companies like Google
Flickr etc are gonna train for their
specific tasks I think it's actually
quite tricky for me to comment on latter
personally okay sorry I understand thank
you for your question there was a
question of her here I wonder is it
possible to pass the microphone over yes
please show yes
say that
yeah I do have a point of view I mean
I'm not very confident in it but my
phone interviewers will get a symbiosis
I mean there was up
I don't know biology very well but
there's a point a long time ago when
cells got other cells inside them
mitochondria or something and that made
things go better and I think you might
think of it in evolutionary terms like
that that up to now we just mean
biological cells but now you're going to
get a symbiosis of a person and an
intelligent computer and that's going to
be a far more powerful thing and I'm
hoping that that's the route eCos rather
than computers replacing people
yeah but remember the machine can learn
so as long as you've got adaptive
devices your assistant can sort of adapt
to you and you can adapt your assistant
so I agree there's an it the question
about how they communicate I'm sure
there'll be all sorts of fancy
technologies for getting things to
activate your brain cells without having
to put electrodes in no the fact is
nobody has a clue about what's going out
yeah yeah I I haven't really thought
very hard about that problem and there
are I know there are other people who've
thought much harder about that problem
and so I don't really have anything
useful to say yeah time maybe for one
more question you mentioned that in
order for the networks to get better and
better they need more and more neurons
millions billions trillions and you also
said that Moore's law continues to apply
we're going to have the ability to do
that but my question is whether you
really think Moore's law is going to
continue to apply or are we going to run
it to quantum effects at some point that
are going to create a bit of a barrier
to moving to the to the next level yeah
the thing about Moore's Law is very like
evolution itself that you have a narrow
view of I mean maybe 15 years ago the
view of Moore's law would be computers
get twice as fast every two years and
it's the same sort of VLSI but is
shrinking and getting faster and that's
how Moore's law is going to be achieved
and then all of a sudden we reach a
bottleneck there there so just kind of
squirts sideways and now we have more
cause and we get twice as many cores
every two years
and then something else will happen and
so the the set of things that can be
developed to make Moore's law keep
holding
he's a kind of open-ended set it's not
like you're playing a game where there's
limited rules and so on we are of course
all governed by physics but we're a long
way from sort of particles here and
there's lots and lots of different
things to be exploited and what seems to
happen historically and I think will
keep happening for a while is that we'll
just find different directions to
improve in maybe a little suddenly go
genuinely 3d and that'll be a huge win
so I actually think Moore's Law is going
to hold for longer than most people
think is gonna hold
I think another 10 years is an
optimistic view and good well I want to
thank you for your questions I want to
thank Jeffrey for that I'm very
stimulating presentation you'll be
around people want to chat with you
informally afterwards and I would like
to thank Nora for joining us to house
thanks thanks thank you thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
