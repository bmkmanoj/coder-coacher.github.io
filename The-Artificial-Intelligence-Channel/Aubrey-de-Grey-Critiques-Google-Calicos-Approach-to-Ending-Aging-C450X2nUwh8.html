for-profit efforts that are in a similar
space so um well as I mentioned we have
general we have created some of them but
the smaller ones you know their age
level and say we're a level right now I
guess what you're mainly referring to is
the much more conspicuous and very large
efforts that have onboard over the past
couple of years especially calico the
company graded by Google and also human
longevity Inc which were created by two
of the more larger-than-life biotech and
visionaries in this space Peter
Diamandis and craig Venter both of those
companies have a very significant place
in this whole universe they don't I
throw them at this point have as big a
place as they could have human longevity
started out and very explicitly a normal
company you know they are a company that
wants to be profitable reasonably soon
they investment from a wide range of
different investors they focused on
developing things that can benefit
people even if not very much at least
benefit people quite sitting in the
quite short term so one could really
think of human longevity as a leading
edge personalized medicine company a
company that's trying to use all the
best technologies that are around to
identify how to optimize the use of the
application of today's medicine of
existing medicines so as to give it the
best benefit for each individual and
that's undoubtedly valuable but it
clearly is not the holy grail of the
defeat of aging because it can only
optimize things that are fundamentally
imperfect code in a very different
situation first of all its budget is
essentially unlimited but earned so it's
not seeking investment from anybody else
and secondly it has been set up very
explicitly to tackle the long-term
question of Aging to really bring aging
under control
unfortunately at this point calico is
proving to be a massive disappointment
not because
the work it's doing is in some way you
know short-sighted but rather than it's
too long sighted in other words they are
kind of ignoring all of the promise that
exists in the research that's already
been done all of the ways in which we
might put together current knowledge
into new medicines that attack aging
more comprehensively than medicines that
exist today
the way that they're approaching things
is basically to take the view that we
just don't have nearly enough initial
basic knowledge yet we need to
understand aging much much better before
we can even think about how to apply
that understanding therapeutically
and I believe that is completely wrong I
believe that it is a point of view based
on basically and hired the wrong people
at the top having heart especially that
chief science officer David Botstein who
is an emeritus professor from Princeton
very very smart guy no question but here
the basic scientists through and through
he understands the value of knowledge
and that's pretty much the only thing he
understands the value of so he will
never feel that we have enough knowledge
and you don't want someone like that if
you want to save lives that's
interesting in an interview I was
reading with you you kind of talked
about the difference between the science
and the technology approach that you're
saying that there is a difference
between trying to pursue understanding
something and trying to pursue doing
something about it
absolutely the difference is huge and I
didn't understand this at all until I
started to talk to my wife back in the
early 90s about the problem of aging you
know she was saying as I mentioned
earlier she was saying that it wasn't it
wasn't very exciting it wasn't very
important and I was saying but the but
it killed people you know I mean well
and and it was only then that I began to
see the profundity of the mindset chasm
that exists between basic scientists who
want to understand things and
technologists who won't if you like
things for human benefit it's just like
and the rest of it is that almost all
basic scientists failed to see this
cousin they think that technology is
easy and
kind of full falls into places the kind
of you know immediate side effect of
finding things out and they you know
they kind of just don't get it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
