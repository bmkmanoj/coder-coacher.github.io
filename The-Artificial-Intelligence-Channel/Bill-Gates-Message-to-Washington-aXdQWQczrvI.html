in welcoming Bill Gates thank you all
right well thank you so much for being
here today we were excited to kick off
the conversation just take a step back
about what you're doing here what your
message is you come why are you here you
know what's the message you're bringing
to Washington on this trip
well my full-time work is at the Gates
Foundation and we have two big things we
focus on one is US education
and the other is global health and the
US government is a key partner in both
of those activities in the case of the
health work for all the diseases we work
on the NIH is either the biggest funder
or the second biggest funder and
likewise we're either the first or
second biggest funder so you know making
sure that research is is making progress
understand how we can work together
better and then in terms of foreign aid
the overall 14 is a hundred and thirty
billion the u.s. is the biggest single
country at about thirty billion of that
as a percentage of our economy it's it's
quite a bit lower than some others like
point two two versus the Europeans some
above 1% Norway Sweden some at point
seven like Germany and the UK but it's a
huge pool of resources you know far
greater our foundation is about five
billion a year so we need to partner up
with all the donors to go after things
like polio eradication the PEPFAR
program on HIV is absolutely miraculous
in terms of holding that disease in
check for us to get vaccine and so a lot
of the discussion is about either with
the Congress about the money allocated
to these things or with the executive
branch on the execution of these things
so I'm back here you know four times
here
when the White House daily guidance came
out last night we learned that you are
visiting the president today this
afternoon talk about your experience
with the president and what your message
is going into the White House well I
think this is a fairly interesting time
because okay okay budget wise period of
time because you know since there was a
demand get the defense budget up and a
demand that the non-defense not leg too
far behind the defense you know overall
we'll be making a 12% increase assuming
the Omnibus passes without some big
change and you know that's pretty pretty
unusual there's more spend and almost
any time in the last decade right and
more than there's likely to be in
molecular decades and the discussion
about okay of that 12% increase you know
what are the problems is this a serious
amount of money I mean 143 billion a
year you know that's like 30 times
greater than what our foundation gives
so it's like you know 30 Gates
Foundation's a strange unit of measure
so the idea of okay you know where where
should that go what you know it's a
transportes at education and you know
hearing how people are thinking about
that you know where does the decision to
break break down to the 12 bills where
does that get made what are you know the
best ideas from various political groups
it is the good news for the area of
greatest concern for us which is that
foreign aid budget is it means that at
least for two years here the normal
discussion about hey've where does this
really go and isn't some of this not
spent perfectly and can someone else
just do this for us
that challenge will be far less often
when I come here it's because I get to
go to African cpap artwork or
president's malaria initiative and I can
come back and say we really are
measuring this stop here's how we
improve it there's a huge benefit to the
u.s. in the long run in terms of having
a stable Africa and you know talking
about the measurement way that we you
know make sure the money that we're
spending together with the US government
and we make sure that that's spent as
best as it can be I just want to talk
about the budget for a second and you
alluded to this because in one week the
budget needs to be passed or else the
government will shut down which we don't
anticipate but if you could wave a wand
and and get one or two things done and
get Congress to do one or two things
what would those be well it's always
important to remember that you can't
wave away it's like yeah allocates money
and makes policies the you know private
sector and science deliver most of the
miracles and yet those two need to go
together the internet was funded by
DARPA which is part of the defense
budget most of the great biological
advances that have been made or because
the US taxpayers so generous with the
NIH you know if you compare globally way
over half the money that's discovering
how to cure cancer it's meant here in
the United States and it's win-win we
get the companies because the people
involved in the research go and actually
build the products and the world
benefits immensely from that so you know
but I had a wand I'd mostly waive it to
say you know create magic clean energy
source that's very cheap or to take the
work we're doing on malnutrition which
is a great problem and say okay let's
understand and and get rid of
malnutrition so the Congress you
is super important but the miracles
still required the hands-on sort of
private sector piece as well when you
think about your meeting with the
president what is the best-case scenario
coming out of it like what wouldn't be
the A+ meeting that you say alright I
did this I'm going to go on to travel to
Africa you know to clear messages one is
about foreign aid where we're partnering
with the government to help articulate
why even if you just look at the benefit
to America of stability disease being
less likely to come here that this is
very beneficial and that having those
strong relationships maintaining that
commitment continuing to tune it that
there's great things that are coming out
of that and that's been you know my
primary message because of this budget
increase a second message me will be
that there's an opportunity to take on
some tough unsolved problems one that
you know I would highlight is that the
preparedness we have for pandemic either
a naturally caused pandemic or a
bioterrorism intention called pandemic
we don't have the tools the preparedness
the capacity to deal with that and yet
the science is at a point where for a
fairly small portion of that increase
say a few percent a year you could do
something quite miraculous in terms of
health security and there's a specific
way this one's a little complicated
because the civilian side and the
defense I both need to work together to
achieve that so to see if he can get
excited about that as something to
prioritize with the the new spending but
let's be clear so the president has said
has tweeted and said in other settings
that foreign aid is the cause of our
budget deficit and is
the country spends way too much on fun
helping other countries and it's time to
start helping our country that is a
message that the president has said
multiple times and multiple venues
I mean react to that how do you get a
president who is allergic it seems to
some of this some of these ideas
well foreign aid is so obscure that if
people bring it up even in a negative
sense at least they're bringing it up
and then you know we have a chance to
explain to people that it's less than 1%
the u.s. budget and make sure when often
when you hear that word you don't
connect with saving lives with HIV
medicine you know under President Bush
in a very bipartisan way this PEPFAR
program which if you add the malaria
piece to it it's about eight billion a
year so a very big part of the 30
billion is that specific disease work if
you explain that to them and say should
we continue to save those lives so that
that disease doesn't get out of control
and until we get a vaccine which then
will enable us to end the HIV epidemic
we'll still have a lot of people in need
lifelong treatment when you say that
people respond very positively and so
you know if people could go on trips
with me and see these things they could
you could invite them there's a lot more
voters than seats on my plane so in
absolutely getting members of Congress
to go visit and see this word people
like Lindsey Graham are very active it
at encouraging his colleagues to go out
and learn and see and I think that's
partly why many elements of foreign aid
particularly PEPFAR has continued to
have this very very strong response now
that didn't stop an executive budget
proposal from including potential cuts
in that case the Congress really
didn't consider seriously cutting that
money because they do have a commitment
to it but aren't you concerned about the
America first rhetoric I mean it's kind
of an anthem to what you your whole
mission and the world is these days yeah
I don't agree with the American first
rhetoric that is I think the Alliance's
that we've built over time and help we
provide to countries up lifting them you
know starting with the Marshall Plan our
role in supporting the United Nations
the bilateral things we do we have made
the world a more stable a richer place
and I think that's good just from a pure
humanitarian point of view I do think
that foreign aid because our foreign aid
budget is so small that we pick things
that are so effective that even if your
lens is hey does this benefit Americans
you know Americans don't want to have
pandemics and Americans don't want to
have to send soldiers off to create
stability in Africa and look at our
ratio you know we spend over 600 billion
a year on defense
and 30 billion a year on the foreign aid
budget that's a 20 to 1 ratio for a
European country the ratio is actually
pretty close like you know two or three
to one so you know we're very much a
hard power country President Bush when
he did PEPFAR and thinking okay we're
gonna exercise hard hard power wanted to
make sure that the soft power piece was
made strong a stronger as well and
that's why he picked PEPFAR general
mattis you know said that the foreign
aid budget helps if you cut it you know
you got to give him more money for for
weapons and so you know I I'm I'm a huge
believer that that framework does not
say that we we should cut cut the money
do you the you know when when Donald
Trump ran for the presidency he talked
about being a business businessman then
that's why he was elected to you in your
experience running businesses
and running a big business and creating
a business do you like do you feel like
you have a good sense of how he thinks
and have you as has anybody that you met
in your time and your career prepared
you to deal with somebody like him well
in business you meet a lot of different
kinds of people
and you have to be good at adapting to
different styles of working I was in in
the New York real estate business or the
New Jersey casino business and you know
obviously I missed a whole different
approach but you know we're you find
things in common
that you know you believe in and you
know I think president Trump would like
to take some of this new money and have
something that's new you know and makes
a big difference that he's personally
exercising leadership against that and
so I think everyone should be creative
about okay what can be taken to him that
would fit that serve the country's
Empress and and really resonate
particularly if it's something where
presidential leadership would be
important to to make it happen
one of the questions we'd like to kind
of take a step back is people are very
fascinated by you we had more interest
in this event and I think we've had in
almost any event that we've ever had
they're not here for us no I mean we
love you but no no seriously it's the
step back what's your daily routine walk
us through what it's a day in the life
of Bill Gates well the foundation shapes
most of my time I still spent about 10
percent of my time over at Microsoft but
she had a board meeting on Monday and
Tuesday I get to help shape some of the
strategies there so I kind of drive
there maybe two or three days a month I
do some things outside the foundation in
terms of the science investing I do so
work on clean energy you know I have a
nuclear fission company and a whole
bunch of energy related things a big
venture thing called breakthrough energy
ventures that's over a billion dollars
that the people have pulled together to
finance breakthroughs in clean energy
but most of my time is at the foundation
so we just had two weeks of strategy
reviews where we go through all the
things we're doing what's going well
what's not going well you know we do
malaria then HIV then TB you know we do
the u.s. program that's got K through 12
and and higher ed are the two key
components there I travel a lot you know
I I need to go to Africa three or four
times a year next week I'll be in Chad
and Nigeria the entire week I spent a
lot of time on Nigeria because it's a
quarter of the population of sub-saharan
Africa and it's a challenge country in
terms of the governance the health
systems and so I'll be over there a lot
of the trips are to other donor
countries you know the UK and Germany
give more than half what the u.s. does
because of that even though their
population and economy are dramatically
smaller so talking to them about the
joint work polio eradication is the
single biggest project that I put Timon
on because we're in a very very critical
phase where we've got three countries
Nigeria Afghanistan and Pakistan the
only countries that have had wild
poliovirus in the last three years and
so if we execute well and have a little
bit of luck this would be the last year
than any child gets paralyzed with polio
ever you know we asked
we asked some of our readers to send us
questions that they'd like to ask you
and we won't give you all of them but
one that was very interesting is how do
you decide what areas to fund I mean
this is from a reader who said malaria
TB and polio are three things that
you've you've worked to eradicate but
there are other diseases like viral
hepatitis which I I'm not as familiar
with some of these diseases and the
impact is you might be but where do you
how do you take it through your thought
process and so we Melinda and I picked
the two areas we were going to work in
just based on our values and and nobody
can work in all the areas so us
education and global health
once we picked Global Health then within
that we are extremely rational about
saying okay of this money what can have
the highest impact and we can save a
life for less than a thousand dollars
per life saved so you know it sets a bar
if somebody comes in suggests oh you
know we should work on cancer because
you can do something well the
pharmaceutical companies with a Rd
budget 20 times bigger than ours as a
group are working hard on that and the
incremental benefit of any new advance
there is more in the you know four
hundred thousand dollars per life saved
regime going out and giving more measles
vaccines that's in the sub $1,000 per
per life saved so we're working on
mostly on infectious diseases things
we're either very cheap drugs or very
inexpensive vaccines can be invented and
get out to people our biggest our
biggest metric is under five death and
when we got started
over 10 million children under the age
of five died per year that numbers now
been cut in half it's under five million
die per year and that's because of what
we and our partners have done with
vaccines and improving the primary
health care system and getting malaria
bed nets out and by 2030 we'll cut that
in half again so it'll go from five
million a year to two-and-a-half million
a year so huge progress in a fairly
dramatic way and so diseases that are
very rare
we won't work on we've made so much
progress on the big ones that we just
funded Tom Frieden to go out and look at
heart disease and high blood pressure in
Africa he's got a group that's doing
that and we're talking sickle cell was
not a focus for us but now that we're
making progress on others it might be if
we can figure out the right treatment or
new invention that can help out with
that it's about 2% of the deaths in
Nigeria are specifically due to sickle
cell we fund a group called the
International Health metrics and
evaluation I ate amine at the University
of Washington where the understanding of
what people died from you know really
getting the numbers right is a hundred
times better today than when we got
started and we even had to do things
that are hard you know no autopsies are
done of these poor children who died
we've created a thing called the
minimally invasive autopsy where we can
take a few samples a got lung and brain
and have it analyzed in labs we've
created in Africa to really get a
picture of okay what do we need to do to
save these lives we should kick it out
to one of our reporters here and I don't
know where they are sitting
yeah the State Department for us hi
everybody thank you so much for being
here today
Nahal TC i cover foreign policy for
Politico my question is this you know
one of the reasons that the Trump
administration gives in terms of wanting
to cut foreign aid budget substantially
is that they feel like other countries
are not doing their fair share they call
this burden-sharing they say that the
u.s. gives more than it should and that
it's making other countries dependent on
us now I realize you mentioned that some
countries have smaller populations but
do you give significant amounts but my
question is isn't the argument a
legitimate one to some degree isn't this
the kind of shock therapy or a wake up
call that the rest of the world needs so
that other countries will step up give
more and also find ways to be less
dependent on US aid well the figure of
Merit is what percentage of your GDP do
you give us foreign aid and so you know
Norway's 1.1 percent Sweden's 1 percent
the UK's point seven percent Germany's
point seven percent we're point two two
percent so you know we are substantially
less generous than then those countries
are and if if you like shock therapy it
is true if you would draw a PEPFAR which
was proposed to wind it down not getting
HIV drugs is a form of shock you die and
those people will no longer need foreign
aid because they'll be dead so I I don't
totally get the logic of why that would
be a smart thing to do
the story of foreign aid is that you
allow countries to lift themselves up so
they become self-sufficient and when the
US started giving aid after World War
two you know first a lot of that aid
went to redevelop Europe some to develop
Japan by the time you get to the 1960s
you've got very much a bifurcated world
where you have rich countries and poor
countries and almost nothing in the
middle and partly because of aid and
partly because of science and economic
development
a miracle took place which is that today
most people live in middle-income
countries and those countries are not
aid recipients Brazil Mexico fairly soon
India China the bulk of the 7 billion
people live in those middle-income
countries which are not substantial
sources of aid or substantial recipients
of aid but you do have still poor
countries the low-income countries and
those countries in order to get
stability health education right so that
they can have their own domestic tax
collection they need foreign aid when
you have malaria when you have an HIV
epidemic
you will not there's no source of
revenue that's going to let you go by
those HIV medicines or those malaria bed
nets and in particular the research to
create say a malaria vaccine you know
who should do that the resources and the
expertise are not in those poor
countries when we gave our first 30
million grant for a malaria vaccine we
became the biggest malaria vaccine
funder and so the market is not going to
provide it and yet in terms of humanity
you know it's still killing we've made a
lot of progress it still kills a half
million kids a year and you know if I
told you hey there's two kids dying and
we could this audience could save those
two kids you know I think people would
respond it costs $14 per bed net and you
know so could we manage to come up with
$28 and help those two kids but those
two kids would be dependent on us
I mean think of it that'd be awful they
you know they wouldn't die of malaria
they would be dependent on us so you
know it's hard for me to understand the
notion that helping people are poorer
than we are is a bad thing it's kind of
in the Bible
in terms of kind of finding partners I
wanted to ask you a question I mean when
you were at Microsoft you often were
butting heads with the government here
and now so much of your time is spent
wooing leaders trying to get countries
to give more money you know kind of
doing this diplomacy effort have you had
to reshape your kind of framework of
where government should be involved no
I'm a government is a necessary thing
huge things you know justice military
and it is true Microsoft had this long
DOJ lawsuit I you know always driving by
the district court where I'd go out onto
the sidewalk and say okay that was a
good day in court but even when it
wasn't sometimes and these days are
probably a little bit more fulfilling
with those things
oh no I enjoyed that I mean the DOJ loss
it was not the most positive thing but I
loved my time at Microsoft and it is
true people treat governments including
the US government treat me nicer as a
philanthropist than they did it's a
capitalist but you know that that's
under if you have to do capitalist
before you become a philanthropist
yeah otherwise you're not going to be a
particularly large philanthropist in
that that affects the impact so it is it
you could say it's a tiny bit ironic
because when we started the foundation I
thought our primary role would be the
invention of the new tools and that is a
little over half of what we do the HIV
vaccine the TB vaccine all those things
the idea that we would have to get
involved in the delivery go in and help
improve the primary healthcare system
you know partner with the government of
Ethiopia to look at ok where do you put
your health clinics how do you train
those people how do you measure their
work which part of this should be
digital
I didn't know that was going to be
necessary I thought if the right things
were invented that the demand was there
and other people would make sure they
got out there but in fact you know it
turned out that that wasn't realistic
there were actually some fairly good
tools that had been invented there was a
vaccine for a form of diarrhea called
rotavirus which is overall half of all
diarrhea's and it was being given to
exactly the kids who didn't need it rich
kids never dive rotavirus poor kids at
that time over five hundred thousand
year were dying and rotavirus and yet
those poor kids weren't getting that
vaccine that vaccine if you make the
right guarantees and do the process
manufacturing right way it's about $3
for a full dose of that vaccine now
that's one of our great achievements now
virtually every child in the world is
getting the rotavirus vaccine and that's
an element of how we went from 10
million ER dying down to to five million
ear now it's been 15 years since PEPFAR
which you alluded to which has been very
effective in your view and in many
people's view since that past Congress
and in a very bipartisan way which you
said I wonder now is what you encounter
when you go try to build new allies on
Capitol Hill you went to Shake Shack
yesterday took a selfie and had some
hamburgers with some sheep yeah yeah
tell us what you encounter and and do
you sense resistance and how do you kind
of pick your allies on the next
generation if you will I mean uh 15
years ago and also Lindsey Graham and
John McCain or champions but of some of
these causes but they're veteran
lawmakers and how do you kind of go
about finding these folks and convincing
them foreign aid and global health are
important priorities well our team here
led by Rob Nabors you know reaching out
doesn't okay to every member insane is
foreign aid something you'd like to
learn about
and even people who come in with a
fairly negative attitude you know our
view is the more you learn about this
the more you'll realize wow this is real
this this is pretty important stuff and
so boat whenever melinda and i come a
fair portion of the time is sitting down
telling talking about the progress
hearing what concerns they might have
you know we we probably more focus on
people or on state and foreign ops
committees but we don't limit ourselves
to that because the you know the the the
sort of simple ideas about foreign aid
we're you know we want to rebut those
even the press coverage of foreign aid
if there is you know like Oxfam had a
scandal which is awful recently the good
news doesn't travel quite as fast as the
bad news and so trying to make sure
people have a overall picture of okay
some things you know aren't managed that
well but overall whether it's health or
education or agriculture or sanitation
this period of time has been the best
ever in helping poor countries uplift
themselves we have one more question
from a reporter in the audience good
morning mister case so Facebook Twitter
and Google have faced some pretty harsh
criticism in Washington of late for what
Sina is allowing their platforms to get
out of control one symptom of which is
Russia's efforts to seemingly in
influence American domestic politics as
you mentioned you've had some experience
with government oversight companies do
you think that the government needs to
step in here if not why not and if so
what exactly would that look like well
yeah the interest in do these platforms
polarize people in a way you know that
exacts exact exacerbates trends towards
polarization that are already taking
place and do they allow foreign
influence that shouldn't be allowed or
trolls hate speech
you know to come on and affect people's
views those are super interesting
questions in a democracy I mean that the
world of media there's always been
government rules about how media is used
politically and yet even as people have
a desire to say okay these platforms
need to need to do something different
let's just take facebook in particular
the specific recommendations about what
they should do I find fairly vague you
know the idea of okay
is there an exact line where free speech
stops and hate speech starts and as
their a in you know what is it that
foreigners are allowed to say you know
foreigners can go on to these forums and
talk you're probably not going to you
know have only u.s. citizens talking to
each other when does it become a form of
political influence and what type of
disability should it have there were
some draft bills that would have created
huge transparency about who's buying the
ads on these platforms it they didn't
choose to move those those particular
bills forward so there definitely is a
something that needs to be looked at but
the actual solutions there I think are a
little less clear one
what do you hear from foreign leaders
which who you obviously meet with all
the time about the United States at this
moment well the world's the way the
world is benefited from US leadership is
hard to overstate you know most of their
policies they look at they'll say hey
what did the u.s. do you know how did
the u.s. get great universities how did
the u.s. organize research even on an
issue like what do we do to prepare for
a pandemic you know the CDC is by far
the best in the world what they do it
it's it's it's phenomenal in the UN
system ISM benefited not only from the
reefs or
but the personnel that go there people
from CDC or working at World Health
Organization you know really
professionalizing that helping that
organization work well and so they there
is an expectation that the u.s. cares
about world stability and world progress
so as we're as we surprise people and
start to pull back from those things or
we say that our role in those things
will have a sort of Schultz short term
focus on our sole benefit in those
activities as opposed to long term
benefit for all of the different members
that is potentially a problem it creates
a vacuum of leadership that you know
people badly miss now when you pull them
about do you love the United States so
obviously know they're this you know
dominant country that you know doesn't
do everything well they you know pick
some things to get involved in that they
shouldn't they don't get involved in
some things they should and everybody
has a an opinion about how the world's
leader goes about exercising its
leadership but as that engagement has
gone down in a lot of these forums you
know I think people are very much
missing it there is some new leadership
at the State Department with mr. Pompeo
coming in as head of that agency do you
know him will you work with them do you
think it's important to have kind of a
safe stable kind of top diplomat for
this country yeah we always worked with
the Secretary of State and we've got
mark green as the administrator over at
USAID we work very intensely with the
USAID you know the PEPFAR money there's
an aids coordinator but a lot of that
money's going out through USAID and CDC
and so there's a deep collaboration
there you know if the hiring of good
people and morale the State Department
can be improved under new leadership
that'll be a good thing I'll certainly
go and meet the new secretary and talk
about the partnerships we've had and you
know how we can can manage those one
thing we haven't talked about is a new
interest if you're as a new priority of
yours which is Alzheimer's talked about
and a lot a lot of your work is abroad
so it doesn't touch the home doesn't
touch the US as much as as it doesn't
and perhaps sub-saharan Africa but talk
about what you're doing on Alzheimer's
and and how you think you could have a
big impact yeah for the foundation our
big thing in the u.s. is our work in
education there's a complicated but
super-important area
Alzheimer's is unusual because that
there is a gigantic market whoever
creates a drug that cures Alzheimer's
will make billions and billions of
dollars and yet it's a target that's
proven to be very very difficult it is
the disease that there have been more
failed trials on than any other disease
and these are very expensive trials
because the gold standard is improving
behavior on a cognition test and that
takes in some cases six to eight years
and the early trials probably recruited
patients that were too far along in
their disease for the drug to have a
benefit and this is a disease where even
getting the drug up to the place in the
brain across the blood-brain barrier
that's very very difficult and so the
costs the human cost and economic costs
of dementia broadly and Alzheimer's in
particular is absolutely gigantic and a
lot of that liability for long-term care
will fall on the government so you could
say even though we're very generous
compared to any other country our
investment in solving this problem at a
research level hasn't been enough now
the Congress with the few people be very
active is taking that budget from about
five years ago the NI a budget which
National Institute of Aging which has
the Alzheimer's work has gone from about
400
million and under the proposed budget is
likely to get all the way up to about
two billion so that's you know God says
faster growth is the National Cancer
Institute had during the beginning of
the war on cancer so it is an amazing
fantastic thing you know my role in
terms of saying okay this is a disease
that requires a lot of different actors
to come in my role is on funding people
for a biomarker getting the data
organized there's a lot of international
data pharma data US government data that
is not available to research in a form
that they can learn about disease
progression and that's the thing we
we've done in the foundation with lots
of how young children grow and when they
falter and so doing that type of
database you know goes back to sort of
my Microsoft background of how you
empower researchers so there's a few
things including investing in
early-stage high-risk companies that
have new approaches because the
mainstream approaches where you clear
the plaques the amyloid is very directly
or the towel those are the drug trials
that at least so far have not worked out
we are about to get a rap but I do want
to ask you about education since that is
obviously a big focus of yours secretary
Betsy DeVos has done made a lot of
changes that are not in line with where
a lot of your priorities of your
foundation what's your reaction to that
how concerned are you and did you watch
her on 60 minutes no I read articles
about it the truth is the federal
government under the Obama
administration and Bush administration
was very active in trying to say how do
we manage teachers you know are we
looking at how they're achieving things
are we getting feedback to them you know
and a lot was done to say okay this
schools failing that the federal
government has some ideas about what can
be going in and change that once we had
the the
authorization the role of the federal
government was greatly reduced and so
now for K through 12 most what counts is
at the state or even the district level
and so there haven't been under this
administration there have been slight
tweaks here and there but there isn't a
dramatic set of changes to the title 1
money or the overall envelope of money
and you know even in the areas they've
talked about you know the idea of school
choice actually there's quite a bit of
that that that we agree with that having
really strong charters to try out new
things that can be very very positive
we're never going to have I don't think
more than 10 percent of kids in charters
so even if you do the best job possible
on charters you have to be using that as
a Learning Lab for the 90 percent who
are not going to be in charters and you
know so we were in a lot of states now
partnering you know trying out new
things it's fair to say that when we
started the foundation I thought global
health would be the hard thing that we
would make very little progress in
because it's just so tough and we'd have
some really quick wins in u.s. education
you know maybe move the math scores up
5% me believe the reading scores up 10%
you know really get that you know to
build our confidence so we can go out
there to Nigeria on a regular basis it's
been the opposite that's not to say our
us education stuff every school where
we've gotten involved whether it's a
public school or a charter great things
have happened but when it comes to
taking that and scaling it up getting
other schools to adopt it or even the
school that we're in you know app you
know say it's three years after we've
been there
does it persist or does that mentoring
program or teacher collaboration program
does that go away so you know we feel
good about the direct intervention but
as a a philanthropy in K through 12
you know it's 600 billion
a year being spent in that market all
you're doing is sort of an RD pilot
programming type thing and so if you
want to move the macro statistics you
have to figure out not only good ideas
that work but good ideas that get
massive adoption and they're the field
including ourselves as not you know had
this huge success we the one thing we
did that's the best is we thought people
really talking about the dropout rate in
an honest way which was your entry ninth
grade class to your graduating class up
until then people had just talked about
the entering senior class to the
accident senior class and most the
dropout takes place dropping out takes
place in those first three years some
people have paid attention to that and
that that dropout numbers gone down some
but it's nothing like what we've
achieved in in global health so we're we
have were just about out of time
it's been a fascinating conversation so
you do expect you can move President
Trump off of his america-first rhetoric
no I'll take his framework and then
explain why things like health security
and continued foreign aid even in that
narrow framework where you give no
credit for saving lives and Africa kind
of pure humanitarian things even without
that this is money well spent
Helen we say hello thank you so much for
this great conversation
a special thank you to Gallup our hosts
for being so generous and thank you to
all in the room ended the livestream for
tuning and thanks a lot every day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
