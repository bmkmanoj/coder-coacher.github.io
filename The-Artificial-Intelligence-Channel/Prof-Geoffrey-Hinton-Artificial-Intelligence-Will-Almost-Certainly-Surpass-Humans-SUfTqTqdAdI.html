leap ahead with deep learning
particularly partly at least based on
the fact that these very large neural
networks could work faster than they
could before so is there another
technological barrier that you see that
we have to overcome to get to the next
level or what's what's the hard problem
that you're working on now so what's
kind of interesting at present is that
it looks so we might be in a phase of
normal science where business as usual
is going to make a whole lot of progress
and I can't actually see why by get you
know assuming the computer industry can
keep producing better hardware and keep
doing computations burning less energy
they can keep doing that with Moore's
law for another 10 years or 20 years I
think business as usual is gonna take us
a huge way obviously if we get big
breakthroughs because actual
breakthroughs that'll take us further I
think one of the big breakthroughs is
going to come is we're going to
understand the brain I actually what
this is just a bet my personal belief is
we're going to get close enough to how
the brain really does do these things
that suddenly it all begins to click and
we kind of fall into a minimum where
it's just obvious how the brain is
actually doing this stuff yeah and I
think there might be quite closer to
that and that would be another
revolution because that would affect all
sorts of things like education and our
sense of who we are so I think that's
that would be very exciting I'm hoping I
get to see that yeah so conceptually do
you think there will be a point at which
artificial intelligence surpasses human
intelligence oh I think it's inevitable
in the very long run yeah I mean why
should it so I mean why should it sort
of asymptote at human intelligence it's
I didn't see any reason I think yeah
sorry go ahead
i but what what is done with that
technology I think is gonna be very hard
so and I think it's something it's worth
one our philosophy was thinking about
that but I don't think it's an imminent
threat given that human beings are
creatures who are embodied and emotional
and have horn
and all of this other sort of stuff do
you think that will be an intelligence
that is a different type of intelligence
from human intelligence um it could be I
should say at this point sort of just
because I figured I had some technical
tricks when you're all networks people
think I'm an expert on the future
I never know any more about it than you
do but my guess would be that yes you
wouldn't want to create other
intelligences they're just like people I
mean it's more fun creating people you
would want other intelligences to be
complimentary so what are you excited
about right now in terms of deep
learning and I'm excited about this
machine translation even though I myself
haven't made any direct contribution to
it and some of my students are doing it
and I think over the fairly short term
we're going to get much better
translators yeah I am excited for things
like understanding documents I think
there's gonna be huge progress there
over the next five to ten years okay and
what would that look like I think you
look roughly like what I said instead of
giving Google some words and it'll find
you all the documents have those words
in you give Google some themes and it'll
find the documents that are saying that
even if they're saying it in different
words and so you're going to be able to
search for documents that buy what it is
the documents are claiming independent
whatever the words are and that would be
kind of useful that will be kind of
useful yeah I want I think we have a
little bit of time left I'd like to open
things up to questions there is a
microphone over there maybe somebody
couldn't pass the microphone over to
people who have questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
