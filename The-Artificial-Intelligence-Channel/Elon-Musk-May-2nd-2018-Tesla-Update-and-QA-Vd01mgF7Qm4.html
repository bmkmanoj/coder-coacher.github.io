welcome to the Tesla q1 2018 financial
results and Q&amp;amp;A and webcast call at this
time all participants are in a
listen-only mode
later we will conduct a question and
answer session and instructions will
follow at that time if anyone should
require assistance during the conference
please press star than 0 on your
touch-tone telephone as a reminder this
conference may be recorded I would now
like to introduce your host for today's
call mr. Martin vieja Senior Director of
Investor Relations sir you may begin
Thank You Sheree and good afternoon
everyone welcome to Teslas first quarter
2018 Q&amp;amp;A webcast I'm joined today by
Elon Musk JB Straubel
Deepak Ahuja and Duc field our key one
results were announced at about 1:00
p.m. Pacific time in the update letter
we published at the same link as this
webcast during this call we will discuss
our business outlook and make
forward-looking statements these
comments are based on our predictions
and expectations as of today actual
events or results could differ
materially due to a number of risks and
uncertainties including those mentioned
in our most recent filings with the SEC
during the question and answer portion
of today's call please limit yourself to
one question and one follow-up please
press star 1 now if you would like to
join the question queue before jumping
into Q&amp;amp;A Yvonne has some opening remarks
along hi I think I think our letter says
says most of it but we're going to spend
extra time on Q&amp;amp;A I try to answer as
many questions as possible I think we
should really don't answer oh great so
we're gonna go as long as as that there
are good questions to answer the thing
I'm most the thing I'm most excited
about is the rapid increase in output
we've got just in the last 24 hours
at the gigafactory managed to achieve a
sustained rate
over 3,000 packs per day the start for a
week and actually reached a peak hour
with extrapolated outward would be a
rate of a thought 5000 cars per week
obviously you cannot take a peak hour
and I think every peak is every hour is
as good as the peak but it's thought if
you can if you can achieve it even once
in an hour then with continued
refinement of the system and improved
operational uptime of the machinery it
means that you can achieve that
sustained rate with more wit there with
more refinement so he's been essentially
a month or two improving operational
uptime and the system as a whole will be
able to do over well over 5,000 I think
and whatever what's interesting is that
at least in the case of PAC production
we were able to do this with minimal
capex
and I think I think in general our
understanding of production is improving
dramatically exponentially in fact and
we're seeing ways to achieve improved
volume with dramatically less capex by
size by simplifying production line by
really engaging all of our associates no
matter how jr. in improving the way the
parts are made it's amazing how
everybody's got good ideas just needs to
solicit those ideas and implement them
and uh and and then making ongoing
design improvements so that when we
discover that something is not well
designed for manufacturing that we very
quickly change that part design and
introduce that into the flow whatever
things have also found is that there's
some things that are very well-suited to
manual operation and some things that
are very well so
- automated operation and the tears
should not be confused so I should be
clear that the vast majority of the
Telus production system is automated
however as I mentioned in tweet away a
few months ago we did go too far in the
automation front and automated some
pretty silly things one example would be
we had this this was a sort of
ironically foolish
we had these fiberglass mats on the top
of the battery pack basically like
fabric they're basically fluff so I we
try to automate the placement and
bonding of fluff to the top of the
battery pack which is ridiculous she
likes with his wet flubber bot which was
really a an incredibly difficult machine
to make work machines are not good at be
here picking up pieces of fluff their
human hands a way better at doing that
and so we had a super complicated
machine using a vision system to try to
put a piece of fluff on the battery pack
that same but the nice level other
questions asked was do we actually need
that so we tested a call with and
without and found that there was no no
change in the the noise volume in the
cabin so we actually had a part that was
unnecessary that was forced line kept
breaking down because buffer bought it
would would frequently just didn't fail
to pick up the bluff we'll put it in a
Koran of location so so that was one of
the silliest things I found we're also
in this was still remains to be fixed
but Anila cases but virgin we're
generalizing the design so for example
the current battery pack has of a port
for the front drive units
which we then put a blanking plate a
sealed blanking plate on so essentially
we punch a hole in it then put a
blanking plate over the hole and do that
full rear drive unit cars which is kind
of crazy we've added cost with additive
manufacturing step better failure mode
and for Ford something that is
unnecessary so that that doesn't you
know that is something that's an example
Sinise yeah
that's changed so the result is we've
had a radical improvement in production
battery pack production went from taking
seven hours to make a pact three weeks
ago to under 17 minutes now so just show
that's like really radical improvements
are indeed possible we also saw an
improvement in zone 4 of module
production thus I should point out is a
fully automated zone and and we're able
to also achieve a sustained rate of
3,000 vehicles week so we're actually
slightly ahead in battery module and
pack production then unexpected the
begin and end with the with some work at
the Fremont vehicle plant primarily in
the general assemble general assembly
area I'm confident we will first even
exceed the 3000 mark in Fremont so we're
ready there in the body shop which is
the which is also almost entirely
automated where we weld up the body
there were already capable of over 3,000
cars read and and then a general
assembly with some improvements which
will include reduction some reduction
catalyst I should say temporary
reduction in automation in a few places
then we should be over 3,000 so
basically I'm feeling really good about
V Tesla production half model 3 and I'm
very proud of the work the team is
has been an amazing amount of hard work
and sacrifice by some very talented
people to achieve bussaco it's worth
noting the you see a chart in the model
3 market share versus competitors in
mid-size premium sedans we are almost
the best-selling sedan and the United
States in this category and as of April
and we will certainly be there in May
listening really odd Camino with in May
and then and there really be there later
this year record within the third
quarter it will right I think that
there's a good chance model three it
gets cooked maybe close to a majority
market share of mid-sized peers it has
40 bits of thirty to forty percent seems
likely
and then maybe maybe a majority more
picture it you know later this year that
this is coming from from a standing
start against a lot of established
brands you have far more sales outlets
than we do so this is very encouraging
oh and yeah as the letter says I I'm
feeling quite confident about achieving
gap in income and positive cash flow
into u3 this is not you know a certainty
but I think it does appear quite quite
likely in my view um we are going to
conduct a literally sort of a
reorganization restructuring of the
company in the night this month and make
sure we're well set up to achieve that
goal and it in particular DB never sort
of third party contracting companies
that that we're using is really gotten
out of control so we're going to yeah
describe the barnacles on that on that
front it's pretty crazy with of articles
on barnacles so if there's going to be a
lot of article room removal right I
guess we can call it Thank You Lana um
Cherie let's go through the first
question thank you ladies and gentlemen
if you have a question at this time
please press the star then one key on
your touch-tone telephone we ask that
you please limit yourself to one
question and one follow-up question you
may then return to the queue if your
question has been answered or you will
to remove yourself from the queue please
press the pound key
to prevent any background noise we ask
that you please place your line on mute
once your question has been stated our
first question comes from Brian Johnson
with Barclays yes good afternoon I want
to talk a little bit about some of the
you know first of all if we talk about
the 3,000 of all relate to the
production Ram if we talk about the
3000-5000 per week run rate is that
assuming 724 or at what point do you
think you get to sort of five-day to
shift operation
well I think a 5k to ship operation is a
ridiculous way to operate because that
would be a very poor use of capex nor
nor is it the way that we have operated
in for most of Tesla so that the module
production will sell module and battery
pack production and powertrain
production have always operated on a
24/7 basis and the the exception has
been General Assembly which is operated
on to the grade two to three shifts sort
of a five to six day 20-hour shift and
paint which is operated on kind of a six
day basis so it I think it's make sense
to operate the whole company on the same
basis but a majority of Tesla is always
operated the majority of production has
operated on a 24/7 basis since we
started production yeah I mean it's this
JB I can chime in
yeah I deal and said it really makes
great use of the capex and the lines and
that's what I did it's starting way back
at the beginning of s but aligning
everything to the same shift schedule
makes it so much more efficient because
we don't have the seesaw of inventory
yeah our line inventory between the
different different shops so exist ok
exactly one of the key things to improve
in capital efficiency of the system is
reducing work-in-progress working
process and if you don't have shifts the
art shifts to another line then you have
to build up the inventory in kind of a
storage warehouse and then right yeah
it's pretty foolish to actually operate
on a five-day tuition thing anyway yeah
but it's so even though this is sort of
a we using the with the chip fab
approach to capital efficiency as it's
been called aww slips so done with
whispers were on short school but like
there's a clinical well did work
whatever other work great yeah I think
people like people work like
three long days and then four long days
ultimately something like that multiple
crews running just using overtime
weekends yeah yeah it's like wish man
right so it seems like it's not like one
person working 24 hours they said
basically it did this video the other
work like four or five shifts yeah so if
I just do the math that would seem at
five thousand to get you to attack time
of two minutes and I go back to some of
the prior conversations I mean that's my
understanding is best in class as sort
of 50 seconds to a minute and I thought
the whole going faster than Grandma
Walker was actually targeted at blowing
past that the tons like your sort to X
attack time of other factories the tax
at the number you refer to is actually
that the general never meant it yeah as
General Assembly never not not those
stuff but you may you may have also not
taken into account you know you know
so-called oae or the actual actual of
time of the line which which tends to
make the tack time a little faster than
you know for project records yeah like
they say that could takes a minute thing
to that mean it's like over the
seven-day toward for our work words like
we could also just say like sure we did
you know a peak pack production today
was 32 32 packs in an hour so we're
under a minute under two minutes a pack
and rising from there yeah obviously you
know that the numbers go up rapidly as
we go to the sub assemblies that are in
higher unit quantity per car yeah so 4x4
module and then you know we have you
know smaller sub assembly still that are
you know factors of ten or twenty even
higher than that yeah that that said I
do believe that the the path to a
faction efficiency is velocity velocity
and density and that that is absolutely
what we're working on runs rather than
just trying to you know spend billions
of dollars on duplicating a factory
if you make like two counties are
competing and one one has to double its
capex or develop production and the
other one can with minor cap minor
Catholics can just beat up the line by
double it's a game over all right but in
the meantime the lines get I think what
you're saying some starts some stops to
get to the five thousand per week
like you can't have like zero
maintenance time and zero you know like
you have to equip it upgrades you have
to do you know ongoing maintenance so
you can't just have it be operating it
be great 24/7 ok thanks thank you
our next question comes from rod Lackey
with Deutsche Bank everybody just wanted
to follow along on on that line of
questions so to the extent that you're
adding humans in certain automated
processes you can just help us interpret
the extent to which these changes affect
the economics on model three and you
know to the extent that you've done some
competitive analysis all of these
efforts in the Tesla Production system
how do you stack up competitively
against other OEMs in terms of labor
hours per vehicle or depreciation for
vehicle well I'll just I'll say so if
you think that I have to can
elaborate see so um the thing that's
look that I've noticed is if you have a
really complicated machine like the
fluff bought that I was talking about
earlier in order to keep it operating
you have to have to have done a ton of
maintenance engineering so you have like
basically a pretty expensive you know
myoh maintenance engineers that have to
maintain a thing and and fix it like
basically seven days a week for four
hours day the the cost of the
maintenance engineer may not be
incorporated directly into a wonderfully
creative darkling it's gross
mutters nonetheless Lacoste that far
exceeds the labor cost of simply placing
the fluff on the battery pack which as I
said that was unnecessary so I think to
actually I do not see this having
amateur along - one - impacting our cost
to actually see a most likely cost will
decrease fully considered costs of
producing the vehicles will decrease by
getting rid of of production stations
that are really poorly suited to
robotics because of the very expensive
cost of robot technicians run we are a
very Catholic sufficient oil let me just
start from that point and if we look at
our depreciation costs on a per-unit
basis that steady run rate of 5,000 or
so of cars per week we are in my mind
well below a lot of our maybe most of
our competitors we're below $2,000 per
unit depreciation
and then overall clearly there is some
impact as we have indicated in the
letter from the additional labor we've
added but it's temporary and our
expectation fully is a lot of this labor
will come out once we stabilize
production and then figure out smart
ways of automating where it makes sense
okay thank thanks for that and just
secondly your comments in your letter on
the advances and batteries we're
interesting could you give us some
insight into how we can translate that
into cost per kilowatt hour or some some
metric in terms of the gains that you're
making that's something I mean every day
every data point rod that we look at
internally suggests that we are best in
class but we don't prevail to use a lot
of class yes we the best sorry the best
our class of one yeah company yeah
yeah I think directionally rod you know
it's a it's helpful to understand the
different commodities and and the trends
that we're pursuing in the batteries you
know being on a path to reduce cobalt
usage Frenchman instance has been
something we've been working on for
literally several years now and this has
been extremely helpful in the overall
cost per kilowatt hour you know
especially you know with recent
commodity price movements so I think you
know we can't really be quantitative but
that directionally is a pretty good
trend yeah we think we can get the
Cobell but took almost nothing okay
great thank you thank you very much less
about next question please
Thank You our next question comes from
Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley thanks a
you on so you've repeatedly said I think
in recent weeks that you do not need to
issue equity capital at Tesla I think
many investors on this call would say
it's better to raise capital when you
don't need to so I guess the first
question is yeah you may not need to
what do you want to know no one can
typically I specifically don't want to
perfect okay my follow up Elon is you
know your cars produce early a large
amount of data and SpaceX gets into the
satellite broadband business next year
summer I will oh yeah yeah didn't okay
not next year but it's probably three
okay okay three years yeah um thank you
for that
some argue that SpaceX could offer Tesla
resilient cyber secure pipe for this
precious vehicle data and a potential
competitive advantage so you want isn't
bandwidth an obvious domain for
collaboration between Tesla and SpaceX
one day I mean it might be the sorts of
interesting things you could do classic
a lot of computing power and it's
connected you know to the cell networks
and Wi-Fi and everything
I work it's totally connected to the Leo
leo
internet constellation I've really
thought about it but probably there is
thanks don't thank you let's go to the
next question please
Thank You our next question comes from
David tambourine Oh with Goldman Sachs
great thanks for protecting our
questions
Ilan you talked about the downtime on
the model 3 you're going to take two
planned periods this quarter one's
already occurred the other is going to
occur later in the quarter
you know what specifically have you
addressed in Fremont so far and what are
you planning to address a little bit
later and are those alone kind of
remaining bottlenecks for you to get to
the 5k within the Fremont plan well the
Tesla production system at this point is
is fast so and we literally have I bet
the two biggest factories on earth
between the gigafactory and Fremont
gigas a little slightly smaller than
Fremont they won't maybe just yeah
slightly more for bid will soon be
bigger than Fremont and pretty much like
the second biggest will they of any kind
by my footprint so it's like this it is
a vast it's a full answer that question
is a complex one the I feel very
confident about our ability to get to
five K in a very students stand rate at
Giga getting to just terms of getting
tip to 5,000 battery packs and motors
and tried powered converters and
chargers that kind of thing sold under
Giga by the end of next month and your
body production got no problem
a General Assembly is probably a biggest
risk and I'm refocusing personally on
that a lot in the next coming month
and then the a paint shop is smooth
second biggest risk after General
Assembly these are all free these are
all quite manageable that it's like it's
not like huge brain surgery to get these
things right it's a lot of work like
there's a lot of just a lot of time hard
work but it's very doable and yeah it
says first it's really quite
straightforward it's like not like a
fundamental impediment here in many
cases we've seen huge gains through
software software that's in the car
software that controls the automation
and connects to our our central systems
so in cases it's not even hardware
upgrades that create substantial
increases in velocity yeah exactly that
makes a good point here and I think does
that the productive production a really
great production system is primarily a
software problem and there's no one in
the order industry that is remotely as
good as Tesla at software status or
wherever
I mean Tesla's way better software than
any other car company so if if it is
what I'm saying is true that the biggest
challenge in a production system is
software I we are in a good position
okay maybe taking my next question in a
different direction what is your
timeline for launching the model why and
have you begun to spend for this or that
only begin to start hitting the PNL from
an R&amp;amp;D in a capex perspective in 2019 it
will only start to become significant in
2019 okay so all of the capex spend for
this year is associated with Freemont
Model 3 Giga Factory no no I please take
me literally I said it only because
thought it becomes significant next year
it's not zero right now but it's not
it's not it's not a big number
but it's not a big number relative to
our revenue so in the early days of our
product development anyway there is not
much capex capex comes
reactors you've committed to equipment
and equipment starts to come in you know
yeah although it is remarkable like well
although the amount of money spent in
beginning is really quite low but we go
to Java program decisions made the
beginning of developed program have
massive implications for future capex so
it is better to spend a bit more time
making the right design decisions and
really thinking through the producer
bility of a product before racing ahead
with capex decisions there's no question
we could have made them all three much
easier produced then we have model why I
think model is going to be a
manufacturing revolution but it will be
I think incredible for a manufacturing
standpoint because we do not want to go
through this pain again yeah thank you
very much
let's go to the next question thank you
your next question comes from Rome Itza
wasn't a more infinite yeah I just
wanted to clarify the the gross margin
comments related to model 3 that you you
put in the in D and the letter you said
a couple things you said you know over
the medium-term model three gross
margins would be would be below the the
target of 25% you also said that in q3
and q4 that those gross margins would be
highly positive so I'm just trying to
understand what's what's possible for
model 3 gross margins by the end of the
year could we get to a number that's
close to 20% whoa what that's is that
progressively each quarter we will be
getting better and yes the answer yeah
and it will come down to you know what
other economics come to play from
currencies to commodities and how much
more cost we take are from labor so I
don't want to give you a specific number
but will be close to it it's like yeah
exactly
it's worth yeah exactly very very close
to 20% could be slightly lower could be
slightly above okay fair enough and then
um Ilan can I just ask you about all
right Kim going a little further for ten
things that say q4 we're very confident
of a 25 cent gross margins I find that
yeah we can read about the next year it
up in 25% yeah it is definitely what we
expect
so when you say medium-term you're
talking 2018 yeah exactly that's why
were clarified what what these things
mean their q4 is when we expect to be
under nearly on or about 20% I then get
but by the middle of next year
25% gross margin it should be where we
are and then well as you try to get to
the high 20s by then next year okay 30
okay
as a follow-up could you just comment on
Jim Jim Keller's departure
highly-respected chip architect you know
what what does it say if anything about
the development of Tesla's custom
silicon and autopilot thank you uh well
the edge of it was great guy and the
this sort of agreeing award for super a
long time
- which is - how to redesign the house
server architecture works you know
that's not something that but but I find
that interesting but it's something that
Jim it's been a sort of personal dinner
gems to do and that's why I went you
know I can tell the you know the Tesla
the data that the design of the Tesla
Hardware it is is primarily by pete man
and though i should be clear like the
with the lead designer of that
Bannen degrees or Tasman and another
Cassandra Carpathia's head of our AI
team so we don't plan to to hire a
replacement for John's position Hey
thank you very much let's go to the next
question
Thank You our next question comes from
Tony second Ozzy with Bernstein yes
thank you I just wanted to follow up on
the previous question and the gross
margin targets I think you had said last
quarter that once you got to 5,000 units
you felt that you could get to 25% gross
margins on model three so that feels
like at least a six or nine month delay
relative to what you thought a quarter
ago and I'm trying to understand what
what the key drivers are is it really
the labor for capital substitution
I don't think currency sequentially has
changed much I understand it can be a
headwind but I think relative to when
you made those statements it hasn't
changed
so perhaps you can help help us
understand what has changed in terms of
the gross margin ramp for model 3
relative to what you thought before and
I have a follow-up place it's along the
lines of what we said in the letter if
we look at the combination of the
recently imposed tariffs section 232 and
countervailing duties plus commodity
price increases as well as the weaker
dollar that is adding significant
material cost and then temporarily we
are using more labor so when you combine
those two that's what led to our
guidance then certainly the material the
labor cost piece we will address and
then come out yeah but we were talking
about a three to five percent again so
like you know and that's something that
will also off like within a you know
three six months later so it's not like
it's like some you know like federal
case on it okay and then separately what
if anything are you taking out in terms
of your lowered capex projection for
this year and specifically you know in
spending less than three billion where
does that take you in terms of both
battery and production capacity for the
model three yeah so we just being much
more smarter in many cases as Iran said
we are not just spending money on
automation we're forced looking at the
problem simplifying it and that's looked
at that's hopped us reduce our capex on
model three and then we are also being
critical about how we grow our
infrastructure and line it up with our
growth in our business so within that
these are the right decisions and there
is still room for us to reduce it
further if we wish to so we are leaving
ourselves some discretion here to go
spend money where needed and so where
specifically will you be in terms you
have a profile neck next boring bonehead
questions are not cool next thank you
our next question comes from Joseph back
with RBC Capital Markets thank you
the first question is related to the
model three reservations I was just
wondering you to give us a gauge as
maybe some of the impact that the news
has had like of the reservations has
actually opened and made available at
the figure can you let us know like what
how what percentage have actually taken
steps to configure
we're gonna go to YouTube
sorry these questions are so dry they're
killing me
Thank You our next question is from
Galileo wrestle with hyper change
hey great quarter thanks for having me
on the call to represent retail
investors
I was wondering with way modes plans to
launch an autonomous taxi service in
limited markets this year if you could
give us an update on the Tesla network
and any details surrounding the launch
date or geographic rollout thanks sure
so I mean that's thank you thank you for
an interesting question
the the long-term goal is a point where
things were obviously evolving towards
is a shared electric autonomy model so
the in order for this to office leap for
the whole sort of system to work you
know you need old pieces in place you
have full autonomy the whole four or
five what do you want to call it and I
you know a lot of cars in the road and
then both the software infrastructure
behind that to enable shared autonomy so
the YouTube tip and they will be able to
share their cars and be able to offer
their cars as or effectively you kind of
a robo lyft or uber uber you know it's
or like combination of like I guess
uber lyft or and Airbnb type of thing
where you can own your car and have a
harp set usage of autonomous electric
car you can say it's available generally
to to anyone who wants to use it when
you're not using it you can recall it at
will you can restrict usage to only
friends and family it will only use your
five-star like this is like the obvious
thing that's going to happen in order
for that to be in place we have to
obviously so full autonomy right we're
making really good progress on that
front I believe that the
currents production of Dakota vehicles
are currently producing are capable of
full autonomy with with the only thing
that would really be like might be
needle but maybe is probably needed is a
computer upgrade to have more processing
power for the vision neural net but but
that's a plug-in replacement a thing
that can be done quite easily so I think
we're really well positioned and willing
to write the foundation for a you know
having millions ultimately tens of
millions of shared autonomous electric
vehicles but which you can like I said
decide not to sure if you don't want to
and that equation specifically on a
timing on the timing though do you have
any details about or when we can even
expect to learn more about the timing of
this service well um the the the hottest
thing to break about the timing is
regulatory approval you know that this
the other thing that's tricky with
autonomous vehicles is that the autonomy
doesn't reduce the accident rate of
tality rate to zero
it improves it substantially but the
reality is that you know even though we
think are that we think economy even an
even current on autonomy that reduces
the probability of a death by by fifty
percent which which is would be
incredible because like identified you
know floridly there's over a million I
can go up point two million automotive
deaths per year and how many do you read
about basically none of them however and
and but if it's an autonomous situation
you headline news and the media fails to
mention that actually they shouldn't
really be writing the story they should
be writing story about how autonomous
really safe but that's not the story
that if you want to click on so there
right inflammatory headlines that are
fundamentally misleading to the readers
that's really outrageous so and this
would be true even if electric cars were
or overexpose sorry photon amiss cars
were ten times safer so instead of a
million deaths you had a hundred
thousand deaths this this still going to
be you know people who will who will
still sue and say hey you're responsible
for the death here it's like well the
ninety percent of people who didn't die
are not suing you know they're not
they're not if they're still alive they
just don't knowing so so you got to deal
with that and then mostly regulators
respond to public pressure and and the
press so if you look if the press is
hounding the the regulators and and the
public is lifting like laboring on
misapprehension that autonomy is less
safe because of that of of misleading
press then this is a this is where I
find things to the challenge of
particulate and yeah it's a really
incredibly responsible with the pro of
of any journalists with integrity to
write an article that would lead people
to believe that Tesla the katana me is
is less safe because people might
actually turn it off and then die
so anyway I'm really surprised
yeah really interesting answer thank you
but it's a chance to say from a
technical standpoint I think I think
would probably be already by the end of
next year
awesome and then one more quick thing on
production capacity and speed of the
Fremont line because this is something
you mentioned a lot at teams and in the
last quarterly conference call you
mentioned the max capacity was 700,000
cars for Fremont or somewhere around
there and I was FX and three and so we
recently got a report a report from
Reuters saying that model y production
would start in November 29
at Fremont and so I'm just kind of
curious with the semi and that model
while launching next year like where are
you actually planning on assembling
these vehicles other words the Reuters
report is based on nothing like I didn't
with know where that came from
we will not be starting pressure a
little wide at the end of next year I
would say it's probably closer to 24
months from now so 2020 is more likely
prospect for model why yeah probably
2020 and the production location from
otherwise not been decided we're really
crowded here at Fremont I don't know
where we put the model y production so
it's difficult to imagine that the great
risk could not fit the model y
production at Fremont we're gem to the
gills here so one thing I know for sure
it's not here
it is crazy packed and we're generous
yeah and so yes okay look yeah we'll try
to repair it out what the possible
location is full from what why
production but it's not here I'm not
here if you want okay and I'm not an
expert in a battery pack technology but
it seems that a lot of people are
speculating that the specs for the
semi-truck even I believe the yo Daimler
that it breaks the laws of physics so
I'm wondering cause it is just a little
bit not much about physics I know yeah
we have to engage in a public discussion
with them I actually thought about a
business in college but yeah my question
is is that just a linear improvement in
your battery technology or is there some
sort of view breakthrough or different
platform that the semi and roadster
going to be built on it likes even if we
didn't I mean even if we didn't improve
our battery technology at all we could
achieve a 500 mile range truck at all
we're going to do better than 500 miles
yeah this is JB I think the key point is
it doesn't require some some dramatic
breakthrough that so there's a
fundamental misunderstanding
I think about the current technology in
our existing products can actually do
yeah you know and maybe that's just a
misunderstanding of sort of the current
status of the technology versus others
in the industry that could be where some
of that's coming from if they're
benchmarking sort of the best battery
pack they can buy you know from a
supplier yeah and then mapping luckily
the semi could do it doesn't give you it
doesn't solve so I think that that's
maybe where some of that's coming from
but but we mean we basically have what
we need in-house and understand how to
do those specs today or better as Yulin
said we could do a five hundred mile
range semi today I think the actual
production unit will be above six or
eight mile range awesome great stuff so
I'm also wondering are you guys going to
let Porsche beat you to market with a
350 kilowatt hour supercharger because I
know you mentioned the other III
questions are boring thank you going
so yeah that's cool yeah so there's all
right we're just going to kilowatt the
350 kilowatt charger from Porsche like
if they mentioned they're rolling that
out on the last call JB seemed to
indicate that you guys were sort of it
going to keep the status quo with your
supercharger technology but you want to
know you mentioned that there is a v3
supercharger so I'm just trying to get
some clarity on whether you will be
improving your supercharger technology
or not and if there is a beep degree
we're definitely going to be improving
our supercharge technology the thing
about a 3 or 50 kilowatt charger is it
doesn't actually make a ton of sense
unless you've got a monster backed
battery pack or have a like a crazy high
C rate in which case your energy density
is going to be poor so it's kind of
cockamamie everything maybe 200 thoughts
on a protocol so I don't if they meant
350 kilowatts for a single car that's
the best that's that's really pretty
you're going to you're going to frag the
battery pack if you do that if there's
no high you cannot charge a high energy
battery pack at that rate at the miss
it's a very high kilowatt hour battery
pack so so something along the
yeah I think you know they've got a
couple hundred 200 250 maybe yeah I mean
that that's a that's definitely sort of
power level that we've discussed and
explored and some of it also comes down
to an optimization around utility versus
cost and trade-offs in the car itself
you kind of hinted at that Elon but you
know there is trade-off fundamentally
between charge speed and in essentially
range or cost of battery yeah and you
know we look at that pretty carefully
you know we you know we understand the
trade-off and we could design cells in a
pack that could charge it you know
faster than you know 300 400 kilowatts
but it's not a very useful trade off to
the customer yes yeah let's go with our
other different strategy and power even
really yeah energies there are synergies
rate is something much too range and
then power is kind of like your peak
acceleration basically you know the Ray
which consume energy so really what's
more important to have it's more to have
long range than it is to have a super
fast charge time and you can sort of
think about this in the devices that you
use like would you rather have a cell
phone that lasted two hours but bigger
charge if you're charging five in five
minutes or ten minutes let's say but it
only lasted two hours or you've like
this off limit last two days and maybe
it takes an hour to charge thank you all
right
yeah right we'll keep going plants good
questions on up or arsenal brother well
actually yeah I have a I have a couple
more on for the superchargers I know you
guys are not trying to profit off of
Tesla owners with that infrastructure
but will you ever open that up to other
automakers and try and generate revenue
from that system we've always said that
we're this is not intended to be a
walled garden and we're happy to support
other other automakers and let them use
our supercharger stations they would
just need to pay you know the
to share the costs proportionate to
their vehicle usage and they would need
to be able to accept our you know route
charge rate or these and our
connectivity to have an adapter a trail
connector so this is something we're
very open to but so far nor the other
car makers have wanted to do this but
there's it's like not because of
opposition from us this is not a wolf
garden you know kind of make a mobile
 okay and maybe can you clarify
what's the strategy like it seems like
that would be a very strong motive this
network you guys have been building
globally for years so you know why open
it up and why is that not a moat so you
repeat the question I'm just wondering
why that isn't a moat because you know
as a long-term investor I feel like the
charging infrastructure you guys have
built would take years and millions of
dollars for another brand to replicate
so I'm just curious about the strategic
thinking behind opening that up versus
keeping it closed of course well I think
modes are lame I mean they're like nice
and sort of quaint vestigial way but
like if you if your if your only defense
against like invading armies is a moat
you will not last long
what matters is the pace of innovation
that that is the fundamental
determinants of competitiveness and
before for any given company if the rate
of innovation let's say like you know
competitors maybe there they come out
with something new every six years we're
maybe every two to three years so if our
innovation is let's say twice that of of
any given competitor then it is simply
or this is true of generally of
companies in any industry whichever
company has the highest rate of
innovation
unless that company is actively killed
by competitors in some way that's
nefarious or shoots itself at the other
foot it will at some point exceed those
competitors like this was obvious that
this would occur with with Amazon or
Walmart because Walmart rented rate of
innovation was negligible and Amazon's
was very high
the outcome was obvious a long time ago
and in terms of the mega charger I
noticed you guys are going to be selling
energy at a fixed price for those truck
customers so I'm wondering what the
philosophy is there is it also you're
going to operate that at cost and reduce
that energy price or are you thinking of
that as a revenue stream for the company
and we haven't really talked about any
of that and haven't finalized frankly
any of that it's you know we want to
make sure that there's a you know a very
seamless and easy system to operate you
know trucks wherever they need to go and
you know some customers may may elect to
you know to work with us on you know the
whole system or parts of it but I think
there's a lot of different ways that
that can be solved yeah I mean for sure
with with commercial trucking I get a
heavy-duty semi economics or fundamental
to to that situation they're not making
decisions based on aesthetics or you
know consumer related things you know we
made a cinema trying to make a semi kind
of cool and sexy just because we think
that that's a good thing to do not
because it affects the buying decision
of our customers and in a meaningful way
it doesn't really move the needle I
really looks like laughable lawsuit
recently from some company ironically
called Nicola like Nicola is suing suing
Tesla that's hilarious
weight loss irony and add but they're
like suing us because the way the trucks
look which is absurd nobody's buying at
semi-truck because the way it looks or
because it's got like a wraparound
windshield or whatever please so I the
economics are incredibly important and
and so we have make sure that the stupid
charges or mega Charizard cone for the
trucks are set up in a way that that you
have very low cost electricity I mean
what one maybe slightly related point to
that that I think is super exciting
about this is
you know the potential to link up
renewable energy generation at a very
fixed and also very affordable cost
you have to power future trucking please
ultimately that can give customers
incredibly you know deterministic cost
per mile that will not change with the
price of petroleum over you know decades
which is really really an interesting
proposition for a trucking customer and
you know that's something that yeah
we're pretty excited about yeah he's
happy I won last if it's really worth
emphasizing that we're trying companies
like if the cost of diesel you know goes
up up you sent it just it just like
destroys their business and we're with
them with the sort of mega charger
situation combining you know investing a
solar battery powered mega charger we
have at the dev constant costs and we
know what they are
with make them in and yeah it's very
predictable and lower cost per mile than
diesel truck at the front of it but you
know primarily it's like what what is
the cost
where's the cost per mile to a kilo
meter of cargo and that that drives the
commercial trucking market and you have
I've been struck in the oil in the soil
would be victorious yeah yeah building
on that do you have any thoughts on how
the trucking market could change or
potentially grow if you guys are
actually able to deliver on dramatic
cost reduction especially with things
like platooning
I think it will it will it will take
away it quite a bit of revenue from
railway because the reason we reason
rail trails able to be competitive is
that effectively just platooning with
with lots of rail cars and you need only
a small crew to operate the Train
five-oh trains look over your trains
don't go everywhere so you have like
have a truck deliver things to the train
rail spur and then picks up pick it up
you know and then at the destination or
trucks going to pick it up from the rail
spirits spur over there so you still
have trucks plus train plus transfer
so I think platooning after both of
trucks will quite dramatically affect
the rail industry it can have been a
negative way okay last one I promise on
Tesla energy I assume that you guys
basically supply constrained not demand
constraint on that side of the business
so I'm wondering how you're prioritizing
residential versus utility scale and in
particular how is this successful
project in South Australia sort of
changed the industry's perception of
what battery can do yeah and it's had
quite a profound effect the the there's
South Australia took a chance on doing
the world's biggest battery it's worked
out really well if you read the articles
it's worked out far beyond their
expectations because the battery is able
to respond at the millisecond level far
faster than any hydrocarbon planet and
so it's it's its value in grid
stabilization was much greater actually
then then than even I picked a gas
turbine plant which can only respond
quite fast so it's not like you get on
Tesla and you can have that instant
acceleration it feels like you're like
how or so like a mind meld with the car
it's just like the car is you and that
the same Rapid Response is true of the
battery pack so the the paper because
was that review Tiller's that worked
with us far I really loved the battery
pack and I feel confident that we'll be
able to announce a deal at the gigawatt
hour scale within a matter of months so
it's a a thousand other ones what maybe
what a thousand make what I asked for
those are we hey Gordon yeah maybe just
the first part of your question also you
know it is absolutely accurate that we
are still you know there's more than
enough to hands and we are still
building out of our demand backlog and
actually increasing it slightly you know
and you know we're trying to do our best
to priority
you know customers between you know
presidential power wall and utility and
commercial you know I'd say our
longer-term strategy is to we have shift
a little bit of our focus and really
catch up on our power wall two-man
backlog which is this it's quite it's
too long right now we know people are
waiting too long so that's I think
that's generally the direction we're
trying to take that but you know model
three is taking a lot of focus in the
last few quarters and you know that that
trend is going to be reversing in the
second half of the year awesome thank
you guys so much really appreciate the
time keep up the awesome work all right
welcome thanks the great questions that
goes on next question please
Thank You our next question comes from
Phil abou with CNBC
i'il on a question on the Tesla semi can
you give us some perspective in terms of
how many reservations you guys have now
and where you guys are in the plan for
developing it and rolling out the first
model so geez sorry we're just
discussing something in telling could
you repeat that question with the Tesla
semi how many reservations do you guys
now have approximately and where are you
in the process as far as the development
and rollout of the first model in terms
of timeline when you guys expect that to
happen etc I actually don't know how
many reservations have the semi I don't
think what mm okay I mean we haven't
really tried to sell semi it's not like
this like an ongoing sales effort so you
know sales orders or semi I like
opportunistic really companies
approaching us you know it just lets me
really think about much focuses on the
model 3 we need to get that to about
5,000 a week at a good margin we to
become profitable company that is a a
good criticism that has been level to
Tesla an accurate one is high time we
became profitable
and you know and the truth is like
you're not a real company until you
until you are frankly so that that's our
focus right now and then the other side
we've got an awesome product roadmap the
tales of samurai is one of those things
and you know I think we've got a really
good idea for the waddle y is going to
be amazing I'm really excited about that
Tesla pickup is going to be great and
you know so at the park board map we
have like way more cool things than we
know what to do like the idea is a
generation party's devoted to execute it
so we just need to stay focused and not
divide our attention on to any products
at one time and a follow up when you
given the fact that you're already
packed to the gills in Fremont when will
you make a decision regarding a second
manufacturing facility so that that's
probably later this year it has to be
later this year so I'm not sure exactly
but I know maybe maybe next quarter but
not later than fourth quarter for Mar Y
and and then we also expect to announce
the location of a Tesla Giga Factory in
China and will that second factory when
you announced it will it be in North
America or is that going to be in China
well I just said it's in China so the
gigafactory there but the second
manufacturing plant without gender sorry
oh I mean yeah so all sites are good to
do yet in the future all for Giga
factories will include vehicle
production so right now we're a big
production and battery production rate
like battery production and motor and
power electronics and charge of
production are at Giga and we're going
after my car factory but future
factories will all incorporate their
comp reduction got it thank you
excited talking like that appreciative
appreciative of the fact that the gum of
China has announced that they will be
allowing a full ownership of
manufacturing facilities in China which
let's express aware of appreciations the
Chinese government that requirement
that's also a promise anything
if you'd like to say we're in good
discussion with the government oh so
well now something well we like okay so
Robin rains here with nice roughness is
managing worldwide sales for Tesla right
now here here's one reason Chang
wonderful it's not be a tight circle
anyway
but we will talk more about I think the
next any school next we'll have a lot
more to say about that in the future our
next question comes from James Albertine
with consumer edge and if I can be brief
I wanted to ask you know given the
coverage that you've received you know I
was it relates to these high profile
accidents you know one of the things we
like most about your company is you have
the most miles tested and uncontested
ailee from an autopilot perspective can
you give us any color from what you're
seeing in your data as it relates to the
confidence that your consumers have in
the autopilot functionality whether
they've worked used it more or less
frequently in their existing vehicles or
whether they opted to purchase the
functionality more or less in lieu of
these accidents because we're really
trying to get ahead a sense of you know
consumer sort of you know the ability
for the likelihood of consumers to adopt
this technology over time so this would
be very helpful
Thanks
we do see a steady increase in the
number of vintage of my house driven
with using water pilots so as we as you
roll out more functionality as we make
it better we see we see a steady
increase you know I think it's something
hopeful cause record autopilot something
on the order of a third of highway miles
maybe closer to maybe a half in some
cases are in some regions are on
autopilot
but then of course when there's like
negative use in the press then that dips
and then I was like okay this is not
good because you're reading things
oppressed that get causing to use auto
pilot less and then that makes it
dangerous for our customers and that's
not cool that's why I get upset and then
we get accused of blaming the victim I
was like look we're not blaming victim
here but we it is important that you
will not be under the wrong impression
mm-hmm the statistics are unequivocal
that motor pilots improve safety there's
no question in fact I the one thing I
was gonna mention original points for
intervention is that we'll be publishing
our safety statistics on a quarterly
basis wonderful so people know exactly
what autopilot
safety is is it getting better or is it
getting worse and it's like common most
impressions is that when there is a
serious accident on autopilot people for
some reason think that some of the
articles think that it's because the
driver thought the call was fully
autonomous and it wasn't and we somehow
misled them into thinking was fully
autonomous it is the opposite case when
when there is a serious accident it is
it almost always in fact may be always
the case that it is an experienced user
and and and and the issue is what more
one of complacency like we just get you
get too used to it
that that tends to be more of an issue
it's not it's not a lack of
understanding of
but what about to do is actually it
thinking they know more about water
palette than they do like a good quiet
quite a significant understanding of it
but 50 less maybe just to clarify
tonight so you've had two accidents
spaced out pretty far you've had dips
during those periods when the accidents
occurred but to clarify your comments
you are increasing user Singh increasing
usage and you've weathered those dips
based on where we are today that is
correct
wonderful thank you so much thank you
thank you
our next question comes from Ben callow
with fair pay you on so I remember the
fair and story I don't know if it was
great news or not what you hung up on
about your battery costs oh and I don't
want to ask him a day in question Bob
but I think it's a fork because one of
your stakeholders or shareholders right
now and so far we've had a couple push
outs in production and is there a way
that you can update us when you get to
that 3,000 number or 4,000 number per
week I mean you you you're active on
Twitter can you just let us know because
then we're gonna have a big back here
and there's a lot of news flow out there
that make volatility into the stock it
makes it hard for people to own even
though you have a lot of believers out
there and so even though we're being my
office right now I think it's very
important to get those kind of updates
and so that's I think that's my question
give us an update when to get to 3,000
or 4,000 per week on the malla brief
yeah I actually but what's what's you
know tens of such a leaky civet
information that I think it's because
the news will leak pretty pretty quickly
it also people track with registration
rate closely so at most any information
that we provide would be a week or two
in advance of what will will become
public knowledge just to do to vehicle
interest registrations and shipments
that attract very carefully so if it
really depart the problems like people
get too focused on like what's happening
in the space of a few weeks or a few
months
this is the old maxim of investing you
should not be focused on short-term
things you should be focused on
long-term things I regret
everywhere no interest with noise we
have no interest in satisfying the
desires of day traders like couldn't
care less please sell our stock and
don't buy it
hi Heather I could pretend you're
frustrated and I think I I'm frustrated
too on on how myopic we are right now
they also say this you know great years
are made out of quarters and great
decades in layout years
so everyone short-term focus to some
ways and volatility has a way of shaking
people out even that are strong and want
to be there and trill okay and anything
could do the help in the near term on
that I think it's helpful for the Sun
that's it I mean I think that if people
are concerned about volatility they
should definitely not my our stock I'm
not here to convince you to buy our
stock do not buy it if volatility is
scary they go okay and let's go to our
last question now thank you
our last question comes from Alex
pattern with type or Jeffrey hi guys
thanks a lot I'm not sure if this is
going to be a hard question to answer
you mentioned model free market share
versus the free series and others in
that segment to what extent do you think
model 3 is I guess changing the
denominator making that segment larger
as a class versus what I used to be I
think it will probably increase the
total number of sedans no interest in
yeah I think so
so you think you're pulling at you know
what X Accord buyers and Camry buyers
into that class yeah we hope ya notice
because of the trade ends so we see
quite a wide range of cars including so
so I feel a lot of trading in the cars
or not
they're not necessarily owners of you
know a se class or a TA four or three
series that we saw signs of not even
with model ed you had my last silver
model tree it's going to be even more
prominent yeah yeah exactly and I think
it's like a cool source once we get to
like the shared economy you know right
healing thing which could be as soon as
in a next year but just call that that's
one is technically ready but they're not
long after that I would expect some some
jurisdictions to give regulatory
approval the effect of cost of ownership
of a model three or Tesla crops
dramatically because you can share that
car with with others okay very
interesting last one you mentioned
earlier you think the model wide
production is going to be a true sort of
production revolution if you had to do
the model three over again there are
some things that you would have change
and you hope to incorporate those
learnings in the model why what
specifically would you do what
specifically shall plan to do well I
think let us say that for another time
but we'll talk about that when we unveil
the model why but it's really going to
be dramatically better the design and
production system I think really will be
next level okay but over to later uh-huh
yeah okay thank you
all right thanks a lot thanks thanks
everyone appreciate good questions okay
these unfortunately all the time we have
so thank you very much and speak for you
next quarter
thank you very much and goodbye ladies
and gentlemen thank you for
participating in today's conference this
does conclude the program you may all
disconnect and have a wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
