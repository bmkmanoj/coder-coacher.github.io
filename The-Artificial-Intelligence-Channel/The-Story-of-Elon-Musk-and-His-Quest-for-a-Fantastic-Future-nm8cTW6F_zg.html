Michael Krasny good morning and welcome
to the second hour of this morning's
forum program Elon Musk has been
transforming the auto industry with
Tesla electric cars producing cheap
solar power throughout the United States
with solar city and building
state-of-the-art rockets and spacecraft
cheaper than all of the competition with
SpaceX each of these companies worth
around ten billion dollars are led by
musk of South Africa born inventor
entrepreneur and engineer who made a
fortune earlier on with PayPal now we
have a biography of musk by Ashley Vance
who for many years was a reporter on
Silicon Valley and Technology for the
New York Times it is now at Bloomberg
Businessweek his book is called the Elon
Musk Tesla SpaceX and the quest for a
fantastic future and he joins us in
studio for the second form our and
welcome to the program thank you for
having me good to have you
well let's begin sort of with what went
off and here's an analogy between Elon
Musk and Steve Jobs for obvious reasons
I mean both of them geniuses both of
them inventors both of them visionaries
and yet in many respects he's thinking I
think he'll on musk he had three
industries coverage I was the only two
but in addition to that they get
compared to each other a lot because
both very difficult men yep i I think
the biggest comparison would be around
their personality you especially for the
employees you can be a hero one day and
a zero the nest it's kind of what have
you done for me lately around the office
and and they can both be very
temperamental and demanding and Elon
certainly has that that job Z and sort
of attention to detail I it's funny
because Elon is more of kind of an
engineer physicist but I've seen him go
around inspecting the cars and he's
pulling down the Sun Visor and saying I
don't like the seam on this thing and
and and so you can definitely see the
similarities well as far as employees
it's like I'd rather they fear me didn't
love me that old axiom there is a story
that one of his employees had a child
who was being born and he that is the
employee asked to get out of a Tesla
event and
according to the story at least musk was
incorrigible and didn't want him to miss
the event but then now must denies that
this comes from my book the the quote
from this employee and then and then
Ilan did subsequently deny it on Twitter
the one frustrating thing is that it's
about ten words in the book and it's
kind of blown up and taking a life on
its own that completely stand by my
reporting it took place during a very
difficult period for Tesla it was 2008
and the company was basically on the
verge of bankruptcy almost every day and
it was all hands on deck you were sort
of on call basically as an employee and
employees were helping they were turning
back their salary to help the company
make it through and and so I don't think
you learn goes around today asking
people to miss the birth of their
children but during this very difficult
period this was the type of thing that
happened well there is also you say for
an engineer he could be enraged the way
Steve Jobs was and difficult what I
would see in terms of get a picture of
his personality and maybe his origins
and everything before we get into these
amazing accomplishments that he's been
associated with but when I had Walter
Isaacson on who's a biographer of Steve
Jobs I asked him to see if Jobs give any
money that we know of to the
impoverished or to people in need or
causes that were philanthropic and
Isaacson who had complete access and you
had pretty much complete access to
Illinois musk didn't have the answer to
that do we know even anonymously well I
know he gave a lot of money for robotics
but I'm talking about charities or
philanthropy here I guess you could look
at the question a couple of ways one
would be if you consider going to Mars a
reasonable thing for humans to do and
consider it saving human right so if you
think of this is the ultimate charity
kind of an exit plan for humans he's
spending a ton of his billions of
dollars of his own money chasing that
goal if you as far as sort of a Bill
Gates Warren Buffett type I'm pledging
my fortune to charity there isn't that
the thing I did run across is quite
anonymously he will one of his employees
will say hey my kids school wants to
start this new probe
and all of a sudden $500,000 show up and
there was something like the Nikola
Tesla Museum they were trying to build a
museum and I think he gave a million or
three million dollars to that so he
seems to do this on more of like a
one-off basis where he gets interested
he just started so a private school
called ad astra right down in los
angeles this is for a lot of these kids
who work with him and his own kids right
this is just coming out now I mean it's
been it's a recent development and it's
basically is a very very small school
for Elon children and maybe a handful of
other SpaceX employees and just being
the idea that the the current schools
kind of weren't going fast enough for
meeting the needs of his kids
well whatever money he gave or didn't
give for whatever causes it now turns
out there's a big article about this
that the government subsidized them to
an estimated close to five billion
dollars in terms of government support
he knew to go to the government for a
lot of these projects of his and he knew
he could get revenue yeah no question
I'm it's been an interesting story for
the companies I think with SpaceX a lot
of times people see a NASA contract for
billions of dollars and sort of think of
that as a subsidy although I would argue
that's you wouldn't call it a subsidy
not at all because SpaceX is the only
company we have right now that can take
us to the space station and that soon
will take a bastard knots and they're
doing business for the government that
otherwise we wouldn't have done or we
would have to go overseas to get that
business done in the case of Tesla there
were moments in that company's history
where it got a huge loan for the
Department of Energy that Tesla likely
wouldn't have survived without that loan
people get rebates for the electric cars
Solar City is in the energy business and
and has some similar rebates if you go
solar obviously but of course you know
they're competitors all have huge
subsidies as well there's a reason our
gas is so cheap and and the energy
companies that solar cities going
against have their own perks so but the
funny thing you know recently Tesla's
been building this really large battery
factory in Nevada and full Fords cars
and for home storage of energy you would
get from solar panels and we can't even
get enough of them out there I mean riot
demand right he just sort of announced
this and they sold out through next year
but then equally this Nevada Texas
California I think
we're all fighting to get a piece of
Elon Musk and the reason that figure
gets so high is is I mean the the
package is that these states were
putting together it's a hat be in the
Elon Musk business were quite lucrative
yeah well Nevada was able to welcome him
across the state border because of the
the deals that they were able to offer
right we're talking to Ashley Vance
who's a technology writer for Bloomberg
Businessweek which was based in Palo
Alto his new book is Elon Musk Tesla
SpaceX and the quest for a fantastic
future and we're going to talk about
that vision of a fantastic future with
Ashley Vance who as I said earlier had
access to Elon Musk which in itself is
no small matter you're from South Africa
originally that didn't necessarily pave
the way for you didn't know I mean it
was kind of it's kind of a story how I
eventually managed to get Elon to do the
interviews when I first I'd done a cover
story on him for Businessweek in 2012
and especially after I visited the
SpaceX Factory I was blown away and knew
that's what I wanted to write about an
Elon ended up being a more a much better
interview than I had given him credit
for before I'd spend time with him he
was he would answer questions
authentically and and really seemed to
put some thought into these things and
so I thought maybe I'd want to do a book
and I went and asked him and he said
look you know eight or nine people have
asked me to do a book before and I sent
them all away I think I want to do my
own book and and so I sort of listened
to that and then I went off and sold the
book and came back to it sold about sold
the book you sound like you're made of
the similar metal it will take no for an
answer I read there were you know as you
start doing your report I get hearing
these stories about him you think okay
what would Elon do in the situation and
so I went for 18 months of reporting I
interviewed on the order of 200 people
and then all of a sudden I was at home
one day and up on my caller ID popped a
Elon Musk and he said I can either make
life pretty difficult on you from here
on out or maybe I'll cooperate with the
book now and we kind of had a meeting
and hashed everything out and he did
cooperate well I must say you know the
the the biography does not put a halo
over his head I mean you get into some
of the tougher things about him and more
arrogant sides of him and Narcis
sides which many people have commented
on who not only worked for him but who
knew him one way or another and like
many of these people who come along
maybe once a century like he does
there are facets to his character that
really sort of repel as well as many
things of course that are attractive
about him he can be charming I mean if
you here's some cuts from Elon Musk in
the course of this hour but let's talk a
little bit about his background before
we get into all of the extraordinary
feats that he has brought to the fore
there this is a he's talked a lot about
his adversity he's been open about that
he got bullied a great deal he was a boy
genius he was always reading just you
know doing nothing but reading there may
have been some brutality from his father
we don't necessarily know a lot about
that I realize but all of these things
don't necessarily give us the picture of
what his mother probably maybe best of
all called a boy genius I mean that's
maybe the only way to in other words
people think well he got kicked out of
PayPal or he had malaria or he had an
infant son who died and maybe this
explains his difficulties or whatever it
was a boy genius and pretty
misunderstood in a lot of ways I think
as I dug into his family life and went
back to talk to his friends and and his
school chums it was pretty interesting
because I had never seen this part of
Elon and sort of brought out I mean he
was a he was a know-it-all kind of kid
but he had this amazing he read every
book at the library he read every book
in the bookstore there was near there
there every comic book yeah I mean he
well you bring up a really good point he
was devouring science fiction and one of
the points I make in the book is that I
think other kids take these things as
interesting stories for Elon it seems to
be a calling from a very young age and
and you know he was this real loner I
mean it was so it was sad people said he
just didn't have friends over for
sleepover he didn't have a best friend
nobody knew and then his his family
thought he was a genius but the other
kids at school they knew he was bright
but they said he he might have been the
least likely person they would have
picked him down the stairs at one point
I mean there was a lot of that bullying
that he endure but let's hear what he
says about
he's talking about how a voracious
reader he was as a child and you'll hear
a woman's voice it's actually his mother
I read all the comics I could buy or
that they let me read the book still
report chasing me away I read everything
I could get my hands on from when I woke
up to when I went to sleep at one point
I got I really ran out of books to start
reading me encyclopedia and he has a
photographic memory so he could remember
everything
any time I had a question my daughter
Tosca would say call genius boy his
genius boy who wants to save humanity it
really has that mission even though he
can sometimes be very inhuman and his
dealings with other people well in one
of those stories is pretty funny so he
was out with all the with Tosca his
sister and Kimball his brother and their
cousins when they were a kid and and the
other kids went outside and they were
afraid there in the in Africa and and
and they complained that they were
scared of the dark and Ilan said what
you know why are you scared of the dark
it's only the absence of light I mean he
would always come out with these very
logical things that the other kids did
not respond well so you captured the
sense of a man may be a genius but has
great insecurities and ultimately from
your way of thinking he's like a general
I mean a which general his his ex-wife
just did she always thought of him as an
Alexander the Great Genghis Khan type
type figure I think of him we were
talking about Steve Jobs earlier to me
he's almost a little bit more like
Edison where he assembles these armies
of engineers within this one giant
building at SpaceX or Tesla and then
seems to have her actual knack for
taking their products and turning them
into commercial things and these people
follow him with a zeal that you know if
it's not a general it's I mean it's on
the order of sort of a deity I talked to
people who would be fired by Elon and
still looked up to him and sort of
worshipped him and they they work harder
and devote more of their life to him
than a normal employee does this real
leadership qualities absolutely
absolutely and also uh you mentioned his
wife actually they're the third marriage
to the same wife that he was married he
had two wives one a turkey so he
you had a first wife and then he married
Talulah Riley an actress and he divorced
her then he remade her and then it he's
currently going through a divorce with
her but maybe getting back together with
her some of the stories uh well you know
like which would divorce was it where
she went and discovered that her credit
card didn't work anymore and that was
the that was the first one his way of
saying we're getting divorced right then
he also say at one point how many hours
do I need to devote to a woman ten hours
he figured in this mathematical
calibrated brain of his that comes from
the book as well I caught him between
between divorces and he was trying to
get back on the dating scene and and I
asked him how that was going I just
don't have enough time how many hours is
a woman want a week well let's talk
about the accomplishments because they
are pretty extraordinary uh but before
we do why is he so afraid of artificial
intelligence I mean just like he wants
to colonize Mars he think what does he
think the robots are gonna take over
he's a divested a lot and robots do well
he seems to have a he's one of this
group of people that really believes the
technology is advancing more quickly
than we might think
and that really we have no proper
safeguards put in place if if it does
start advancing on its own it's pretty
funny because he's very good friends
with Larry Page at Google and Elon
splits his time between LA and Silicon
Valley and when he's in Silicon Valley
he doesn't have a home so he either
stays in a hotel or at friends houses
and so he'll he'll sleep over at Larry
page's house and and he thinks Larry is
a good-hearted humid big but he thinks
Larry may well be creating something
that will destroy mankind by accident
and Ellen's been investing in AI
companies to keep an eye on them and now
he's starting to write papers about this
he's very afraid of it well he's got a
lot of visions about the future not only
colonizing Mars and artificial
intelligence but solar cities vision of
a solar future obviously solar city is
behind that to a great degree and other
kinds of energies let's talk about Tesla
first though because when he started
selling Tesla's he went into his own
stores in his own showrooms and that
created a problem I mean in Texas it's
illegal for example isn't it still it's
still an ongoing problem Tesla doesn't
have dealerships like a traditional auto
company does they either sell
a computer or sell direct they don't
charge Commission the salespeople don't
earn commissions on their sales and and
Tesla doesn't really try to make money
off servicing cars like a traditional
dealer was so they're this huge threat
to the dealership model and it's very
strange
it's these laws are sort of state by
state and so in some states
Tesla's been able to set up dealerships
other states they've been blocks and and
I guess all these rules date back to the
early early days of cars when the car
manufacturers would sort of take
advantage of the car dealers the car
dealer groups are supporting
deregulation now I think some of them
are but you know like you see in Texas
where the car dealer Lobby is is
blocking Tesla and all of this
investment into space I mean SpaceX has
really broken into went into the space
station for example but also if you had
said to most people a few years ago
Boeing Lockheed is going to have real
competition nobody would have believed
it no Tesla probably gets more attention
because it's the consumer facing company
SpaceX to me is his greatest and most
unlikely achievement even two years even
three years ago when I started writing
the book SpaceX had had some successful
flights but Lockheed Boeing Aaron's boss
in Europe the Russians still thought it
was more or less a joke that would
inevitably have something go wrong and
and send it packing and it's become sort
of the most consistent one of the most
consistent performers in the aerospace
industry well we have a cut from a 2014
TED talk Elon Musk talked about why he
wanted to explore space and build
rockets let's hear I did build rockets
when I was a kid but I didn't think I'd
be involved in this it was a really much
more from standpoint of what are the
things that need to happen in order for
the future to be an exciting and
inspiring one and I really I don't think
there's a fundamental difference if you
still look into the future between a
humanity that is that a spacefaring
civilization that's out there exploring
the stars on multiple planets and I
think that's really exciting and
compared with one where we have forever
confined to earth until at some eventual
extinction event well they're using and
talking about extinction and the future
and saving humanity as sort of the
undercurrent of that again this is his
life's calling people think it's some
people think it's a joke unless he's
lying to himself and his family
and doing a really good job of it this
is it's an authentic calling for him but
look at what he's achieved I mean you
know you have to suspend your disbelief
with some of these ambitions but like
colonizing Mars and everything but at
the same time what he's achieved is
pretty extraordinary by any standards
he's 43 years old he's made and lost
fortunes many times over even the stuff
he had done just by the time he was 30
this company's zip2 and PayPal would
have been enough for most people who
thought that within 10 years after that
he would have created three industrial
companies that were even bigger is yeah
I mean that's what starts to make you
think this guy can actually do some of
these things what do you think's the
greatest achievement do you think it's
the space stuff I mean from your
perspective as a reporter and who's
covered so much in his accomplishments
from a business standpoint and and a
technology standpoint to me SpaceX
should not exist it's unbelievable that
it does only nations have ever done
anything like it he used to when he
first came out he said oh we're gonna
fly for 60 million dollars Boeing
Lockheed similar flight today would cost
about 300 million dollars everyone
thought he was making these figures up
SpaceX has lived up to them it may even
get cheaper they're now doing a launch
almost every month and that puts them
right on pace with with Europe and the
Russians and they've invented technology
that everybody's copying and they're the
OLT there's you know CEOs at these other
companies have been fired over the last
couple of years they've all had to start
reusable rocket programs from scratch to
match SpaceX and and it's a like for
America it's an amazing story they make
90% of the rockets in Los Angeles all
the competitors buy Russian engines for
their spacecraft and essentially
assemble parts and and so you know this
is the USA's only response to China and
Russia well you tell a story in your
book about one of his chief engineers
talking about how something is going to
cost
pretty high amount of money he said come
on it's the same principle as a can
opener yeah he would there's a couple
times he does this in the book that are
I think really funny there's this thing
is like an actuator just sort of a
device to turn something on or off on on
the spacecraft and people are used to
them costing fifty thousand dollars or
something like that and Elon says you
know I'll give you five thousand dollars
and this guy has never built one before
and so he has to figure this out there's
another guy who comes in and Elon says I
want all of the electronics in the
Rockets it costs ten thousand dollars
and this guy had been working at the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena and he
says Elon it would cost ten thousand
dollars to have a lunch to talk about
these electronics at JPL talk a little
bit we're coming up at a break here but
about the Hyperloop where do we stand on
that and I mean we actually have San
Francisco to LA in 30 minutes thanks to
you I'm us well this goes to the point
you're making before when he first
announced the Hyperloop I think a lot of
people stood up and said here's the Elan
musk announcing another crazy thing and
and since time it's at least gained
traction from a business standpoint
Ilan's building a test track in Texas
that'll be about five miles long he
doesn't want to commercialize it himself
right now so other groups would be able
to test the track and then there's a
company Hyperloop technologies that is
looking to build a track from LA to Las
Vegas and they have 50 million dollars
in funding well we also have a lot of
people who are no doubt interested in
Elon Musk who want to go on the record
here and maybe make comments I invite
you to do that we involve you our
listeners and this becomes interactive
you could join us now at our toll free
number that number eight six six seven
three three six seven eight six please
feel free to join the program again its
toll-free
at KQED forum and you can also go to our
Facebook page many ways to join us with
Ashley Vance who is technology writer
for Bloomberg Businessweek and also the
author of Elon Musk Tesla SpaceX and the
quest for a fantastic future this is
forum
I'm Michael Krasny
this is forum Michael Krasny we're
talking this hour about Elon Musk the
man and his achievements and certainly
someone who has been controversial and
iconic and remained so Ashley Vance is
our guest he's a technology writer for
Bloomberg Businessweek which was based
in Palo Alto and his new book is Elon
Musk Tesla SpaceX and the quest for a
fantastic future and we're focusing on
his past as well as that fantastic
future as he envisions it and we do
welcome your involvement in the program
you can join us by calling us at our
toll free number eight six six seven
three three six seven eight six
particularly like to invite maybe some
people who have had personal contact
with musk or have worked for him many of
them out here but also what you think
about what he envisions and what he has
as I said achieve which I think nobody
can pretty much well the real question
is that we've been kind of hovering
around here is is he saving humanity
because in his mind I believe that is
his mission and that's what he's doing
with a lot of the work that he's doing
or is he just a Titan of industry or is
he both maybe in fact you have some
thoughts about that but we do welcome
your involvement and you can also email
us forum at kqed.org or go to our
website which is kqed.org slash forum I
was just asking Ashley a little bit off
microphone about Elon Musk's politics
because I know he went to Cuba with Sean
Penn and he has dinner frequently
probably six times is pretty frequent
with the president United States Barack
Obama
seen probably by many people as a
libertarian but liberal on social issues
yeah I think he's liberal on social
issues I think his he seems to have
these ties with Obama that can rub some
conservatives the wrong way I think Elon
has to play both sides pretty carefully
because of the businesses he's in and
how much they business they do directly
with the government or influence that he
needs help with and and so he's usually
treads pretty carefully about what he
says he's a smart salesman in that sense
isn't he right and like Steve Jobs is a
Salesman absolutely he's quite practical
about these things
could you just say before we go to our
College something about dragon v2 I mean
let listeners know what it is and what
the status of it is yeah SpaceX plans to
take people to the space station that's
kind of the next goal they've been doing
these resupply missions and so dragon is
the capsule that they've been using to
take supplies to the space station and
then dragon v2 is the next version of
that and it's this very updated look at
what a capsule it does not look like
your 1960s sort of it's got a drop-down
touchscreen display and then these fancy
seats and interior and the idea would be
that it could go to the space station
and come back and land with exact
precision wherever you want it to on
earth and the cost well we don't know
the exact cost I mean it's still way
cheaper than what these things usually
cost to develop I know the first dragon
was maybe on the order of a billion
dollars which would have been a probably
1/10 what had ever been done before for
a capsule what does he conceived of is
the cost of the Hyperloop I mean
especially if you're going to LA in 30
minutes he's talked about it totally
hypothetically on the order of 6 billion
to 12 billion so making it kind of a
fraction of California's high-speed rail
but I think it has to be taken with a
huge grain of salt because we have no
idea what it would actually cost about
the Hyperloop and our governor who has
some visionary qualities to him as well
you know it doesn't necessarily see this
as competitive to his notion of a
high-speed rail or what he envisions of
a high-speed rail yeah well Yi LAN came
up with the Hyperloop pretty much
because he thinks the high-speed rail is
a complete joke and that it's the most
expensive slow train you could kind of
envision under the parameters that you
have and he wanted to put out a
competing vision it's just again we have
no ideas if it can even be done yet even
though people are trying now talking
about Elon Musk with his biographer
Ashley Vance who's here with us in
studio talking about colonizing Mars
about well the relationship between Elon
Musk and humanity as well as his
employees
Tesla's there's so much to talk about
space X and let's go to your calls we
began Jeff with you good morning yeah
thanks I guess my question would be for
the Elon Musk's of the world there
aren't that many by the
there's no doubt he's probably most
extraordinary people that's ever lived
but I guess my question would be when
you get to a point where you're already
you know you've already you're already a
billionaire the motivation the you know
I get it you want to save humanity in
case the you know the apocalypse or
whatever but you know wouldn't that
money best be spent on the problems we
have today cancer and and education and
I'm just wondering I just don't get it
sometimes just don't get it why they
feel they need to do these things that
again they're sexy and they're cool and
all that but all that money you're
investing in a Hyperloop wouldn't that
be great to put that into cancer because
that's something that can hit any one of
us even him and his own kids during his
lifetime
why do all this other stuff in space and
stuff well it's sort of the the tenor of
the question I started out with about
you know Steve Jobs notorious for not
necessarily supporting what many think
of his good causes here at home you ever
broach this with Ilana holy a little bit
I don't want to answer for Elon but he's
a very logical guy and I think while we
may not see existential risk for the
human species as as pressing of a threat
as cancer or some of these big health
issues
Elon does in his head this makes
complete sense and if you think about
global warming maybe it's a much easier
case to make because then he's one of
the only people on the earth that's
doing a couple of practical things to
actually address this problem in a
meaningful way well he is I think he's
been called a techno utopian you know I
mean he does see possibilities here on
earth as well not just that we mean with
his fear of human extinction
notwithstanding and all his talk about
it we can move forward and we can move
into some kind of tech no utopia here
well perhaps a bit I think he's less in
that camp maybe than some of the some
other people in Silicon Valley who I've
covered for a long time I think he he
believes in the wonders of technology
but he doesn't run around spouting you
know technology's the answer for
everything he just happens to settled on
these couple of problems as he wants an
exit plan for people at
just in case we need to keep living here
he wants it to be possible in the in the
meantime and we'll bring out more of
your calls we go to Michael Michael join
us what am i calling to make a general
comment but it was originally inspired
by teacher in 15 you guys because
California report this morning with
Ashley the woman doing the interview
expressed some what I thought was very
strange decision about mr. ma motive and
why he was always talking about been
inspired by going to face another tech
mark for achievements in small child
it's like oh look before mr. mouth
started they exact I'm sorry Michael
we've got a you're breaking up here and
we're not hearing clearly what you're
asking but I think you got the tenor of
the question Ashley I think so sort of
where his motivations come from I the
the one story I was thinking of is that
Ilan had made a bunch of money at PayPal
and he had this fortune and and he went
off to see I didn't go off they kind of
removed them then they know yeah but he
went off after he'd made his money they
did have a coup it sort of push him out
but he went to the the NASA website to
see what NASA's plans were for Mars and
and he expected to find this very
concrete this is how we're gonna explore
it and and maybe one day colonize it and
he found nothing there and so this is
really where SpaceX started was that
Elon wanted to he was depressed that
people that America was no longer really
into exploring he was depressed that we
didn't have these high hopes for space
and for Mars and so before he he started
a commercial space company he actually
wanted to send mice or a plant to Mars
as kind of a grand gesture for Humanity
to inspire people to dream about these
things again and that's that's again
where these motivations come from he
wants people to think that's kind of why
I put this this in the subtitle of my
book that we do have a fantastic future
or that we might have a fantastic
feature as he envisions it yeah what
happened at PayPal
well at PayPal he had essentially there
were two camps they were warring camps
and Ilan came out on the losing side he
had been a very tough but effective
bosses this company was doing very well
it was getting tons of users but he had
a sort of technology battle there were
two founding camps and he had a
technology battle with the other
founding camp when and one day he goes
off to take his first vacation in a very
long time is actually his honeymoon with
his wife that they had put off for about
a year they were going to Sydney for the
Olympics and the minute he hopped on a
plane all the other executives called a
meeting and staged a coup and kicked him
out of the company by the time he landed
he was no longer the CEO they still gets
along with Peter Thiel does it's amazing
it was Peter Thiel David Sachs Max
Levchin
and for a period of time they did not
get along but they've all patched things
up they even produced movies together
thank you for smoking was a movie they
produce that's right yeah let me thank
Michael for his call we'll go to another
caller here and we'll welcome shel
you're on Good Morning Show hi mine I
was wondering if he's come out with
Hamas who's come out with any statements
similar to opposing or in agreement with
Google and people wrote them but book
about Google saying that it's the
government that place to ensure that
that the unemployment which me which is
going to occur with future mark
manufacturing processes that that
increase in unemployment will not be
drastic on much of a negative effect
it's that the government yeah I don't
think as far as I know Jana hasn't come
out with a huge position on if you're
talking about kind of autonomous
technology and the idea of robots and
factories he's more been objecting to
the subjugation of humans really to
machines and an artificial intelligence
less on sort of an employment level and
more and then we should all be kind of
slaves to these things and they would be
our rulers and
obviously in the Tesla factory today
they make heavy use of robotics I just
haven't heard Elon have a position on
that particular part of the AI question
and thank you shell for the call here's
Robert who writes on our website
this is hagiography and by the way for
those of you who don't know what that
means it means making someone into a
saint or putting a halo over their head
happening right in front of us Elon Musk
is an odd duck with plenty of vision and
is involved with interesting
high-profile ventures he has no
engineering degree he has a BS in
economics and a BS in physics there are
plenty of excellent self-taught
engineers but PayPal and Musk's other
foundational activities are financial
service companies and sales and
marketing operations he seems to have a
lot of interest in engineering but I
don't see evidence that he ever did it
for a living
journalists are fond of tossing genius
around well the it's funny because when
I first started out during the book
people said to me Elon comes up with
design things for Tesla and he helps
design part of the rockets and I really
thought that was BS I thought this is
all part of the Elon legend the one
thing that you'll find if you go
actually talk to hundreds of people is
that Elon can hold his own with any
aerospace engineer certainly there are
people who experts in his field and he's
not some savants they can just Bowl them
over but he can absolutely hold his own
he does come up with very specific
things around the rockets and the cars
and his engineers give him full credit
for that he's not always right but he
has come up with a lot of inventions and
SpaceX in particular the things that
they have done with materials and
advanced manufacturing are now being
copied by other industries and almost in
every case it was something that he on
asked for also like his mother said he
had an eidetic memory I mean I don't
know how you establish what geniuses but
usually photo so-called photographic or
eidetic memory is associated with genius
and you know you know he reminds me of
this I had an uncle not a blood uncle
who actually owned an ice cream factory
in Cleveland and he was I don't even
think he went to college but he knew
more about the engineering of that
company then the engineers he hired I
mean was just that kind of mind he had
and I would call him a genius you know
elin talks about this in the book a
little bit he compares his brain
you know in a computer there's the CPU
which does the math calculations and
there's the GPU the graphics processor
which is the stuff that makes the video
games and the movies look great and Elon
thinks he has sort of the equivalent of
a GPU in his head he seems able to hold
images in his head and sort of
manipulate them in 3d and know how
things are going to interact and see the
physics kind of in an innate way and and
I again I thought this was complete BS
until I talked to so many people that
even people who do not really care for
Elon who backed this up and I certainly
don't want anyone to think the book is
hagiography because I tried to tell all
sides to this and there are pluses and
minuses this a listener writes let's
face it as much as Steve Jobs is now
revered by everyone including myself the
impact that Elon Musk will likely have
on civilization will overshadow my
iPhone 6 iPad and Mac like Everest does
to Mount Tamalpais
this is the big debate people always
want to know is who's better but really
a lot of Steve Jobs or it's such a
difficult thing on one hand Steve Jobs
makes consumer products on the other
hand he's put a computer in all of our
hands with all the world's information I
mean I couldn't even get around a city
without this device I think certainly
you can make a case that if Elon Elon is
still to be determined I mean he has to
get a mass-produced electric car that
everybody can afford out he's got to get
the reasonable rockets to totally change
the economics of space travel if he does
those things if he has some significant
impact on global warming then ok I think
you can start making the case Freelon on
that one well let me read some more
comments here's a Facebook comment from
a listener all right so I just finished
this book it's a good one gives a
balanced perspective I'd like to know
more about Elon but I'm sure pretty sure
I would not enjoy working for him
another listener writes I would never
buy a Tesla car on principle I've
watched a number of accolades field
videos about Elon Musk which seemed to
have been deliberately scattered around
the internet by a public relations firm
and that always describe him in the best
possible terms as if he were text
equivalent to Vladimir Putin these
videos are thinly veiled propaganda
disguised as journalism and meanwhile I
observe a definite trend in his
personality affecting his work and
personal life of throwing people under
the bus this is not a virtue he comes
off as a self-serve
user of people who lacks empathy which
speaks to a lack of character there is a
self same trend in the startup world
that surely musk has helped to bring
about don't know how to manage just fire
people don't know how to maintain a
relationship just dump the broad I'm
surprised musk kids aren't in an
orphanage already pretty harsh it's
pretty harsh this is elements of maybe
truth in there I don't think not about
he's pretty devoted to his kids he
always absolutely devoted to his kids
and then he doesn't just go around
firing people it's it's more that he
would demand a ton of you and then
you're either in the camp that is okay
with this sort of lifestyle or you're
not and the one thing that I found that
was really surprising because both
companies have a reputation for burning
through employees is that the top
executives at both Tesla and SpaceX the
the four or five six people who really
run the companies they've all been there
10 to 12 years and and share kind of
eelain's visions and and you know that's
what these people feel like they're
achieving something much bigger than
just running a company well as we might
have imagined we get all kinds of sides
heard from in terms of the character who
inspires much controversy here's Erica
writes I don't doubt that mr. musk has
real entrepreneurial skills but Tesla
unlike PayPal seems to be mostly a
creature of crony capitalism as it has
received various government subsidies
including a federal loan reduce property
taxes etc I don't have a problem with
the government funding basic research or
giving consumers an incentive to use
clean energy alternatives but I object
to the government trying to pick winners
in the industrial space especially when
a company like Tesla produces a product
that is targeting a very affluent
customer base well this is the big knock
on Tesla and it's a fair one right now
they make a car for rich people and the
the point is not that the point that
Elon would make is not that this is
where the company wants to end up this
is where they started just like any
technology begins the computer was very
expensive and then eventually you make
cheaper and cheaper models over time and
so the goal has always been to get to
this less expensive model and the other
the other thing that I would point out
not that I'm here to defend Ilana he can
do that himself but if you look at not
only what Tesla has built with the
electric car and
making that an interesting thing for all
car makers now to get into he's built
this charging network of charging
stations across the United States Europe
and Asia he's in essence built a car and
a fuelling network to go with it which
is what a lot of those who are
advocating hydrogen should be used
instead of fossil fuels were saying
there needs to be image Schwarzenegger
when he was governor I mean if you're
saying oh he he got a government loan to
go along with this I mean this is
unprecedented
what he he's doing government scale
things a lot of them a lot of listeners
are talking about this I know you didn't
like the S word subsidies word but there
let me just read one more email here and
then I want to get to caller who's right
on point rich says you have to admire a
guy who gets who can get enormous
taxpayer subsidies to build these cars
to start with and then get the taxpayers
to grant even more tax credits to
subsidize rich people and their
purchases on top of that he claims a
mission free on the back of each car
when sold in spite of the need to plug
the thing into a power source with the
emissions quite an operator this fellow
he's gifted a collar and mic join us
you're on the air hi I understood he had
a network of swap out batteries for
electric cars in Israel and you just
touched on it briefly but it seemed like
a great idea do you know how that's
working out he kind of go in swap out
your battery get a new one and be on
your way yes there was a company called
better place that was building that in
Israel and they raised I want to say on
the order of a billion dollars and then
basically have folded and if they
haven't filed for bankruptcy they're
near bankruptcy and Tesla is now the
only company that's kind of building
swap out stations so the possibility
here well Tesla's said that they want to
build these swap out stations when I've
talked to Elon though what he's telling
me now is that the range is getting so
high on the battery packs Tesla thinks
they're going to get to 500 miles of
range that the need for kind of an
instantaneous swap out at these charging
stations becomes almost a moot point at
that at that stage we had these power
pack batteries though that he says
you know the need for them is crazy oh
the ant control this is on the how the
houses - yeah right so Tesla now is this
very strange creature that's not only
making cars but it's making battery
storage for homes and offices and so if
you have solar panels you store the
excess energy in here so you can run at
night or during periods when you want to
pay less to the grid and after he
announced that they sold eight hundred
million dollars worth through 2016 let's
go to more calls Bill join us you're on
high if you would bear with me for a
second I'm going to describe the kids
experiment with little red wagons the ok
boy stands in the wagon holds baseballs
throws them to the rear and the wagon
goes forward this is the equivalent in
principle of the reaction engines that
have been used up until now including
nuts with reaction engine Sinise does a
remarkable job and improving efficiency
you can get to orbit you may be able to
get to the moon certainly with great
effort and time you can get to Mars
but you will not go to the end of the
solar system even to Jupiter with that
technology what is needed is new physics
and that is never discussed at least a
significant portion of the dollars spent
should be on physics get us to that
point of levitation devices and
anti-graft
propulsion whatever that looks like and
otherwise we're lost we well you know
how much doesn't want to get us to
Jupiter he just wants to get to Mars but
you're certainly right to bring up the
possibility of alternative physics just
like alternative geometry we should
maybe be looking more in that direction
than we have been traditionally and let
me thank you for the call I'm actually
looking at a speaking about cost in
different directions email from Robert
who says considering musk has a
humanitarian Drive does the author have
any idea of musk is considering
solutions to the water problem which
looked to be long-term and essential to
the health of the world I've never heard
him talk about that I would say
his plate has been pretty full
especially the last couple of years with
the pace at which his companies are
expanding and you know I I just haven't
had a I will do my best to to poke
around and I've never never talked about
that what about the accusation that he's
a man without empathy that he can
compare he can commiserate with humanity
in the abstract or you know feel for
civilization or something but on a
day-to-day level he may command respect
from people in everything but he can't
empathize this is what you frequently
hear means too self-centered or
narcissistic or - in his own world
there's certainly some truth to it I
think with his family his family he has
sort of a different relationship than he
does with many people they see a funny
charming emotional Elon
a very close group of friends see a
similar sort of character but we were
talking on the order of maybe four or
five people in that group and then it
was something I heard again and again
and again from employees they they see
him as not having empathy certainly for
how your day is going things that are
going on maybe in your family it's sort
of the mission of what needs to get done
is the most important thing I think he
does have this strange brand of empathy
which is empathy for mankind and he
feels that on a I mean he would break
into tears and I mean he feels this on a
deep deep level this sort of peril that
mankind is in and that's where I saw
okay this is not an emotionless figure
this guy just has emotion for the exact
species very another color on Scott
joins us from Palo Alto Scott you're on
welcome good morning I just this is a
little bit of a nebulous comment but I
wanted to know from your guest what do
you think mr. musk shares in common not
you know we like to compare and contrast
people in society and one of the other
things we do is we tend to either hate
or love them and we can only look at
their lightness or their darkness and we
we need to realize that you know if it's
JFK or if it's Steve Jobs or if it's
Elon Musk with all the great things that
come with each strong leaders and
creatives we always there's almost
always a dark side and it always piques
its head out so but for some reason we
just can't accept that that paradox but
I want to
to suggest is that his leadership is
probably not unique I think he just get
has courage when a JFK just said we're
gonna go to the moon basically because
we can he showed the leadership in the
will and then everybody kind of
aggregates around around that mission so
I think that's probably where his lack
of empathy comes is that you've got to
sacrifice some things I want to reach
that mission but I was wondering if your
guest could share some things that he
has in common with some of those other
great leaders that we've seen throughout
the last several decades Thanks thank
you Scott for the call actually we I'm
interested you have to say obviously
actually when will comes to mind just
from Scott scholars and some of these
people who are so driven feel they're
gonna work 20 hours a day and they're
gonna work as Ellis Lee so they're
employees and people who work with them
want to have the same standards the same
ethos I think he makes great points and
you do as well the Elon in a lot of ways
sets the bar exactly like you said
extremely high for himself and then if
he's calculating kind of how things
should get done on some level it's kind
of like if everyone was me
how fast and how efficiently would this
get done and then that's kind of what I
expect from people in Elon works seven
days a week and many many hours a day I
think he is different you know I
interview all these CEOs to me he sets
the bar higher and he asks he does ask
more of people and he may also ask more
of himself
absolutely the this this is that he's
running two companies at the same time
even Steve Jobs when he was doing Pixar
on the side it was nothing like what
Elon zuri I mean he is he he certainly
has people at both companies who do the
day-to-day operations but Elon knows
everything that's going on he's he would
come to our meetings with these huge
bags under his eyes I mean he this is
not a man who sleeps very much at all
come on he lost an infant son he should
commiserate with employees who have
children and all those kinds of things
at least in the best of all possible
worlds or ideally when you know sorrow
you should be able to empathize more
with those who have well formable kind
of barriers or obstacles or or sorrow
here's a facebook remark though from
Chuck who says responding to the caller
who asked why the Elon Musk's of the
world don't focus on for example
curing cancer think about the
contribution Steve Jobs made toward
technology and communications these
technologies have had an incalculable
effect on advancing the field of medical
research arguably contributing more to
curing cancer than anyone else and Shawn
writes on our website I think it's a
good thing that we're going to SpaceX
and private companies to send people to
the ISS the initial space International
Space Station this frees up NASA to go
to Mars I think that musk means well but
I don't think private companies can yet
get to Mars not before the government no
way that he's the SpaceX will get to
Mars before NASA does I'm pretty sure
well the book again is Elon Musk Tesla
SpaceX and the quest for a fantastic
future the author Ashley Vance
