introduction and for the opportunity to
speak to you all this evening and for
the opportunity to be at the Oxford
Martin School and to have an Oxford
Martin School in existence to be at
great thanks
so this afternoon I would like to
outline to the prospects for a turning
point in the development of
nanotechnology the early days of the
concept the focus was on a long term
objective flexible programmable
atomically precise fabrication of
intricate objects including components
for machines that could do a better job
of assembly of intricate atomically
precise structures during that time we
have seen this little maturation of the
development of ways of making molecular
structures that are adequate to get us
to the first rung of the ladder and in
the last few years is that if
technologies has reached a threshold
that will enable us to take a crucial
step and I would like to describe that
step to you today as presentations topic
was first introduced last August and has
been developing some momentum as a
research goal since then so the large
transition ahead is from molecular
self-assembly to molecular active
manufacturing and I'll be talking
hitting several topics here one is where
macroscale fabrication is today the way
we make things in the macroscopic world
by systemic engineering atomically
precise fabrication today which is very
different very contrasting then how to
build on that to develop a first
generation of atomically precise
molecular additive manufacturing systems
than just a few words about early
applications which I will turn over to
Sonia very promptly because she is the
one who is working in the area where the
greatest applications are likely to
emerge the first macroscale fabrication
if you look around you you'll see many
artifacts
see people and we're not artifacts but
virtually everything else you see was
made by machines or with the aid of
machines and those machines were made by
machines or with the aid of machines and
tracing back the genealogy of machines
you'll find earlier and and less
automated and simpler machines if you go
back far enough down the family tree of
industrial technologies you'll find
someone doing this kind of work
shaping materials in a direct way to
make components and tools that could
make better tools more mechanized more
precise that we used to make better and
more complex tools to make better and
more complex products and ultimately a
very intricate technology base making
complex objects has required complex
machinery now we'd like to be able to
make complex objects in the molecular
world to start climbing a ladder of
technologies like the one from
blacksmiths forward but it'd be very
nice to not have to build very complex
systems to make complex objects and in
fact in recent macroscale industrial
progress we've we've seen a way of doing
that you have relatively simple machines
do X Y Z motion of something with
respect to a platform on which one is
building something and to something that
has moved takes some action that results
in a little bit of material being added
sometimes it's using laser to Center a
bit of powdered metal other times it's a
nozzle that's putting down little bits
of melted plastic the most common form
of 3d printer or additive manufacturing
system and the reason this is so
attractive is that rather than having
lathes which cut cylindrically symmetric
objects or various other other
mechanisms for casting with special
tools and and so on where many different
machines are needed to make different
shapes instead additive manufacturing by
adding small amounts of material at a
time with XYZ control bit of material
here a bit more there can make a
tremendous range of shapes including
today aerospace quality materials
that are used this is a component that
Airbus is putting in aircraft that may
fly in and was made by a 3d
manufacturing technology and additive
manufacturing technology well the
essence of such systems again is some
structural framework you know the moving
in XYZ requires a structure to hold
parts together hold a tool with respect
to work piece and stepper motors to
increment on accent increment on winding
for motto NZ to put the the tool where
it needs to be to add the next bit of
material so we have structural framework
stepper motors and then some way of
getting in the typical case materials to
the location and then placing those bits
of material not all 3d printers work
that way and what I will describe and
the molecular world avoids that that bit
of complexity no topically precise
fabrication today back up and ask how do
we make complex things from from
molecules today well the complex
structures that are readily accessible
today using chemistry but also biology
because they're their biomolecules first
and foremost one is DNA which forms
rod-like objects these these guys the
helix the double helixes can be thought
of as a funny kind of twisted rod that
can be used as a structural member the
other class of biopolymers that we can
use to make structural objects and
functional objects or proteins my first
paper in this area and the Proceedings
of the US National Academy of Sciences
was on the prospect of protein
engineering people thought it would be
impossible because it was too complex to
predict how a chain of amino acids would
fold into a 3-dimensional object I've
pointed out that they were trying to
predict how natural proteins will would
fold it's a very different task to
design one that would fold the way you
planned and said aha and that's the root
of the citation tree in this area where
people have gone off and done brilliant
work that is now coming to fruition and
the direction that I had been looking
for as a way of implementing the kind of
system that I'm finally in a position
diplomat after all these years so it's
rather an exciting time
the nice thing about proteins is that
they're highly functional materials they
can be as solid as as would they have
shapes that can be tailored in great
detail they can serve as components for
motors and they can serve as components
for for enzymes that serve as enzymes
that transform other molecules and so on
so DNA is simple soft proteins are a
very good engineering material the great
advantage of DNA is in fact that it's
simple there is a field of technology
known as structural DNA nanotechnology
which can now make hundred nanometers
scale objects on a scale of in terms of
material content millions of atoms and
if you follow design rules making a new
object is about as about as much of a
research project as carpentry there are
ways of holding the Gila C's together in
a systematic way that all is based on
watson-crick base pairing and so these
objects can be designed and made in a
matter of days
proteins have recently reached a
threshold where engineering self
assembling protein objects as of 2014
this report reached through the point of
being able to systematically design
complex objects here we have extended
arrays flat sheets think of those as as
plates that could be used for structural
purposes worked on in 2015 and the way
this works is that you have to
synthesize molecular chains using
chemistry or biology first designing
molecules that will self assemble in
solution they have to have complementary
surfaces DNA that's very simple
watson-crick base pairing proteins it's
a matter of designing pieces that will
fold in a predictable way to make what
amount to 3d puzzle pieces that will
then fit together with other pieces to
make a larger object that's difficult
requires computational search that's
been a long long process to get to the
threshold that was indicated by the
previous two slides
this is very different from macroscale
fabrication you don't put the pieces
where you want them to be you do a very
complex process that enables
self-assembly starting with with
one-dimensional chains so we'd like to
be able to do is additive manufacturing
we put the pieces where you want them to
be and see that would be a fundamentally
different way of manufacturing
atomically precise structures on the
nano scale enable faster more systematic
design wider range of materials be a
technology platform for a fundamentally
new way of making intricate nano scale
objects with atomic precision that is a
very large prospect and now finally
there is a clear picture of how to get
there 3d printers require structural
frameworks and steppers it's still
necessary as for the tip functionality
want to simplify systems now you can
substitute bulk fluid flow and diffusion
to transport materials and instead of
putting pieces where you want them to be
you can take a workpiece and activate a
location so that the building blocks
that are washed and bind there so
three-dimensional designation of where
the blocks go rather than moving the
block much simpler than what people had
thought just a few years ago unlike your
chains are made to do about my chemistry
start with a block attached to a surface
activate a site chemically wash in a
block that reacts there and then
continue by activating at the end
repeating and building a chain and those
are the kinds of chains that will then
fold up to make objects if you're very
clever design such things so the concept
of 3d additive manufacturing with
molecular building blocks is to have a
tool not a chemical on a solution that
washes through wood activates the end of
a chain but a tool that can move around
on a structure and activate a particular
location moving to a particular place
activating the site moving along two
additional ones where you'd like to have
the same next kind of blocked Washington
blocks of that kind and then iterate
additional cycles the different
additional layers different kinds of
blocks on on each cycle to maintain
intricate three-dimensional object this
is a stack of bricks there's no reason
why the object has to be that that
simple in structure so what's required
for that are as they are the machine and
the the building blocks and the tip for
for activating locations if you have
that you can avoid folding chains to
make puzzle pieces have greater design
freedom wider range of parts structures
and functions fast designing fabrication
for product development put the pieces
where you want them to be and a key
point here is that if the structure as
I'll be describing is based on
self-assembly of DNA and proteins for
example in some some auxiliary molecules
made by organic synthesis you don't talk
about how many devices you're making you
talk about how much material is being
self-assemble to make those devices and
in chemistry a milligram is considered
to be respectable but small amount of
material and a gram is considered to be
modest but a very substantial amount of
material machines of this sort would be
on a scale of a hundred nanometers or so
and a milligram of material being
macromolecules assembling to make those
machines provides ten to the twelfth at
a shot one gram 10 to the fifteenth so
rather than having some large machine
that's trying to do precise manipulation
on a surface and spent the pictures of
having a substantial volume fluid
flowing through carrying materials ten
to the twelfth to 10 to the fifteenth
machines working in parallel to to make
things to determine how those building
blocks are arranged that's scalable
quantities and eventually by building
arrays of machines there's a pathway to
scalable product size initial products
would be on the scale of the machines
however which is in 100 nanometers or so
so key components need building blocks
platforms to build on activation tools
those are questions of chemistry there
are many ways of solving those problems
none of them are obvious chemists do
he was very clever in indirect methods
to make structures what's needed here is
clearly within the envelope of what
chemists have done but one we're going
to need a bunch of chemists to actually
figure out what blocks they can
synthesize that meet other system
constraints what the functional groups
are that are activated by what kind of
catalytic mechanism and so on the part
that has been the sticking point the
hard part has been the machine and there
are the two parts again our structural
frameworks and steppers so we need a
system that can move in x y and z x and
y can be performed by strips of
self-assembled structure that are in a
framework something like this is the
axis by by moving the two u-shaped
pieces with respect to one another and
each one of one is carrying the X the X
slider and the other one the Y slider
and that provides the XYZ motion the
reason that this is a boxy configuration
is for a structural rigidity bio bio
polymers are relatively soft relatively
low modulus all else equal lower modulus
means larger thermal fluctuations
thermal fluctuations in a linear elastic
model give a a Gaussian probability
density distribution for the position of
the tip with and thermal fluctuations
are constrained by mechanical forces the
variance is inversely proportional to
the mechanical stiffness and if you have
soft materials you try to build a
structure that is as rigid as possible
with those materials and one that I just
outlined turns out to be a very very
attractive design in that respect and
then the next way of accommodating
thermal fluctuations is you have the
size of the blocks and the targets be
far enough that the probability of
hitting the wrong target is is very low
so numerically those constraints can be
met in a in a in a part of design space
that results in some very attractive
systems the other part which is more
interesting and a release of new ideas
here the structural mechanisms we were
waiting for the fabrication techniques
what's new is a way of making stepper
motors that seems very attractive
probably other ways of doing it but this
one
nice macroscopic world there what are
called three-phase motors stepper motors
in this case we're turning on one set of
windings produces a magnetic field that
produces a potential energy function
that aligns a moving part with respect
to that turning that off while turning
another went on shifts the location that
the moving part wants to sit you turn
that one off turn on another it keeps
shifting you do the you do the three in
reverse order moves the other direction
so each cycle moves a step because
molecular actuators are at a premium
there's a trick where you leave out one
of those steps that have it be kind of
an idle step and that gives three
distinct states which is enough to move
left and right in increments how to do
that well want to have three input
channels for control well a natural way
to do control is by flooding the volume
with light if you can have absorption at
three distinct wavelengths you have
three different addressing channels for
your actuators turns out there's some
dye molecules that absorb very nicely
with well separated Peaks
modest amount of overlap and by putting
in light at three different wavelengths
can activate different sets of molecules
that are activating different phases of
a stepper motor what does that
activation look like well there are
molecules of a family called azo
benzenes which when they absorb a photon
and they flip around a double bond from
a trans configuration on the left to us
this configuration on the right that's
enough to have changed the way they
affect their environment and if that
changes changes the potential by ke T
which is easy that's good enough now
there are two problems when I was first
thinking about this a few years ago one
is that the light these absorb light
only at very short wavelengths the
violet range
you couldn't channel multiple
wavelengths of energy in there because
you can only run the energy downhill the
longer wavelength absorption well in
2013 developed with some clever people
who are trying to get systems
we work in the body we're red light
travels more easily figured out how to
make molecules of this kind that's which
with red light the other problem was
that the reverse switching what took
minutes two hours that time has now been
reduced to the microsecond or nanosecond
range very recent developments 2013 2012
so we have the structures due to recent
advances in protein engineering and
structural DNA nanotechnology we now
have components that are suitable for
motors so those are the key components
the key challenge is coordinated
cross-disciplinary development almost
all of this work in fact actually each
of those technologies has been driven
primarily by an interest in biological
applications biomedical applications
researchers who are developing molecules
for introduction into biology do not
work together to build complex systems
built from those molecules requires a
systems engineering approach where
there's a top-level function we
decompose the function into into
component elements such as framework
versus a motor versus a control system
chemistry for building blocks those need
to be put together and last August there
was a meeting in Berkeley meeting on
integrated nano systems for atomically
precise manufacturing which is exactly
the direction that I've been pointing
for some time person who the this was
held by the advanced manufacturing
office of the US Department of Energy
the program manager is someone who I
first first propagandized when he was a
doctoral student at MIT back in the
1980s so another element that has come
together is an organization that has a
reputation for doing systems engineering
I guess it grew out of the Manhattan
Project in part and they also do
renewable energy and many more more
peaceful developments and they're now
very seriously looking at developing
this placid system there are however
moving at government speed the the
workshop was in August
apparently the final work
draft well they've assembled the
material for a comment by the workshop
participants I'm expecting to see it any
day now and sometime after that there
will be a report from the workshop I can
report that there is also some
preliminary interest around the Oxford
community and in addition we're instead
having a center of coordination for a
systems development effort in this area
in the in the Oxford mill you will see
where that goes very very preliminary
thinking there so early applications
well discussed a lot of them at the at
the workshop for do eight many of them
involving materials processing and
strong materials and filtration
membranes and electro catalytic
membranes for fuel cells energy related
applications but the most attractive
applications I think are in diagnostic
and therapeutic property products in
medicine our bodies are full of
atomically precise structures nanoscale
structures these structures interact
with one another which is how biology
basically works and to be able to make
structures of that kind more rapidly
with more design flexibility more
control and straightforward control of
three-dimensional structure can be very
important to give some sense of the
complexity of structures that people are
investigating today with more
conventional means of assembly here are
some some nanoparticles one class of
applications of nanoparticles with
tailored molecular components for nano
medicine but at this point I would like
to turn the presentation over to a
researcher in nano medicine who can tell
us what kinds of things are being built
today that we could perhaps by providing
better tools unable to move forward even
more rapidly thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
