pleasure to be here over the last decade
or so I've been really focused on the
potential implications of artificial
intelligence and robotics
I've been focused on the potential
implications of technologies like
robotics and artificial intelligence and
I've really come around to the view that
we could well be on the leading edge of
a major disruption and I think it's a
disruption that's going to completely
redefine the way businesses compete and
it's also gonna put a lot of stress on
both society and on the economy and the
central issue that I've really focused
on is the fact that robots and smart
algorithms and computers are
increasingly going to substitute for
human workers they're going to take over
more and more of the work that's now
being done in the economy and I think
that ultimately that could lead to some
real challenges for us now during the
course of my research I've had a chance
to talk to a lot of people that are
really on the leading edge of these
technologies in other words people that
are really innovating in robotics and AI
and what I found is that at least among
those technical people there is
something of an emerging consensus that
we really are headed toward a disruption
maybe even we're ready to enter an
entirely new era a time when perhaps
things are not gonna work according to
the same rules as they have in the past
but at the same time there's a lot of
skepticism out there about that whole
idea that this time is maybe really
different and I think it's probably fair
to say that economists generally tend to
be quite skeptical of it and that is
largely based on a historical record it
turns out that this concern this fear
the machines might displace a lot of
people and maybe lead to unemployment it
goes back at least 200 years to the
Luddite revolts in England and since
then it's come up again and again I'm
gonna guess that most of you have
probably never heard of the triple
revolution report but this was actually
a very prominent report it was put
together by a brilliant group of people
it actually included two Nobel laureates
and this report was presented to the
President of the United States and it
argued that the US was on the brink of
social and economic upheaval because
industrial automation was gonna put
millions and millions of people out of
work and his report said if the
government didn't do something right
away there was gonna be chaos
now that report was given to President
Lyndon Johnson in more
two of 1964 so that's now over fifty
years ago and of course that hasn't
really happened and that's kind of been
the story again and again is that people
have worried about this the alarm has
been raised but it's always turned out
to be a false alarm you know the economy
has adjusted new jobs have been created
people have found new things to do and
so it's very reasonable to be skeptical
but I do think that we are probably
finally at the point where the
technology is finally here and that some
of these fears are likely to be realized
so what I want to do is begin by telling
you why I think information technology
is really different what is what is so
different about it relative to the
technologies that have caused
disruptions in the past and I would
point to three fundamental things the
first thing is that of course we have
had this ongoing process of exponential
acceleration I think many of you have
heard of Moore's Law of course or this
idea that every two years or so
computers roughly double in power but
it's actually much more broad-based in
that it extends for example to
communications bandwidth it extends in
many cases the software where we've seen
an acceleration even more rapid than
Moore's Law would imply but the other
key thing to understand is that this
acceleration has now been going on for a
long time it's been going on for decades
if you measure from the late 1950s when
the first integrated circuits were
fabricated we've seen around 30
doublings in computing power since then
which is just an amazing number of time
to take any number and double it you can
kind of imagine that by thinking about
what would happen if you got into your
car and you started driving very slowly
at five miles per hour and then
gradually double your speed to ten to
twenty to forty if you do that just a
handful of times you'll need a faster
car and a racetrack if you could do that
30 times you'd be some kind of science
fiction spaceship you'll be traveling up
millions of miles per hour you'd be able
to get to another planet in just a few
minutes and that's really where we are
in terms of today's technology you know
relative to where we began and because
things are now moving at such a rapid
rate and because things are gonna
continue to accelerate from this point
we're gonna see things
over the next year's and decades that
really astonished us you know things
that in terms of technology we're
probably not quite prepared to see the
second crucial thing is that information
to you is that the machines are
beginning to think in a limited sense by
this I don't mean science fiction
artificial intelligence but rather that
machines are making decisions they're
solving problems and most importantly
they're learning in fact if there's one
technology that is really central to
this and has become the driving force
behind it it's machine learning which is
just becoming this incredibly
broad-based disrupt disruptive powerful
technology one of the best examples I've
seen of that recently was what google's
deepmind division did with its alphago
system this is the system that won at
the ancient game of go now if you know
anything about go there are two things
that to me really stand out one is that
as you're playing the game the game is
almost incomprehensible complex there
are more possible permutations for the
board to be and then there are atoms in
the universe so what that means is that
you're never going to be able to build a
computer to win at the game of go using
the same approach that was used with
chess which is just to throw brute force
computational power at the pro at the
problem and let the computer compute all
the possibilities the game of go is too
complex for that you can never build a
computer that could do that so it takes
a much more sophisticated human thinking
like approach the second thing that
really stands out to me is that if you
were to interview one of the
championship goal players in the world
these people very often can't even
really explain what's going through
their mind as they play the game they
say that very often it's just kind of an
intuitive feeling that they get that
they should make a particular move in
order to in order to win at the game and
so if you imagine you're a computer
programmer interviewing one of these
people trying to understand what they're
doing so that you could put that into
computer code you wouldn't even know
where to begin so given those those
facts about the game of
it would seem to me that playing this
game at a championship level ought to be
something that's safe for people it
should not be something that a computer
two can do it should not be something
that we can automate and yet Google has
already built a system that not only
taught itself to play this game but then
within short order it was able to beat
virtually any human being in the world
so what that says is that a lot of our
assumptions about which jobs are safe
for people and can't be automated can't
be taken over by technology a lot of
those assumptions are gonna turn out to
be wrong because this technology is
gonna turn out to be extraordinarily
powerful the third thing that's really
critical is that information technology
and increasingly artificial intelligence
is really becoming a general purpose
technology and what I mean by this is
just that it's gonna be everywhere it's
gonna invade the whole economy every
industry every business every employment
sector it's going to be everywhere a
number of people have compared
information technology to electricity
and it's true that information
technology and artificial intelligence
are becoming like a utility almost like
electricity you would never ask
what industries are most impacted by
electricity that seems almost like a
silly question I mean everything every
business every industry is dependent on
electricity and the same is gonna be
true of artificial intelligence so it's
gonna scale across everything it's going
to invade every industry and one of the
implications of that is that it's gonna
make everything less labor intensive
because it's gonna bring to bear this a
buck this ability to basically to think
to solve problems to make decisions and
to learn and that's likely to displace a
lot of jobs especially jobs by done done
by people that are doing things that are
more routine and repetitive and
predictable so it is does have the
potential to be very very disruptive one
point that's often made by people who
are perhaps a bit skeptical of all of
this is that of course many jobs will be
destroyed by technology those jobs will
disappear but of course there are also
gonna be entirely new things created
right there'll be jobs create
in the future today we can't even
imagine and that's definitely true in
fact you can already think of jobs that
exist today that not too long ago we
wouldn't be able to anticipate things
like website designers social media
marketers data scientists these are all
new kinds of work but what I'm showing
on this particular chart if you look at
the the bar chart on the right it shows
you that well these new kinds of work do
exist they really aren't a substantial
fraction of employment it turns out that
in the United States about 90% of our
workforce is engaged in occupations that
existed 100 years ago so you know it's
things like driving vehicles preparing
and serving food working in offices
doing routine things working in
factories and warehouses working in
healthcare these are all occupations
that someone in the year 1915 say would
have been quite familiar with so the
point here is that while new things are
going to be created there may not be
enough of those opportunities to absorb
all of the workers in traditional
occupations that are sure to be
disrupted in the coming years and
decades just to take one example think
about the impact of self-driving
vehicles you know cars and trucks just
that one single innovation could
potentially eliminate millions and
millions tens of millions of jobs and of
course it's not gonna be just
self-driving vehicles it's also going to
be fast-food robots and rope improve
robots and retail and factories and
warehouses and it's gonna be automation
in many many white-collar areas so there
are gonna be millions and millions of
jobs at risk there and the question is
well there will be new things that are
created will there be enough and
secondly is there gonna be a skill
mismatch problem in the sense that well
there may be new jobs created but will
the person that's driving the taxi are
working at the McDonald's will they
really have the skills and the
capability to move into one of those new
jobs or maybe those jobs will really
require high levels of education and
skill so again this I think points to a
potential challenge that we could face
over the next 10 to
years let me show you a couple of graphs
of economic data taken from the United
States primarily that I think
demonstrate that technology is already
having an impact on a job market now
what you see here is a comparison of
productivity and compensation or incomes
for average people in the United States
now productivity is a measure of
efficiency it's basically equal to what
we produce the value of what we produce
divided by the number of hours it takes
to produce it and what you see in this
graph is that right up until the
mid-1970s these two lines move together
perfectly they're perfectly correlated
and that's exactly the way things are
supposed to work the idea is that
technological progress increases
productivity
therefore workers can produce more they
become more efficient more effective and
therefore they should be paid more they
become more valuable and that's just
what happened right up until 1973 or so
but at that point you see these two
lines diverge they decouple and
compensation or incomes have basically
stagnated they're pretty much flat where
productivity has continued its increase
and you see this big gap opening up now
I think that one of the things that's
causing that to happen there are a
number of forces in play here but one of
the things that is most important I
think is that the nature of our
technology is shifting where once
machines were tools used by workers and
therefore made those workers more
valuable increasingly machines are
substituting for workers and instead of
making workers more valuable the
machines are displacing the workers that
may be working making them less valuable
and I think that this is one of the
reasons that you see this big gap
opening up and it's one of the reasons
that we've seen income stagnate in the
United States and you see also the same
kind of graph there for the United
Kingdom in the top left and you see
basically the same shape there I also
think that this graph probably to a
large extent explains some of the
political disruption that we've seen if
you want to understand why Donald Trump
is the President of the United States
this graph to some extent explains that
because a lot of people
a lot of voters in the industrial
Midwest are very unhappy because they
feel they've been left behind that
they're no longer participating in
progress and I think that this graph
shows quite vividly that's true they are
they are in fact being left behind so
this is a real problem that's already
created disruption for us here's another
graph showing what job creation looks
like in the United States you can see it
looks almost like a declining staircase
every decade just about has produced
fewer new jobs than the preceding decade
in percentage terms so I think that
again this is a sign that some kind of a
structural change is happening in the
economy and I think that it's happening
almost certainly as a result primarily
of technology so let me talk a bit about
some of the technologies that are
causing all of this to happen
and robots of course have been around
for a long time if you had gone into an
automotive factory in an advanced
country back in the 1980s you would have
already seen these big powerful
industrial robots so what all this
automation means that in developed
countries within manufacturing all of
the truly rote repetitive assembly line
jobs where you just stand there and do
the same kinds of thing again and again
those jobs have already disappeared and
the jobs that have been left for people
and manufacturing have primarily been
knows that are unpredictable often it's
jobs that rely on qualities like visual
perception and dexterity an example of
that might be loading and unloading
trucks in a factory that used to be a
job that could be done only by people
but that's rapidly changing and what you
see here is a picture of a robot built
by a company in Silicon Valley that is
specifically designed to move boxes and
you can see that in the picture here the
boxes are not stacked precisely some are
rotated a little bit there are gaps
between the boxes the boxes are
different shapes and sizes and colors up
until recently only a person would have
been able to figure out how to move
these boxes but this company has built a
robot and you can see it looks like a
robotic arm with a machine vision camera
on the end this is a robot that can now
move these boxes and eventually this
company expects the robot will move
about one box every second
now that compares to about one box every
six seconds for a productive worker a
human worker
so you can see how that's gonna be a big
disruption also this robot or work
continuously it's not gonna get tired
it's not gonna get injured and so as
this technology becomes more affordable
and available and reliable a lot of
companies are gonna come to rely on this
and that's gonna threaten a lot of jobs
now there's quite a conventional way of
thinking about this which says that if
you are working on a loading dog lifting
heavy boxes all day there that's not a
great job really you're likely to injure
yourself if you do that for decades many
people end up disabled they can't even
work at all
because this is such a difficult job so
in a sense if a robots gonna come along
and take away this job we shouldn't be
too upset about that that in a sense is
a good thing that's something that we
might celebrate and there is a solution
to that that when a person loses a job
like this we ought to send him back to
school
give him some more training maybe the
end up working in an office in a safer
more comfortable work environment that's
the way things have always kind of
worked in the past but what I want to
show you next is the reason that maybe
that's not a sustainable way of viewing
this and this is a graph that is focused
on white-collar automation in other
words computer algorithms that are doing
white-collar jobs and more skilled jobs
and what you see on the right is a bar
chart showing the number of employees in
the corporate finance department in the
largest US corporations and corporate
finances jobs like accounting accounts
payable and receivable financial
planning and so forth and if you look at
that chart you can see that about 40% of
those jobs have disappeared in the last
10 years or so and that's happening
largely as a result of smart software
which is taking on more and more of this
work and there are many other examples
we can give for example lawyers are
being impacted by smart algorithms that
can review documents and figure out if
they're relevant to a court case there
are also sophisticated systems that can
evaluate contracts journalism for
example is another example there are
systems that can tap into a stream of
data analyze that data
and then automatically generate a new
story and that's those stories are
published online or in newspapers and
you can read one of those articles and
it won't be immediately obvious to you
that it was written by a machine and not
a human journalist so this is becoming
very disruptive and I think that what it
leads to is a world where almost any
kind of knowledge work any call of
white-collar work that involves sitting
in front of a computer doing predictable
things generating the same report again
and again or doing the same kind of
analysis all of that is going to be
highly subject to automation and these
of course are skilled people in many
cases people that have gone to
university and so if this this idea that
we can just educate people more and more
no longer become sustainable then we
really need to think in a different way
because this is gonna be a real
challenge for us another very important
point that I want to make is that all of
this has an economic economic impact
obviously if many people in the future
are unemployed that's a big social
problem but it's also an economic
problem because the market economy
relies on people who can buy the
products and services being produced
businesses have got to have customers
with money if they don't have enough of
those customers then we run the risk of
getting into stagnation or even a kind
of a downward economic spiral where we
just don't have robust economic growth
so the point here is to as these trends
in accelerate this could get a bigger
and bigger problem not just for those
people that you know lose their jobs but
really for everyone for our whole
economy there's simply may not be enough
demand there to really have a vibrant
economic growth so that's an issue that
I think needs a lot more thought I've
talked a lot about the negative aspects
of this in other words the idea that
there's gonna be a big impact on jobs
and so forth I want to make sure that I
at least briefly mentioned the positive
side of this and that comes about
because there's gonna be enormous
progress as a result of all this
incredible increase in our ability to
compute and solve problems and leverage
technologies like artificial
intelligence people have noticed that in
the last half century or so there's been
quite limited progress in many areas
all of the real true disruptive advances
have really been concentrated in
communications and in computers as an
example consider the airline industry I
mean the airplane that you get on today
is really not too different from the one
you would have gotten on in the 1970s so
we haven't seen a lot of broad-based
technology progress but I think that's
going to change it's going to change
because of all this incredible power
that we're gonna begin to leverage in
all of these other areas and I want to
just mention briefly one example of that
in terms of a company that I'm actually
involved with and it's a company called
Genesis systems and it's focused on
atmospheric water generation in other
words extracting water directly from the
air and that's not actually a new idea
that's how I D humidifier works but this
company has utilizing powerful
information technology developed a
really revolutionary technology and we
think that we'll be able to deploy
within a year or so self powered units
that are able to extract water at
industrial scale in some of the most
arid regions of the world for example in
North Africa in the Middle East in
Australia maybe some areas of Italy here
where you have you know a real scarcity
of water and of course that's very
disruptive because there are many
regions and economies that are really
held back by a lack of access to water
and of course climate change is making
that situation dramatically worse so
this is just one example of how all of
this powerful information technology is
going to begin to play out in many many
areas of the economy in a very
disruptive way and it's gonna bring
enormous benefits to all of us and
therefore the last thing that we would
ever want to do is to try to stop this
progress you know we don't want anyone
to say let's not have this progress
because jobs will be threatened so
therefore we need to adapt to it and
that brings me to my final point which
is what what can we do about this and I
think that you know it's it's easy to
view this in a very utopian way you can
imagine a future where we might all have
to work less where maybe nobody has to
do a dangerous job or a really boring
job or a job that they hate people have
more time for leisure and for their
families and so forth
and I think that that's a great vision
that's something that we should strive
for but at the same time we have to be
realistic and we have to understand that
we're probably gonna run into a
significant income distribution problem
a lot of people are gonna be left behind
by this their livelihoods and their
incomes are going to be threatened and
we're gonna have to figure out a
solution to that in order to remain
socially stable and also to solve the
problem I mentioned earlier of the fact
that we really need people with money to
spend in order to drive that whole
economy in order to solve that problem I
think ultimately we're gonna have to
find a way to decouple jobs from incomes
you know we're gonna have to ultimately
find a way to make sure that everyone
has at least a minimal survivable income
whether they can find a traditional job
or not and I would argue that the best
easiest way to do that is gonna be some
kind of a universal basic income or
guaranteed minimum income and net is but
no doubt that remains a very tall order
politically it's a staggering political
challenge there are some small-scale
experiments happening throughout the
world with basic income I think that it
will still be some time before we're
ready to really scale that out and and
begin to really consider that as a kind
of a national solution but I also think
that that's almost inevitable that that
will have to happen as these trends
accelerate and as things become more and
more unequal we're gonna have to think
of unconventional ways to solve this
problem or we're really gonna run into
some huge difficulties I think so my
point in coming and talking to all of
you into groups like you and also in
writing about this is to get you
thinking about it I hope that you will
really think about this issue because I
think this is gonna be one of the
biggest challenges that we face in the
coming years and decades and I hope that
as you think about it talk to others
debate others that we're gonna engage in
this global conversation and from that
will emerge some solutions so that we
can really build a future and an economy
that works for everyone at every level
of our society thank you very much
thanks so much well thank you very much
let's connect with our video recorder
here you can see a map of things Martin
for the at oldest new jobs are being
created but you need incentives and so
this is the initial sketch of what we
heard so let me give you the number for
questions at 3 3 5 7 0 8 5 4 3 9 now we
also have Martin's account M for the
future question because I feel like I
need a drink I need a strong drink of
two you know the idea that you gave us
of about a future we heard a lot of
talks about the jobless recovery it's
been underway since 2009 2010 we had in
Italy a double recession and we've lost
1 million jobs during that recession we
are trying to get back to normal level
of unemployment we are still very far
and my first question is if we look at
what happened in the u.s. currently in
the US the unemployment rate is at
historic lows is this just about jig
jobs or is it happening something
different do you feel like that the
story correlation between economic
growth and job creation is over have we
entered a new era or we can rely on
what's happening in the US and we can
still trust that if we get to a decent
economic recovery we will get two new
jobs also here in Europe and Italy well
I would say that you know relying on
what's happening in the u.s. is maybe
problematic because what's happening in
the US isn't quite as good as what it
looks I mean we do have a very low
unemployment rate below 5% but one
reality is still a lot of people have
completely left the labor force they've
just given up and dropped out of the
workforce so our labor force
participation rate in other words the
number of people are either work
or looking for a job he's actually
declined quite dramatically so you know
to some extent that low unemployment
rate is you know less optimistic than it
looks the other point is that what we
have been creating jobs that have gotten
to that low unemployment rate there's
definitely been a decline in the quality
of the jobs what one thing we're freeing
very strongly is what's called
polarization which basically means a
hollowing out of the job market and the
good solid middle-class jobs the kind of
jobs that you really want the ones that
you know provide a good income and and
vacation and-and-and and good benefits
those jobs are disappearing and instead
what you're seeing are lots of low wage
jobs in the service sector you know so
they're even in the u.s. there are
problems so yeah and we've also of
course noted the jobless recoveries
there as well I mean I have a graph in
my book that you can look at it shows
how jobless recoveries in the United
States are getting longer and longer
meaning it takes longer and longer for
the economy to get back to where it was
even as its producing jobs that are you
know less desirable so the question is
well well Europe finally recover I mean
it's hard to say I mean I think a lot of
what happened here is still hangover
from the financial crisis of course I
know that you have a very high level of
youth unemployment but the question is
can a normal process of recovery
overcome the other trend which is the
one I talked about you know as these
technologies are gonna get more and more
powerful so I think we'll have to see
about that but I would already be
cautious though looking at the United
States as an example of great optimism
in terms of the job market because there
are real challenges there as well your
views what are the jobs that my son's
for example should be prepared to if
they want to find a decent occupation in
the future well the best advice I can
give is that the last thing you want to
do is go to school and prepare yourself
for a job that's routine and repetitive
and predictable so you don't want to end
up any kind of job where you come to
work you do the same thing again and
again it doesn't matter whether that's a
blue-collar job in a factory or sitting
in front of a computer doing some kind
of
knowledge work so probably the skills
that are gonna be most important in the
future and most valuable are things like
creativity coming up with genuinely new
ideas or the ability to interact with
other people in a very sophisticated way
in terms of people that are gonna go to
university those are probably the two
areas that I would emphasize there's a
third area and that includes jobs that
really require lots of mobility and
dexterity and I'm printing unpredictable
environments and this would be skilled
trade jobs things like plumbers and
electricians which of course University
bound students are you know especially
excited for those jobs but those are the
other areas that that are probably
fairly safe from automation in fact this
is one of the first question that I got
from the audience which will be the
truly distinctive skills that won't be
reproduced by machines right I mean it's
creativity empathy the ability to work
with people engage with people but again
we're speaking of the near term I'm
thinking 1020 years I can tell you that
there is already research underway into
creative algorithms in my book I give
examples for example of algorithms that
have successfully written symphonies
original symphonies painted original
works of art and so forth so computer
algorithms are beginning to exhibit
creativity already and who knows what
that's gonna look like 20 years from now
so and the same is true in terms of
interpersonal relationships there are
already algorithms that can help with
counseling you know that provide people
assistance with with psychological
problems and so forth so you can never
say never I would say that for now focus
on creativity and working with people as
to particular areas that seem to be the
safest now in Italy but in Europe we are
trying to push forward the traditional
industry and manufacturing in general to
combine with digital to move into this
4.0 transformation at the same time
apparently
the companies that are more in trouble
and then layoffs more are the Wunder the
lugger in
of technological transformation so what
should we do what we are currently doing
with the national plan giving incentives
to companies that become more automated
more intelligent more smart or try to
prevent that and to remain the old world
right you know I would never argue for
trying to prevent progress and stay in
the old world because what's gonna
happen is you're gonna be out competed
by other countries right and then you're
gonna become irrelevant so I don't think
there's really a choice here I think
that from the business world you've got
to embrace these technologies you need
to obviously retrain or get people you
know repurpose the workforce so as many
people as possible can we remain
relevant working with these new
technologies but it seems highly likely
either that's gonna be fewer people so
probably it does mean that they're gonna
be fewer jobs is these these factories
and workplaces become more and more
automated and so our challenge is to you
know as I said is to find a way to adapt
to that so that we can continue to
leverage that progress and all the great
things it's gonna bring for us but at
the same time we need to take care of
those people that are gonna be left
behind or else we're gonna have do you
think that taxing robots make sense
because we are detoxing companies that
buys robots right I don't advocate
specifically taxing robots because first
of all it's hard to know what a robot is
very often as I suggested what we might
call a robot is just software it's gonna
be part of the enterprise software and a
big company how would you how would you
isolate that and figure out how to tax
it it's too difficult also that would
put you put your country at a
disadvantage right Dave to another
country that doesn't tax robots but I do
think we need to shift our taxation
scheme right now we very heavily tax
labor right we tax workers and labor and
that probably isn't sustainable because
they're gonna be fewer jobs and and
fewer income so probably we need to
shift to taxing capital more or business
profits more or more you know the
wealthiest people who are capturing more
and more of the income we have to tax
more DOS more but uh you know more of a
simple scheme rather than trying to tax
robots I would say last couple of
questions from the audience
first how do you see the role of public
government's in the future in managing
this transformation and second where do
you see the next Silicon Valley in terms
of where artificial intelligence is more
ahead in terms of innovation and is
there any place outside of the Silicon
Valley
in terms of the role of government I
think it's critical I mean you know the
last point I made in my presentation is
that I think we have to adapt to this
maybe with something like a basic income
and clearly I think that that calls for
a role from government I mean I think
that there is a space for government and
business to collaborate there and to
work together but a big part of that is
simply business understanding the
reality of this and supporting some of
the things that governments are gonna
have to do and not always for example
trying to avoid taxation you know trying
to either oppose it domestically or or
escape to another jurisdiction in order
to avoid it I mean if businesses are
going to continue to do that we're gonna
end up with kind of a race to the bottom
that's why I hope that in part because
of conversations like this that attitude
will ultimately shift and they'll come
to be an understanding that we need some
sort of a solution to this in terms of
the new Silicon Valley I mean you know
it looks like in terms of the companies
that are really going to control this
it's gonna be for the foreseeable future
the same ones that are on top now it's
gonna be Google and Facebook and Amazon
and those companies are becoming
incredibly powerful partly because they
have so much money and partly because
maybe more importantly because they
control so much data and access to that
enormous quantity of data is one of the
biggest inputs to this it's one of the
you know that the most important aspects
of building artificial intelligence so
in terms of other Silicon Valley's
emerging I mean the other best place to
look would be China I mean China has
certainly got its own ecosphere of
incredibly powerful companies that are
doing AI Baidu and $0.10 and so forth so
I you know but part part of the story
here is I don't think that it's critical
that everyone competes directly in
creating
artificial intelligence it's important
to note that well these companies are
going to become really powerful and
maybe we do need to regulate that or be
concerned about the power that they have
it's also true that this technology will
disseminate and that businesses of all
kinds and all sizes are going to have an
opportunity to leverage these
technologies within their business
models and I think that's going to be
the real challenge for you know
businesses of all sizes throughout the
world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
