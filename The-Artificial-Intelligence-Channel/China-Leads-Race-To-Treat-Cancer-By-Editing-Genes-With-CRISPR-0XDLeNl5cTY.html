known as CRISPR is revolutionizing
scientific research and stirring up a
whole lot of excitement about new ways
to treat diseases NPR health
correspondent Rob Stein recently
traveled to China where scientists are
racing ahead of the rest of the world in
using CRISPR to treat cancer to see how
Chinese doctors are using CRISPR I
traveled to the city of Guangzhou it's
about two hours southwest of Shanghai by
bullet train long to his famous for its
big beautiful lake where tourists take
boat rides and dance to music blaring
from speakers along the waterfront but
Guangzhou is also home to the Guangzhou
cancer hospital when I visited early one
morning the lobby was already packed
with patients family members doctors
nurses hi oh hi dr. Whirley dr. Wu shiso
runs the hangzhou cancer hospital and is
on the leading edge of using this new
gene editing technique to treat cancer
in people dr. wu takes me upstairs to
watch as he uses CRISPR to treat one of
his patients
CRISPR let's scientists make very
precise changes in DNA much more easily
than ever before when we get into a
patient's room dong-chil Rong is sitting
up in bed he's thin and looks frail dr.
Wu starts asking him questions as a
nurse takes his blood pressure
dunks 53 yes cancer of the oesophagus
stage for the worst I get a chance to
ask them a few questions through my
interpreter when did you first get sick
so you necessarily Endora it's over a
year now and he went through other
treatment first agent Antonio father you
went through radiotherapy and
chemotherapy pose and then it's not
really working so then doctor suggested
this type of treatment the treatment
involves dr. Wu sending some of dongs
blood to a biotech company about two
hours away there scientists extract key
immune system cells called t-cells and
used CRISPR to edit the genes in the
cells
that gene-editing unleashes the t-cells
so they can attack the cancer was a song
what I sang she Cheatham Oh God
he's very excited he feels like he's
very lucky just then a nurse rushes into
the room she's cradling a plastic pouch
it's filled with a yellowish fluid she
hangs the pouch from a hook on the
ceiling pulls out an IV tube to attach
the pouch and slides a long needle into
Dung's arm what does that they just
brought in what is that
this is a gzo the immune system cells
yes yes this is the actual experimental
therapy yes and now it's a beginning
dr. Wu's patient mr. dung stares at the
needle as millions of genetically
modified immune system cells slowly drip
into his body so yeah oh yes sure that
collection video and farewell
you can only hope it will get rid of the
cancer this is his second infusion dunk
says he started feeling better soon
after his first about a month ago he
first arrived he is on a wheelchair
right now he feels stronger he's gonna
walk freely dr. Wu says he's treated 21
patients with advanced cancer the
esophagus and that more than a third
have gotten better one patient is still
alive almost a year later usually
patients like this would die within
months so it's not curing them it's just
keeping them from getting worse just
keeping them alive yes yeah but that's
it that's a big deal I guess for these
patients yes they have no choice
even they have not to receive this
treatment they will die most of them
were dying 3 to 6 months 3 to 6 months
yes
and so far what says the only side
effects have been minor maybe an
occasional fever a rash 9 patients did
die who told me later
but Wow says that was from their cancer
not the treatment so using Jesus as a
man to be a cancer doctor C or C so many
death so it's great to use a new
treatment to save patients lives even if
it's just to prolong their lives a
little longer and this isn't the only
study doctors in China are doing to test
spurred gene editing for cancer China
has at least nine studies for lung
cancer bladder cancer prostate cancer
and more in the United States only one
has been approved and that's just now
about to get going
why why is China so far ahead
I asked Poole about that just what's a
Tumwater chinese patients wants to be
cured very much there's a Chinese saying
eleven dog is a better than the dead
lion so patients are willing to try new
cures that's why the Ethics Committee
and the lab are very positive about this
who says it only took a few months for
that one ethics committee at his
hospital to sign off on testing CRISPR
on patients but that makes some worry
that some Chinese doctors may be rushing
ahead too quickly so China's our wild
west that's dr. Carl June a University
of Pennsylvania scientist involved in
the u.s. study his study went through
two federal agencies and painstaking
review by two more committees at his
hospital before getting the go-ahead you
know China is they've made it a very
high priority
they made a you know a national priority
to develop this there's some very
high-quality research and time and there
are some others that are not high
quality Jun doesn't think the US should
relax it safeguards to protect patients
but he worries the u.s. is falling
behind like it did at the beginning of
the space race was kind of like Sputnik
2.0 Sputnik was the Soviet satellite
that shocked the u.s. when it became the
first man-made object to orbit the earth
crisper technologies have created a
Sputnik moment where vast new
improvements can occur if we focus on
them and make it a priority
I want it to be done safely but I want
it to be a high priority and he'd like
to see a level playing field where
researchers around the world follow the
same rules for his part dr. Wu says his
team explained all the possible risks to
the patient's very carefully and he's
already started treating patients with
another kind of cancer cancer of the
pancreas just a beginning we just see
the benefits already for patients we
should improve there are more benefits
for the patient we want to improve it to
get even more benefits
yes but if you do not know try it you
never know you don't try you'll never
know yes it's in my opinion his patient
agrees he says figure why I'm a banker
see man
my second question he's not worried at
all he believes in science Rob Stein PR
