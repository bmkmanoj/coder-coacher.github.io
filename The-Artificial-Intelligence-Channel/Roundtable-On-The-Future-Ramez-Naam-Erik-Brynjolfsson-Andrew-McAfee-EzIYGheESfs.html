know me and it's a honor and a pleasure
to be here with my friends Andrew McAfee
and Harriet Queenie Olsen and I we're
just talking backstage it was three and
a half years ago we met on this stage we
met yeah French chats was initiated here
at Town Hall in Seattle it's it's
fantastic give me like I'm serious about
that yeah yeah and it was because we
were talking about your previous book
the second Machine Age so what's
happened in the three and a half years
since the second Machine Age business is
you well I mean the main thing that
happened and it's a little bit
embarrassing is that tech progress
continues to surprise the two of us even
after we wrote a book about surprisingly
fast tech progress just just weird
things keep happening and Eric and I
kind of look at each other at one point
and said hey this continues to be
extremely interesting we continue to be
extremely fascinated by this and there's
just more and more story to tell so we
went back out and talked to our favorite
alpha geeks and wrote another book and
the other half of it yeah Tech is
happening faster especially in areas of
machine learning but also they rise
these platforms and the core and clouds
a new thing we'd really talked about
before in the other book but the other
thing that is the disappointing half of
it is that our organizations our
institutions are not keeping up if
anything that's which are not even worse
than we would have been two standard
three and a half years ago so this is
this mismatch and we were hoping to try
to do something not to slow down the
technology but to speed up our
adaptation to it right so second Machine
Age is really a book about the impact on
society of these changes and this is a
book about how organizations can try to
keep up with what's happening is that
fair yeah that's a nice way to exactly
so you have these three words in the
title machine platform crowd why don't
we take it from the bottom like can you
walk through a crowd platform machine
what these all mean why you're talking
about the nitro yeah I said Andy was
joshing me that I didn't want any prep
we're just gonna get up here on stage so
I said I try to throw them some some
harder ones
if we weren't expecting a crazy
curveball like that but we're very used
to going machine platform crowd we're
deer-in-headlights with this you the way
we framing the book is in terms of three
three balancing zarif pretty deep
rethinking x' that need to happen within
organizations and with crowd we
counterpose the crowd which is literally
these hundreds of billions of random
weirdos out there on the internet with
the core with organization with what
organizations think they're really
really good at and we kept on coming
across these crazy examples of what
organizations thought they were really
really good at the instant you give them
an honest head-to-head comparison or
competition between what their core can
come up with versus what the crowd can
come up with the crowd eats their lunch
the crowd just what mops the floor with
what the best people of the core can
come up with and so we found all these
fascinating examples of that and it's
worth diving into and figuring out how
and why is the crowd so powerful can you
give us an example
what's a scenario where the the crowd
did better than the core of a company
well here's a good one that just got
launched today if you are just reading
as I was coming over here just before is
coming over here there's organization
called Kaggle anybody familiar with
Kaggle so this is a group an
organization that's brought together 1
million data scientists and the US
government has just asked them to run a
contest to figure out better ways to
speed up airport screening to identify
things more efficiently and speed the
process they have a 1 and a half million
dollar anyone here think of a more
important thing and and the reason that
they went to Kaggle is that as Andy was
saying you know there's some pretty
smart people working to Homeland
Security's people who they could hire
from you know from Harvard or MIT or UW
or wherever but instead of just picking
a few core people to work on this they
want to tap into that a million-plus
data scientist and as Andy was saying
when they do that they get answers just
out of left field one of the reasons the
crowd works so well it's not just that
there's a bunch of people but more
importantly that there's a lot of
diversity of people any organization no
matter how good it is
most of the
smart people work outside of that
organization furthermore in the
organization people tend to get
groupthink they sort of start thinking
the same ways they hire people similar
to them but what makes these contests
successful is that there's some very new
approaches techniques algorithms that
people are doing it in Ireland or
Bangalore or Norway or wherever that the
people in the Corps hadn't been familiar
with and those can sometimes make a 10
or 20 or 50 percent improvement in the
performance and sometimes even a few
hundred percent improvement one of the
weirdest examples we came across that
made it into the book you know who our
buddy Karim Lakhani is at Harvard
Business School he's one of our
colleagues does great research about how
to tap in with a crowd he's a Harvard
MIT but we claim him because he got his
PhD yeah so he's he got brought up
proper is what I'm trying to say so
Kareem worked with the National
Institutes of Health to try to see if
they could improve over the baseline NIH
h algorithm for sequencing human white
blood cells which have really weird
genome so you got to do some clever work
on it the baseline algorithm from the
NIH could do this work in about four
hours with about 70% accuracy is that
good is that bad
national and sponsor yeah okay that's
the National Institutes of Health you'd
think that's kind of a good baseline to
work from there is a researcher at
Harvard Medical School also kind of the
core of the medical establishment who
got it down from four hours to one hour
and got it up to about seventy five
percent accuracy okay
that's better then Kareem worked with
top coder in this case another
crowd-sourced tough problem site and
through this problem open to all the
random weirdos out there on the Internet
and the best solutions that came from
the random weirdos of the Internet did
the work in ten seconds
and did it at about eighty percent
accuracy which they thought was close to
the theoretical maximum here when they
went and interviewed the people who
submitted those solutions there was not
one person with life sciences experience
among them most of them were students
they were all from fields very very far
away so the fancy word for the secret
sauce here is marginality
if what if your expertise is marginal or
kind of far away from the what the
apparent
domain of the problem chances of solving
actually go up you know Eric Raymond's
law with them with enough eyeballs all
bugs are shallow it's a lot of eyeballs
out there amazing four hours to 10
seconds so cream wrote this paper up in
Eric and I read it and I called him up
immediately I said he's a friend of mine
so I said dude is this the craziest
thing you've ever seen and he sits about
average I said come on he said if I run
a competition a fair crowd competition
and I don't see this magnitude of
improvement from the crowd I think I've
done my work incorrectly so so what's
what's tops more and more companies I'm
actually taking advantage of this
ability to tap into the crowd I'm only
half joking I mean the technology is
there this is a cultural change this is
a mindset change it was something that
you just couldn't do you you physically
couldn't do this a decade or two ago we
now for the first time have the majority
of the world's population the majority
of the world's brains connected in a
global Internet and able to share
information like this more or less
instantaneously that hasn't always been
true in history that's never been true
before and not only can they tap into
that data more importantly they can add
to that data so people are just now
discovering new clever ways to tap into
the crowd these contests are only one
way Wikipedia is another way you know
you have a great story about nupedia
wiki how it changed yeah well that's a
good example that you know so that
nupedia was kind of up the despite the
name kind of the old thinking of how you
make an encyclopedia
you have some experts and you go through
this seven step process where you vet it
blah blah blah
they got a bunch Jimmy Wales the guy who
did start Wikipedia first started
nupedia they got a few hundred thousand
dollars with a funding they worked on it
for a year the end of the year I think
it had what twelve articles done
something like that 1,000% true story
how many of you have heard of nupedia
this was the direct predecessor founded
by the exact same people as Wikipedia
they wanted to make sure only experts
could edit art
cuz they had a seven step process that
everyone had to go through and the world
said yeah no thank you but then they
should've is this little skunkworks
thing some people said you know this is
new you know type of software wiki's you
could just kind of throw stuff up real
quickly while ways the people just kind
of play around with that and so they let
people anybody could just sort of play
around with it and you know the rest of
the story people started writing
articles like crazy soon they'd have a
thousand articles soon they had ten
thousand articles and then Jimmy Wales
company said wait a minute what are we
doing with this nupedia thing we got to
do the wiki pedia
option and and now it's become you know
the resource so that's another way that
you're able to tap into a crowd but it's
a mess it's a mindset change understand
that you can tap into this and one of
the things we want to see more and more
is people being creative about other
ways to tap into the crowd you know
Google the power of Google when you
think about it is really tapping into
the crowd yeah they've got some super
smart engineers in Mountain View and
elsewhere but how do they rank the pages
if they're something called PageRank and
it's based on the link structure and
where those links come from everybody in
the crowd decides what pages to link to
and when you link to a page when you
write some a web page you like to others
you are voting and so basically what
Google is doing is taking the collective
wisdom of the crowd all the votes that
different pages get and the ones with
more votes it up to the top of the
search rankings so they are leveraging
our collective thinking as your question
is one that Eric and I grappled with a
lot in the book why is it so hard for
successful incumbent established
well-managed companies to see these
possibilities and and like Eric says the
idea of of crowdsourcing your toughest
problems went from actually
inconceivable Isis extraordinarily hard
to do 20 years ago to kind of
cognitively inconceivable even though
that even though the technology
environment changes really quickly so
the mantra that I've adopted as we wrote
this book was that tech progress
rewrites the business playbook and a lot
of even really good companies get stuck
in the old version of the PlayBook so we
talked about collective intelligence and
these are awesome examples where we've
seen some failures recently right we've
seen harrassment and hate on Twitter we
can fake news on Facebook yeah maybe the
filter bubble collective intelligence
seeming to go to
rat holes like what does does that make
you rethink your thesis at all but well
I think this is a powerful tool and any
powerful tool can be used for good or
evil
and yeah let's compare you know Facebook
Twitter Wikipedia they all harness the
crowd in different ways they have
slightly different structures and
Wikipedia even the first time they
didn't get the the finetuner quite right
Wikipedia tends to have a lot less fake
news and actually we were talking to
Jimmy Wales about this and and he you
know he thinks I'm convinced that a lot
of it has to do with the fine structure
of how you set it up and that the way
Facebook was set up it's it's very prone
to these filter bubbles you share stuff
with your friends and your friends
aren't inclined to fact check it at
Wikipedia there are these editors you
don't know who they are and they take it
upon themselves to fact-check it they're
not your buddies they're not there to
like say rah rah more that you know go
Obama go Trump whatever they have a very
different perspective and by depending
on how you setup you get different
outcomes one of the things that were
we're collectively doing is
experimenting with different ways of
structuring it and sometimes we mess up
and you know you talked to Mark
Zuckerberg and I think he'd be among the
first to say they messed up big time in
2016 at first they thought eh we we
thought our responsibility I they say
we're just we were like selling a pencil
and if someone writes bad words with a
pencil that's not our responsibility and
they were they were sticking to that
line for a while and now they've backed
off okay you know what no that's not
right at all that's not the right model
one thing that I think we've learned in
2016 and 2017 is that free speech is a
bummer right because we at we are
actually giving you there's your great
quote from the journalist Dave a Jay
Liebling he said freedom of the press is
limited to those who own one okay hey
everybody we got a printing press now
and sort of the Nazis and the racists
and the anti-semites and the trollers
and the haters and that that echo
chamber can make these environments
filthy filthy places so I have not
walked away from my devotion to free
speech but I'm gonna segue and talk
about another chunk of our book now um
we kind of think that a part of a big
part of the solution to this weakness of
the crowd is are actually machines and
and what I mean by that are machine
learning algorithm
that can recognize you know vitriolic
speech terrorist speech stuff like that
do that very sophisticated
pattern-matching and yank it down in
addition to these architectural changes
that Eric talked about so that that you
you you you can reconfigure things that
the echo chamber doesn't it doesn't echo
quite as so that like the end of the day
I think more and more that the limiting
thing and one of these we stressed in
the book is figure out our institutions
and the organizational side of it is
where I think there's been a bigger and
bigger gap and it's great that the
technologists are working on the Machine
algorithms and the ways to tap into the
crowd but the the biggest bottleneck and
the biggest gap is figuring out how to
use them more effectively the economic
principles underlying organizational
principles online and that's a big part
of why we wrote the book was to try to
lay out that this is not just random
chaos out there or the luck of the draw
there are some underlying principles
that can work this is this is actually
where I disagree with Eric a little bit
I'm a bigger fan of using the machines
instead of the institution's on this one
everything that you and I see on
Facebook and and a lot of these other
platforms has been teed up for us by a
machine machine learning algorithm great
tweak those two damp the stupidity and
the hatred and the echoing so you both
have hoped that this this filter bubble
can get better and you would use
machines to assess truthiness and you
would change the incentives of the
structure of Facebook to to to change we
do both we emphasize emphasis
differently and we don't we're not faith
I wouldn't quite use that word hope yeah
optimism I think that there's the
potential for it but it's very much
going to depend on our choices and it's
certainly not going to be automatic the
last thing I'd want to do is just sit
back to hey don't worry it's all gonna
work out that would be totally the wrong
attitude totally so since we talked
about Facebook let's let's dive into
what it is which is that's a platform so
you talk about a change from businesses
selling products to businesses creating
platforms that soak up a lot of that
value what is that what's happening folk
about create a lot of that value so you
know five of the five most valuable
companies in the world are basically
platform companies two of them here in
Seattle Microsoft and Amazon but also
Facebook Google alphabet
Appl and what they have in common is not
that they've just they create some great
products but more importantly that they
enable an ecosystem they create a
platform for other people to contribute
to that and you know so whether it's
Apple's apps that people are
contributing or in other ways and these
platforms scale as more and more people
participate them they have network
effects or even more subtly against the
book two-sided network effects you're
all familiar with the basic network
effect which is like the value of a
telephone goes up if other people in the
telephone no one else has a telephone is
not very valuable or a fax machine or
whatever so that's a network effect that
more people using the same product is
more valuable a two-sided network is a
little more subtle but it's when people
are using a other side of the network a
complement for instance uber is another
kind of a platform that took off very
quickly what they were able to do is
create one app for users and there's
actually a different app that the
drivers use and as a user I don't really
care of lots of other users are using it
I want more drivers to be on it and what
the drivers care about is not having
lots of drivers they want to have people
on the other side and the platform is
able to connect these two sides in
different ways Facebook is connecting
advertisers and their users and each of
these and Apple is actually a
multi-sided network where you've got the
different kinds of apps the users apples
on the iPhones and the more people that
participate in any one of those sides
the more valuable it is to the other
parts of it so this this concept of
these multi-sided networks is a
derivative part by the digitisation that
we referred to earlier these underlying
technologies it's also driven by some
some new economics that people really
didn't understand very well one of our
colleagues jean tirole got a nobel prize
a few years ago for really worth never
shuts up about it either it's really
annoying he's one of the nicest nicest
Leeloo guys in the world
despite being French oh wow we went
there
and and he's a very sweet guy and he
worked this out and there's a beautiful
elegant math some of our other
colleagues like Marshall Van Alstyne
helped to contribute to it and what we
try and do in the book is say look these
platforms aren't just accidents that
just pop up that if you understand the
economics you can see sometimes it makes
sense to give stuff away for free and
then you make money on the other side of
the network it's not always a good idea
to give stuff away for free you should
just do it willy-nilly but if you
understand the platform economics you
can see when it is a profitable strategy
and Eric just did a really nice job of
walking through those economics my
favorite part when we were writing the
section on platforms was highlighting
how no less an authority on all things
digital than Steve Jobs very nearly blew
this I love this story this is an actual
true story when Jobs introduced the
accelerator to stir a lot of decent
fraction of our stories are true stories
so the iPhone came out just about a
little more than 10 years ago January of
2007 and when it was introduced some of
us are probably old enough to remember
this all of the apps that were available
for the iPhone were developed by Apple
and that was not an accident that was an
adamant deliberate strategy by Steve
Jobs Jobs as a control freak and he
didn't want random crash he buggy virus
he kinds of things mucking up his
beautiful iPhone
he had colleagues on the board he had
executives inside the company who tried
to persuade him of some of the economics
that Eric just talked about said look
open this platform up and you're gonna
unleash a whole lot of energy and jobs
is like nope and it took about a year
and a half of convincing for him to do
it Apple finally opened up the iPhone
store that was called iTunes back then
open up iTunes to outside developers of
the iPhone in July of 2008 and just like
with Wikipedia they came back to
half-hour later and there are 6,000
articles they came back a day later and
there were 400 amazing apps available
for the iPhone and it's one of the few
times that I think Jobs ever came
anywhere near close to admitting that
he'd been anything less than faultless
about something you're saying Steve Jobs
did not want me to have Angry Birds
no not unless people came up with angry
but learned this is true it doesn't seem
like a very Apple product Angry Birds
yeah so when you look at these platforms
it seems that there's in most of them
because of the network effects there's a
winner-takes-all dynamic or winner
leaves for one or two or three winners
totally does that concern you as far as
monopolizing power or a lack of
innovation or stagnation the guideline
that I try to follow is that all great
concentrations of power demand vigilance
and we need to be mindful of them and
watch out for them and try to make sure
that that they're not abusing that power
doing things that don't that we don't
like right
to me that's different than saying that
all great concentrations of power need
to be broken up and here's a here's a
yet Flip analogy America is a great
concentration of power I am not about to
commit treason here on this stage I am
not advocating that we break up the
United States government so in the same
way I will worry a lot more about the
power that these platform companies have
these are really powerful companies and
we need to be vigilant I'll worry more
about them when I get clear evidence
that either innovation is being
squelched or that we consumers are being
harmed and Andy just hit down the two
key tests for a good antitrust I mean
when a competitor becomes very very
powerful its competitors get angry and
they say hey we've got to stop these
guys
we at Walmart are having trouble
competing with Amazon or whatever and
boo-hoo-hoo understandable that they
would say that and Marshall is much
anger in that direction but the
regulators and the rest of us we
shouldn't be worrying about the
competitors we should be worrying about
the consumers or about the innovation
and on both those fronts so far these
companies are pushing prices down even
to the point of free for a lot of them
and I don't see like a lack of
innovation in the app economy or the
social media it looks like it's still
still going pretty strong stronger than
in these other places now if that
changes yeah I'm totally with Andy
you know we need to keep be vigilant and
if the I guess when Amazon bought Whole
Foods they got about 4% of the grocery
market you know that gets to be you know
60 percent and they start raising prices
you know then then I would I would
change the story but the other thing
that gives me some you know confidence
and maybe willingness
sit back a little bit is another economy
I love quoting economist Joseph
Schumpeter so he was a great Austrian
economist and he came up with this
concept of creative destruction and the
way he described a capitalist successful
economy working was yes you get
monopolies but then another monopolies
overtakes it and another monopoly
overtakes it so you get companies that
become dominant for a while but if they
don't keep innovating someone else to
innovate or so there was once VisiCalc
and then Lotus and then Excel and you
know and each of them they got overtake
they had big you know seventy percent
market shares for a while and eventually
you know Windows just became more or
less irrelevant as as the iPhone and and
and other tools became more pertinent so
that's actually a lot more of happening
this tech economy is absolutely you get
these monopolies but they're as long as
they're temporary and they're yeah
subject to challenge so then it's less
of a concern and one of the classic
things in monopolist does that we need
to watch out for is price gouge kind of
hard for Google and Facebook to price
gouges when they give it away for free
that's a pretty low price that's
anything it doesn't hurt right it
doesn't feel like I'm being gouged yeah
so you talk you have some advice or some
analysis of what leads to a company
being successful in building a platform
so if you have if there's entrepreneurs
here who want to get into this new space
let's say that isn't monopolized already
what would you tell them to do to try to
establish themselves successfully again
there's a book but but but we what we
try to do in the middle section of the
book is is go through the the economics
that Eric just went through a second ago
in a bit more detail to talk about why
two sided or incited markets work why
you would drop prices for one side
versus the other which side you would
pick and kind kind of do all that at the
same time so I think the economics are
at the core of all these successful
platform companies that that we learned
about and that we think are really
really cool at the same time we found a
couple other things they seem to do
really well one of them is focused
obsessively on the user interface and
the user
Ariane's which is hard to do on a very
small amount of real estate you're
trying to cram in a lot of functionality
so all the platform companies that we
talk to work like crazy on getting that
stuff right in the a be test and they've
got really smart people on it and then
the other thing they do is they they
just draw in you know data geeks from
economics and operations research in
yield management and stuff like that and
they cram a whole lot of math and
algorithms and matching inside the
ecosystem that they build yeah and what
they do if they do it right they get a
virtuous cycle going Argos the termed of
art these days is flywheel going where
you you get a few more users and on one
side then you get more on the other side
and becomes a positive feedback loop but
getting that ignited getting that
started very difficult so if you could
find a way that can work with very small
numbers of users or just you know a lead
user then you can ignite that virtuous
cycle and if it gets going it can take
off very rapidly and it becomes like you
said often a winner-take-all market or
gonna take most market venture
capitalists love that because if you can
be out in front and they're willing to
invest to try to get you into that leave
but you also gotta be careful cuz the
same thing can unravel if you start
getting into a vicious cycle where it
goes the opposite way it can all come
undone pretty quickly too we got a great
example of exactly how to do this just
two days ago we had a book event in San
Francisco we invited some of our alpha
geeks to come talk with us us on stage
and one of them is Patrick Collison
co-founder of stripe stripe is a
payments company founded by these two
Irish kids and I mean I'm using the word
correctly Patrick and John Collison were
21 and 19 years old respectively when
they founded this company to take on the
established payments industry around
them take on the banking you know what
the heck were you thinking but but
they're really very very smart
thoughtful great entrepreneurs and and
Patrick said you know look we realized
that if we could build a payments
platform and more merchants would show
up and then more kinds of payment would
show up and then we'd have different
countries and we could get this virtual
virtuous cycle going but at the start it
had to do something for a customer that
we were interested even just one what
and he select the one thing we could do
for an on
merchants from the get-go was accept a
credit card just like help them process
those kinds of payments and that was
enough of a toehold and they did other
clever things and they got the virtuous
cycle going okay and maybe uber if
they're not lucky enough might be at the
start of a vicious cycle well that's
that there's a couple lessons there
obviously the culture has some serious
problems but you know the fact that they
had such powerful two-sided network
effects in this platform I think that
sustained them through a less than
optimal culture but it's not it's not
you know unstoppable you could easily
see it coming out and what we've seen in
the past a couple of months is that
their market share has started turning
downward and lift going up so you could
be you could be seeing something really
ugly if it gets to a certain point
you're running running a dysfunctional
kind of ugly corporate culture is a
terrible idea in this day and age and
all previous ones excellent if you've
got a strong plan let's go to machine I
saved this for last this is your
previous work was the second Machine Age
and I've talked about AI and machine
learning and amazing feats what's
happened just in that sector in the last
three and a half years what's gotten
better well well the biggest thing and
by the way we all of our books so for
this is a third book career and they all
have the word machine in it so we're
really are obsessing about theme and we
pay close attention and and the biggest
thing has just been the amazing progress
in machine learning you know we touched
on it in the last book but no certainly
us too but even the the geeks working
machine learning didn't expect it to
advance as rapidly as it has and we
sometimes call this the second wave of
the second Machine Age in that a lot of
the stuff in the the last book was about
how technology could we could teach
machines how to do things now machines
are learning on their own and they've
gotten to the point where they're
crossing some real significant
thresholds for instance vision systems
that learn on their own how to recognize
faces or cancer cells or other objects
are now getting the point where they are
not just as good but even better than
human vision at recognizing those same
things sound systems that are
voice recognition systems are beginning
to in recognize speech at that point
that the error rate on Google home went
from eight point five percent to four
point nine percent not in the past ten
years in the past ten months and that's
because of these deep neural net systems
it's a certain branch of machine
learning where you feed it lots of
examples and it learns and the people
working the field say that we're just in
early days this is gonna improve more
and more and this technique of a beat
neural Nets supervised learning they can
apply it to lots of other areas that
previous hadn't been applied to before
so we think that there are some huge
impacts that are happening on business
on the economy on the workforce as you
cross that threshold I mean think about
it if something goes from being a worse
than human the better than human then
that's not just a difference in degree
that's a difference in kind if you are
an entrepreneur or a manager you're
gonna pick you know whatever tool
whatever resource whatever person is
best for that job and if it goes from
being a human to a machine that's gonna
change you to calculus in lots and lots
of businesses or across American across
the world I find it hard to overstate
how big a deal this is we we are no
longer limited by our own knowledge we
can build machines that do better than
us that exceed our knowledge and that
sounds like some kind of trippy sci-fi
thing it's already happened a couple of
times a lot of us are probably aware
that the world's best player of the
Asian strategy game go is now a piece of
technology right we kind of knew that
that piece of technology is not just
playing go better than the best human
players it's playing differently than
the best human players it made moves in
some of these very high-level matches
that were inexplicable at the time
nobody commenting or watching the match
would know why the machine made that
move because it violated about 3,000
years of accumulated human knowledge
about how to play this game those moves
turned out to be the right ones how do
we know the machine won the game and the
the current Chinese champion of go
phenomenally talented player went on
their equivalent of Twitter a little
while back and he said after he had
played alphago
said I don't think a single human has
touched the edge of the truth of the
game of Go we played this game we
invented this game you played it for
3,000 years we got up to this level and
it kind of reminds me of the algorithm
like the of the NIH is how good is this
how much Headroom is on top of this and
alpha ghosts seems to be saying gang
this a lot of headroom on top of this
and so I think about these other you
incredibly complicated incredibly you
know rich domains where we'd like to be
smart
whether that's material science or
investing or genetics and we're not
we're not the only game in town we have
a colleague that can help us and I think
in a lot of domains our knowledge is
here and we're gonna see a lot of head
room opening up I'm really excited about
that so just rip off what you're saying
you're saying that that AI machine
learning could be the best scientist at
designing you material so it could be
the best doctor at diagnosing a disease
for medical imagery it could be the best
engineer for designing a new airplane
part I want to be clear yes that's what
I'm saying yeah in a lot of those so
there have been you know published
papers in nature our friend Sebastian
lund published one where a machine
learning algorithm did a better job
diagnosing cancer we were talking to our
friend carl bass used to be the CEO of
autodesk and he was showing these trippy
diet these trippy objects that had been
designed by machines there's a heat
exchanger and it looked really beautiful
kind of psychedelic it had some delicate
curves to it
he said no human would have designed it
unless they were really high I think is
what Carl but then it would have worked
right then right and then we're not a
completely exceeded anything that any of
the people had designed so these are not
like some day maybe we'll attorney this
these are physical objects that have
been created these are actual diagnoses
that have been done by machine learning
algorithm can I do one more thing
because I'm one question that we always
get when this question comes up is oh my
god Skynet right people just immediately
think about the Terminator or the matrix
or some kind of scary super intelligence
coming because of these developments and
when Eric and I go talk to the Alpha
geeks who are making these technologies
they are just dismissive of this
possibility and what they say is look
we're solving incredibly tough
engineering problems were throwing a
whole lot of math and a whole lot of
computation and a whole lot
data add things that's all we're doing
we don't know how the brain works we
don't know what consciousness is we're
not plumbing those mysteries we're
banging away on this really kind of
super important but constrained set of
problems over here I don't think they're
lying to us you would think that it's
that's true I'm gullible that way right
the hospital information system is not
going to suddenly become self-aware and
decide to take over no you know the line
that I use which I said for the first
time in 2013 and it still works is I
will start worrying about that when my
computer spontaneously decides to talk
to my printer awesome you you have a
section when you're talking about this
you're talking about it and going back
before this before the the computer not
Skynet not arriving from our toasters
good I have you to talk about the old
deal between machines and mine so you
talk about rebalancing machine to mind
crowd to core platform to product yeah
and you talk what the old balance being
the machines that all the rote work all
the just like the number crunching and
so on but humans exercise all the
judgment yeah is that changing it damn
well better right um we're gonna do a
quick experiment here and I mean and I
mean this seriously I work I'm gonna ask
you three questions and I want you give
yourself a number from 1 to 100
one being I'm absolutely absolutely
objective all at this 100 being on the
best that that there could possibly be
at this so here are three questions and
meant and just mentally give yourself
three numbers don't shout them out
compared to the folk around me I have
good judgment compared to the folk
around me I make good predictions
compared to the folk around me I am a
good judge of character
you have three numbers in your head
here's the last bit of the assignment
average them don't have to do two
decimal points of accuracy average them
everybody have a number raise your hand
if your number is above 50 rate waving a
wave in the air huh
yeah gang no more than half the hand
should be up in the air so we're just
super fond of our judgment and there's
way too much evidence our judgment is
awesome but it is biased and bug
in flawed and it's really easy to beat
our judgment with just a little bit of
objective evidence and a little bit of
math and so you're saying in in these
domains in some that are that we think
of as being not to that business but
judgment judgment in the legal sense for
instance that we'd be better off using
algorithms to decide who gets parole
yeah exactly there have been studies of
this and and there's a fascinating study
of Israeli judges and the main thing
that determined whether or not someone
got parole or not was not the facts of
the case it was whether or not that
judge had had a meal recently so if the
judge had low blood sugar you're very
unlikely to get parole but if you were
lucky enough to go just after breakfast
or just after lunch your odds went way
way up so these were patterns that
showed up repeatedly was it was peer
reviewed carefully study and this has
been found in lots of other situations
that we were just subject to all sorts
of biases in our decision-making and
there's a Nobel Prize an economist and
Amos Tversky got Nobel prizes for
pointing out these kinds not diversity
he was dead yeah yeah that's right these
biases in decision-making that happened
in there like blind spots we're all
familiar with the visual blind spots but
we have the same kind of blind spots in
our mental decision-making and so
there's room to use algorithms to make
better decisions and one of about other
things that sweeping addition to
artificial intelligence the sweeping the
country in the world is more data-driven
decision-making shifting from using
human judgment to more data-driven
decisions and so for instance the number
of companies that by our criteria have
become data-driven has increased by
about three fold over the past five
years it's become much more data-driven
and the companies that are data-driven
have about 5% better productivity than
the companies that aren't data-driven
the the the parole the dysfunctions of
the parole decision are so widely
accepted now that a lot of states have
actually gone toward algorithmic scoring
for parole this notion that I'm gonna
look into your eyes and know if you're
criminal or not give me a break there's
just way too much evidence it doesn't
work very well and and again part of the
reason that this didn't happen before
was we just didn't have the data or
didn't have the ability to techniques so
you know it used to be that for
thousands of years the way important
decisions were made organizations
companies kingdoms or whatever is people
would sit around talk that I'll give
their opinions and then when it was time
to make a decision they would go with
the hippo and the hippo anybody heard
that accurate luma before the acronym
we've used in some of our writing it's a
it's a it's an acronym for the highest
paid person's opinion so basically
that's what you ended up using as the
decision-maker material you went around
and then whoever had the highest pay
their opinion would rule but that's
because you had no other data nor the
way of judging but as Jim Clark once
said you know if we have data we're
gonna go with the data if all we have is
opinions we'll go with mine how many of
you have seen a bad decision made based
on the highest paid person's opinion and
we should be clear algorithms makes them
stupid
have some weird stupid outcomes to what
Eric and I are not saying is give every
decision of any consequence over to the
technology and don't ever second-guess
it that's a really scary way to proceed
exactly these are three rebalancing and
while we are enthusiasts for the power
of machines the power of platforms the
power of the crowd we absolutely are
clear in the book that it's not like you
turn the dial all the way to max on each
of those you have to understand where
the trade-offs are there seems to be a
recent backlash a bit against
algorithmic decision making people
complaining that the algorithms might be
trained on bad data that they might have
their own biases that we don't know
what's in the algorithms who's
controlling them what do you say about
that that that's absolutely legit and in
particular if you train an algorithm on
a set of you know data that only has one
set one segment of the population you're
gonna not do a very good job with other
segments of the population so no one in
machine learning that we talked to is
unaware of this problem and so they they
work really hard on training these
things there's another complaint which
you brought up which is we don't know
what's in the algorithms
gang we don't know what's between our
ears either and when we we use Danny
Kahneman's language in the book about
system 1 and system 2 system 1 is this
really fast instinctual snap judgment
thing system 2 is the slow deliberative
rational week we all walk around
thinking that because we're evolved
human beings a system to kind of carries
the day and it can override this this
lizard braid system one that's actually
about 180 degrees backward and what what
we know from from way too much evidence
is that what really happens the imagery
that I love is that system to this
rational deliberative thing is a very
high high paid lawyer drafted by system
one to get system one's will done out
there in the world so it's an explainer
module not the actual decider mod but
people call it technology call it
confabulation you will come up with a
reason for doing something no matter
whether or not you realize it or not and
that's part of what system two does but
but you do hit on some important points
it is certainly possible for an in
common for these algorithms to have
hidden biases in them and it usually
comes not because the people who
designed the algorithms have some ill
intent it's it's as Amy said it's from
the training data and if the training
data has is trained on you know who
should we give loans to let's look at
who our loan officers gave loans to had
by subtle biases those are going to be
picked up in the training data and the
algorithm is going to have those biases
but but it and it competes it could be
problematic because it's very unlikely
that the algorithm or it's certain that
the algum is not going to have a rule in
there that says you know don't give
blown stew black people or whatever the
biases is it's gonna be much more subtle
because many of these neural nets have
upwards of 1 billion interconnections
and weights and trying to sort out what
exactly is going on those billion
interconnections and weights is
basically impossible they cannot explain
it to us we can't properly explain to
each other the thing that the reason
that I think Amy and I both have some
pushback on a little bit on the the
anger against the algorithms is that we
have the potential to improve them over
time and I think that there's more room
to testing the algorithm will come up
with the same reckon
datian given the same amount of the same
data and then you can tweak it you can
see what what kinds of mistakes it may
be making and once you improve it your
can have sustained improvements over
time that's a lot harder to do with
humans it's much harder to even
understand where the biases of humans
are and get them to overcome their own
bias for example if you give an
experienced clinician a medical
clinician the same information about a
patient over the space and you wait
about 24 or 48 hours they will agree
with themselves about 65% of the time no
more than that that's not a failure mode
that the algorithms have but the
algorithms are just god-awful stupid
about what's happening out there in the
world they deeply lack common sense we
have a ton of that and what what Eric
and I are excited about is if you bring
together minds and machines properly you
don't double down on the errors you can
cancel each other as errors out yeah how
do you do that how would you put mind
and machine together in these judgment
scenarios let me give you a couple of
examples one is exactly in sort of
looking at data diagnosis a lot of these
algorithms they can be tuned and be very
good at detecting cancer but they often
make too many false positives they say
hey this looks like cancer and it really
isn't humans are actually better at
ruling those out so many of the systems
that people in place will do them
sequentially that the machine will bring
to the attention this is something that
looks concerning instead of these
thousand places you could look at these
10,000 places you look just look at
these twenty and then the human focuses
their attention on the ones that are
concerning and maybe rule some in and
some out another example is one that I
think we may all be able to write a
little bit more is that's the sales
process our friend Sebastian Thrun runs
a company called Udacity anybody here
know Udacity familiar with that it's
online a teaching course and they get a
lot of incoming traffic from people
through chat rooms saying hey is this
course right should I be doing this what
do you think should I be taking this and
they have highly trained really good
salespeople who respond back in these
chat rooms rapid-fire answering
questions some of them are better than
others and what Sebastian and his
student realized was that hey all these
transcripts of all of our conversations
with customers and potential customers
are training data or an algorithm
let's teach the algorithm which
conversations leave the sails and which
ones don't lead to sales and by looking
at example sales not sale sales not sale
it eventually starts certain patterns or
certain kinds of things
exit information you can provide ways
you can phrase things that are more
likely to convert a potential customer
but instead of trying to build a an uber
amazing bot that would be able to answer
all of the questions that people came in
that was sort of artificially
intelligent that level they built one
that just gave advice or suggestions to
the human salespeople especially to
those not-so-good that the 50 percent
that were below average and every
organization has 50% of the people that
are below average sadly so aren't Ruth
Arch another hard truth so but but what
it would do is as the questions came in
it would notice some patterns and say
you know you might want to give him this
piece of information you might want to
phrase it this way and over time the
humans got better but they would get
this this prompting and it increased the
throughput by about 50% in the
conversion rate by over 20% so that was
a good example of humans and machines
working together to have better
performance than either improve
separately okay last topic before we
open it up to all of you for questions
if the computer is gonna be so good at
diagnosing disease at helping us with
sales maybe doing it one day what are we
gonna do write read science fiction
novels right and read science fiction
novels the important thing to keep in
mind is that technology is encroaching
on stuff that we used to need all of us
for that's absolutely true and Eric and
I think that that encroachment is going
to continue and it's going to accelerate
and that can be a terrifying vision for
a lot of people the thing to keep in
mind is that there is no shortage of
work to be done there is no shortage of
work to be done that is for a long time
to come even with crazy tech progress
still needs to be done by human beings
and a couple different categories of
that are work that requires compassion
or work that inquires tapping into
social drives work that requires putting
like dealing with other human bodies
we're so blobby and weird the robots are
not very good at that stuff yet my mom
unfortunately is in a rehab facility I
think she'd want me to specify that it's
a physical
we have facility and this the surgeon
that worked on her back and then the
physical therapists who are helping her
regain her function these are not gonna
be replaced by robots any time soon I
can vouch for that first hand we need to
take care of little kids we have sick
people we have lonely elderly people
that has worked at as human human work
to be done if we could actually decide
that we wanted to have a infrastructure
in this country that was better than a
d-plus grade the robots are not
repairing bridges and airports yet so
that that's hard good old-fashioned you
know I'm for a brawny hardhat worked for
America we can continue to go down the
list there's just no shortage of work to
be done I mean the thing to keep in mind
in terms of the big picture is
technology's always been destroying jobs
but it's also always been creating jobs
and there's this is turnover we're
concerned because it's happening at a
faster pace it's a broader swath of
things but we are very far from having
machines be able to do everything we
don't doubt that maybe someday that will
happen but what we're the problem we're
facing right now is not the end of work
it's a big dislocation a transference of
work and the advice I would give is look
for things that machines can't do well
and Andy hit on on two of the big
categories one are interpersonal skills
emotional intelligence caring compassion
coaching motivating teamwork leadership
all of those sort of human skills the
other big category is creative work and
I mean like large-scale complicated
writing novels coming up with scientific
discoveries being an entrepreneur and
conceiving of a whole new way of
organizing people and products and
customers those kinds of large-scale
creative tax machines can't do well at
all in fact there's probably no better
time in history to be a talented
entrepreneur or person with any kind of
talent that is scalable with these
machines it's a time when you can just
affect the world to a far greater extent
than you ever could before so there's
room for ways that we can do a lot lot
better and III think it's way way
premature to sort of be talking about
let's put everybody on you know basic
income or whatever and give up on work I
think there's so much work that needs to
be done and that can be done only by
humans we
have to help make that transition happen
I mean you're kind of my exhibit a for a
someone who's not gonna get replaced by
technology anytime soon because I know
three important things that you do
professionally you write science fiction
novels computer-generated extended prose
Wow does that suck like it's just
completely it's gibberish so far you are
an amazing moderator and you're tapping
into all these social energies out here
in the room technology's lousy at that
and we've Eric and I have learned a ton
from you about energy over the years and
you decided to focus on that problem
then inform yourself on it you picked an
area and then got deep on it the
technology doesn't know what area to go
pick and get deep on okay well I look
forward to reading all of your science
fiction novels in the years to come on
that note let's give it up for Andy and
Eric here Thanks
and so now we will take questions so
we'll start over here Amy so your very
first topic that you talked about was
the the how how well crowds do compared
to experts and it seems like on the one
hand this is kind of a a problematic
erosion of the notion of expertise
because if that's the case then how can
we you know tell people you should
listen to these scientists about global
warming or you should listen to the
medical establishment about vaccines and
I don't know if it's just a matter of
you know something that's just a like
accumulation of research data versus
coming up with different kinds of ideas
but I was hoping you could talk a little
more about the distinctions between the
kind of issues where we might want
crowdsourcing or expertise might not
actually be that valuable versus the
ones where can I do this one cuz I've
tried to think about this I your
questions a really important question
what what we don't want to be in the
business of is contributing to the
erosion of respect for facts and for
expertise that's there's enough of that
going on already right so the way I've
come to think about it is if you want to
understand the state-of-the-art in
climate change or crystallography or
anything go talk to the credentialed
experts and those those folks are pretty
easy to identify if you want to make
progress on a tough problem in those
disciplines that's where I start to turn
to the crowd and I make I make a
distinction between credentials and
chops and with what the crowd
demonstrates what these weirdos out in
the crowd demonstrates they got amazing
chops to work on a problem and that
credentialed experts continue to
undervalue I think and this is a really
key point absolutely I don't think that
expertise is less Bob it's more valuable
to quite the point is that expertise
takes many forms the people come in and
solve these problems they have amazing
insights that the people inside the
organization didn't have they have some
expertise in in random forests and
decision analysis in different
techniques than the ones inside the
organization so what you're really doing
is you're tapping into it a more diverse
set of techniques and expertise exactly
you're avoiding the groupthink and by
doing that that's what you really
leverage you it's not that these are a
bunch of people who have no skills
whatever and just a throwing darts
against a board these are really really
sharp
who were involved they have chops some
of them have credentials some of them I
don't have credentials but they have
skills that obviously the initial group
didn't have so it's it's it's not at all
meant to be shooting down expertise or
learning or technique if anything it's
tapping into more of that in a more
diverse way and the last I think that I
think it's important to say about that
chops are accessible right we have can
you do this or not
did your algorithm perform better or not
to me that's the exact opposite of
morons
yelling fake news at each other yeah and
there are more and more platforms - so
it's a top coder we mentioned that this
is where people can go and there is a
pretty objective ranking there of people
who are have high top coder scores who
have done things kaggle and one of the
things that we're not winging it right
yes yeah yeah they have and they learn
from each other so it's a new way of
generating expertise if you will and
identifying okay thank you over here sir
you both spoke really on about
concentrations of power and awareness
and you did so in terms of in general
individual companies that that came
close to being monopolies I mean I don't
know if use we're monopolies but and
here's where my questions start isn't
the real concentration of power tech
itself the combination of now for
generations that have worked on
algorithms hard work and indications and
what most people would easily move from
one problem to another and that it has
become quite an upper class and with a
need to defend itself and to keep on
growing and that might what happened be
happening now is a move from
augmentation technologies to scale
automation to autonomous driving who has
asked for that besides the tech
companies disabled disabled people well
what if no let me finish since you asked
that was a question
disabled people blind people elderly
people people small kids who'd like to
have them get around stuff in
people who want to have fewer than
30,000 road fatalities in the United
States per year I'm asking for that I
mean that's on the margin at that point
in terms of our timeless driving on the
mark and in terms of scale automation I
mean so so the lieutenant governor of
California has actually just broached
this as a problem for the tech industry
so my question is if you'll have another
book out in three or four years will
there have been serious attacks from the
left and the right on the tech industry
for just the reasons that I've all think
there will be attacks but not for the
reasons that you wanna I'm with any that
I think self-driving cars would be one
of the most best thing most humanitarian
things that could be done given I think
people will consider that the carnage
that we are willing to accept right now
with non self-driving cars is just
unimaginable in a few years and it would
be to be striking that we didn't try to
work on it sooner that said I do see a
concern and it's one that I think a tech
industry all of society's gonna have to
take on which is not just the
concentration of power and companies but
potential leave much more concentration
of wealth and among individuals because
some of these winners is because there's
a great time to be an entrepreneur
there's more millionaires more
billionaires than ever in history the
top 1% and the top 1% of the top 1% have
a bigger share of income than any time
since the just before the Great
Depression in the 1930s if that's any
comfort and that kind of concentration
of wealth can lead to a concentration of
power and the people who aren't part of
that I could see becoming very
disaffected so one of the challenges we
have before us is thinking about how we
can make create not just prosperity but
shared prosperity I think technology is
doing a lot to make the pie bigger and
it's up to us as a society to think
about as we make that pie bigger what
can we do to make sure that it's broadly
shared ok thank you sir over here if I
may have a question actually think that
ties in with that as we make the pie
bigger you closed with what can people
do we can be compassionate toward kids
just like early childhood teachers we
can be working with kids being teachers
we can care for the elderly thoroughly
agree with you on that I'm getting a
little emotional because
these are the same industries that are
not getting paid they are getting driven
out and I'm not in any ways hacking you
guys in any way but our system is not
designed to do that I have talked to
many people I'm teaching myself I've had
a student in particular say I was
explicitly told junior year
don't go become a teacher you're too
good for this and yet to me that's
exactly the people that we need to
become teachers but they can't make a
living given the way that things have
changed because of this inequality gap
what can we do well I'm not sure that I
agree with that what's that little last
part that you said I'm not sure it's
because of a big gap in wealth and
income that we don't pay teachers very
well I just don't make that Association
that's so that is very okay I would
agree it's systemically and there's
there's institutions but because of how
because the rules we set up this is a
systems problem this is the institutions
these are the rules that we've put in
place what can we should we change to
make this actually make them valued for
the way that they should be valued
because of what they do because I agree
those are the kinds of things that we do
really well as humans but there's not
valued economically because it doesn't
go faster faster faster okay this is not
something that is determined exactly we
were we've been visiting a lot of people
I was in Finland recently and they
choose to have teachers among the
highest paid college graduates yes but
that's not something that a computer
decided you know that's something that
is society sized so this is a
conversation we have to have if we think
that lawyers are going to add more value
or more of the wealth creators than
teachers and and pay them accordingly as
a society then that's one allocation or
we can decide the teachers are creating
more value isn't a great study by Eric
Hanna's check that a teacher in the top
quartile adds about 400 thousand dollars
to the earnings of that of each year of
students that come out of that compared
to a median teacher so it even just on
that very narrow metric it's not the
only metric of earnings it's it's a huge
amount of wealth creation but that's
something you know that that is a choice
and one of the lessons we had at the end
of the the second Machine Age the last
book and this book is well is that
technology does not make our choices for
us we can't abdicate that or blame
technology we can make our choices what
technology is doing is giving us more
powerful tools than we've ever had
history and tools can be used in lots of
different ways that means the more
powerful the tool is the more choices we
have the more power we have almost by
definition to change the world now are
we going to use that are we going to use
it and we have to decide what our values
are you know I think that those of us
that are in this conversation right now
I probably have fairly aligned values
but it has to be a conversation broader
that than that about how we want to
allocate our society's resources and how
what kind of level of shared prosperity
but we see technology as part of the
solution to that it can have safer roads
it can have better health
you have better education how we go
about rewarding the participants and
that is a social decision and the only
thing I want to add to that a
technologically sophisticated society is
a wealthy enough Society to pay teacher
as well but paying teacher as well is
not about the technology about the
choices that we are making as a people
together so thank you great question so
we choose user early on you talked about
price gouging and the power concentrated
in various companies a few companies and
how do you get better than zero you know
how do you get cheaper than zero what if
you put a monetary value on privacy or
lack of privacy how would that enter in
your thinking about when to worry there
are about 1.9 billion Facebook accounts
in the world today that is what that's
about 2/7 of the world's population so
either Facebook is the first company in
history that has finally managed to fool
all of the people all of the time or
there's something else going on and that
other thing that I think is going on is
we're gonna roll out a suite of really
really attractive capabilities to you to
let you form a network of friends and
share all kinds of media and do these
other things and in exchange you got a
look at some ads two billion people are
taking that deal yeah I see that and I
have to have some faith in the choices
that they're making there has been
intense scrutiny on these companies to
see if they're doing really nefarious
shady things and selling our data out
the backdoor
I haven't seen the expose about how
terrible things are I just don't share
that concern you're saying it's a quid
pro quo and it got us value that privacy
less than what they're getting out of
this the voluntary exchange yeah and you
know as economists were kind of as a
bedrock thing we're kind of fans of
voluntary voluntary exchange especially
when you have the information about the
exchange and I think we do have the
information about that exchange okay
I think he'll actually I think it's a
really good deal you know just take that
one little part of what Facebook does or
Instagram you know photographs used to
be about fifty cents a piece it wasn't
that long ago the year 2000 and there
were let me see well they were about one
there were about one-twentieth as many
photos taken back then there's there are
today and shared and now they're done
basically for free we share them with
our mothers or grandmothers or kids
instantly through this network it's it's
a much better for me social system way
of sharing photographs than what we had
you know 15 years ago my wife keeps
getting ads for guns she doesn't know
what she clicked on some day that caused
that to happen or how to stop it
well the user interface could be better
there is something in Facebook we can go
up and you through the Preferences and
you know I don't have the main you're
frozen you can click through and you can
say you can actually click things you'd
like to see more of the less app you can
see your history so there is a way you
can do it they could do a better job of
making it more accessible thank you for
you can find a twelve-year-old that's
that's a growth industry right there
yeah yes sir here just as a point by the
way to the prior person's message you
guys said earlier that Google Facebook
you know they're not monopolies because
they're not charging you but they are
monopolies in that if people are on
those two platforms they're charging the
advertisers so monopoly means takes all
of a market let's be careful about the
words were using then what's your
question sir the question I've got is
NPR was just doing something on this
just the other day and they were doing a
thought experiment on growth and they
were saying that imagine that you go to
sleep every 50 years from 1800 to today
and every year you wake up and you've
got nineteen hundred's electrification
and you've got cars 1950s has come
through you've got the washing machines
and whatnot and then if you went to
sleep and wake up today essentially
nothing has changed other than the
electronics and then they paired that
with the Bureau of Labor and Statistics
growth rates which are showing that the
growth rate from 2007 to 2016 for
productivity is the lowest growth rate
that we have ever seen since this has
been keeping track of so if what you're
saying is true and happening why is the
per person labor productivity growth
lower than we have ever seen in the
history of this record-keeping yeah
there are a couple really interesting
questions down in there um why so let me
say two things I'm gonna try I'm gonna
kick the productivity question over to
Eric because he's one of the great
scholars of productivity actually that
thought experiment waking up every 50
years is a really interesting one if you
picked a random human being on the
planet and didn't confine yourself to
those of us lucky enough to be born into
the lucky you know to win the birth
lottery born in America you'd get an
extremely different result the average
human being would have seen no change
from 1800 till about you know four
thirty or forty years ago and then the
material conditions of their life would
have improved faster than ever before
I'm talking about income I'm talking
about health child mortality things we
care very deeply about the past 50 years
have been the the most optimistic and
hopeful time for the average person on
the planet that we've seen so I so if we
broaden out that experiment we get a
very different result and they've set it
to the point of technological change not
when the change reaches people so what
one thing to bear in mind is that GDP is
not a measure of our well-being and
productivity is based entirely on GDP I
know that it's always used that way
she's that way on NPR's use that way in
the newspapers people get excited when
the quarterly numbers come out of
productivity was 2.3 percent or was a
2.2 percent the person who invented GDP
was a guy named Simon Kuznets one of the
great inventions of the 20th century and
shortly after he invented he said please
please do not use this as a measure of
our well-being and that's what we
instantly started
it is a measure of production of things
that are bought and sold of purchased in
the economy all this free stuff we've
been talking about by definition was
never intended to be in GDP it's not
part of GDP sorry I'm not speaking to
gbto GDP I'm talking about per worker
per person labor efficiency yeah well
what's the numerator so that is so per
productivity is defined as output per
worker how is output defined output is
defined as GDP go go look it up so so
that's that's what it is so there's a
we're all you know the health the
well-being the improvements in living
living standards that those are not
counted as part of this the other thing
to bear in mind is that you know I think
woody I actually do be frank I was a
little disappointed with the
productivity numbers recently and we
were sort of in this still had a very
long slump of the Great Recession there
the the examples that we're talking
about I think most of them part of our
excitement is that these haven't even
hit yet so we're just talking about
self-driving cars
how many self-driving cars are there
driving around Seattle right now
basically zero okay so this is something
that we can see coming in the pipeline
on a lot of the other the medical
examples yes they were done in the
laboratory but they're not helping us
right now so our enthusiasm in our
excitement and part of the disconnect I
think between the technophiles the folks
in Silicon Valley and at Amazon and some
the communicator of labor statistics is
the BLS is looking mainly in a rearview
mirror and saying hey this is what
happened previously and we're looking
forward and we see just breathtaking
excitement I think if you look at the
scale of inventions every 50 years the
50 year period where you get artificial
intelligence where you get machines that
can think where you interconnect
humanity for the first time you have a
ability I think will be very hard to say
that wasn't the coolest 50-year period
ever ever in history and to do one more
ticket that experiment how many of us
think that if we fell asleep today for a
Rip Van Winkle period and woke up in 50
years we would not be blown away by the
crazy sci-fi world that we see around us
and that thought experiment
yeah so we see these things you know and
we should talk again in 50 years Neville
sooner um and and and so you know and it
maybe we're wrong maybe there will be a
catastrophe that this office is but what
we already see that has been proven
we've written around in those
self-driving cars you know we've talked
to the guise of films so so these are
not hypothetical and these are not just
science fiction although they're back to
these are things that that exist and as
they diffuse and as those not just the
1.9 million billion people on Facebook
how many people have smartphones a few
billion more than that three fun as they
always get access to a doctor that can
diagnose them for zero cost with
efficiency as good as the average shock
or maybe better than that I think that
those things are totally in the pipeline
totally happening and that's part of our
excitement but but I think you're right
oh these things haven't hit yet and the
pure productivity part of it hasn't been
as evident as what we expect to see
going forward
that's her name I just find interesting
that we see the huge productivity growth
of Microsoft and the personal computing
revolution and then the entire cloud
computing entire machine learning
everything we see no change whatsoever I
just want to hit on this point the IEP
that what you said and you wrote it
really eloquently in second Machine Age
but if you take something it use to be
really expensive like GPS used to cost
500 bucks for Garmin yeah and now it's
free in all of our cell phones or
self-driving cars make transportation
across behalf of what it does it looks
like a lowering of GDP or no change
that's right even though we've gotten
this new value yeah this is just I mean
it's it's a sad fact about GDP you think
that GDP is push me but let's take a
really specific example Wikipedia we're
just talking about that replaces
Encyclopedia Britannica Wikipedia is
free how much to contribute to GDP zero
okay tiny bit for the electricity that
takes to run the servers but basically
it's call that zero okay whereas
encyclopedia you know for each person
but but contributed a significant amount
but it's a total night and day all those
apps you have on your smartphone you
know not just the camera the video
camera
the GPS everything those would have cost
thousands
of dollars and they did cost thousands
of dollars when they were separate I
like heart items if the if the be8 not
to be a lesson if the VA does the the
the GDP part of it had tried to properly
account for the extra value you know you
would have an explosion of on the
production side as well but it's it's a
very thorny problem and what happens is
that it just gets completely missed you
know louis c.k theic the comedian has a
great summary of what Eric just said
he's like everything's amazing and
nobody's happy yeah but at the same time
I'm get offstage if that was truly and
we move on yeah you would expect that
that worker that's got instant access to
the information should be more
productive in whatever he is producing
thank you so yeah you don't have to
three books later this is how it goes
the productivity you get ultimately is
what the benefits you get is a consumer
not at what you're doing is a worker and
so it's a mistake to think that by by
producing more stuff that automatically
increases productivity it's what you
actually end up getting as a benefit
exempted this makes create benefits for
you as an end user that is that's the
end that's that's the productivity it
doesn't have to make you better as a
worker right over here that was a good
addition sorry well lightning round it
yeah and then we sign books so then you
all buy books sorry go on please she's
learning a high computers right now are
extremely good at logic like boolean
stuff or perception minimizing some loss
function between those two things humans
do concept formations currently machines
don't people you talk to you when do you
foresee this kind of confirmation gap
closing and then to me that that's like
what opens the floodgates to AI we don't
know you're absolutely right it's great
at this some of those perception tasks
and those are really important that is
far from everything one of the reasons
we think that there's still a lot of
work to be done is that there's all
those other things that machines don't
do well there are
super-smart people more than ever in
history working to solve those we ask
them they don't know when they'll make
that discovery but they're working on it
I will say in the book they have
excellent examples of machines doing
what we would think of as creativity and
doing it well over here sorry we talked
about deep minds alphago and when it
came online it it went in like destroyed
like all existing like human masters
well didn't destroy them the first game
we the first was four to one but yeah it
was and now it when they turn it on
online an anonymous master oh yeah yeah
more weed in a row that's right destroy
the current master yes and then so then
deep mind did you know hunt they did a
hundred self playing games and then they
turned it off and they don't have any
plans to turn it back on so so my
question is do you feel like the mere
existence of an algorithm or or a bot
like alphago reduces human dignity in
terms of not Evers in that area not one
iota not one little bit
you know how goes this what happened to
the sales of go boards in Korea after
Lisa Dahl lost that match and
skyrocketed
Lisa Dahl became a better go player as a
result of playing against alphago I I
fundamentally don't understand this
notion that that we humans have to
define ourselves by what we're best in
the universe at that just doesn't make
any sense to me the best thing never
happened to Garry Kasparov was losing it
took him a while to reach that they hit
that realization if you know Gary does
not like to lose but but but this notion
that our dignity is compromised if we
lose to a machine in the game I'm sorry
I don't share that view in the slightest
but if it proves that the game is
pointless so like my son likes to play
me tic-tac-toe but I mean if I emphasize
the point to him like this game is
pointless you're at you're your endeavor
is basically I wouldn't I would lay off
on the existentialism with with a young
child as a general rule but but you know
I think over time we have to think about
what is our place in the universe and
how do we how do we evaluate that and I
think lots of people get enjoyment about
playing games with each other I know
that I can't outrun a race car but I
still had fun doing races with my kids
and
and I still like watching the Olympics
with humans racing against other humans
so I think it's more complicated more
subtle than just saying you know once
the machine can do it is no longer
interesting right
it's manifestly not true that you know
because we do we do still find this
interesting
but there's layers upon layers of what
are our ultimate motivations and maybe
that would be a good project for us too
but when things do involved it does
change the equation because like I no
longer play chess I used to be first
board that changes the equation that you
it did not let me so let me finish it
did not so it did not change the
equation for a bigger subset of people
who went out and bought go boards I just
mean we your one individual should take
up go but we got to move on there are a
lot of other things that machine's can't
still beat you at so I think there's no
shortage of things for you to work on
over here thank you you've highlighted
and drawn attention to some of the
bright prospects for this technology and
it's really encouraging to hear you
being very exciting about it and I think
you're hearing in the room tonight some
concerns that folks share what advice
would you give to policy makers and/or
lawmakers to on the one hand encourage
facilitate or at least not screw up the
benefit the bargains lowered these days
and yet on the other hand to ameliorate
or mitigate some of the downsides our
colleague Alan Blinder is a really
really good economist and his most
enduring contribution might be a thing
called blinders law which is really
depressing and what he noticed he worked
in Washington for a long time is that
the areas where there is the greatest
consensus among economists and
professional policy people are the areas
where they get listened to the least and
Lee and and the Lee the the least
actually happens so the policy playbook
the smart policy PlayBook is really
uncontroversial these days and to keep
and to remember it I just hum the Old
MacDonald theme song to me myself I'm
gonna get to eieio
I go entrepreneurship immigration
education infrastructure and original
research e-i-e-i-o what we're doing
we're doing a middling to actively lousy
job at all of those things
right now and it's getting worse instead
of better the administration today just
announced that it was going to walk away
from the very notion of a start-up visa
great that that's a move our enemies
would make so the politics so Eric and I
have written put lots of policy articles
the policy PlayBook is not just some
brave intellectual new territory it's
the fact it's just not being done we've
been super optimistic about the
technology we're very very concerned on
the policy side we share your concern
one of the reasons we wrote the book one
reason we're having this conversation is
hopefully changed the national
conversation so we can make some
progress on the those parts but you're
at your right to be concerned and we are
to the answer I the answer I heard was
that you to them for officer you should
run for office that's what I say exactly
a policy walks Adam I'm a property
attorney Ã©xito and I used to think that
inventions were one of those things that
we're going to survive and then NPR
talked about there was a Duke deck which
is a machine created music which people
are now licensing machine created music
because humans are too expensive to
license music from and three recent
articles just came out about human
assisted invention processes so
artificial intelligence being used to
assist people in inventing things
copyrights and patents are enshrined in
our Constitution as a way to encourage
people to invent and create how soon
before we have to remove them copyrights
and patents because machines are doing a
better job at creating and there's no
point in rewarding the small human
contribution left
that's my rising intonation thank you I
appreciate that Adam I think it's a long
long time I mean there's no question
that machines are helping with invention
they've helped from the beginning right
I mean you know whether it's a you know
a microscope or whatever there's been
tools that have helped people discover
and invent things and they're becoming
much more problem but machines you know
until
make those conceptual breakthroughs that
were there the earlier questioner asked
about and and you know I don't know when
that's going to happen it could be a
hundred years it could be five years
probably it's going to be more than that
machines aren't good at this sort of
more unstructured long-term complicated
planning their greatness filling up you
can be very specified tasks a very set
of examples of these are dogs and these
are cats please distinguish them but
conceiving of the problem is the hardest
part
there's a quote we have in the book from
Pablo Picasso believe it or not he
wasn't really think around this and he
said you know computers are useless all
they do is give you answers and and
there's there's no it's funny and but
but but he was ahead of his time there's
there's a lot of truth to that that the
real value is going to be conceiving of
the problem defining it and specifying
it well enough then maybe ish machine
can go and and work through it so we'll
still ask the questions and last
question to you sir no pressure needs to
be a bang up final question what do you
but I'm 26 so I definitely can see a lot
of the the previous thing you're talking
about if I've spent way too many hours
on Wikipedia and gotten a lot of joy out
of that so I can totally buy your your
technology thesis but what I've also
seen it over my lifetime is what you
mentioned the increasing intensification
of terrible policy mistakes you know the
right ones not getting carried out and
so I just wanted to know what gives you
optimism that the positive trend of
technology is enough to overcome you
know I again what I've seen a blast
since since I becoming more Mormon at
all this more tragic policy mistakes
that we keep making you know we've seen
this movie before unfortunately there
there been previous periods in our
nation's history where we made decisions
that I I would violently disagree with
so you know things go in cycles and we
should take some comfort from that my
optimism comes from the fact that a
technological progress the old joke is
it's the only free lunch economists
believe in it is letting us create a
more whatever word you want
abundant prosperous wealthy world it
while it's doing that it is letting us
tread more lightly on the planet overall
with the huge exception that we're
cooking the planet we need to stop but
we need to stipulate that over and over
again tech progress will help us with
that maybe not quickly enough it'll help
us with that so tech progress is giving
us some more giving us human beings more
more wealth more prosperity and letting
us take better care of the planet
now the pessimism is exactly what you
brought it bring up we might fumble that
future we could do some really stupid
things and a couple of the recent
election results make me a little
nervous
however for inspiration as always I turn
to France where they just elected a 39
year old guy this is a really awesome
system they just like to have 39 year
old guy says gang we're going into the
future we're gonna be an entrepreneurial
state all you machine-learning geeks get
over here and help us with this and I
find that awesome right so there's hope
out there I just wish it was a little
closer to home I would distinguish
between two kinds of optimism there's
the unconditional optimism of a child
you know before Christmas expecting
because it can come and it's like I
can't wait for the captions and you just
sit there and it happens and I think way
too many people who call themselves
optimists are those kind of
unconditional optimists or for that
matter you get some unconditional
pessimists they just know it's going to
be terrible I think they both make the
same mistake they both think that
something's gonna happen to us I think
the right kind of optimism is
conditional optimism and that's the
optimism of the kid who's like hey you
know it would be cool if I had a tree
house and if I got some hammers and some
nails maybe got some the kids
neighborhood maybe got my dad to help me
we could go and build a tree house no we
would have a tree house and that's the
kind of optimism that we need in America
is a kind of a can-do optimism that says
we've got more powerful tools we can
change the world but it's not gonna
happen automatically and we're hoping
that more people will appreciate this
potential but I'm very very concerned
it's not certainly not going to be
automatic it's going to depend on people
like you and I'm glad you're here and
asking those kinds of questions and I'm
not just to us I mean asking them more
fundamentally about what we can do in
the world if we make the right choices
we can we can have a much better world
and it's something we've done as a
society time and time again historically
so there's a track record there but the
thing that I would probably want to
leave us the last word is just that this
is not automatic we have to be actively
engaged in it the tools are there but
it's not going to happen without our
efforts the best way to predict the
future is to create it through that yep
thank you very much thank you to all of
you for coming out on a baking sheet
wall thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
