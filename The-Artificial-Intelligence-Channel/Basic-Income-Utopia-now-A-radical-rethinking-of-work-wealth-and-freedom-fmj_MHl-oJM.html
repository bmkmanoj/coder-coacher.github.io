about the future right now you're not
alone politics as usual seems to have
gone style more the energy seems to be
with the people who were shouting Rutger
Bregman thinks we can do better than
that
Rutger is a Dutch historian and author
who writes about history economics and
philosophy
his most recent book has a provocative
title utopia for realists and it's
become an international bestseller some
of raqqa Bergman's ideas are completely
at odds with conventional thinking today
and they are likely to seem crazy to
some people ideas like a standard basic
income for everyone no strings attached
no matter what you do three apartments
for the homeless fewer hours at work
more job sharing and he says there are
far too many highly paid jobs that
create little or no value and induce a
kind of despair in the people that hold
them shouldn't there be more support for
people who actually create value and
contribute to society people like
teachers can bus drivers and farmers and
garbage collectors much of Rutger
Brickman's insights come from his
research and other people's research
into the nature of poverty and why poor
people apparently make poor life choices
he says it's this hard data that led him
to realize and everything he thought he
knew about poverty was wrong
hybrid can hi there I want to start with
a story you have in your book takes
place in 1970 for more than 40 years ago
in a town in Canada called orphan just
first of all what kind of a town was
dolphin in 1974 I'll just sit pretty
small rural town I think about 10,000
people if there so this is somewhere out
in the what the Prairie lands yeah it's
close to win it back in which is a bit
larger and there's this couple in it you
mentioned they're called Hugh and Doreen
Johnson and they've got two kids they
both work but the wages are really
minimal they're just getting by and then
one day there's a knock on the door tell
me what happens after this knock on the
door happens to well there were two men
dressed up in suits there and they
basically said do you want free money so
what what started there in dolphin in
1974 was a really fascinating and
radical experiment what they did for
four years is completely eradicate
poverty so it was called the town with
no poverty and they did it just by
topping up the incomes of everyone who
fell below the poverty line so they
didn't flatten everyone's income they
just lifted up the bottom incomes there
was a flaw in the income distribution
you couldn't be poor anymore you
couldn't be poor anymore okay so what
kind of money were they being given on
an annual basis then every month
actually so they reported their earnings
every month and if it was not enough to
get you above the poverty line then it
would be supplemented and the income
support would sort of phase out with
their with attacks and this is this is
what we call a basic income and what
conditions were attached to this free
money not at all not at all not at all
you only had to live there and it's
absolute was absolutely unconditional
you were completely free to decide for
yourself you know what you want to do
with the money you can spend it on drugs
if you want or alcohol or whatever was
there plans to roll this out nationally
in Canada yes absolutely this experiment
was seen as just the last trial before
it would be rolled out nationally not
many people know that at the end of the
60s in the beginning of the 70s almost
everyone from the left to the right
believed that this kind of policy was
going to be implemented both in Canada
and the US and probably soon after that
the rest of the world the left and the
right board were talking about this yes
exactly I mean Milton Friedman the
famous neoliberal economists was also in
favor of this of the guaranteed annual
income how long did this scheme in
Canada endorphin last four years four
you said so they did it for four years
and there were a lot of economists
sociologists anthropologists who all
descended on the town and that their
research so they you know they did
interviews they collected a lot of data
and maybe made interesting graphs you
know what
what would people do with it with the
money they received what happened after
four years and this this is where the
story gets a little bit sad so a new new
government was voted into power and that
new government thought this is a really
weird experiment what are you actually
doing I mean you're just giving free
money to people stop this at once and so
there was no money left to analyze the
results and the researchers had to put
all their files away in 2000 boxes and
then for 20
five years everyone forgot about it it
was just it was there in the archives
and and no one had done their the
research so no one had processed this
research exactly so we didn't really
know what the what the effect was and
actually some of the researchers were
also a little bit afraid to analyze the
data because they thought that it would
show that it would have been a huge
disaster yeah what was some other kind
of more negative predictions about that
program the the things that were
predicted would most likely occur well I
mean people have two objections mostly
to this kind of idea the first one is
that you know we can't afford it it's
way too expensive and the second one is
obviously that people are just gonna
stop working and that they'll be lazy
and and and and use the money to buy
more drugs and alcohol watch the way
along right yeah and so when someone
finally did find these records what
happened then yeah this was just a few
years ago actually a Canadian professor
her name is Evan n4j she heard about the
records she tracked them down and they
did the analysis worked for a few years
on that and you know it was pretty
amazing what she showed that it was a
tremendous success success by what
yardstick by so many yardstick so I mean
I think the most important finding was
that Evelyn for Jay discovered that the
hospital admissions decreased by 8.5%
which is huge I mean we spent so much
money these days on health care so that
that's there was quite a significant
finding but kids also perform better in
school crime went down and domestic
violence went down mental health
complaints were down it was it was quite
a success what about the predictions of
the people who quit their jobs and just
live on this minimum basic income just
didn't happen who didn't show any total
amount of work our rejections for male
breadwinners was 1% and this was totally
compensated by people doing other useful
stuff like I don't know caring more for
their kids or for the elderly of being
longer in school yeah so it and the
prophecies of doom just failed to
material I can I can see the kind of
connection between better performance at
school because if if parents aren't
working all the time in the hardscrabble
jobs to try and working overtime to
bring an extra dollar they got more time
to look after the kids in a tent their
schooling why hospital admissions that
why did they go what's the connection
between the reduction in hospital
admissions with the introduction of the
universal basic income there well I mean
poverty creates so many problems and and
worse health it's just one of them I
think that we often forget that poverty
is just incredibly expensive you know in
terms of higher healthcare costs
higher crime rates you know you pay more
for the judicial system etc etc and it's
it's it basically can invest investments
to eradicate poverty itself and I think
that the data even shows that it's an
investment that pays for itself so the
savings are actually bigger than the
cash grants themselves are you saying
that the results showed that the
introduction of this minimum income
scheme this introduction of free money
saved money yeah it's and in that sense
it's literally free money you know we've
sort of forgotten to think about social
policies in that Surrency say usually
the debate goes today goes like the left
says we need to do this because it's our
moral responsibility to help the poor
and then the right says yeah sure but we
can't afford it now what I think is that
there is a huge amount of evidence that
these kind of policies you know just pay
for themselves
there are great investments with a huge
return you mentioned that there were
proposals all around the world in the
developed world anyway to introduce a
similar scheme the universal basic
income had this been tried elsewhere and
if so what kind of results were cropping
up in these other places well as I said
it's a completely forgotten episode in
American history and in Canadian history
that yeah we we trialed a lot actually
with basic income in this time so there
were huge experiments in in the US as
well with thousands of people
participating that basically had the
same results so again health care costs
went down crime went down gets performed
better in school and no people didn't
quit working now sometimes they quit a
job that they thought was completely
meaningless and you know look for
another more useful job which is a great
thing I believe but that was that was
mainly the the results now there was one
problem though and that was in 1978
there was a big experiment in Seattle
where researchers found that the divorce
rate had gone up by 50 percent so as I
said you know the right and
conservatives initially were in favor of
basic income but when they heard about
this they were like the we call the
basic income you know this will make
women much too independent
we don't want it anymore
it was only ten years later that
researchers found out that statistical
mistake had been made so reality the
divorce rate did not go up but it's one
of the many many bizarre ironies in of
this history here at the President Nixon
in the 1970s a Republican president was
interested in introducing such a scheme
in the United States how far did he get
with that
well he was almost there actually at the
end of the 90s there was a letter on the
front page of the New York Times that
was signed by a thousand economists all
calling for a guaranteed annual income
and there were economists from the left
and the right you know as I said Milton
Friedman the right-wing economists but
also John John Kenneth Galbraith you
know quite left-wing economists they
were all in favor of this Martin Luther
King it also was in favor of a basic
income and Richard Nixon just thought
you know it it it wasn't the case that
he was the big man with the big idea he
just thought all right you know let me
be the man the president that makes
history so he had a bill for modest
basic income that got through the House
of Representatives twice but then it was
killed in the Senate by the left by the
Democrats the left killed it yeah why
they wanted a higher basic income they
thought this is going to be implemented
anyway so let's just kill this bill now
but there will be another bill in the
near future because this is this is the
future
anyway they believe the thing about the
experiment endorphin was that there were
no strings attached to the payments so
it came as more of a right than as a
privilege if you like how important is
that that idea that there are no strings
attached to the payment of this free
money I think it's absolutely crucial if
you look at the welfare state right now
in in the past 30 years since Reagan
integer it has become more and more
conditioned or more more participatory
allistic and quite humiliating for the
people who are in it the real experts on
the poorest lives are the poor
themselves poverty is not a lack of
character but just a lack of cash we
just have you know way too large
bureaucratic
industry of paternalist is just better
to hand out the salaries of those people
to the poor who really need it
so I mean to see why the right won't get
behind this now
if you get that means really getting rid
of welfare as it is a combination of
right wing and left wing thinking I mean
the right is true when it says that the
welfare stayed you know keeps people
down at the bottom of society it is true
I mean there are so many mekin
mechanisms that enforce that what you're
talking about the payment of a universal
basic income would eliminate those giant
bureaucratic apparatus as machines if
you like that I put in place to look
over the shoulders of welfare recipients
exactly to make sure that they're
they're spending it wisely that they're
doing this for doing that they're still
applying for it exactly and behind that
just slice a different philosophy if you
will of what poverty actually is and
that is that is maybe the most important
point here is that both people on the
left and on the right completely
misunderstand what already actually is
how do they do that well what the right
often things is that you know poverty is
some kind of character failing right
that Margaret Thatcher famously famously
said that poverty is a personality
defect lack of character a lack of
willingness to work yeah yeah the lazy
you know the the willingness to take
responsibility for your own life etc and
that the idea is then that we have to
push people into work or teach them how
to you know be responsible now the left
of obviously doesn't put it like that
but what it does say is let's help
people you know to make better decisions
let's guide them you know let's give
them money management training let's
give them courses for the unemployed
let's help them to set up their LinkedIn
profile or something like that and the
Assumption by behind that is the same
it's again the assumption that there's
something wrong with the poor themselves
so I think that the left and the right
basically agree on that that there's
something wrong with the poor it also
assumes that they have better
information than the poor themselves
absolutely it assumes that they know
better example people that says it's a
quite arrogant position if you put it
like that so tell me another research
that changed this is part of the
research that changed your mind on this
what do you now understand to be at the
root cause of poverty and why poor
people often typically make poor life
choices well the experiment that really
changed my mind was it was a it was a
breakthrough article in science a few
years ago and what the recent these ritu
research is did
is they went to India and they work with
a group of sugarcane farmers now these
farmers receive about 60% of their
annual income all at once right after
the harvest which means they're
relatively for one part of the year and
rich the other so then they did
something very simple you know they gave
them an IQ test before and after the
harvest so while they were poor and
while they were rich and the difference
was 14 points in IQ now to give you an
idea that's comparable to losing a
night's sleep or the effects of alkyl
ism which means that yes it is true that
the poor off to make poor decisions I
mean there's overwhelming evidence in
that shows this but it has nothing to do
with the poor themselves it is just the
context of poverty we would all make
very you know worse decisions if we were
in the same context so how do we solve
that problem get them out of poverty
that is what we should do so what is the
root cause of poverty then what does
what is if it's not as some kind of
character filing what do you now believe
it today it's just a lack of cash not
all that is just electric cash it's a
lack of cash yeah it's you know when I
say it like this it sounds like oh wow
that's it but that's just what it is and
it's pretty easy to solve a lack of cash
I mean just give cash there are
different examples of new books are in
your book of other schemes that are
taking place there's another story about
the Cherokee Indians of North Carolina
and what happened when they were given
the legal right to open a casino on
Cherokee lands tell me what happened
there this is another fascinating piece
of research and it was it was a big
coincidence actually there was a
professor who had started a study among
about 1,500 children and you know their
mental health and lots of other stuff
and then during that study suddenly a
casino opened and the the casino was
operated by the Eastern Band of Cherokee
Indians and they were free to you know
do with the earnings whatever they wants
to do and they decided just to give it
to the members of of the band and these
it was quite a lot of money you know it
was a very profitable casino so at some
point the cash transfers reached a point
of 6,000 7,000 8,000 dollars and a lot a
month or a year a year yeah and so
they've been paid out like shareholders
essentially
yeah on a given that's exactly
Christianity so this was sort of a basic
income and a lot of a lot of the members
of this and lived in poverty so it was
you know it was a golden opportunity for
these researchers to look at the effect
of that of what actually happens in a
basic income now again they saw the same
results as in as in dolphin and in the
u.s. experiments is that you know again
you know health improved crime went down
gets performed better in school etc etc
but what was even more fascinating is
what an economist his name is Randall
key from UCLA found out later is that
the savings in terms of lower health
care costs etc were bigger than the cash
grants themselves so there was another
piece of evidence that shows that this
can actually work you were saying that
them the research does back to subsidy
that poor people do often make poor
lifestyle choices and that's often this
some kind of a terrible shrinkage the
techs place in their ability to either
not compute their lives I suppose once
there's enormous scarcity and the
tension and stress of that in their life
you know tell me a bit more about what's
got what's going on there and and the
kind of relentless short term that comes
into play when people are enduring pop
yeah well the it's probably good to
compare it to being busy you know if you
busy if you're really busy you have a
very short term view right you think
about you know the the email you've
gotta finish or you know that
appointment that you got a rush to and
you're gonna make mistakes if you have
that rationality now you should just
imagine that the poor are in that state
all the time and the thing is you can't
take a break from poverty like if you're
busy you can no you can go on vacation
or something like that or call your
employer and say you know I'm really too
busy can't do anything anymore today but
the poor can do that they're always in
that mindset they're always focused on
you know how will I reach the end of the
week you know living from paycheck to
paycheck and that means that in the long
term you're gonna make a lot of
decisions that are not very good for you
you know you're gonna raise your kids
less well you're gonna eat more
unhealthy and all sorts of things
so are you calling Dean for universal
basic income to be introduced in
advanced economies all economies right
across the board but what are you
exactly are you calling for here but
I think that developed countries should
have done it 40 years ago actually you
know back then it almost happened and we
miss sort of our our opportunity to do
it but it's really exciting to see the
the idea spreading around the globe
right now I mean just a few years ago it
was completely forgotten when I started
writing about it in 2013 I you know
almost no one knew what it was and now
it's pretty much everywhere like Canada
is just seen as a big experiment Finland
has already started one it was just in
the news that Scotland is always also
going to do an experiment so yeah I
think we have little time to waste but
it's also important countries actually
or here's the here's the problem that I
think I can see with this which is this
something in human nature that just
rebels against people getting money for
nothing you know if I'm working hard I
know my taxes you're gonna take money
from me and give it to someone without
no strings attached no matter what they
do and they can sit around all day even
if maybe the research shows that that's
not what happened there's something in
human nature that rebels against
confiscation of someone's will to head
it to someone else who can choose to
work or not choose to work what do you
say to that I think it's really
important that we use different language
here there's one place in the whole
world that sort of has a basic income
it's Alaska and it's a basic income of
$2,000 a year so I mean doesn't get you
out of poverty or anything but it's
significant and it's financed with oil
money and it's really seen as a dividend
that you just I mean it's not a favor
but it's just a right that everyone
receives now if you want to get rid of
that policy in Alaska as a politician
you're finished it's be incredibly
popular so we should really see the
basic income like that it is a dividend
of progress you know because our
forefathers worked so hard to create all
this incredible prosperity that we have
today you know we are wealthier we are
healthier than ever all these
institutions all these technologies etc
that we didn't create ourselves were
just given to us right we were just
lucky to be born in this world that's
our rich kids who've inherited the
fortunes those patiently built by our
predecessors in the way in
yes of collective inheritance and a
basic income is a recognition of that
fact that everyone deserves a part of
that pie your books called utopia for
real so you want to reintroduce the idea
of utopian thinking and you begin with
this perspective that we do live in this
land of plenty
despite the kind of sour note a lot of
politics has in developed countries
these days can you give us a bit of
perspective on this kind of land of
plenty that we've arrived at now in this
time compared to say 200 years ago
well I start the book with what is
probably the biggest lesson of all of
human history and that is that in the
past everything was worth it's something
that you don't really get when you watch
the news a lot I mean when you watch the
news you hear about corruption and
crises and terrorism etcetera you think
Oh everything is going downhill we are
living through the worst period in all
of world history but that is I mean
mainly the effects of amnesia we have
just forgotten how bad the past really
was yeah and when you see stuff from
that time as well they go do things were
so much better in the past back then too
so there is a kind of weird amnesia the
tech side yeah the truth is we've never
been richer healthier more long-lived
more free of disease if you just look at
some of the stats it's been pretty
incredible extreme poverty was 84
percent of the world population in 1820
now it's less than 10% if you look at
the the decline of child mortality has
declined by 50% since 1990 hunger has
declined by a third since 1990 if you
think about violence and you think that
we are living in a very violent times
well in reality the amount of war deaths
has gone down by 90 percent since 1946
so yeah indeed we are living in a safe
experience in period in all of world
history but again and you'll you don't
really get that from the news so why are
you going for utopian thinking like
saying well let's muck it up and move
forward again why to change it up what
rather than hang on to what we've got
why are you calling for a new kind of
utopian thinking again Oscar Wilde once
said that a map of the world that does
not include utopia is not worth even
glancing up for it leaves out the one
country in which Humanity is always
landing I think it's a beautiful quote
that shows that we always need to have
some vision of where we want to go now
we have achieved fascinating things
great things tremendous things in fast
to 300 years you know the end of slavery
democracy equal rights for men and women
these were all utopian fantasies once
and the first one who said you know we
should introduce something like
democracy was probably original and said
that's unrealistic that goes against
human nature you can do that and here we
are yeah he's the problem of today is
that we have no new vision of where we
wanna go next you know what is our
utopian dream for the 21st century he's
the problem as I see it with utopian
utopian thinking we've just come out of
the 20th century where utopian thinking
was across the Crucified untold millions
of people and I'm thinking specifically
here at the Soviet Union under Stalin in
particular or Mao is China if you like
in order to build this perfect new world
well you can't make an omelet without
breaking eggs I think with Stalin's
phrase as well this is always the
problem with utopian thinking that well
well if this is the leadership now wants
to build a utopia who would be an enemy
if you turn here and we must do away
with the enemies if utopia and we must
also hide the mistakes because utopia is
more important than all of that this
kind of that utopian thinking it has
been extremely dangerous in the past
what lessons do you draw from that
Rutger well I used to think exactly the
same thing because this is what they
taught me at university you know I was
born in 1988 a year before the fall of
the Berlin Wall and people of my
generation were basically told that the
age of grant narratives of big dreams
was over you know communism filled
capitalism at one good riddance this is
it this is the end of history this
top-down Pro I mean the communism was a
kind of top-down blueprint for all of
humanity
yeah and we're just that's got make me
feel a little smarter than many
intellectuals and journalists drew a
bigger lesson like we really don't need
that big thinking anymore we only need
technocracy you know just small skill
tinkering and the only thing we have to
worry about is you know what is the next
iPhone going to look like and I used to
believe this for a while but then came
2008 the financial crash and suddenly it
seemed hmm something's going wrong here
now we just set 2016 brexit rise of
Donald Trump and I think it's obviously
clear to millions of people around the
globe right now
like we can't stick to the status quo
and I started to realize more and more
that we had thrown away the chat with
the bathwater and that we have forgotten
that progress is always the realization
of utopias is all score Wow at once
right and that there are basically two
forms of utopian thinking I mean you're
absolutely right
it is incredibly dangerous to come up
with a blueprint and say this is the
perfect society and if you don't agree
with me well too bad for you but that
doesn't mean that we don't need some
bigger vision something to strive for
something that gives people hope you
know that good that we can build a
movement around conversations with
Richard fodhla broadcast podcast and
online
you know for me with the most
fascinating party book was a quiet
crisis in the nature of work that you
completely put your finger on rigor
which you show that in many countries
like Britain for example more than a
third of people feel that they're in
jobs that have absolutely no use
whatsoever their lives are designed to
make or shift things around that have no
value for them and this is inducing this
terrible kind of despair how widespread
is this this problem of useless
meaningless and often high naive useless
and meaningless work well I think it's a
huge phenomenon and I also believe that
it is one of the biggest taboos of our
time because not many people are talking
about it
I mean politicians from the left to the
right say we need more jobs we need more
employment and all we commonly say well
we just need more productivity and as
long as it's that's contributing to GDP
economic growth then everything is
alright but meanwhile indeed I mean
we've got quite some polls now that show
that at least a third of the workforce
is stuck in a job that they think I mean
it's not me saying it so people might
say well he's a historian that's useless
anyway it's people defining it for
themselves and saying my job really it
it doesn't do anything you know I'm not
creating what your value and sometimes
even worse I'm actually destroying value
as many people in the financial sector
know about their own jobs yeah this is a
kind of a corrosive feeling to need to
wait yourself a steam over time just
that this this feeling that my job is
pointless or even it does more harm and
what's an even bigger phenomenon is the
phenomenon of part-time jobs
like this is pretty huge in journalism
as well so what happens is that I mean
you want to do investigative journalism
right I mean especially if you're young
you still have got dreams and ambitions
that set through it but the problem is
you don't get any money with that so
what you do is you write ads for
companies that you really hate and then
you use that money to the investigative
journalism into exactly those kind of
computers so you could call that the
circle of and you see it in in
so many professions these days
consultants lawyers bankers doing work
that they think is pretty much
destructive but then using the money
they earn with that to do I don't know
pro bono stuff or working for a you know
another organization that they really
care about it's pretty fascinating isn't
it that in modern capitalism we finance
the stuff that we use we think it's
really important with meaningless
nonsense this seems to be like a great
example of market failure here because
many people are really very high
salaries almost obscene salaries for
doing work that doesn't create this goes
deeper than market failure I mean market
failure sort of assumes that there's a
fix you know that we could have a know
one small tweak to the market then the
market will work properly again but
isn't there supposed to be some kind of
invisible hand that gets rid of all this
meaningless jobs I mean why would
employers even want to hire these people
that don't really have anything of value
I mean it is sort of it strikes at the
heart of capitalism this phenomenon and
yeah as a quote from someone at Facebook
who says I saw I saw the finest minds of
my generation making clickable ads yeah
I just want to make really clear that
when you talk about jobs you're
not talking about the low status jobs
are you no absolutely not absolutely not
I mean I'm not talking about teachers or
nurses or garbage collectors the best
way to know whether your job does add
anything of value is just to stop doing
it and see what happens
so then I thought you know let's look at
garbage collectors I mean there have
been a lot of strikes of garbage
collectors throughout history I looked
at one in 1968 in New York it lasted for
six days the emergency State had to be
declared and the garbage meant one
because New York found out that they you
know the city really can't do without
them it's it's a total disaster if they
quit their job and at that point I
thought has it ever happened throughout
world history that the bankers went on
strike now this took quite a while to
research for kids you know at some point
I thought well I'd probably never
happened until I found one example and
that was in Ireland 1970 this strike
lasted for six months so compared to the
garbage collector story for six days
this was six months and nothing much
happened actually the famous Irish
bankers strike yeah I think it's not
really it wasn't very well known to
strike because nothing much happened the
economy just kept growing businesses
just kept operating and the Irish
invented their
own money system from the bottom up they
and after six months the bankers came
back and said alright alright we'll get
back to work
all of our economic policies they rest
upon one really key index which is gross
domestic product GDP is the key figure
here in this central banks take their
guidance from this in terms of how
whether they lower or raise interest
rates or the market looks at those
figures and makes conclusions about
whether the currency should go up or
down tell me what you come to understand
about gross domestic product and how
good it is as a yardstick of measuring
true wealth in a country you know a few
years ago in Dutch news there was a lot
about the Greeks being not productive
enough you know we have the depth crisis
in Europe and the Greeks were supposedly
lazy spending all our money and they
were not productive enough that's what
the economists said and then I started
researching there and I found out that
the definition of productivity of
economists is just the amount of money
earning so in that sense you know my
mother who's a teacher would not be very
productive and a banker would be
incredibly productive so I started a
that's a really weird definition of
productivity isn't it I also discovered
while later that actually the Greeks
have the longest working week in all of
Europe and you know my country Holland
has the shortest working week so there's
something weird going on here I really
think that we live in a time that we
should go back to very basic questions
like what is work what is wealth who are
the real wealth creators what is
productivity and indeed if we look at
something like GDP or economic growth it
counts a lot of things as somehow being
productive or useful that in reality you
know if you look at the real economy if
you look at real people's lives then
when you're talking about waste we are
talking about useless stuff that doesn't
have anything of value what are you
calling for what's a way of shifting
people away from these highly paid
 jobs as you call them into more
productive life I'm assuming that's what
you're calling for you how might such a
thing be accomplished I think that a
universal basic income will make a huge
difference here I mean just imagine what
is happening right now I mean kids
around the developed world they are
thinking about what they want to study
and then at some point their parents
will tell them you know I know you love
music I know
of the arts like history but you know
you got to earn money as well in the
future right you got to pay the bill so
maybe you should go to business school
or law school instead and there they go
with a basic income if they would know
that they could rely on a basic income
they'll say to their parents you know
I'm gonna do what I actually want to do
I'm gonna actually contribute something
to this society so that will make a huge
difference the other thing what will
happen is that with a basic income all
the people and really useful jobs will
have much more bargaining power it will
also be a universal strike fund so again
I mean the garbage collectors the
teachers the nurses they can say you
know wha I can always go on strike I can
always fall back on my basic income so
what will happen is that their wages
will go up now if you're in a not very
useful job you won't get any additional
bargaining power so your wage will
probably go down a little bit and in the
end the wages in the whole job market
will much better reflect the social
value of you know what people actually
contribute and I think that is actually
one of the most important effects of a
basic income it will completely change
what we value and reward in our society
look one of the things you talk about in
your book quite a bit is the whole
concept of leisure and leisure time
mm-hmm and I do have memories of this I
do have memories of the 20th century xx
of leisure yes from the 20th century of
of these predictions that were made and
I can remember them being made in my
childhood nearly teens often by science
fiction writers that the crisis we're
going to have in the 21st century is a
super abundance of leisure time we won't
know what to do with all the leisure
time we have and this will in turn
create a spiritual crisis a strange
spiritual malaise it will be lying
around on couches going to psychiatrists
thinking my god how do I do things with
my life from now on it didn't pan out
that way did it no no this country
particularly you know with this
discovery is famous for knocking off in
midday on a Friday this country was one
of the first to introduce a proper
working week a living wage to stone
masons of Melbourne were the first to
get the eight-hour working day there's a
monitor and there's a monument for that
in Melbourne that I visited visited just
last week we were pretty proud we've
worked through it most of my childhood
in it Australia was kind of what often
castigate itself for being a bit of a
lazy country
I just don't think that's the case
anymore everyone everyone I know works
really long hours at their job what what
do you think has gone wrong the earth
indeed something has gone wrong and how
what waddle to what ought to be done to
address this problem again I think it's
really important that we remember that
up until the 1970s
almost all the economists sociologists
philosophers all believed that we would
be working less and less and less so
this is not some crazy prediction that
was just made by some science fiction
writers I mean the British economist
John Maynard Keynes believed we would be
working just fifteen hours in 2030 this
was basically a very mainstream opinion
that boredom was going to be the big
challenge of the future everything
changed around 1980 throughout the
developed world there are usually two
explanations given the most popular
explanation is consumerism so we keep on
buying stuff we don't need to impress
people we don't like
which is probably a part of the answer
but let's also be honest I mean most of
us don't really produce anything in our
jobs that other people consume right I
mean our iPhones all the crap that we
buy is being produced either by robots
or by wage slaves in third-world
countries right it's not being produced
by us most of us are sitting in the
office sending emails to other people
all day writing reports no one really
reads so I think that the rise of
meaningless jobs is a much better
explanation actually and this is just
something that all the grid all these
great thinkers from the 20th century
underestimated they underestimated how
adaptive capitalism can be they
underestimated its extraordinary
potential to come up with new
meaningless jobs and I actually believe
this can go on for a lot longer I mean
now it might be 30% but it could be 50%
in the future it could be 80% it could
be a hundred percent I mean at some
point we could live in a society where
everyone is just pretending to work well
in reality we're just browsing Facebook
the upshot of all these these extra
house that are being worked is it's put
a check on civic life throughout the
developed countries you know community
organizations volunteer organizations
churches unions all those things their
ranks are thinning out it's harder to
get people to show up for staff I mean
whatever hours you have left after your
job have to be devoted to caring for
your children or your parents it's this
little kind of a rule
and the quality of life this super
abundance of work our lists and in the
meaning of life as well I believe I'm
not saying that we should work less so
that we can sit on the couch and watch
Netflix all day actually it's the
country through the longest working
weeks where people watch the most
television which is pretty logical I
just like it again say that again it's
the countries to the longest working
weeks like the US turkey Japan or people
watch the most amount of television is
that because when they get home you just
so tired
exactly all you feel like doing is the
only thing you can just watch Gilmore
Girls and and that's it for better times
that's it while in countries with much
shorter working weeks we see that people
develop much more time to their kids to
the elderly to volunteers work to
participating in their local communities
so in that sense I think we need to do
less paid work into in order to do more
the thing that's about to crash into
this ever-increasing amount of work
we're doing is the rise of robot
Association automation in the workplace
which are starting to eat away at jobs
the job market at the moment how do you
see that intersecting with this crisis
of of overwork if you're like well there
are some people especially in Silicon
Valley who believe that you know when
the robots calm and some predictions say
that 50% of all jobs will be gone in 20
years
and then people Silicon Valley say what
a universal basic income is just
inevitable it's gone it you know there's
there's no alternative but the thing is
in the 70s they believe that as well but
we still haven't got that basic income
so maybe it's not inevitable maybe if we
need to fight for this and actually
create a movement around it I think
there's technology just creates
possibilities but you know there are
different routes that we can take in the
future well as I said I mean there we
could add many more meaningless jobs yes
the advent of the light bulb meant the
crisis in the candle factory I mean
didn't and of course that again and
again we've seen a situation where a
whole form of work is made obsolete then
humans then inevitably create new forms
of things to say and do and think and
create and all those things that are
will that change do you see that
changing no this is the argument the
economists always make you know there
will always be new jobs and indeed that
has had
in the past 200 years my point is just
that many of these jobs do not provide
people with meaning in their lives so
that I think that we should get rid of
the dogma the old Dogma which is well
I'm now saying it it's an old Dogma but
actually it's a fairly recent idea the
life is just about paid work
I mean people didn't believe that in the
16th century so we should get rid of
that dogma and just redefine what life
is all about just the last couple of
years
the whole issue of inequality is hid
world leaders like a rock through a
window
it suddenly appeared maybe it was there
all the time I don't know but it was
there all the time
sure yeah so how is this well that's
right I mean the increasing automation
of work is this increasing inequality at
the same time it's it's certainly one of
the reasons but there are many many
other reasons as well you know the
decline of labor unions the growth of
the financial sector there are a whole
you know plethora of reasons here I mean
we've all heard about the book of Thomas
Piketty I mean we didn't read it but we
know what's basically the argument is
and it is that you know especially
wealth inequality is growing and growing
and growing are you seeing politicians
or leaders being willing to change their
thinking on this matter I mean we are
still stuck in a kind of paradigm of the
kind of economics and philosophies if
you like of the 1980s at the moment and
then stuff at the end of previous
orthodoxy I think we just kind of moved
from one Orthodox ideas to another over
time that's what human history is really
isn't it well as a historian I really
believe in the power of ideas and new
ideas you know they don't start in
places like Westminster or Washington or
camera that's where they end they start
but I started camera they start with
crazy people and who are on the fringes
in our first dismissed I mean just look
at someone like Donald Trump we
dismissed him just a few years ago as
you know completely we thought it was
completely unrealistic the idea that he
would ever become president the the
whole phenomenon of thumb-up Trump is
just the endpoint of a quite long
historical process that started probably
20-30 years ago
it's the same with the idea of
neoliberalism that started in the 50s
already until it took over in the 70s
and became really powerful in the 80s
and crashed into
so it takes some time but I think it's
important not to look at you know the
Centers of what we call political power
but look on the fringes and what new
ideas are starting there that might take
over the world when a new crisis hits us
the most contentious I think proposal in
your home is the one that concerns open
borders you're calling for a world where
borders essentially a dropped and people
can pass backwards and forwards across
borders pretty much the way why goods do
more or less these these days I can't
see that getting up anytime soon I mean
strong borders are with whether you
agree with them or not nonetheless
there's there's large majorities for
support of strong borders in this
country in particular increasingly so in
the United States and in the UK that's
what led to breaks it or something why
are you calling for an open border
system and doesn't this mean like half
the world disadvantage suddenly turn up
on their front doorstep suddenly well
it's definitely the most radical idea in
my book I mean compared to basic income
basic income we could do that tomorrow
as and as I said we should have done it
yesterday but maybe the idea of open
borders is also the most important
utopian idea that is out there right now
let's just zoom out a little bit
and think about what our world would
look like if we live in the Year 2200
what would the biggest injustice of our
time be I think it's pretty obvious its
borders
I mean borders calls inequality on a
massive scale much bigger international
inequality is global inequality if you
have the same skill set as someone in
Australia you're in about ten times less
if you live in a Nigeria and and that's
just because you were born in the wrong
country now obviously we have a long
list of objections against immigration
and diversity and most of them are
basically wrong we have a pretty
substantial migration program the
stragglers have a refugee program we
don't have open borders immigrations one
thing that open borders are a whole
other thing I mean it's not a question
between on or off isn't like you put up
the fence and hedalin-- no one in no
country does that but but the sudden
arrival the sudden radical arrival of
very large groups of people into your
society that don't speak the language
bats have lower age level
of Education so they can't play using
the local economy this can create
terrible crises in the communities of
the places that they come to and yeah
main to become counterproductive there's
a huge reaction in takes place against
them exactly and that's also I'd see
utopian visions something that we should
strive for and and take one small step
after another in that direction so it's
important to remoting clear dropping the
borders tomorrow no I'm not saying that
I think you should always experiment
first I mean I was saying the same thing
when it comes to basic income let's do
more experiments you know let let our
current welfare state become more like a
basic income it's it's very important
that we have a radical vision for the
future but that we are very practical
about you know what we want to do
tomorrow and then take one small step
after another and you know Bo would open
to learn along the way and maybe even
change our opinion if something's not
really working working out the way we
hoped it would but it's important to
remember though that immigration is by
far the most powerful weapon we've got
against global poverty and that most of
the objections we have against it like
oh these are all criminals or terrorists
and they're lazy and they that will just
go on welfare and do nothing it's just
not true if we look at the data we look
at the mountain of economic evidence
we've got it's just not true it's not a
coincidence and again I say this as a
historian that throughout world history
all the great nations and empires were
founded on the strength of immigrants
you know from the Roman Empire to the
United States there are lots of examples
here and it's also important to remember
that actually I mean this is happening
right now in the US and Europe is that
the higher the walls are the more
illegal immigrants you're going to get
because people will still come you know
this happened in in the US but they
don't go back anymore there's some
fascinating research that shows that in
this 60s and 70s hundreds of thousands
immigrants illegal immigrants from
Mexico came to the u.s. u.s. that 80% of
them went back to their home country
which is logical I mean that's where you
came from and you probably miss it
but then they started to militarize the
border in the 80s and started building
higher and higher walls nowadays about
15 to 20 percent of all illegal
go back the same thing is happening in
Europe the higher the walls the more
immigrants you're going to get in 2011 I
happened to be in New York City broken
and I wandered down to have a look at
the Occupy Wall Street demonstration
that was going on in Wall Street and
this was very much in reaction to the
outrages performed by the financial
community which led to the crash of 2008
and maybe I just were there on a bad day
I don't know I saw like guys drumming I
saw people in tents I didn't see a
program I didn't see like a list of
ideas like this ought to happen and in
fact the leaders at the time said we're
not here to come up with an alternative
set of policies we just want to register
our protest okay is this a problem with
the left at large that they don't bring
forward proposals like this at the
moment I'd say that the problem with the
left these days that it only knows what
it's against it's against a lot of
things these days I mean it's against
homophobia against racism against
austerity against the establishment
against mainstream media against
consumerism against growth there was
even a book recently published by a
famous New York intellectual and the
book is called against everything the
first chapter of that book is against
exercise now I'm not saying I'm not
against all those things but we also
need to be for something I mean Martin
Luther King he did not say I have a
nightmare
he had a dream right and when we need
that we need a dream of vision of a
better society to build a movement to
give people hope that it actually
matters what we do in the HERA now and
that we can create a better world
ultimately this is Paul business
politics we're talking right now this is
politics III think that all politics
anyone's political system of beliefs is
rooted or rests fundamentally upon a
view of human nature hmm what's your
view of human nature
I have very crazy and dangerous view of
you oh dear come on let's hear it I
believe that most people are pretty nice
I believe that most people are are
creative social that we want to make
something of our lives and that we are
completely misguided by what the news is
telling us every day I mean the news is
about exceptions about things that go
wrong about corrupt politicians about
terrorists about
have you driven a car on the road lately
you see what people are like on the road
but that's what you remember I mean
we've got a very bad memory here what
you remember is you know the few
incidents now that we have in a week or
a month or whatever but the majority of
our interactions with other people are
quite pleasant actually I think you
could call this the banality of good
it's just what we are like as a species
but the thing is is that we often assume
the worst in other people and this is
where things really go wrong because
then we start to base our democracy and
our social welfare system on the idea
that most people want to corrupt the
system and we start making laws for the
1% instead of the 99% this is happening
in the in the welfare state all the time
so we've got all kind of anti-fraud
regulations etc I mean just just last
week in the news in Australia drug
testing I mean it hardly hardly exists
people on welfare money wasting their
their money on something like that but
now everyone has go got to go through
that humiliating test what kind of
collateral damage will that get and get
us and I think so many times we just
have a completely wrong idea of what
most of us are really like when you talk
to people about this idea of a universal
basic income what did they say about
what that would mean for them and what
it would mean for that guy down the road
well that's so funny I mean if you'd ask
people what would you do with a basic
income 99% of all people say don't worry
about me I've got dreams of got
ambitions you know maybe I'm gonna quit
that meaningless job of mine and I'm
gonna you know contribute something to
society that I really care about but
then if you ask them what what other
people do the basic income invasive no
other people although probably wasted so
their houses watch TV yeah you know
we've been brainwashed about what other
people are like it's been such a
pleasure and I really thank you for
joining me today thanks for having me
this is conversations with Richard
Pfizer ABC radio
Rutger Bregman Spock is called utopia
for realists and I spoke to him last
week and since then it's been revealed
in Hillary Clinton's new book that she
was considering proposing a universal
basic income at the 2016 presidential
election but she didn't
