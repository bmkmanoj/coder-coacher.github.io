think it's we're gonna have a very
interesting evening tonight and I wanted
to start off by telling you a little bit
about the origin of this the idea for
this this talk and what its what its
leading to over the next couple of days
so we had very wonderful interaction
myself jennifer doudna with bill Hurlbut
who's sitting over there from Stanford
and realized that there was an
opportunity to get together and discuss
the ethics of of genome editing in a
particular human genome editing and we
wanted to do this in a puttin it with
starting off with a very public lecture
with someone who really represents a
real leader and and thinker in the field
and so we were fortunate to have
sponsorship for this by the Templeton
Foundation so we're very grateful to
them and it's a really a great pleasure
and honor tonight to be able to
introduce our keynote speaker for this
evening George Church so let me tell you
a little bit about George he's almost
someone that doesn't need introduction
but but there's there's really a lot to
say about him so he received his PhD
from at Harvard in 1984 and then he
joined the Harvard faculty in 1986 and I
think I would
I met him around that time when I was a
I was a graduate student in a very
different field but you couldn't help
but be aware of George and his big
thinking and his incredible ideas and in
those days you know he is he was
starting to do work on DNA sequencing
and thinking about how you analyze
organisms from the level of the whole
genome he his name has really become
synonymous I would say with the field of
genomics he pioneered the first direct
genome sequencing method and over the
years he's made many incredible
developments and discoveries that have
led to technologies for genome
engineering and genome manipulation he's
the currently he's the director of a
center of excellence for genome science
he's advised the government on policies
and biosafety personal genetics and
precision medicine and he's authored
over 400 papers
and also a book Regenesis which a number
of us we're fortunate to have him sign
for us tonight and you know I think that
he's someone who's just been a real
inspiration over the last couple of
decades in the field someone who's
always sort of thinking beyond what what
the rest of us are doing and thinking
about in science and really trying to
ask where are we going in the future and
that's really the topic I think for
tonight and I'm very excited about his
title which is future human nature
reading writing revolution I don't know
quite what he's going to tell us but I
know it's going to be very interesting
George were delighted to have you here
well it's great to be here and this is
my conflict of interest slide and if
it's been up there for a while but if it
goes by too fast it's on my website as
well and transparency I think is an
important part of we technologists who
take an interest in the ethics side of
these things and and I just want to make
a special thank you here to this
organization personal genetics education
which was initiated by ting woo a close
colleague and and my wife in 2005 and
this this is where we were at the off
Science Technology Policy OSTP and also
Congress that same day giving what
briefing not not lobbying but briefing
on genetics which we do on a regular
basis PG had also teaches high school
teachers and they visit especially
underrepresented and underserved
communities are throughout the United
States mainly and then they work with
screenwriters for TV and films to try to
get the facts straight so and this is a
picture of map IDI where people will
mark that they have some that they will
take a test and show they have some
knowledge of genetics this kind of fun
anyway Jennifer was at the congressional
briefing and and we were had the
pleasure of being with her when she got
her Gairdner award in Canada at which
she then donated the PGA Tour's so we
were extremely grateful to her
generosity so I'm gonna start with a
little audience participation we'll have
some at the end as well so I think most
of you I'm just I'm gonna take a guess
that most of you feel that human
genomics is not useful and and I will
ask you to raise your hand if you have
your human genome sequenced you don't
have to have it with you but if you have
it ever had a sequence raise your hand
well that's actually quite a lot I
expect from well-educated that I want
the whole sequence sorry I mean 95 I'll
settle for 95% since a dirty little
secret is that no one has ever had their
genome completely sequenced anyway so if
I'm gonna make the argument that it
might be useful and if what's it useful
for I will make the argument later on
that you need to know your genome in
order to edit it
that may sound shocking to some of you
but these are some of the things that
you can do it with preconception genetic
counseling this is something that does
not necessarily put embryos at risk you
can diagnose very serious diseases like
Tay Sachs there there are hundreds of
them now that are highly predictive and
actionable in the sense that you can
marry somebody based on that information
and that may seem a little unromantic to
some of you so there are in vitro
fertilization diagnostics and prenatal
non-evasive testing and so on
there's newborn testing which many
people are shocked to find out that that
their children and sometimes they Moute
were genetically analyzed for up to
forty diseases that are actionable
usually something like dietary then
there's what's called a genetic Odyssey
where you have a child that has a
developmental delay or some other
problem and you go from physician to
physician trying to figure out what went
wrong and very often the parents blame
themselves and just finding out what
went wrong
at a finding an explanation in the DNA
is a great relief that to the parents
even if there is not a cure it just
means that they didn't cause it and so
anyway the light.the the list goes on
and I think there's an opportunity here
for preventive medicine very often we're
talking about the cure for this the cure
for that
what about prevention i'ma just give two
quick examples this is a and you'll
notice that I actually show pictures of
patients and I name their names and
you'll think oh how can he be talking to
us about ethics if honest
you know first slide he's showing John
Lauer men as a patient and the answer is
that we run a study where we have where
we make sure that they are educated and
that they know what they're getting into
and part of that is if you participate
in medical research the chances are that
your data will become public and you
will be reified in fact it's quite
likely that all of your medical records
whether you're in a medical study or not
is already in somebody else's hands that
you don't want because your medical
records are worth 20 times on the black
market your credit card and if you're
interested I can explain why so that's
and so in this case John Lauer Minh was
a an author for Bloomberg and he
discovered in the process of our study
Personal Genome Project that he had a
jak2 mutation which was not germline it
was it was in his blood
and he and it turned out that that he
had reported that he was healthy but we
we found out in his medical records that
he had scotoma as in his eye and leg
pain and so he takes aspirin for life
not too bad here's another one who you
know really did a wonderful thing for
the world in being quite open about her
brca1 genetics and then get and then
talking about the decision about whether
to trust the genetics and take a
preventive met medicine here a lot of
people people think that Angelina Jolie
had a lump or some positive result in an
x-ray this was entirely based on her
genome she was said to have 87 percent
chance of breast cancer before she had
surgery and less than 5 percent
afterwards so that's an example of
preventive medicine not reactive now
this is a list that you'll see a few
times during this talk this is my
personal ethics list these are dated in
the order they appeared in my life
they're not necessarily significant or
logical in any other way
and they represent ethical things that
I've dealt with and I teach a course in
ethics by the way it's a required course
at Harvard Medical School for the
graduate students and we talk about some
of these things and we're not going to
cover all of them today but the first
one I want to talk about is and it's
been throughout my career not just in
1974
is this idea that when a scientist
stands up here like this and talks to
you and talks with animation let's say
about a subject that means that he is or
she is advocating that subject that he
is an enthusiast if I were to talk to
you about let's say Neanderthals then
you will all conclude that I and have an
active program to clone the inner Thals
this is not this case or should not be
the case I should be able to discuss
topics that I think from my point of
view are alarming or in it possibly in a
negative sense and I can say it with
animation without being an advocate or
an enthusiast and so to that end I have
been co-author on about 30 some articles
on the topic of ethical legal social
issues something that you know I've been
very privileged to have very close
relationship with Jean tain once off for
example who is embedded in our
laboratory as a as a bioethicists and
very often I we seek solutions to the
polarization that often happens in these
where you were looking for a win-win
where a week and you'll see some
examples on this list as we go through
them for example that you know for the
the win/win for embryonic stem cell
pluripotent stem cells was induced
pluripotent stem cells that was
something that satisfied most of the
argumentative groups on both sides not
every men so let's talk about equality
as something that often comes up at the
end of a long meeting like this one that
you know Saturday afternoon it would
come up well what about equality you
know all this great technology and I'd
like to have this conversation start
with some of the tough problems and so
let's start with that and of course I'm
going to give you quirky view on it and
take it for what it's it's worth so what
is the revolution we're talking about
here I said reading writing and
revolution you could say that's that's
my version of math but what is the
revolution here and of course we all
know the revolution is crisper but I
think that the I'm not going the normal
acronym none of those letters have
anything to do with the CRISPR
technology that we're all enamored of
that we're all fixated on it is so I'm
gonna give you a couple other words that
I think better capture what the
revolution is and it has many components
not just nucleases but the idea of
comprehensive data biology or molecular
biology used to be the anecdote the
single gene single base pair but now
comprehensive data is a possibility and
often insisted upon we have
recombination not just cutting but
actually cutting and splicing and making
exactly what you want
we have informatics we have sequencing
we have pluripotency that is to say that
you can go from a single engineered DNA
molecule into a whole organism plant or
animal and we have reduced costs greatly
reduced cost and that's what the next
two slides are about and for you know
for some of these things I know this
broad audience some of these pictures
will be you know inappropriate they will
be complex just think of them as eye
candy so I'm not even gonna explain what
I just showed you but I like the Novus
seek instrument that's the newest of the
next generation sequencing it's named
after my granddaughter whose name is
Nova anyway it's just kidding
uh-uh so her name really is Nova but
anyway we have this exponentially
shrinking cost of reading interpreting
your genome so
after I had been obsessed with this for
a long time in fact I've been obsessed
AddThis ever since I left sung-ho Kim's
lab we who's here in the audience when I
was 20-something years old and and
shortly thereafter we could eat before
that we couldn't even conceive of the
project but when we finally started
delivering it looked like there's going
to be three billion dollars which is
about the price of this tallest building
in the world and then it's come down
ever since then it's been about a
thousand dollars for over a year and in
a certain sense it will be free soon in
the same sense that that phone has on it
free software you Google Maps they used
to charge for it and now it's free and
then in fact many people in our project
get their genome for free and so this is
the these are the curve sees the more
technical versions occurs and the the
thing that is most striking so this is
factors of 10 on the y-axis and it goes
back to almost the time that I started
doing molecular biology and it was on a
Moore's Law curve which is a very very
steep exponential for computers it's
going very fast but then it got even
faster in 2003-2004 so what was going on
there we'll talk about that in the next
slide but this is for both reading and
writing DNA I would say that reading has
improved over 3 million fold during that
period of time most of it in the last
few years and writing a short oolagah
nucleotide says improve by a billion
fold over that same period of time a
billion fold and I think that both of
them could improve by another maybe a
thousand to a million full don't ask me
when and don't don't remind me when it
doesn't happen but anyway that's my
guess and so far we've all heard under
predicted it rather than over predicted
it so what happened in 2003 2004 I will
give a totally self-centered and
self-serving synopsis which is that
these two papers we figured out how to
miniature
multiplex and self-assembly could be
used and biology should be really good
at this sort of thing at it is
atomically precise which is about as
miniature as you can get and it does a
lot of self-assembly and so we just
captured that along with the revolution
and bio and story and Nana in
electronics industry of micro
fabrication in both reading and writing
and the the key thing here to take away
is you can't do one without the other
our our most popular sequencing method
is literally called sequencing by
synthesis and every time we do synthesis
or editing of a genome the clued end
people do know the genome that they're
editing you shouldn't be editing a
genome that you don't know although you
can you know just like you can you can
text and drive a car at the same time
there is just as I've been impertinent
enough to redefine CRISPR um be
blasphemous enough to say that there is
more than one editor in the world there
are nine editors and what editor these
molecular machines do is they scan your
genome which for humans this is six
billion base pairs looking for one place
that they like 120 mer 20 ACS use in 200
a row that the Machine likes and making
either a cut or a combination at that
point how does do that how does it fine
one and six billion well the scan head
the the place where the action occurs
where that recognition of 20 base pairs
out of six billion occurs is either DNA
in red or RNA in in blue which which is
what CRISPR uses cast nine or therefore
these protein to do the recognition so
you have watson-crick base pairs that
are doing the scanning for DNA and RNA
and proteins have more complicated but
at this point very well understood rules
and you can you can dial them up and so
that brings us to the next question why
is everyone so infatuated with CRISPR
why do we
think that that's an improvement at all
and a lot of people say well it's really
easy to use in its low cost and that's
the reason that we have exalted it to
you know such a high status I will say
that maybe and but maybe not because
about about the time that we were
starting to publish this deluge of
crispr papers were the first few had
come out this lovely paper came out from
Junsu Kim's lab where they with with
very little fanfare assembled an
alternative CRISPR nucleus that
so-called Talon accounted for all of the
almost all of the protein coding genes
so eight over 18,000 of them so it can't
have been that hard to do even though it
wasn't CRISPR I realized this an
anecdote but there you have it that
though that was the previous technology
and its day in the Sun only lasted about
a year Christopher has lasted now of
Wapping you know four years in the Sun
and it may it may it may last forever
maybe the only edit that maybe the last
editing method but this is kind of the
history of I could write the same thing
for genome sequencing a very complicated
plot of a whole series of replacements
but in this case it starts with
homologous recombination in mammalian
cells with Oliver Smithies and Mario
Kikuchi and some people ask who's gonna
get the Nobel Prize for genome editing
and I say it's already been given to
Mario capetti and Oliver Smithies I mean
that's very silly of me to say so but
but the point is there is some progress
but there's also a lot of you know this
is again factors of 10 on all axis
there's a lot of constancy in the
editing efficiency but I think it's the
editing efficiency that is what we are
celebrating here with CRISPR now to be a
party-pooper again
there is if you're going to be applying
CRISPR especially in a clinical setting
where you're where you're treating a
large number of human cells
simultaneously if any one of them gets
an off target event and most drugs have
some kind of off target event if you
have an off target with CRISPR and it
lands in the middle of a tumor
suppressor gene then you you run a risk
of getting a tumor and so you want the
off target at least in two men
suppressor exons to be as low as
possible
and I'm not going to go through them but
there's a whole bunch of and this list
doesn't isn't even give it justice
there's a large number of articles that
have improved the specificity of CRISPR
at least in certain stat contexts and
one of them even claims from my group
that that you can detect single
nucleotide polymorphisms this jargon
snip you can detect you can make a
CRISPR that will up recognize one be off
by one nucleotide and you can do this
fairly routinely it was published in you
know the first ranked Journal called by
archive and I urge you all to publish
there and you'll see a few other
references like that but even as we
bring down the the off target as low as
possible the more changes you make the
more risks you have and they multiply
out so even if you have an error rate of
10 to the minus 4 let's say which is
among the lowest that you can get one
error in in 10,000 cells if you're
treating a billion cells that's a lot of
errors so that's off target errors what
about on target errors these believe it
oh these are ethical issues ok these are
these are safety and efficacy issues
most mostly safety but on target CRISPR
is not ideal in fact none of the
nucleases that have been used the mega
nucleus is the talons the zinc finger
nucleases because they create a race
situation a race between repairing the
double strand break and hoping for the
best where the cell makes a mess which I
call genome vandalism rather than
editing
and what you want very often which is to
make a precise change again there are
solutions to that and my two favorite
are from bacteriophages in fact CRISPR
itself is something that involves
bacteriophages most of the gifts that on
slides I've been mentioning most of the
technologies were not invented in the
sense that we thought about the atoms
from first principles and said oh I'm
going to design a CRISPR they are gifts
they're gifts from the microbial world
and these two are as well and these work
the specificity that we want on target
by not making a double strand break but
by only bringing to you only once they
bring together the donor DNA that you
want to change and their target then
they do their job and these are not
these are not as applicable as CRISPR
you don't go out and sell your CRISPR
stock they they are very specialized in
fact one of them the beta recombinase
here only works in e.coli k12 you might
say that's coincidental coli k12 is my
favorite organism I'm sure you're all
saying that right now even the non
scientists you love e.coli k12 but
anyway but we've done arguably one of
the world's largest and most radical
genome engineering and I think in this
case radical is a good thing maybe where
we changed a four million base pairs in
ohm to eliminate one codon so all of the
organisms in the world synthetic and
natural use 64 triplet codons so ACGT to
the third power except for this one this
one only uses 63 and we expected it to
be useful for four things and in fact it
is useful for four things it uses
non-standard amino acids very
efficiently meaning we're not no longer
restricted with the amino acids of
nature we can put in completely
chemically synthesize amino acids it is
genetically and metabolically isolated
so here's an ethics
lesson and I hope you haven't missed
this is biocontainment if we're going to
release something into the wild we want
or if we're gonna make any new
technology we want to have a reverse
button we want to have we want to have
some ability to to go back and so that's
what this is and we've proven it and
then finally multi viruses and I think
that's very profound sort of
philosophically as well as practically
which is the idea that you could make an
organism resistant to all viruses
including viruses you've never studied
and that you don't understand as long as
they follow one rule which is that they
use the genetic code of the host if you
change the genetic code of the host they
say hey what's up it's not working you
know and they can't and it's radical
enough that they can't even evolve
around it that's a theoretical
prediction and it looks like it's
turning out to be very very likely we
were surprised how multi virus resistant
these organisms were with just one code
on change and now we're doing seven
we're gonna jump now from that radical
recoding that radical application of
something that goes beyond editing we
call it genome project right variation
on genome project read which is the
first genome project this is writing the
whole genome beyond editing we're gonna
change to engineering humans we're going
to go into this gently we're gonna start
with something that that's probably not
controversial which is engineering human
cells for Diagnostics for their testing
therapeutics for testing hypotheses when
you we started this as exercise as to
why you would want your human genome if
you get your human genome some things
are highly predictable but other things
are variants of unknown significance if
you get one of those variants of unknown
significance you'd like to know how do i
how do I make it determine whether it's
harmful or not and this is a new way of
doing it which is you can alter a genome
by one base pair or however
many of the difference is let's say well
as little as one and then you can make
it into a complex tissue or organ or you
you know modestly called organoids and
then test whether that the function has
changed you can test cause and effect
you no longer need a cohort of 10,000 to
prove you know you don't need to collect
gigantic human population samples to get
a correlation which is not convincing
you can do cause and effect as long as
you have convinced yourself that you're
changing one base pair and that you've
got a good organ model doesn't involve
animals it involves actual human organs
and so in this case we start at the very
top there with PGP one which is code
name for personal genome project which
I've already introduced number one full
disclosure per the the individual number
one and I think I said I can release the
names of the participants is not John
Lauer Minh but it's me and so we
sometimes call me guinea pig number one
GP one and you take those cells switch
your fibroblasts turn them into stem
cells turn the stem cells put in the
crisper cast nine and then use that with
a repair all ago to to take out that one
G if you leave out the repair all ago it
makes a mess that vandalizes the DNA but
if you put that in you can change just
that one G and and you say well I've
been talking to you about off target on
target messes you expect me to believe
you just change one G in the genome out
of six billion and the answer is we
sequence the genome this is a clonal
cell line so this is embryonic stem
cells here's an important lesson is that
even if you have off target if you have
a clonal where you've grown it up from a
single cell you can sample that clone
and show that it is extremely unlikely
have anything off target in this case
this baby was hypothesized I mean in
some cases you might have hundreds of
hypothetical changes in this case the
most likely one was missing one G on a
sex chromosome boys have only one X
chromosome in every cell
every nucleated cell and in this case we
wanted to test that so we made two cell
lines from PGP one that went differed by
that one base fare there's a clean
experiment if we just compare yourselves
to mine or this baby's to mine there'd
be 3 million differences that's not a
clean experiment but changing one base
pair is and so Lu Han yang who did this
work thought nothing didn't even bother
to consult me as to whether she should
sequence the genome and that's how we
route what we routinely do we change one
base pair sequence all six billion okay
and so then this is AA just example of
these cardiac like tissues with the
beautiful saw repeating sarcomere
organization when you have a normal stem
cell again from PDP one on the far left
here and then change one base pair and
it's abnormal physiology biochemistry
and morphology so you can determine
cause in effect and if you run this in
Reverse you have gene therapy so now we
get to more serious that was genetically
modified human cells and human organ
nodes
this is you know actually genetically
modified humans and some people are
surprised to hear that there are
genetically modified humans running
around these are there are 2,300
clinical trials research trials on gene
therapy there is only one approved
ironically in Europe where they're not
keen on eating genetically modified
foods but they're okay who is uniquely
modified humans and this is the most
expensive drug in history it is a
million dollars a dose now to somebody
like me who likes bringing down the cost
of things by a million to a billion fold
this is unacceptable and we have various
strategies that you can we can talk
about how to bring that down the main
thing is increasing the market size but
the problem is a lot of these are orphan
drugs they are very very tiny market
size but there are some like infectious
diseases that will have gigantic markets
and that will bring
the cause so now we get even edgier so
he went from human cell engineering to
organoids to human gene therapy which
typically is done in adults or in some
cases children you have to do some cases
the earlier the better because for
example if you cure blindness which is a
real thing it happens in gene therapy
you have to do it at a certain age
otherwise they'll see photons but they
won't be able to see faces and processed
faces and you can imagine taking this
further and further back you would want
to engineer in utero or earlier so what
is the status of human germline therapy
some people take it for granted that
this will never happen it doesn't happen
anywhere and it is not allowed anywhere
that is very far from true it is
permissible in many countries including
the United States human cloning is
actually permissible in the United
States but the question is not just what
is permissible whether it's acceptable
and it is already done so again here's
showing a real real patient this girl in
the middle had mitochondrial germline
now some people say oh that's not really
germline well but it is it's passed on
to her children
most of these therapies are to reverse a
problem and I think you can either think
of it as a slippery slope if you think
in negative terms or as the way of
carefully testing without putting too
many people or embryos at risk is it
will start with it will it will move on
from mitochondrial therapy to sperm
infertility or you'll be reversing
you'll be changing men with certain
kinds of infertility genetic traits to
fertile and if you could do that by just
engineering the soma the somatic cells
around the sperm then that would be
considered ordinary somatic gene therapy
meaning not affecting norm line but
since it is a sperm itself this effect
in these then you have to at least
reverse it now you're just changing it
to what everybody else has but that will
probably happen and if it happens in
clones like the clone that I showed you
your cardiac muscle you could in
principle get something that's close to
100%
correct Nords it has all the low error
rate of crisper plus all the low error
rate of checking the clone by sequencing
so this could possibly make it in the
fertility clinics and then if that works
well no embryos have really been put at
risk there then it would be but any more
so than any other medical procedure and
then then you could move on might the
world might move on with due
consideration Duke conversations like
the one we're having here two serious
diseases like Tay Sachs which I said
right now is handled with either
abortion or in vitro fertilization where
abortion you might sacrifice 25% of the
children that are that are born with the
recessive disease like Tay Sachs and
with IVF you might sacrifice more like
80% of the embryos so some of them will
be normal but they won't be implanted
and for a large fraction of the United
States and the world that loss of
embryos is unacceptable so this might be
so usually the way this conversation is
phrased almost every conversations I've
been in is we are putting embryos at
risk in this scenario where actually
could be saving embryos putting fewer
embryos at risk than current medical
practice so I just put that out there
and then finally also note that now
there is great progress in making eggs
and sperm entirely outside of the body
mostly done in rodents so far so let's
okay so we've gone from human cells
human organs adult humans therapy
germline therapy which is past tense now
let's talk about enhancement I'm not
doing this just to be provocative I
think it's important to visualize things
in advance even if they never arrive we
need to talk about it and I'm gonna make
the argument so here are some of the
traits that you might want to enhance in
human beings or not theirs it might be
the sort of thing you want to prevent
the world from enhance
we right now can only see a very tiny
sliver of a visible light with our eyes
we can only hear a limited range we can
only sense certain chemicals and the
list goes on
touch each sensing in our memory is very
limited we locomote very slowly and so
forth but we are already augmented we
are almost unrecognizable to our ancient
ancestors our ancestral limits have been
blown away we can essentially see the
entire electromagnetic spectrum from
gamma rays to radio and the list goes on
I think you get the point we can go so
fast that we can escape we can reach
escape velocity from the earth and then
it survive in the vacuum of space and
the extremely cold 15 degrees Kelvin out
there we have greatly augmented and in
fact our goals like being able to go
into space and survive and the vacuum
and cold would be incomprehensible to
our ancestors so I will argue that most
of the augmentation that already that
will exist and already exists is physics
and chemistry it is not genetics if we
are to talk about genetics it probably
will be intelligence immunity and
longevity or aging reversal and much of
the ethics that we will talk about will
we may talk about other things but if we
get to something that's safe and
effective there's a tendency to drop the
conversation for example in vitro
fertilization was considered very
negatively it was described negatively
with terms like test-tube baby Justin
baby doesn't sound as negative today as
it did back in the in the 60s but it is
but when Louise Brown was born and she
was healthy and beautifully healthy
suddenly the FA
turned around almost 180 degrees where
it went from we should never create the
monsters of test-tube babies which could
be teratogenic like too we should not
deprive parents of the of their right to
have babies of their own that is the
product of the union of two people that
love each other but there are things
beyond safety and efficacy we might drop
them if safety and efficacy is proven
but we need to be very cautious and
these include the possibility that
parents might treat their kids like
commodities they might say which in the
services they already do they get them
the best education and they expect them
to perform there are parents that will
be making choices where they choose to
have children that have hearing or do
not have hearing that have particular
genders in fact this is already if you
look at in vitro fertilization in the
United States a very common practice is
to choose a gender and guess what gender
that is 80% of the time female and I
don't know what your expectations were
but I was a little you know it's it's
it's there and I've seen editorials who
give reasons we can talk about that in
the discussion and the other thing that
will happen that we need to be very
cautious about which is not safety and
efficacy is this loss of neuro diversity
if you look in a classroom there is a
great desire to turn the classroom into
an exercise like Henry Ford's of mass
production where all the children sit in
neat rows dress the same way they showed
diversity in their skin color but no
diversity in their behavior and
appearance and if if somebody fidgets
too much or falls asleep this is a bad
thing you should medicate them and
believe me if you could genetically
medicate them that would be even that
would be that would be something we need
to be very cautious about because some
of our most amazing citizens are those
who are on the edge of some spectrum or
other I think we don't want to lose them
we might want to allow them to not be in
pain some of the time maybe to turn it
on and off but not lose them and it's
very hard to - we talk about diversity
but do we really mean it okay
GMOs how many people here shop at a
market that has the no GMO rule I do
geez this is you're not a radical
Berkeley crowd here okay or qb3
whatever I will argue that there are
some GMOs that nearly everyone likes
even the people that are anti GM foods
and here they are it's a longer list in
this but I picked a few here that that
are recombinant proteins that treat some
some of them fairly common diseases
others are orphan diseases so there is a
difference of opinion when you get the
things that are extreme health interest
and sometimes extreme economic interests
for example Hawaii they banned GMOs from
the entire set of islands except for
papayas because that was they the
papayas would have gone extinct so there
was some room for negotiation on that
subject I would argue the future of GMOs
and this is actually a report from one
of the non-gmo project groups is that
one of the main problems with genetic
engineering is that that you insert
genes randomly and that could create
toxins and allergens well actually
random mutations are definitely random
and we're getting better and better at
engineering that's not random so I would
argue that if you want to open a car
door you could shoot it with a random
shotgun fire or you could engineer a
handle and use it
so so we get two very interesting
definitional issues here this is not
technology it's possibly ethics which is
sis genex versus transgenics now
transgenics is a pretty commonly used
word and then almost is the definition
that people use for defining GMO GMO
plants and natural and organic is that
you have moved the gene between species
over a great distance and the distance
is actually defined in regulations how
how far apart the plants have to be
let's say sis Jenica is a much less
frequently used word so far but I think
you're going to see it more and more
because it is a regulatory if you think
of it generously is a regulatory
opportunity or a loophole if you think
less generously but there are 30 GMOs
already in the last five years alone
that that get through the USDA and to
some extent international regulations
because they're essentially they're
changing like one base pair you change
one piece here that could happen in
nature and it's very easy to tech the
transgenic because you got this whole
big chunk of DNA that came in from a
bacterium or some other plant but if you
change one base pair that could have
happened by the shotgun approach and you
just cleaned it up by conventional
genetics but and one of the famous
recent examples is the white button
mushroom where they knocked out a
particular gene in order to prevent
browning but an example of the
transgenic which surprisingly to me
should have passed should have gotten a
pass from the critics because it is a
matter of life and death it is not a
typical that the reason that the anti
GMO forces are justified for foods is it
really isn't a matter of life it it's
not even a matter of taste in most cases
there's some subtle thing off off campus
having to do with farmers but Golden
Rice actually affects millions of people
I mean our sorry the thing that's
addressing which is vitamin A deficiency
millions of people go blind
and I they they often die within a year
of going blind
it is a cause-and-effect relationship
and Golden Rice however this was started
back in if it was working by 2002 it
started well before that the decision
was made to make it transgenic it didn't
have to be transient I think I can't
prove this because beta carotene which
they're making is made already in rice
it's made in the wrong place in rice and
so sis genic Li you could move it but
instead they imported two genes from two
other organisms one of them a bacterium
or wynia so that's I don't know where
that's going to go I don't know where
Golden Rice but it's an example of
transgenic that did not escape even
though it's a major health threat now
here's something that is you could say
it's not beyond safety and efficacy it
is part of safety but it's not what the
FDA the USDA and the epa usually worry
about they worry about sort of like the
distant future which might be next
quarter or maybe ten years from now but
this is a hundred years and here's the
juicy example and hopefully many of you
know that in 1872 Yellowstone was
established and the gray roof grey wolf
was already in decline both in
Yellowstone and elsewhere and it was
completely gone by 1926 the Endangered
Species Act was the second such act and
it allowed reintroduction many years
later in 1995 it began and the impact of
the president of the reintroduction of
wolves was dramatic they the Elks didn't
like it they didn't get a vote but they
started killing a couple dozen elk per
year that result in the Willows coming
back which resulted in the beavers
coming back which resulted in otters
minks wading birds water fowl fish so
forth it was a really amazing impact on
the environment so we made a mistake
back in 1872 not established in
Yellowstone but getting rid of the
wolves
what if we're doing similar things today
but it's not sufficient to say oh well
well let's not change anything because
that can have negative effects as well
so let's talk about some some quicker
examples here here xenotransplantation
so this is even worse than transgenics
if you think transgenics are bad this is
moving organs from humans into pigs and
then pigs organs into humans and this
wasn't something like this was in the
news today and it was also in the news
many times here's one beautiful article
by Carl Zimmer on the topic we have some
skin in the game here but it goes way
back before I you was interested in it
which is this humanization of pigs goes
back at least two decades about 15 years
ago there was a a billion dollar
investment in this field and it died not
just what there was actually a pretty
good road map to changing multiple genes
I think they thought it was one or two
or three genes it's now probably 50
genes that need to be changed or more
but they had a road map what freaked
them out was that the pig organs were
producing viruses that could infect the
immune compromised recipient of those
organs and and that would be a bad thing
probably it would you know you don't
want to have swine flu crores the
equivalent evolving in your immune
compromised patient so so when we got
the awesome power of CRISPR lujan who is
one of the co-inventors many
co-inventors she decided to try she and
her team decided to try this getting rid
of all 62 and not just retro viral genes
from the genome of the pig all at once
with one CRISPR and it worked it was
actually pretty easy we were surprised
to how easy it was up to that point
people were doing one or two maybe three
genes at a time 62 just seemed
completely out out of out to lunch but
in 14 days sitting in the 37-degree
incubator that's all it took and then a
little bit of PCR to screen it and a
thing that and
and so now there are there are piglets
that we have ultrasounds on these things
where many many dozens of other genes
have been changed as well
and I look forward to seeing and
hopefully holding these piglets when
they are born but if they're not we will
we will try again and what excites me
about this is maybe a little more subtle
than the idea of curing the
transplantation problem which is very
acute it's not just that you and I
aren't compatible for exchanging organs
it's that there just aren't enough of us
to give organs but it's more than that
which is that would we produce organs we
are going to be highly motivated to do
preventative medicine which is to make
organs that are pathogen resistant
cancer resistant and Aging resistant we
are not quite so motivated to do that in
humans directly it is it was very hard I
think to get FDA approval to take a
healthy human and try to make them
resistant to pathogens cancer and aging
that preventive medicine is very hard to
do unless it just involves taking walks
into eating broccoli not something as
radical as gene therapy aging reversal
is is a real thing and we will see it
both for physical as well as cognitive
disorders because we have an aging
population and it will be extremely
important it I would imagine that many
of these things will be used off-label
to reverse aging and people who don't
have any disorders that are not disabled
do not have cognitive disorders but
here's an example there are two actually
two classes of example of aging reversal
has been shown in mice one of them
involves hooking up young mice with old
mice they're there blood systems I don't
recommend you do this with your children
but but this works and another one
that's just recently been published is
using the same reprogramming factors we
use to establish pretty potent stem
cells so you can do that on a whole
organism basis and it reverses Aging
gene drives gene drives was something
that was
hypothesized again about two decades ago
actually was observed in the 70s by
bernard dijon who was one of my mentors
as a graduate student but then
hypothesized that you could turn it into
a technology by austin burt but it
didn't go very far until the awesome
power CRISPR came along and Kevin s felt
and indeed spied ler here a graduate
student in my lab and shared with
familiar Uchiha published this paper
where we didn't do the experiment we did
we didn't do what they did with
gain-of-function flu viruses which was
to to not talk about it until it was
ready to publish we talked about it
before he did any experiments to see if
there was a gotchu that people told me
and to talk about ways to reverse it and
it can do all these amazing things you
know reverse invasive species and
reverse herbicide and pesticide
resistance and most importantly control
vector borne disease such as malaria and
Lyme disease nobody likes lyme disease
or malaria and what it does is unlike
normal inheritance where half of your
offspring will get will inherit the
trait here 100% of them inherit the
traits so it spreads exponentially
through the population and does this
time does not permit a long description
here but it does this by using CRISPR
which is mechanistically we you know if
scissors
it's basically scissors yeah the crystal
structure indicates that they're
scissors and and we put in many
different scissors up to 8 so far in the
mosquito experiments we're doing to make
sure that the the or the mosquito genome
doesn't become does not become resistant
the CRISPR gene Drive we're essentially
creating what would normally be called
selfish DNA but in this case it's being
altruistic it's doing what we want which
is to carrying the purple cargo there
purple cargo is resistance to malaria
we're not trying necessarily the wipe
out the mosquitos though some people
would like to do that but to make them
resistant to malaria with a whole
variety of known anti-malarial
antibodies and in small peptides
and those scissors are aimed at an
essential gene a ribosomal protein gene
for example so that if it repairs by
genetic vandalism it dies but if it
repairs by copying the gene drive making
two copies it lives that's the base
that's you can now tell anybody in the
elevator that you understand gene drives
I hope if not ask me but now here's the
sophisticated stuff on the top is how
fast it will spread this is mathematical
modeling which has been confirmed by
experiments in some animals sorry some
organisms and then we have a new one
which is again published in this amazing
high-profile journal called bio archive
where it's called a Jay Z Drive where we
have three drives CBA and none of them
are really gene drives in that they cut
themselves they cut the the part of the
genome they come from they cut the part
of the genome that the next one comes
from and this just trust me on this or
read the paper the yellow decays because
it is slightly deleterious and it has
nothing driving it
the orange lasts a little bit longer
because as the yellow driving it and
then the blue has yellow driving orange
driving blue and it persists longer but
this allows you to do geographically and
temporally controlled drive so we have
reversal and we have reverse and we have
drives that are local okay so what if we
cure aging and eliminate poverty and
diseases of developing nation we're
gonna have a problem which is
overpopulation or at least some people
say that and I stand and I don't think
it's a great solution to say oh well
then we're not going to cure diseases of
poverty or of aging which is a disease
of industrialized nation so one possibly
is going to space and I don't mean this
frivolously it is a possibility and it's
a good idea from our species standpoint
because we are at risk for
super volcanoes and asteroids but out in
space we have a new set of ethical
problems which is space radiation even
on Mars the gravity is very low and then
there's space genetics issues so we have
a consortium on this and here's some of
the challenges we have this gravity
Austria prosess there are all sorts of
neurobehavioral issues the radiation
issues microbiome issues I've made a
list of kind of a quirky list here
rather than rare disease causing genetic
changes these are rare protective
alleles and I won't go through the list
but they're things that make your bones
extra strong maybe that could could
result in something that would help with
osteoporosis in space or on earth and
there's some that reduce sensitivity to
pain which you might be able to turn on
and off rather having you don't want to
have it off all the time because you end
up hurting yourself and not knowing it
so little kids will like to on their
tongue and things like that and then
there are there ways that you can ABC 11
will give you low odor which is very
important in closed space where you're
all together and in fact is very common
allele among Asian populations of the
good version that is and the list goes
on and down at the bottom you start
getting into things that are so rare you
don't see them they're actually
synthetic and they've been tested in
animals and they include things that
have locate cancer and high ability at
cognitive tests what about radiation
resistant this seems really improbable
but here's a case in the literature that
where you can improve radiation
resistance up to a hundred thousand fold
with just four mutations and and there's
a wide variety a ssin among
naturally-occurring organism but this is
a nice experiment because it's isogenic
there's the only difference those four
mutations and then I'm just going to end
on this very speculative notion where
the normal surgery ward we have a choice
as to what we're going to take into
space are we going to take the entire
Noah's Ark including you know the Giants
Hoyas in the and the whales and the
malaria and smallpox and so forth or are
we going to leave something behind most
most notably germs and if we do then we
don't need to wash our hands for surgery
and if we can turn pain on and off we
don't need anesthesia so I just want to
thank a bunch of I'm thank the few along
the way but there's these people that
have helped in our center of genomic
engineered organs and we have some brain
initiative grants and the these are
photos from the annual get conference
for a Personal Genome Project where the
people whose identity we should be
keeping anonymous wear name tags thank
you questions or discussion actually
it looks like it's locked on maybe it's
on this on great so George Wow that was
wonderful um so what I think we're gonna
do is we'd like to have a have a
discussion and we'd like to invite
questions from the audience and we have
a couple of people that are running
around with microphones so if you have a
question if you could just put your hand
up and we'll bring you a microphone and
we'll open it up to the floor so I see I
see one over here thank you so much so
as a precision medicine continues to
grow
and we continue to use genome editing
technologies such as CRISPR what sort of
implications does this have on the
cumulative effect of off-target
mutations and say non-coding regulatory
regions for example if an off target
deleterious mutation occurs in the
germline new pathology is that we
haven't seen before and may arise and
perpetuate throughout the population
alright wait before you give up the
microphone clarification are you talking
about off target trying to fix something
yeah if you're trying to fix something
yeah and we don't know what sort of off
target effects these genome fully these
you know editing technologies have what
are sort of the ethical implications of
that yeah so this is ethics in the
category of safety and efficacy safety
mainly I mean the safest thing would be
to insist that you have nothing off
target at least with it detectable which
means you get the the CRISPR as low as
possible mainly due to computer analysis
and then and then you sequence the clone
now most gene therapies are not done on
clones they're done
you'll put you'll you'll treat a billion
T cells for example ex vivo and put them
back in the patient and so every one of
those is an independent event everyone
has a chance of being off target the
most serious things are probably giving
tumor suppressor genes and it probably
gonna be in tumor suppressor exons but
not all of them
and I guess it'll be like every other
drug is that will go through phase one
two three and even four phase four is in
the public and well when you start
finding things that actually cause
cancer then you will go back and fix it
but it will be very hard - it will be
very hard to prove it you certainly
can't use animal models because they
have a different backgrounds you know
which is the whole point it's off target
in a genome that is not a pig or a mile
steno so it's probably gonna have to be
tested in in humans but if you want to
know what a particular base pair does in
terms of cancer formation I would say
organoids are getting better and better
and then we should exploit those as much
as possible but right now organ I mean
if it's something that happens in 10 to
the ninth cells organizers are pretty
small they're they're limited to about a
half a millimeter we're getting we're
starting to get vascularized organoids
and those will be whatever size you want
so okay I see a hand there Thanks
you mentioned in one slide that one way
we could get to Janette germline
modification in humans is through
synthesizing new eggs or sperm from you
know embryonic stem cells and the like
but there are a lot of you know
mutations that are occurring in these
attempts in mice so far and I was
wondering how you see this progressing
how do you think it's doing and do you
think there's a lot more work to be done
before we see that working safely in
humans right so the mutations you're
probably referring to our patients occur
just from growing cells so if you look
at your body
it's full of mutations almost no two of
your cells have the same genome in fact
a lot of your cells are unemployed
they're missing or have an extra
chromosome so it's a lot of changes in
your body that doesn't mean that we
should glibly start creating germ cells
that have the same kind of me
you have in your body in fact the
standards should be much higher but it
is true that a huge fraction of human
births never make it to term or sorry
human conceptions never make it
determine probably a lot of that is that
they have mutations that are deleterious
to embryonic development so I you know I
think it's a huge challenge I mean you
hit the nail on the head it's not due to
CRISPR it's due to just growing cells
growing cells have a mutation rate of
about one or few mutations per cell
division and it's a little worse in Colt
cell culture than it is in vivo but it's
a problem both places so it's an open
question but hey that's the fun of being
a genetic engineer in this in 2017 so
maybe I'll just interject here and ask
you so I think you know during your talk
you presented a number of different
areas where genome editing and
engineering is going to have a big
impact in the future and and I wonder
what you what do you think is the is the
first you know area where we're gonna
see this kind of impact is it going to
be in transplantable organs is it going
to be in a clinical benefit to patients
or maybe something else well here's
here's where I can cheat by saying that
just focusing on what we already have so
we already have genetic genome editing
for ccr5 and treating patients with HIV
infections that already have HIV in fact
not preventive and that's done with zinc
finger nucleases we also have treatment
involving car t-cells or cancer
therapies so it's it's a pretty safe
prediction that those are at least going
to make it through serious clinical
trials well some of them are already in
Phase two clinical trials I think
applications to infectious diseases
beyond HIV is going to be a major place
where you can get larger populations so
that's a fairly safe that as well but
you know the the orphan drugs have been
the northen drug Act has made it
affordable
two companies by getting reimbursable
huge you know a regular orphan drug
might be hundreds of thousands of
dollars per year and if you can do that
with one dose and that's that could
conceivably save money so that I think
that's where we're going yeah I see
thanks so much for coming here George I
was super happy to see animal rights on
your on your list there but then I was a
little confused when you brought up sort
of growing organs in in pigs
I was surprised not to see sort of a
straight jump to like in vitro organ
growing is there is there a reason for
that it seems like some sort of conflict
so yeah that's a very accurate well I
mean observant people wonder how I can
be a vegan and also allow one of my
postdocs to go off and start a company
on making transplantable organs you know
a fairness we are trying very hard to
get organs to develop in in the lab I
showed an example of an organ I'd which
is a cardiac muscle and I think we're
one of the first labs that has
vascularized organs growing in the lab
and and we that allows you to pump blood
for them and get larger and more
realistic ones I'm just worried that if
given a choice but if everybody stopped
eating pigs tomorrow for all reasons
that would or hurting them that would be
great but this is a drop in the bucket
compared to bacon I'm not wild about it
you probably aren't either but it's a
it's a temporary we don't know if we can
deliver organs accurately entirely in
the lab I think we can but until we're
sure that millions of people are dying
for lack of organs it's it's a very it's
a example of a very tough ethical
decision of whether a pig's life is
anywhere
close to to human life and and that pig
would what could save ten human lives
because you've got all the you know
heart liver lungs kidneys and test and
so on
I am very I apologize in advance I see
one in the hand in the back there
doctors in illegitimate analogy to say
that aging and cancer and some of these
diseases are the Yellowstone wolf and
humans are the Yellowstone elk and
should there be any of the pathogens or
something that should be not addressed
prevented etc by genetic manipulation
yeah that's a excellent question in fact
there are experiments that so some
people feel that that you need we've got
to this sudden infatuation with the
microbiome there's a lot of microbiome
products I'm involved in five microbiome
therapy companies but the fact is we
don't need our microbiome for life there
have been almost every animal ever
experimental animal goats chickens and
even humans have grown without any
noticeable microbiome they nevertheless
they're very helpful so you can you get
certain less than lethal diseases that
can be cured with careful carefully
chosen species of microbes there and and
for awhile people thought it was just
good bacteria so-called good bacteria
but there are actually now shown that
you can do some of this also with
viruses like norovirus so I think we
have deep ignorance that hopefully will
be fixed very soon as we move from
merely observing the human microbiome to
doing therapeutic experiments and
experiments on germ-free mice but it's
it's it's a great question and wealth
well put in terms of the wolves
maybe you could edit the human
microbiome well you can you you can edit
the human microphone but I think there's
a assumption that that is pretty healthy
out there you just have to get the right
one it has been shown that you can
confer obesity and diabetes be a
microbiome to germ-free mice so you want
to be very careful and even with
naturally occurring microorganisms hi
you discussed human enhancement through
genetic modification and I was wondering
if you could give us like some examples
of what is in our reach right now and
which kind of human modifications would
be more challenging right so so I listed
a lot of things that sometimes people
list is on their wish list you know so
called you know post human or
transhumanists but most of those can be
handled with physics and chemistry quite
adequately I would I would not say that
I would want to change my genome so that
I could fly into space without a space
suit but I what I listed I thought that
are possible not addressed by physics
and chemistry alone our longevity
immunity and cognitive behavioral traits
some of these will be addressed in
adults through right conventional
therapies there's there you can already
see some conventional therapies that
treat some of these you know caffeine
metformin these sorts of things and
there's and there's it's hard to raise
an ethical issue when you're talking
about small molecule drugs or probably
if you have a safe and effective gene
therapy applied to an adult human being
and so I think that a lot of the red
lines that we draw I'm not a big fan of
drawing red lines ethical I think I'm a
fan of having strong discussions and
algorithms but it's much more
complicated than a red line and the red
lines that are drawn about you know
worrying about embryo manipulation
artists
interacting us from real issues so if
you manipulate an embryo let's say to be
enhanced for cognitive it's gonna be 20
years before you see any impact of that
on society while if you can change an
adult cognitively that could spread in
weeks through the internet everybody is
doing do it yourself gene therapy on
their brain I mean that sounds ludicrous
but we live in a time of exponential
change and I personally know several
people that are already doing
do-it-yourself gene therapy on
themselves these are not wealthy
individuals either I'm not encouraging
you to do this okay but I'm just
reporting that there are people are
doing this if look at the latest MIT
tech review for example okay let's take
one or two more questions over here hi
so I'm sure you're aware that the vast
majority of diseases are actually
epigenetic in nature and not genetic and
so because epigenetics is so
multifactorial it depends on things like
stress in your diet and lifestyle should
we really be using this has a genetic
engineering has a crutch I'm instead of
altering lifestyle or cleaning up the
environment and things like that yeah so
the you know the question is how many of
these things can be fixed by life
lifestyle and diet and tay-sachs to take
an exam an extreme example is probably
hard to fix with lifestyle and diet it
is a genetic disease that is what pretty
well understood and there's hundreds
like it for diabetes on the other hand
is something that is an epidemic and it
is probably environmental and lifestyle
and and it could be microbiome it might
have a fix that has nothing to do with
human genetics it has to do with
environment include if you include your
microbiome as part of your environment
so yeah I think we should take a deep
breath and make sure that we're not
using you know bazooka when we could use
a flyswatter but but not everything's
gonna be that easy
there's one way in the back there oh
okay yes please
yeah way in the back and then we'll come
here and then we'll be we'll wrap it up
yeah
please in the back hey I know you said
not to ask this but I'm still very
curious what do you think are the
advances required to actually make the
next sleep in read and write to get the
thousand or a million fold improvement
I'm gonna ask you to just restate that
so I make sure I get it right you know
oh in at one point you're talking you're
mentioning that you thought that we
could still make a thousand or you know
a million fold in our ability to read
and write and I'm just curious what are
the enabling technologies you think that
are required to make that leap yeah so
if you had asked me in 2003 or let's say
at the beginning of that plot you know
how we were gonna get a billion fold
improvement I might have said very
glibly miniaturization multiplexing and
self-assembly but that's not a recipe if
I had a recipe in the 1980s
you know things would be different but
roughly speaking I give you an example
that we are actively pursuing is right
now
DNA synthesis is done by organic
chemistry phosphoramidites it takes
three minutes to add a base you can do
many in parallel but it takes three
minutes to do each of those in parallel
while biochemistry polymerases can go up
to a hundred thousand times faster than
that
that's not a recipe but it's a it's an
indication of where one can go and and
that and that speed turns into cost
because the equipment whatever whatever
the parallelism is however you're
directing the pixels in an array the
cost of that machine has to be amortized
though before it's you know over a
period of years and in the more cycles
you can get per year the better so if
that's that's a factor of 10 to the
fifth for example for example
yeah that's a question in the friend
here please thank you I really enjoyed
the talk and so machine learning and
deep learning has really impacted
biomedical research for example in
medical imaging algorithms being able to
identify cancers as effectively or more
effectively than doctors I'm wondering
in your opinion what sort of
applications you see for deep learning
machine learning even artificial
intelligence in genetic engineering why
so the question is about deep machine
learning in biology in general and I
think this simple hopefully not too glib
answer is everything almost everything
that we currently do could be augmented
by machines I've you know I've gone on
record as saying that human intelligence
is has a lot of advantages over machines
with we're that's a 20-watt computer
while Watson the jeopardy winner machine
is 85,000 watt brain but putting aside
small human chauvinist comments like
that I think that that the deep learning
it has a huge promise in biology and
there's going to be a little loop so for
example we have a grant from the part of
the brain initiative from AI ARPA where
we're analyzing a cubic millimeter of
visual cortex with amazing set of tools
for calcium imaging and behaving a live
behaving animal and getting the
connection wiring diagram for that
activity map to synapse level resolution
in order to and this is the goal of the
IRP project to help the machine learning
community to handle complex visual tasks
like self-driving cars viewing faces and
security footage and so forth because
these are not solve problems in their
community and so so there would be a
virtuous cycle where they help us read
out the brain and then what we read out
the brain can help them with their
algorithms and through that
two times and it'll be amazing well up
it's probably a good place to stop but
thank you very much to the audience for
your for your your great questions and
George I just like to say that I think
you you're setting a wonderful example
as a scientist who is not only thinking
about the future and kind of bringing it
about and going there going there with
with appropriate caution but you're also
coming out of the lab and you're talking
about it publicly and I think that's we
need more of that so I really applaud
you for that and thank you for giving us
a fantastic evening here Thank You
