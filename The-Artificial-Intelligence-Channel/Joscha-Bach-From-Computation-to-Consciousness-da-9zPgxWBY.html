the last or the best contribution of the
last century to the sciences was the
discovery of the concept of computation
computation treats arbitrary systems as
sets of discernible differences the
fancy name for discernible differences
and science is information and we can
group these discernible differences in
States and then can describe an
arbitrary systems by how these states
change and the way they change is
usually described with some kind of
transition function and the description
of a system using a transition function
and States is the most general way to
capture the notion of computation
digital computation is a very special
case and detrol computation the states
are discrete and the rules for the state
change are deterministic of our
ballistic we can use this language of
description to describe any system that
presents itself to an observer as a set
of discernible differences for instance
the universe or the observer itself so
if we look at these different computers
what kind of computer would we need to
run the universe at the moment you don't
know that but imagine I describe the
universe as a set of a disassembled
differences observations that I can make
and how these change into the next state
and I would want to build a computer
that can run our universe and I want to
buy the cheapest computer that I can get
available what would I need to look at
in order the cheapest one I could buy is
probably something like a very big
computer like this one just this much
much more memory it's a finite state
machine it's discrete and so on way more
memory speed doesn't matter if you live
inside of it of course because you won't
notice if it's slow or fast when you are
inside it could be probabilistic which
means you can branch between the states
with some probability function or it
could be a quantum computer in which
each state can be a superposition of
states or maybe this is not enough and
maybe we need something like the one of
the three versions if I just mentioned
with infinite amounts of memory this is
going to be infinitely more expensive
but it could get even worse if it has
infinite memory and number one that's
your Turing machine as we know it from
these usual definitions of computation
it could also be a geometric hyper
computer which is what physicists
believe for the longest time that is
that the universe is something that is
continuous and is able to perform
continuous operations and something that
you cannot do there's a digital computer
can only approximate it with a digital
one or it could be in a causal hyper
computer one where you can take
information and calculate it and send it
back in time and use these observations
which break causality in a closed
timelike loop that's also a computer
it's just one that is not cannot be
simulated on a discrete state machine so
computation is the description of an
arbitrary system as states and the
transition function and computationalism
is the notion that computation is
necessary and sufficient for describing
all conceivable observables including of
course consciousness by the way number
one and two are the only ones that we
know how to build in this universe and
one of the speakers after me heart mode
is going to talk about that he's working
on building number three and one of the
speakers after me James is going to talk
about that the universe is possibly in a
causal hyper computer Rodgers thesis is
more radical he says that there's
something going on the universe possibly
that is not computational that is not
cannot be described as states and
transitions between states something
that is not afforded by current physics
so we would need to go beyond physics
and something that boggles the mind
because it's very hard to imagine what
that could be what is not computational
well there is stuff that is not
computational for instance most of
mathematics how can that be
but mathematics is not computation
mathematics is the domain of all formal
languages it's the domain of
specification languages you can specify
arbitrary things most of which won't
work right in language you can say stuff
that doesn't pan out and most of
mathematics is not computable whereas
computation is the domain of possible
implementations
so computation itself can never run into
a paradox or be impossible or anything
like this computation is just what it is
a state the transition function then
comes the next state transition function
comes the next state that's it so if we
try to describe the universe we do this
with physics if we try to describe Minds
as information processing systems we can
do this for instance using artificial
intelligence this was largely why this
field was started in the 1950s after
people realized that psychology isn't
going anywhere
kannei I revealed the nature of our
minds
currently I probably not the current AI
is in strong movement which is called
deep learning it's super successful and
that ugly we started pretty much five
years ago five years ago a group of
engineers led by Andrew Inge from
Stanford and Google built neural network
with nine layers on 16,000 computer
course and they showed it randomly
selected frames from YouTube ten million
of these frames so order of magnitude
more than a baby is going to see in the
first months of its life and after that
it was able to recognize this stuff from
an image database this 15.8% recognition
accuracy which means you could show it
an arbitrary picture and it could tell
you and 16 percent of the cases what's
on that picture and it hadn't been
trained to know what it was seeing on
these YouTube frames it was just looking
for structure for anything that makes is
a discernible structure in there and it
got internet famous because one of these
things that could recognize very well
was cats which is not surprising when
you remember that it was trained on
YouTube frames so deep learning is
basically using stacked hierarchies of
layers and which are feature detectors
and it uses a method of gradient descent
to approximate functions that allows us
to classify objects and learn policies
and this means that in 2015 these things
outperformed humans and recognizer and
images in that database that didn't stay
at 16% that really outperformed people
at doing this
they also got better at that than people
are playing pacman being trained from
scratch and not being
told what to do in last year they
outperformed people at the game of gold
and maybe 2020 we will have the first
self-driving cars at the moment they are
already outperforming the average humans
in driving a car which vie for some
reason don't think is good enough
because they sometimes make accidents
but in average they make fewer accidents
than people and there's an argument to
be made if it's really about saving
lives you should switch right now of
course this is very far from a mind and
when you think about building artificial
Minds you often think about the Turing
test a system that convinces people that
it's intelligent I don't think that is
the actual challenge the actual
challenge is a system that performs a
Turing test on us right it's what we do
with each other we talk to each other to
find out what the other person is
conscious of right but you don't try to
convince others just that I am
intelligent I already know that I want
to find out what you know I want to find
out what you think about what you are
aware of and once a system does this
with us we can recognize that the system
has an idea what it is that it starts to
become a mind that it recognizes us as
Minds that it makes models of the world
in which minds figure prominently how
long does it take to get there we don't
really know Marvin Minsky said if I
believed in realism if we work really
hard we will get there and between four
to four hundred years and we are pretty
much on track I think but we could say
that these systems that we need to build
cognitive areas are different from the
narrower eyes that we have right now the
narrow eyes that we have a largely
pattern recognizers and object
classifiers so for instance if you want
to get such a system to recognize ELISA
one of the dancers in that image it
means that this system has to filter out
everything in the image that is not I
know that is a variant to find the
invariant the invariably would be ELISA
so it reads to filter out the pose the
lighting the dress the facial expression
and so on and her only ELISA is left in
all the images that contain her but this
is not quite what people do what people
do is they take all these different
concepts and don't filter them out there
is no background as only partially
occluded other objects and images for
it what what we do is we create a whole
world from what we look at and we relate
the features of that whole world with
each other and we do this starting from
patterns then we go to percepts and then
we go to mental simulations and then we
go to concepts which are abstractions
over these mental simulations and then
to linguistic symbols that allow us to
synchronize our conceptual domains and
to some degree our mental simulations so
minds are not classifiers they're
simulators and experiences and they
start out with feedback loops because
they are in the service of control of
the needs of a social primate most of
the feedback loops that we have are not
very available to our conscious
interaction with them because they don't
need to for instance we regulate our
body temperature our heart rate where
our breathing patterns and so on
autonomously there's a lot of feedback
loops many of which are in the brainstem
but for some of the things we need to be
able to control what we are doing and
adapt our actions and for that we have
pleasure and pain they are residing in
the limbic system largely and pain tells
us please do less of what you're
currently doing pleasure tells us do
more of what you're currently doing and
then we have impulses and they are
directed on future pleasure and pain and
we have a whole motivational system that
gives us impulses many of which are
physiological some are social and
handful are cognitive my own work is
related with discovering these
motivations and building computational
models of them to associate these
motivations with situation in the world
many animals have a structure that is
called a hippocampus that mattress
patterns and the environment visit the
needs of that organism so it knows what
impulses should lead to which world
situations and which the world
situations it should try to get to but
of course it's very difficult to make
sense of the world if it's just a bunch
of patterns so we have something more
than in the hippocampus we have the
neocortex and the neocortex allows us to
generalize over situations to say for
instance what do all the restaurants
have in common how can I recognize all
these situations where can get food and
so on or how can I recognize Alyssa and
many many situations and to do this our
brain needs to do something very tricky
it needs to generalize
and a good metaphor to understand what
it's doing as a synthesizer if you ever
played around with a synthesizer that
has a bunch of knobs and buttons and you
can twiddle these until the synthesizer
makes exactly the sound you want now
imagine you take the synthesizer and you
connect it to the output of your cochlea
this is the organ in your ear that
basically performs a hardware Fourier
transform on sound waves and this is
then piped to the cortex and the cortex
takes these signals and it fiddles knobs
and buttons until it's able to predict
what signals are going to come next from
the cochlea which means it understands
the current sound and once it has done
this for a number of sounds it
generalizes over those sounds and looks
what do all these sounds have in common
so for instance all these different
sounds have one property and that makes
them different and it's the pitch if he
wants you to filter out the pitch we
recognize you can now take a whole class
of different sounds and lump them into
one into one function that makes it
predictable and then once you discovered
the nature of pitch and the different
sounds as you can generated you'd find
another feature for instance loudness
and once you learn this you get to in
the next level and you can build
something like there's a sequencer
something that is able to assemble
sounds and tourism's and then you go a
level above that and you can build
harmonies and melodies and so on you go
level above that you can build songs and
you go level above that you can build
musical styles and so on and then you
can go across the modalities and do this
for different modalities you do the same
things for color for spatial frequencies
and so on you take your synthesizers
plug them into high level synthesizers
and you do this until you can create a
whole mental simulation a dream because
this is what the world is to us it's a
dream we don't live in the world out
there if you live in the dream in the
simulation generated by our neocortex
the same circuitry that will choose this
dreams at night but uses dreams during
the day which gets loosely synchronized
with our sensory input right I think
most of us understand that that we don't
live in the world out there the
interesting thing to realize is there is
no colors in the world or there are no
sounds no people there is a weird
quantum graph out there probably we
don't know what it is but colors sounds
people and so on exists in our neocortex
as mental representations that allow us
to predict the next set of bits that is
going to hit our retina
and above these mental simulations we
create concepts as abstractions over
what elements and simulations have in
common it's like the address space of
our sensorimotor scripts and then on top
of those we can create linguistic
symbols to talk about them and
self-report and so on control our self
reports for this we need different types
of learning one is function
approximation which is Bayesian reisel
parallelizable and it's exhaustive so we
use the for instance to learn the laws
of perspective in the first month of our
life and then we have scripts and
schemas which are narratives that
stories that that we used to describe
for instance what happens in a
restaurant what happens in the financial
markets or in society or in politics and
this is largely what we are talk with
talking to each other right and we can
use these conjunctions of those to
direct our mental simulations so this is
what the neocortical is doing it's
simulating a dynamic world and at the
moment we don't have all the elements
for that in place and our machine
learning models I think the basic unit
is probably not a neuron because it
needs to be compositional needs to be
able to reap arranged in different
things the basic unit is probably a
cortical column we have something on the
order of a hundred million of those each
of them is probably a state machine made
from something like a hundred to four
new neurons which has a function
approximator and combines it with
different learning modes in different
ways it can link up to its environment
and these cortical columns are linked up
into cortical areas and these cortical
areas are linked with each other and two
processing streams and form these
hierarchies of synthesizers so to speak
and together there is something like an
orchestra we have something like roughly
fifty brain areas that are made each
from an order of a hundred million of
these units and they talked with a
neighborhood and their form processing
streams right and it starts out from
sensory patterns and motor patterns and
gets integrated into more more abstract
things and there is also a conductor and
the conductor is not a homunculus the
conductor is not something that has
super powers or something is a brain I
really like others
in the same way as a conductor an
orchestra is not a Superman but it's
he's similar to the musicians he just
has a different task and the task of the
conductor is very similar to the
conductor and orchestra it's task is to
resolve conflicts and tell individual
instrument
to belittle our orbital laser or to make
something slightly different or to
listen more to this guy to his other
side and so on and a conductor is in
this way controlling what's being played
tonight if you take the conductor of a
the person becomes a sleepwalker
the sleepwalker can still do interesting
things like get up from bed make dinner
open doors walk on the street answers
questions in random ways but there's
nobody home nobody is able to integrate
this motive with the motivation of a
consistent agent and create a consistent
protocol of what's happening and learn
based on that protocol right so this is
what this conductor is doing it gives
you attentional awareness and integrates
experiences and the brain is probably
it's all done largely by the dorsal
lateral prefrontal cortex and some
neighboring areas that provide
infrastructure for that but an important
thing is to realize of course you're not
your brain you are a story that your
brain tells itself largely so the
protocol of the conductor so you have
the sensory perception you put
distributed hierarchical representations
from them which are your mental
simulations and then you have your
conductor that is able in a secondary
process to scan part of these mental
representations basically see what your
brain has decoded from the world and
most of the stuff is doing down
completely subconsciously autonomously
in parallel on the background by your
brain your conductor is really paying
attention to only very few things there
and what actually not in real-time and
on your model you have your mental stage
world model self model procedural memory
object memory and so on so all this is
part of your vote representation
including your model of yourself of how
you interact with the world and the
model of that model which we usually
call the self your conductor also keeps
a protocol of what it attend no to in
this protocol is the only place where
experience is integrated it's something
like an equivalent of experiences in
many parts of your brain and distributed
fashions but these different parts don't
know about each other and as they talk
to each other and when you self report
or report to other people you need to
have an integrated place where this
information comes from is exactly that
protocol of what you attend to you can
only remember of what you what you
attended to and put in that protocol
right you can also then use this
protocol to get activation into it too
create a mental simulation or partial
mental simulation that is very similar
to the simulation that happened when you
looked at a particular thing or where in
a particular situation so you can use
this to recreate situations you can
recreate memories you can recreate
particular dreams and learn from them
and they're sufficiently similar to the
situation that you had in that situation
that you can learn from them and then
you can also put the effect that you
accessed that protocol into your
protocol which means it now becomes
somewhat recursive doesn't mean that you
are truly because if you just become
aware of the fact that you did access
your protocol and this created a
particular mental state inside of you so
basically you take the model of your own
recollection that your model at some
point in your mind because it's part of
your mental landscape and put that into
a protocol itself so this conductor
maintains an attention protocol which is
a narrative about the self and it has
access to the protocol which gets
integrated into the protocol itself I
think that remembering having been
conscious of something is both necessary
and sufficient for consciousness that is
I don't need to be actually conscious of
something it's necessary that I remember
having been conscious of something so I
can report about it to myself and to
others the availability of my mental
simulations to my conductor is necessary
and sufficient I think for access
consciousness and the integration of the
access into the accessible protocol is
necessary and sufficient for my self
report about the awareness and the self
report in turn about my memory of
awareness is interpreted as my awareness
and actuality what does it mean it means
for instance if you are drinking a cup
of coffee and you feel how the coffee
goes down your throat this is of course
not what's actually happening what's
actually happening is that you have some
sensory neurons in your throat your
larynx and so on that gets stimulated by
the coffee and some of that information
gets integrated and transmitted to your
brain and there it gets rise to a
simulation in your somatosensory cortex
which happens something between nicing
700 milliseconds on 1/2 seconds after
the fact and is totally different from
what physically happened with the coffee
in your throat
right but you perceive it at the same
time as which you subjectively put take
the cup and take it to your mouth and
you hear the clinking of the cup to your
teas and so on all these things happen
simultaneously even though the
processing what of the sound took a very
different amount of time and the
processing of your movement took a very
different amount of time because they're
very different sensory modalities it's
different part and mental presentations
how is it possible that this objectively
happened at the same time because they
are patched together on the protocol and
you only get access to them long after
the fact and they're patched together
and the protocol navaid which they
didn't happen together which means
you're not conscious in the right here
right now when you drink that coffee
you're not aware of that coffee while
you drink it
you're only aware of it a long time
later and value when you actually
navigate the cup you do this with
reactive subsystems that have been
primed by previous conscious
interactions right so I think that
you're probably not conscious and
actuality of things like that you're
probably having a memory of having
conscious of something of experiencing
something that didn't take place in
exactly the very same way as you
remember it that's the easiest
explanation of how to make a machine
conscious is to give it a memory of
hanga be conscious of something that's
it from me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
