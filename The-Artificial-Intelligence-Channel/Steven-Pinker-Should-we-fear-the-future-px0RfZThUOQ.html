forthcoming book enlightened now the
last word of the subtitle is progress it
is a major theme of the book and I wrote
it in part because I discovered that
intellectuals hate progress and
intellectuals who call themselves
progressive really hate progress if you
think that we can solve problems then
you have a blind faith for a
quasi-religious belief in the outmoded
superstition of the false promise of the
myth of the onward march of inevitable
progress you are a cheerleader for
vulgar American can-do ISM with a
rah-rah spirit of boardroom ideology
Silicon Valley and the Chamber of
Commerce you are a practitioner of Whig
history a naive optimist a Pollyanna and
of course a Pangloss named after the
Voltaire character who declared we are
always for the best in the best of all
possible worlds
well my reply is that progress need not
be associated with any of these
temperaments or philosophies that rather
progress is an empirical hypothesis
namely their human wellbeing can be
measured life health sustenance wealth
peace freedom safety knowledge leisure
and happiness if they have increased
over time that is progress
well let's look at some of the data we
can begin with the most basic dimension
a few human well-being of all life and
health and we see a pattern that is you
will see over and over again whenever
you map out some dimension of human
well-being namely before the
Enlightenment in the say the early 18th
century basically the entire world was
miserable and abject then Europe and the
Americas and the United States North
America started to pull away from this
state of universal
here we see that the average lifespan in
England in Europe in the 18th century
was about 30 that's pretty much where
had it had been parked for thousands of
years before but then starting in the
19th century the lifespan of Europeans
dramatically increased that was quickly
followed by the Americas then Asia ah
and more recently Africa here you have
the plot for the entire world the
average life expectancy today is 71
across the entire world averaging over
rich and poor countries and including
all of the premature deaths from 0 year
old infants virtually no one guesses
that the world's average lifespan is
that high child mortality follows a
similar pattern in Sweden one of the
world's most advanced countries in the
18th century one third of all children
died before their fifth birthday
and that declined to very close to zero
over the course of the 19th and 20th
centuries that was then followed by
countries in the Americas such as Canada
then Asia South Korea even in the 20th
century had a rate of child mortality
similar to Sweden's in the 18th century
but it has come down to a and African
countries are following suit here you
have the graph for Ethiopia which
represents sub-saharan Africa likewise
maternal mortality a couple of centuries
ago a woman had a 1% chance of dying in
childbirth childbirth in the 18th
century was as lethal as breast cancer
is today
Sweden brought the rate down followed by
the United States Asian countries such
as Malaysia and I now we're seeing
Africa catch up as well that's the graph
radicchio Pia sustenance famine used to
be a regular occurrence in all parts of
the world but starting with the
Agricultural Revolution in the 18th
century the number of calories available
to
a person started to shoot up first in
England United States and France but
then more recently China has caught up
even India long associated with famine
now exports grain and here we have the
graph for the world as a whole the
average for the world is the number of
calories needed for an active
middle-aged man we the increase in
calories is not just going to make rich
people fatter but it is also preventing
the stunting of children the United
States for a long time has not had
malnourished children but as recently as
the 1960s 40% of children in South
America were stunted that has been
brought down to less than 10% likewise
we see a decline of stunting in China in
followed by Kenya sub-saharan African
country and Bangladesh as a result
famine deaths have been decimated and
whereas famine used to be a threat
everywhere on earth now there just a few
pockets in Africa that are vulnerable to
famine prosperity here you have a graph
of prosperity in the world from the year
1 to the year 2000 for thousands of
years everyone was poor then starting
with the Industrial Revolution in the
19th century there was a 200 fold
increase in the gross world product once
again that did not unfold evenly across
the world's regions the UK was the first
overtaken by the United States but then
more recently South Korea has almost
caught up Chile China and you see India
accelerating it as well this pattern is
sometimes called the great convergence
as a result extreme poverty which is the
inability to feed oneself in one's
family has been decimated in the 19th
century
90% of the world met the criterion for
extreme poverty that has now been
reduced to 10% and the United Nations
has set the goal of eliminating extreme
poverty from the face of the earth by
the year 2030 which means that most of
us might live might live to see that the
day in which extreme poverty will vanish
from the face of the earth as a result
for all the talk of increased inequality
within wealthy Western countries
globally inequality is decreasing
because poor countries are getting
richer faster than rich countries are
getting richer here you have two
estimates of an international Gini index
showing this recent decline as countries
become richer they devote more of their
wealth to helping the worse-off children
the poor the sick the aged every
affluent country devotes at least 20% of
its GDP now to social spending for
centuries that was that figure was 1% so
here you have the data for France Italy
Sweden Germany Greece Netherlands UK and
so on it's a pattern that no affluent
country escapes
thanks to this social spending poverty
is as is being decimated with in Western
countries again for all the talk about
the problems with the American economy
the growth in the growth in inequality
what really counts namely poverty has
been in a decline here you have the
American poverty rate if you take into
account social spending such as the
Earned Income Tax Credit Social Security
and so on and the decline is even more
dramatic if you look at consumption
which is really what counts when you
consider poverty namely can people
afford to feed themselves clothes and
sew themselves house themselves and so
on by one estimate the poverty rate in
the United States was 30 percent in 1960
it has now fallen to 3 percent when
measured by consumption
peace it used to be the case that war
was the natural state of affairs and
peace was merely an interlude between
wars this graph shows the percentage of
time that the great powers of the day
that is the most powerful states and
empires fought wars against each other
from 1500 to the present and you can see
that several hundred years ago the great
powers were pretty much always at war
now they are never at war the last great
power war took place more than 60 years
ago the Korean War which pitted China
against the United States even the wars
that have taken place mostly civil wars
kill a fraction of the people that they
used to here we have the rate of death
in wars from 1946 to the present and
it's been a bumpy ride there are spikes
for the Korean War for the Vietnam War
for the iran-iraq war but we now see
that the rate of death and war which is
about one 400,000 per year has fallen
considerably from the 1950s when it was
20 to 400,000 per year freedom and
rights have been in the ascent despite
some discouraging headlines
notwithstanding the common claim that
democracy is in retreat that there's a
democratic meltdown or rollback
the world has never been more democratic
this is a score of the average measure
of democracy versus autocracy across the
world's nations and it shows that we are
living in a time in which a majority of
nations are more democratic than not and
a majority of people in the world live
in democratic nations for the first time
in history human rights are harder to
quantify but there has been one data
scientist who's tried to quantify human
rights at violations such as summary
executions in prison a dissident and so
on the gold standard for human rights
is the to be found in Scandinavian
countries and here we see that Norway
started out in 1946 as having a high
level of human rights and it's gone even
higher the Koreas have gone in opposite
directions in the 1940s there was very
little difference between South Korea
and North Korea
they were both dictatorships South Korea
has gotten as respected Human Rights
increasingly North Korea as should be
obvious has gone downhill a country like
China the opposite of a gold standard is
still has a higher level of human rights
today than it certainly did during the
Cultural Revolution and the great leap
forward of Mao Zedong the world as a
whole with all of the backsliding all of
the the turkeys and rafa's and
Venezuela's still shows an upward arc in
progress toward human rights one
manifestation of respect for human life
is in the death penalty where country
after country has abolished the death
penalty here you see a timeline from
1863 to the present over the last couple
of decades every year three three
countries abolish the death penalty if
the current trend continues not to say
that it will the death penalty will
vanish from the face of the earth by
2026 homosexuality is being abolished in
country after country again
notwithstanding backsliding in countries
like Uganda and Russia but still the
overall trend is for homosexuality to be
decriminalized and child labor has been
is being decimated in 1850 about 30
percent of English children were in the
workforce that has gone to pretty much
zero who you have the curve for England
in the United States for Italy and for
the world as a whole there is still far
too much child labour but the trajectory
is definitely downward safety we have
never been safer here you have a graph
of homicide deaths over the last 50
years showing that the united states has
reduced its rate of homicide by
more than 50% England too has seen a 50%
reduction since the in the 21st century
alone and the world as a whole had now
has a homicide rates of 70% of what it
was just at the turn of the millennium
in the United States violence against
wives and girlfriends domestic violence
has been decreasing as has sexual
assault and rape violence against
children has been in decline this these
figures are for the United States the
rate of children being beaten up or
bullied at school has declined the rate
of physical abuse by caregivers and the
rate of sexual abuse have come down the
our technology has become safer and
safer as far as I know this is a
universal law and the reductions have
been dramatic an American today has
about 1% of the chance of being killed
in a car accident as his counterpart of
a century before pedestrians are 20
times less likely to be mowed down on
the sidewalk people are about a million
times less likely to die in a plane
crash people are less likely to fall to
their deaths
less likely to drown less likely to be
burned to death in a fire less likely to
be asphyxiated by point by a gas one
exception the rate of poisoning by
solids or liquids has gone up and what
you're seeing here is the American
opioid epidemic so it obviously is not
the case that everything improves all
the time that would be magic not
progress Americans are far less likely
to be killed on the job again a
reduction of about 95 percent and people
the world over are less likely to die in
earthquakes floods wildfires mudslides
and meteor strikes here you have the
rate of
death from natural disasters my favorite
in these is if you think of the
quintessential act of God the bolt from
the blue that is being instructed being
killed by a bolt of lightning
Americans now have 3% of the chance of
being killed by a bolt of lightning as
Americans of a century ago knowledge has
been on the increase it used to be that
only about 15% of the world knew how to
read and write in the early modern
period that first we see the Netherlands
achieving universal literacy then
England Germany Italy a bit later a
United States and as with all the other
measures of well-being the rest of the
world is catching up here you have the
figure the curve for China for Mexico
and for the world as a whole more than
80% of the world is literate now and the
illiterate people are all in their 70s
and 80s when they die off the world will
achieve close to 100% literacy likewise
basic education the elementary school
here we have the British offshoots
Western Europe Eastern Europe a little
later East Asia Latin America at the
Middle East and South and East Asia and
sub-saharan Africa once again there is a
lag but that we are starting to see a
convergence there you have the figure
for the world as a whole believe it or
not we are getting smarter in a
phenomenon called the Flynn effect IQ
scores have been increasing by three
points a decade for a century with the
result that humans today are about 30 IQ
points higher than their ancestors a
century ago here you have the figures
for each of the continents what are we
doing with all of this wealth and health
well we are enjoying life as opposed to
slaving away at jobs work hours in
Western Europe and the United States
have been declining since the 19th
century by about 22 hours a week
people spend less of their paycheck on
food clothing and shelter it used to be
more than sixty percent of your paycheck
went to the necessities of life now it's
about one-third thanks to the growth of
appliances and utilities like running
water electricity washing machines
vacuum cleaners refrigerators
dishwashers stoves microwaves the amount
of time that we lose to housework has
been steadily decreasing from more than
60 hours a week to less than 20 as a
result of all of these leisure time has
increased by about 12 hours a week more
so for men than for women and that's
because women have are using their extra
time to spend more time with their
children which doesn't count as leisure
time is it making us any happier
well probably yes here's a graph that
shows the relationship between
self-assess life satisfaction and gross
domestic product and over over countries
the rich of the country the happier the
person on average this graph this data
cloud shows a number of arrows
indicating the relationship between
happiness and income within each country
and as you can see richer countries are
happier richer people within countries
are happier which means that as the
world gets richer on average it gets
happier well how is the fact of human
progress all of these developments that
have shown you reflected in the news I'm
going to show you a graph that is the
result of a tone mapping algorithm where
thousands of new stories from the New
York Times since the 1940s are rated in
terms of their ratio of positive words
like better improve increase good to
negative words like crisis deterioration
horrible and so on and as you can see
since the 1940s the New York Times has
been getting more and more negative it's
not just the New York Times this is
a composite of broadcasts from media all
over the world so as the world has been
getting better and better the media have
been getting more and more negative
journalism so why do intellectuals and
journalists deny progress it is just an
overwhelming fact about the human
condition and the picture of the world
given to us by the writers and thinkers
is the opposite to reality well one
possibility is a psychological
phenomenon discovered by Daniel Kahneman
and Amos Tversky called the availability
heuristic namely the human brain
estimates probability according to how
easily examples from memory pop into
mind so if you see news about a
terrorist attack you assume that
terrorism is common if you read about a
shark attack you don't go into the water
if you see a tornado you think the
tornadoes are a major cause of death and
so on if you combine that with the
famous watchword of news programming
namely if it bleeds it leads
violent stories get the most attention
the most clicks the most eyeballs then
you get the illusion that the world is
more dangerous than it ever has been I
think that's not the only reason there's
a second psychological phenomenon behind
it the negativity bias sometimes
summarized by the slogan bad is stronger
than good this summarizes the results of
hundreds of experiments showing that
people think and feel about bad events
much more than good events probably
because there are so many more ways for
things to go wrong than to go right now
and in our evolution evolutionary
history and the cost of missing a danger
is much greater than the cost of failing
to note a beneficial development a third
phenomenon is what I think of as the
gravitas market namely if you want to be
taken seriously as a social critic as a
profit that it's much much more clever
to be pessimistic than optimistic person
sounds serious optimism sounds frivolous
is one business writer put it pessimist
sound like they're trying to help you
optimist sound like they're trying to
sell you something uh finally a somewhat
cynical explanation is that there's a
status competition among elites all of
us seek to enhance the prestige of our
tribe our profession and when
intellectuals aren't responsible for
running things they just comment when
intellectuals disparage the state of the
world it's another way of undermining
the prestige of politicians civil
servants businesspeople the military and
so on well is it good to be pessimistic
is it is it socially responsible is it
good to speak truth to power to hold the
powerful accountable to afflict the
comfortable well it has a serious
downside that I think we are only
beginning to recognize namely that
fatalism if all of the pictures of the
state of the world are that it's going
to hell in a handcart
it's a flaming dumpster it's a disaster
everything everything is a crisis well
people are gonna say well there's why
waste time and money on a hopeless cause
I may as well just enjoy life bring home
my paycheck bring up my children and
enjoy life while it lasts and cynicism
it in for people who do want to change
things if they are told that every
institution is failing it's bound to
encourage the philosophy of to smash the
Machine to drain the swamp to burn the
empire to the ground and it lays open a
invitation for strong charismatic
leaders to say only I can fix it now is
progress inevitable I've shown a number
of curves that just keep - going up and
up and the answer is of course not
there is no dialectic that carries us
ever upward there is no mystical arc of
justice and indeed any solution will
create a new problem
which have to be solved in turn and
history can always throw nasty surprises
at us and there have been a number of
them the two world wars the increase in
crime in the from the 1960s to the 1980s
in every western country the AIDS
epidemic in Africa which reversed the
increase in longevity and as we are
seeing today the rise of
authoritarianism in Russia Turkey
Eastern Europe and elsewhere there are
major threats undoubtedly including
prominent among them are nuclear war and
climate change although I do have to
mention that these should not be seen as
portents of inevitable doom either that
there are signs that that these threats
can begin to be mitigated here we have
the number of nuclear weapons in the
world from 1945 to 2015 very few people
are aware of the fact that the nuclear
world's nuclear arsenal has been reduced
by 85% and about 10% of the electricity
in the United States comes from
decommissioned nuclear weapons the
ultimate swords into plowshares it we
cannot expect this curve to be
extrapolated to zero anytime soon but it
is not an idle dream and as you probably
know some of the world's most vociferous
cold war Hawks like Ronald Reagan like
Henry Kissinger like George Shultz have
called for a world without nuclear
weapons likewise the world's greatest
challenge is undoubtedly climate change
but I think we are not to see it as an
unsolvable problem as inevitable doom
this graph showing the trajectory of co2
emissions suggest that the world has
reached peak coal and might even have
reached peak carbon here yet the
European Union co2 emissions the United
States China India and other regions of
the world all in all the at least the
rate of increase has come down that is
obviously not enough to address global
warming but it shows that industrial
society is not on
path of indefinitely increasing co2
emissions ah I'm going to just throw
this out and I'm not going to defend it
because it will segue into the next
session you can't worry about everything
we really should worry about nuclear war
we should really worry about climate
change
I think worrying about runaway
artificial intelligence of robots taking
over enslaving us for reasons that I can
expand later I think is not an
existential threat ah whoops I so I'm
just to stay on time I'm gonna skip that
but I can go through it later if there
is time but I'm gonna cede the floor to
my my fellow panelists so progress is
not a law of nature I argue in the book
that it is a gift of pursuing the ideals
of the Enlightenment namely reason
science and humanism these ideals must
be identified and defended
they are what we have to thank for the
progress that we have enjoyed if we
continue to pursue them we can enjoy
more progress if we don't you won't uh
and over all what it shows is that human
effort is not futile despite the
headlines humanity has made tremendous
progress and there is reasonable hope
for much more thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
