looking at disruptors people things
ideas that fundamentally change our
world and right now we're talking about
a new scientific tool that could disrupt
the fundamental nature of every kind of
life on Earth your body contains
thirty-seven point two trillion cells
and within each is a copy of a code
consisting of more than 20,000 genes and
billions of strands of DNA this code is
your genome and it determines everything
that makes you you what if you could
modify that code bring back extinct
species eliminate hereditary diseases
that is precisely what molecular
engineers and geneticists around the
world are working on George church is
one of many using a revolutionary gene
editing technique called CRISPR caste 9
which allows you to modify DNA sequences
paint this picture of what the future
looks like
as a result of CRISPR in your eyes I
suppose the wildest description would be
that you have some 150 year old people
that look like their 20 year old riding
on a mammoth is that why all of them
well the idea of a youthful senior
citizen riding on a wooly mammoth as you
just heard they're on CNN may still be
far from reality but the prospect of
editing genes the building blocks of all
life on Earth has got a boost from a new
technology called CRISPR cast 9 or
CRISPR for short the advance is a
disruptor with excitement building
around the endless possibilities it can
create from curing genetic diseases to
creating crops better adapted to climate
change or even developing more humanoid
pigs whose organs can be transplanted
into humans for some this excitement is
personal and potentially life-saving
Kitchener Ontario's Jacqueline Skinner
has the genetic mutation for
Huntington's disease a devastating
illness for which the CRISPR gene
editing could potentially provide
treatment or even a cure
things like CRISPR right that just means
like giving me my future back I mean
having all of these child's and stuff
you got a-you get super hopeful and get
super excited and I celebrate every
minor milestone with my family and so to
hear technology and things
Krister come forward it's just it's such
a relief because all of these people
don't deserve what this disease does to
you and to be able to hit like look at
something like this and see like the
light at the end of the tunnel it's I
don't know it's like somebody hating you
like a golden ticket saving your life
back
well that is Jacqueline Skinner she's
the head of the Canadian group young
people affected by Huntington's disease
she lives in Kitchener Ontario along
with a promise CRISPR is also causing
concern the technology could allow us to
change human DNA not just in an
individual but in all of their future
children and grandchildren that's raised
the question of whether we as a species
are prepared for such an awesome
responsibility and among those saying we
need to better understand all the
potential implications of CRISPR is one
of the scientists who worked on its
discovery Jennifer Doudna is a professor
of molecular and cell biology at the
University of California Berkeley she is
the co-author of a book called a crack
in creation gene editing and the
unthinkable power to control evolution
jennifer doudna is in berkeley
california hello hello good morning as
one of the people involved in
discovering CRISPR how do you feel when
you hear the excitement in the voice of
someone like Jacqueline Skinner Wow I
mean I just feel so honored to be part
of that revolution in technology and the
opportunity to help people is really why
we do the science we do well we heard a
bit of an explanation from CNN there and
that clip at the top but how would you
explain to a layperson what CRISPR
technology is you can think about DNA in
our bodies being the the code that the
code of life that really controls who we
are and what we do and our health and
and and disease states and having a
technology that allows changes to be
made to that code and not randomly but
very precisely at desired places in the
DNA that could in principle correct
mutations that cause disease I think
that's really what CRISPR is all about
so it allows it allows you to end
it little bits of the DNA that's right
it literally is a programmable tool it
allows scientists to tell this tool
where to go in the DNA where to make
changes and then introduce either
disruptions to the DNA or in some cases
actually replacing DNA sequences with
sequences that are desired for example
to correct a disease-causing mutation
were you looking for a gene editing
technology when you discovered CRISPR
absolutely not this is the thing about
CRISPR that or one of the many aspects
of this that I think is very interesting
it sort of illustrates the way that
scientific research is often done is
that you know this is a technology that
came from a very different sort of
unexpected direction it was a project
that was aimed at understanding how
bacteria fight viral infection so it was
a fundamental research project asking a
question about how things work in nature
and in the course of that research it
became clear that this tool this
molecule that is used in bacteria to
protect from viral infection could be
deployed in a very different way in
human and other cells to induce changes
to the DNA and what did you think what
did you do when you realize what you'd
found well first I I have to say I kind
of laughed out loud because it was one
of those moments that we all as
scientists live for that comes along
very rarely where you have an insight
that you realize you know has a really
important implication for for the
scientific community and I just thought
it was very interesting that bacteria
had come up with this had evolved this
mechanism for defending against viruses
but I I also very quickly felt a sense
of awe because it was clear that this
technology would be very powerful and
would you know enable scientists to use
it in many ways for both research and
clinical applications that would you
know in the end is going to really
change our world
humans have been creating animals and
crops more suited to our needs for
thousands of years how is CRISPR
different well it's different for a few
reasons I would say it's it's really a
very precise technology so rather than
relying on random changes that humans
have been introducing by you know
exposing seeds to chemicals or to
radiation for example now we have a
technology that allows precise changes
to be made at only the desired DNA
sequences so that's one thing also it's
a technology that is remarkably simple
and inexpensive to use and that's one of
the reasons we've seen it take off as
quickly as it has over the last few
years is that you know it's just there's
very low barrier to entry in a way you
know you just need a sort of a minimal
understanding of molecular biology to be
able to use it so you've discovered not
only this awesome thing but an awesome
thing that's democratic exactly how has
CRISPR been used already to make changes
to crops and livestock well you know in
amazing ways I mean we're already seeing
uses in crops like wheat rice sorghum
these are you know staples that can
benefit from introduction of genes that
help them to deal with drought
conditions or fight off various kinds of
fungal infections that could otherwise
affect crop yields also more recently
there's been work in plants like
tomatoes so using the CRISPR technology
to make changes that avoid fruits that
are too heavy for the stems that hold
them you know things like that so very
practical kinds of uses so that's an
agriculture we're also seeing uses not
only moving towards clinical treatments
but also to do things like to humanize
animals that would be good for organ
donation for example pigs and you can
also it can also be used to make certain
livestock more muscular can it nod it
can you've probably seen the pictures of
muscly pigs muscly cows that's something
that hasn't been widely deployed at this
stage but you know but is is real
very visual example of how gene editing
can be used how do you see the ethics of
making a so-called designer livestock or
crops that pass down genetic changes to
the offspring this is an area where
we're at the very early stages of using
this technology I think that on the one
hand having a precise way to make
genetic changes like this is in my
opinion safer in a way than making
introducing random changes and then just
hoping that you get the the trait that
you desire on the other hand I think
there has to be research to understand
the stability of those kinds of genetic
changes and and like with anything else
that that we might introduce into the
food supply we need to ensure that those
animals or plants are safe for
consumption I have a clip here of Pat
Mooney who is the executive director of
the etcetera group a technology watchdog
organization he has concerns about
commercial uses of CRISPR in the food
industry let's listen to him there is
always the concern that because there's
an opportunity here to make profit
quickly that someone will push it into
the marketplace to quickly try to get
control of it to make it impossible to
be retrieved there's a lot of enthusiasm
for using this technology to develop
resistances to different pests and
diseases and that certainly interesting
area for them to explore to see if that
could be a benefit to us and it might be
but in the same way that it could move
quickly to defend us against the disease
it could affect a major food crop it
could be disease that affects our major
food crops it could cause the problem
it's such a new technology and it is so
powerful we understand it's so little
that to jeopardize our food supply by
introducing this technology to quickly
physically dangerous Jennifer Doudna
what do you think of commercial uses of
CRISPR technology do they pose potential
risks I think like any technology
honestly this this one you know needs to
be carefully vetted and appropriately
regulated you tell the story about an
entrepreneur you call Kristina who met
with one of your colleagues what
happened yeah so this was an interesting
meeting with someone who was interested
in using the CRISPR technology in humans
and
in fact she had the idea of having
herself the first what she called
crisper baby you know the idea that you
could actually use gene-editing in human
embryos to create human beings that
would have desired genetic traits and
what happened well it was a very very
strange conversation as you could
imagine for me because it was clear in
that conversation that she was serious
about this and even though I knew that
you know this would not be possible
today for many reasons both regulatory
but also technical it was a bit a bit
alarming to know that she might think
this way and that that might be the way
that others would think too about
opportunities to perhaps make money or a
garner attention by doing something very
radical like that this is why you want
to not only talk about the science but
the ethics you want to have you want us
all to be having these bigger
discussions on to really think about
this I think it's hugely important and I
think it's also a wonderful opportunity
to get people involved in discussing a
really exciting proverbial moment in a
way in science you know something where
we're seeing this transformative change
and what we can do with genetics and so
this is a great moment to invite people
to learn about this understand it enough
that they can engage in a meaningful
discussion mmm some people have talked
about bringing back the woolly mammoth
we heard that clip off the top even
creating a winged dragon with CRISPR is
that possible well there's possible and
possible possible or probable maybe is
the way to put it I think you know the
thing about gene editing is that it
opens the door to doing things that have
never been done before so people have
talked about for example the idea of
creating a unicorn you know putting a
genes to make a single centered horn
into a horse is that possible I think in
principle the answer now is yes and you
know could it happen immediately no be
for various technical reasons but I
think this is one of the reasons people
are so captivated by it is that it just
really does open the door to think
that we've never been able to even
really contemplate before well let's
talk about using CRISPR on humans what
is the promise of CRISPR when it comes
to disease well I think you know it's
it's fantastically exciting to think
about a technology that allows
correction you know of DNA sequences
that would otherwise cause terrible
disease and I hear from people that have
genetic disease and their family
virtually every day who are you know
very excited about about the potential
for this to really have an impact on
their health in the future I think
that's you know clearly is tremendously
exciting and how close are we to
actually treatments or cures survive
well I think it's important to
appreciate a couple of things first of
all the technology is clearly very
powerful as we've heard however it does
require introduction into cells to work
and so I think one of the big challenges
ahead for using this in people is being
able to deliver the the gene editing
molecules into cells or tissues in a
person and this is why I think and I
think many people would agree that you
know one of the the most likely first
targets clinical targets for for gene
editing is is going to be blood diseases
for example sickle cell disease these
are diseases where we understand the
genetics there's a single gene that
needs to be fixed or repaired and we can
get access to blood cells by taking them
out of a patient doing the editing and
then putting them back into the body and
so you can imagine a path clinical path
forward faster than for something like
Huntington's where you know you would
actually have to think about how to
introduce gene editing molecules into
the brain hmm it's quite extraordinary
though
yeah there's different kinds of gene
editing there's germline and there so
Matic what's the difference
yeah very important to know to
understand that so if somatic means
editing in cells that are already fully
developed they're there already a liver
cell or a skin cell or a blood cell
there's no possibility of transmitting
the changes that are made to those cells
to future generations
the difference between that and germline
editing is that in the germline we're
talking about making changes to sperm or
eggs or early embryos these would be
genetic changes that could be
transmitted to future generations and so
it's a-you know when we talk in the book
about the power to change human
evolution that's really ultimately what
could happen if there was widespread
editing of the human germline do you
think we should be doing germline or
heritable gene editing on humans right
now I would say no you know I think that
this is a technology that you know is
still in its infancy in many ways we're
learning about it I think the
opportunity to use the gene editing tool
to understand better human development I
think that's exciting but I would
caution against using it clinically
anytime in the near future because we
need to understand it better and and and
maybe even more importantly we need to
have time to discuss it as a society
what are the implications of that kind
of use in many parts of the world
including Canada it is currently illegal
to do any human germline editing
including on embryos that will not be
grown into babies but some ethicists
think that's a mistake and that includes
Chris Ginn Joel
he's a research fellow at the Hiro
Center for practical ethics at the
University of Oxford listen to him well
look we we miss out on an important
resource a resource that we can use to
do a lot of good if we stop now because
of irrational fears about what might
happen in the future of technology we
really miss out on a good opportunity to
opportunity develop a way to treat
genetic disease we alter the human
germline all the time every time we have
children the natural way we introduce
random genetic mutations into our
germline
so it's it's not a question of whether
we should change the germline we're
doing this all the time already
it's the question is how do we change
the germline for good how do we do the
most good with this technology and I
think this technology could be key to
reducing suffering and to increasing
human flourishing
so Jennifer Doudna how do you respond to
that idea that we have a moral
imperative to go ahead with germline
editing research well I remember the
very first meeting that I convened in
the Napa Valley this was already a
couple of years ago to discuss the
question of human germline editing with
a small group of scientists and at one
point somebody leaned across the table
and said you know there may come a time
when we would consider it unethical not
to edit the human germline and that sort
of made everybody take a breath and say
well yeah that's a different way to you
know think about it in my own view I
think that clearly you know I mean I
think I agree with what was just said
you know I clearly this is a really
exciting technology and we have an
opportunity right now to use it to
really help people and also to really
understand better our own biology and
and I think but you know hand in hand
with that goes a huge responsibility to
use this in a fashion that you know in
the end does lead to benefits to human
beings and also brings the community of
people around the world along with the
scientists you know that scientists are
not rushing ahead but that we're
actually engaging with our our neighbors
our our parents our kids are our friends
and so that people understand what's
happening and we avoid sort of the
feeling of being you know railroaded or
just you know sort of not included in
technology this important I think that
would be a mistake I think just talking
to you is one of the people who was
instrumental in its existence this and
its discovery and you wanting to engage
in that helps us understand more that's
sort of the gray areas that's certainly
my hope what so what do you think of the
idea that with CRISPR we could make
humans better than their parents
beyond curing a genetic disease well
it's sort of one of these amazing things
to think about I mean I'll give you an
example so you know there's a gene that
has been
discovered in liver cells that when it
is present in a certain form a certain
DNA sequence of that gene that occurs
rarely in the human population it turns
out that those people have virtually no
risk of cardiovascular disease meaning
that they you know don't have to worry
about high cholesterol they don't have
to worry about heart attacks as they get
older and yet there seems to be no
deleterious effect on their health so
you could imagine you know what if you
could actually just introduce that gene
variant if you will into the human
population very broadly using gene
editing would that be a good idea some
people might say yes and same thing with
something like Alzheimer's disease what
if you could ensure that anybody that is
born in the future doesn't have certain
gene types that might predispose them to
Alzheimer's disease
as someone whose mother is currently in
the final stages of Alzheimer's it's a
you know it's a terrible terrible thing
and I know many people that have gone
through this and their families and you
know I feel that you know this might
really be something to consider in the
future there's been so much hype around
the promise and potential of CRISPR what
are the chances that it won't pan out on
a major scale well I think you know with
any any new technology there's always
going to be bumps in the road and I
think what we often see with new
technologies is that you know people get
very excited and there's tends to be a
lot of hyperbole and then you know
reality sets in when you realize that
you know there's still a lot of steps to
be taken before there's a real in this
case say clinical impact I think the
thing that's different with CRISPR
though is that the technology is only
you know it's barely five years old
right and so it's you know it's really
been adopted incredibly quickly and
globally and we're already seeing you
know at least in in in the agricultural
world we're already seeing products you
know coming to market that are using
this technology so it's just already
moving so quickly and I think that you
know for me when I think about clinical
uses it really is going to come down to
more of the ensuring that there aren't
unintended
consequences of gene editing for
particular diseases you know things like
that right I think the technology itself
is is really robust well I want to ask
about what you just said there because
there has been a new study now showing
that CRISPR editing could cause hundreds
of mutations that weren't the ones that
a scientist was intending to make and
the authors of the study are cautioning
that scientists should be aware of that
is there a possibility that it could be
too risky or too imprecise to use on a
larger scale well I need to look at the
data in that study I just saw the
headline for it but in our own
experience in my lab and with our
collaborators and with the other
scientists that I know that are that are
using this when the CRISPR system is
used in a way that limits the time that
DNA is exposed to the the CRISPR
molecules the editing molecules I think
that that has really gone a long way to
limit the kinds of off-target editing
that might occur so I think that sure
can you show that there are off target
events that occur with this technology
absolutely but I think as the technology
matures over time it's becoming more
clear all the time how to use it in ways
that are safe and I myself don't really
see that as a bottleneck going forward I
think that's a very solvable problem
mm-hmm we are talking about a technology
that is awesome how difficult is it to
gain public trust in science in today's
political climate it's hard I've now
been running a professional research lab
for almost 25 years and you know I've
seen over my time in science that
there's been a you know sort of a dick
Hey and the public trust of science and
scientists I think that scientists bear
some of the responsibility for that I
think we need to be much better at
communicating about what we're doing why
we're doing it
explaining about the scientific method
how does it work explaining that you
know science is you know it's an
imprecise operation right we don't you
know none of us are infallible but we
you know we try to do
work that we'll uncover in the end the
truth we try to work in ways that lead
us closer to the truth about nature and
and we have to explain that process to
people and and and frankly to include
them in it we have to you know help
taxpayers understand what is the value
of investing in scientific research how
does it benefit them how does it benefit
our economy how does it make life better
for people in the future and I think
scientists really need to get much more
engaged in that conversation do you
stand to profit financially from CRISPR
well I'm a co-founder of three startup
companies that are trying to
commercialize the CRISPR technology in
various ways two of those companies are
focused on human therapeutics and one of
them is building the technology for use
in other areas of biology including in
agriculture
I think commercialization is an
important aspect of new technologies you
know I think academic researchers can
only go so far in their work we simply
don't have the resources to take
technologies to the next level and
likewise companies need to have
scientists engaged to help them
understand the the basis of these
technologies and use them in ineffective
and responsible ways it's only been as
you point out about five years since you
helped discover the CRISPR caste 9
technology and a lot has happened since
then how do you feel having let the
genie out of the bottle well mostly I
feel just very very excited and very
honored to be part of this I mean I
think that you know for any any
scientist I mean we all sort of do our
work hoping that someday our work will
contribute at least in a small way to
helping the world to be a better place
and I think that for me you know being
part of this has been an amazing
experience and I'm just excited to
continue working with my colleagues and
my students to understand better how to
use this and and we hope that we will
see at some point people that are
actually treated using this technology I
think that would be a fantastic outcome
thank you for talking to me today
