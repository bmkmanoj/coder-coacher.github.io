kind introduction and if we could have
my slides please so what I I will talk
to you about tonight is how we compare
intelligent machines of two kinds one is
the biological intelligent machines
which general is known as humans and the
other are the new artificial intelligent
machines that are designed by us at the
moment so we really have the contrast
between evolution and design and I won't
call it intelligent design because that
might be a bit controversial so on the
biological machine side you see that
really our intelligence is based on our
brain and of course our brain is made
out of neurons so the build basic
building blocks of our intelligence and
neurons they then gather in large
numbers about a hundred billion of them
to make brains we have ears to hear eyes
to see likes to wander around we learn
in schools and then I'll end up my talk
with the sort of disruption that
technologists caused and how this might
also have an effect on the chemical
industry and then end up with the point
about human goals being really the
leading principle for coping with these
artificial machines where the transistor
is the equivalent of the neuron a
computer is a bit like a brain
microphones of course are the an
artificial equivalent of the ear cameras
the eyes robots have legs I'll have a
nice little video on that those sort of
things that are achieved in schools is
now achieved by machine learning
talk a little bit about the business
aspects that there are business
consequences of these disruptive
technologies that we'll see in cars and
healthcare and so on and how evolution
maybe will give way to design in the
future so let's start with neurons
versus transistors the first thing to
note is that neurons are a thousand
times bigger than transistors so we've
managed to make transistors very small
about 20 nanometers and neurons about 20
microns there are the faster these
transistors there actually there are a
million times faster than brains brains
typically work at a kilohertz frequency
when we you know really think very hard
but all this fast but computers can
typically go at gigahertz speed we still
have the edge in terms of a number of
neurons in the brain which is about 100
billion the largest chips that we can
produce as about a 10 billion
transistors but the real secret of the
brain which we haven't really understood
yet is that every neuron on average has
a thousand to 10,000 connections and it
is the the usefulness of this large
number of connections of every neuron to
a thousand to ten thousand others that
we're now trying to understand with the
new machine learning techniques now we
have the Internet we've got a billion
hosts and will soon have 20 billion
Internet of Things connected but you
know there's still a big difference
between a billion of the trillion like a
factor of a thousand so let's look at
neurons but mirrors are really quite
complex things so they're cells so they
have the whole machinery of a cell you
know nucleus the ribosomes they need to
live so all sort of things that cells
need to do in order to stay alive it's
also true for
then they collect all their inputs from
these dendrites and they're up to you
know ten thousand thousand to ten
thousand of them then they add them all
up to create a voltage in the soma here
and if the voltage exceeds a certain
threshold then they fire a signal a very
specific signal which we'll talk about
the so called spike on your own spike
down the axon which then fans out again
in a thousand to ten thousand of these
sign up says and then there's another
complexity that happens here because the
electrical signal that arrives at the
synapse that connects to the next neuron
actually doesn't traverse the synapse
there is a thing called a synaptic cleft
where the electric signal is translated
into a chemical signal there are these
little vesicles that then traverse the
synaptic cleft
- all these receptors on the other end
on these dendrites they then in turn
cause the electric signal to go to the
sumer of the next neuron in addition to
that these acts although they are only
about 20 nanometer 20 microns big these
neurons they can have rather long axons
like the one that gives from my brain to
my big toe
so these hands are amazing things and
the reason why they have these sheaths
around it is because it changes the
electric environment for for these
spikes so that they can travel faster so
if I hit my toe I know very quickly that
something is not quite right my toe
because of these these very clever
myelin sheaths so you're on Sep soma
then tries axon synapses voltage-gated
ion channels which were first studied by
hodgkin-huxley in cambridge and it's
called the hodgkin-huxley model and this
is the formula that describes neurons
pretty well so you've got the
thousand of 10,000 inputs here they get
some dim sum and if the sum of all these
inputs exceeds a certain threshold he
goes bang so it is digital in that sense
and these bangs these little spikes are
all the same size they're all about you
know 60 millivolts high and they're
about a millisecond wide but although
the individual spike is certainly
digital because there is either a spike
or no spike there is nothing in between
so in that sense it's digital but the
frequency of these spike trains as you
see is not digitally in any way in the
sense that the the frequency looks you
know very very analog very distributed
so that's now go to a transistor that
transistor is much simpler in fact the
transistor is incredibly simple it just
has three parts really it has a source
of the electrons where the electrons
come from
then as drain where the electrons are
collected and in the middle there is
normally a voltage gate that determines
whether these electrons are going to
make it from the source to the Train or
not so it's an on/off switch and that's
it
Oh computing is is done with these
transistors and we run them in this
binary way that you know it's either 5
volts or now look voltages in which case
it's a 1 or it's no voltage in which
case it's a zero and you get these these
very regular clocks that look like that
now this is led to a very very simple
element where we call an and gate and
here's C the truth table of a NAND gate
only if both a and B are true so if a is
1 and B is 1 do you get an output here
but as it turns out you can build any
logical function using just NAND gates
so they're very very fundamental and
useful building blocks
the problem with them is that they don't
just work in this binary form but we
also can approximate you know analog
waves more and more accurately the more
of these digital digits you you want to
use and this is seduced us to think that
the world can be described in this zero
and one way the statements are either
true or they're false and that turns out
to be actually quite a poor way of
describing the world and as we'll see
later on the correct way of describing
the world which is much more powerful is
with probabilities where things are
never true they're never fall for just
more or less likely so how do we think
well we of course think with our brains
and computers have these semiconductors
and this was this amazing chip that I
found which is only one gram but it
contains 512 gigabytes of memories so
since the brain is about a kilogram this
would translate into 500 terabytes which
is an unbelievable amount of storage and
actually more than the storage in the
brain this is the biggest compute
element that we're producing at the
moment this is a so-called GPU a
graphical processing unit which is the
fastest computer that we have produced
so far so if we now compare the capacity
of the brain is very difficult to to get
an accurate an accurate measure for how
much we can actually remember but the
best estimates are between 10 and 100
terabytes so it's 10 to the 12 but as
we've just seen if we just add up all
these chips these components that we had
on the previous slide we can actually
store five times as much in a kilogram
as a brain does and this is not true for
our processing power we are actually
surprisingly killer
we are about a thousand times cleverer
and the best computer that we have just
in the in the raw processing power that
we have in our ability in particular to
process the the world as it appears on
our eyes so we're we're really quite a
clever lot and and this is the most
impressive thing that biology does is we
do it very very frugally with just 20
watts if we have built a computer that
was as powerful as our brain we would
consume 200 kilowatts so ten thousand
times more than our brain and of course
it has these wonderful hundred trillion
connections so the main difference
really in the past has been that
computers work in this digital way has
one processing unit that everything has
to go through whereas the brain has a
hundred billion of these little
processing elements called neurons so
the the big advantage of the brain is
this massive parallelism where not just
the compute elements are distributed all
through the brain but the memory is
distributed all through the brain as
well and the connectivity is sparse and
that seems to be the secret of how the
brain works but we're beginning to mimic
this so this is a picture of the brain
and this is the picture of our latest
new microprocessor called graph core
which simulates the human connectome
this is a picture of an actual brain and
the connectivity in the brain produced
by a university west of of Cambridge
which is perfectly good University comes
from it shows 200 different brain
regions from 461 people and this is the
processor that tries to
be the new processor that is needed for
machine learning this is quite an
unusual event this has only happened
twice before in the history of computing
so this is the third time that we feel
that computing needs a new
microprocessor architecture the first
time of course it was the change from
sis to risk where we produced the ARM
processor that it's been quite
successful it's in 95% of the phones
that you use the second time it was with
the GPU the graphical processing unit
because we needed a specific specialized
processor to produce all the nice
pictures and videos that are displayed
on screens of a PC and now we're a bit
stuck with single processors because
Moore's law has finished and we cannot
make processors go faster than about
three gigahertz because there's this
little problem with the speed of light
we haven't managed to solve yet so three
gigahertz it is so the only way you can
improve the performance of a computers
nowadays is by paralyzing it and having
lots and lots of processors work
together a bit like the brain this is
hard because there's no generic solution
of paralyzing a general piece of
software as it happens
machine learning works on very large
datasets so there is a natural way of
dividing that data set up into lots of
smaller bits of that dataset and then
dedicate a processor to each of the
smaller parts so you can actually bring
to bear in this case 7,000 processors on
to the single task the single machine
learning task so this looks as if it's
going to be the biggest chip in the
world by the time it takes out this will
be in December it has not just 7,000
processors but is also 650 megabytes of
RAM that those of you who remember the
BBC microcomputer it had a memory of 32
so this was ten thousand times less than
this single-chip so things have moved on
and the semiconductor business since
those days and it has a new very clever
architecture called PSP bug
synchronization protocol where basically
the computing cycle is separate from the
communication cycle now the reason why
this is important to have lots of
processors and lots of RAM is because if
you can do the computation on the chip
itself it's 10 to 100 times faster than
if you have to go off chip to find the
data and bring it on chip again so it's
very important that as much as you can
will be done on chip and these are
actually very interesting graphs that
show how the different processors in
that chip communicate with each other so
there's local things where they all talk
locally and then there's a little faster
here and then they talk across as well
and there's a wonderful experiment going
on called spinnaker in Manchester with
Steve Furber one of the two people who
produced the ARM processor and is
actually using a million arms in a torus
configuration to simulate a billion
neurons in real time it's a really
exciting project so let's look at our
ears we of course hear with our ears and
these artificial machines here with
their microphones so how are we our ears
doing compared with the microphones well
not great really we're here between 20
and 20 20 Hertz and 20 kilohertz and of
course we now can actually go much
further down probably just a few heads
up to gigahertz there are ultrasound
microphones and ultrasound transmitters
that can go up to key guards these
things can also listen very well and we
sort of max out at the hundred and
the decibels after which we go
completely deaf but a Saturn 5 rocket
can actually produce two hundred and
twenty decibels they didn't want to
stand next to that and we can also
localize the sound very accurately to
about five degrees which turns out to be
very important because the next big
thing happening in user interfaces you
will live through the iPhone era iPhone
is just ten years old and just the
introduction of touch has changed the
way we relate to computers well this
will change all again very rapidly over
the next five years
because voice recognition has become so
good so they can talk to the computer
this only works because of beamforming
microphones otherwise you'd have to have
a microphone like I do next to my lapel
but companies like Amazon that produced
the Amazon echo with software from a
Cambridge company called EB and x-mas
one of our companies actually produces
the best hardware solution for these
beamforming microphones
now the beamforming microphones are
important because what we do quite
naturally without knowing is since we
have two years if as I talk you know
where the sound is coming from most of
you are looking at me which is very nice
so you're not completely bored yet and
but your ears now concentrate on where
the sound is coming from which of course
is my mouth which means if somebody
coughs or the air conditioning yourself
or sir you can lock all those sounds out
because you know where the sound is
coming from it's called a beamforming
microphone and in these products echo
has seven of these microphones at the
top it will find out where the speech is
coming from and will be able to
understand your speech across the room
as indeed they do it's a very important
change because people have been dreaming
about talking to computers for a long
time it actually now works
works very well we see with our eyes and
of course artificial intelligence to see
with the with cameras and boy are we
losing that one where are we
hmm okay well there is a slide that just
compares all the different things that
we can do with the eyes this is just one
the chosen in great detail and then
there's the frequencies that we can see
but as you can see the the photons that
we can see in the indivisible
it's about from 400 nanometers to 700
nanometers and it's or it's the blues to
the Rays of the rates to the Blues and
it's the rainbow and of course we're
very proud wood we can see it very good
wood we what we can see but look at the
tiny window of what we can actually see
compared with the number of
electromagnetic waves that are out there
from you know long waves radio waves
microwaves thermal infrared right up to
the ultraviolet the x-rays and then you
have to get to thin through the 19 with
these gamma bursts that are amazing
photons and there's also the other
problem maybe a one-one thing also to
just mention because when when I did a
bit of research on this it was amazing
it's the speed with which we can see you
know we can see again in the sort of
kilohertz region but there are now
cameras that are so fast that when you
switch on the light over there say this
is a scene that the camera looks at you
switch on the light here the camera
camera camera will resolve the light as
it travels across see you know in the
light the speed of light is it's very
fast
the other big difference is that we have
two eyes we're very proud of our two
eyes they allow us to see saris go
quickly but these artificial machines
have access to a hundred thousand
cameras that just web cameras all over
the world so the amount of information
that they can take in from anywhere in
the world you know how to eyes I can put
your glasses on maybe we might have a
telescope or something but but you
didn't have a hundred thousand webcams
that are available to you and this is
important because with a number of
cameras like in this car we can solve
the problem of autonomous driving and
let me just give you an example of the
fantastic amount of cameras and staff we
have in these autonomous cars so
starting off with radars for adaptive
cruise control then we have the lidar
this is a light based distance and
range-finding technology for emergency
braking pedestrian detection collision
avoidance then we've got another lot of
radar then we've got ultrasonics for
parking then we've got the whole thing
off both sides and round the back in
addition to that of course we've got all
the cameras
I don't never good
transport is a service how does this
work well very recently machine learning
has created a lot of excitement because
because of machine learning when you've
got good data sets these convolutional
neural networks as they are called allow
a computer to understand speech for
example better than a human so voice
recognition computers voice recognition
is now better than human but it also was
shown that it can see that better than
humans sorry the object recognition is
better than humans so if you if you have
you know a cat or a dog or or a car here
and this is the way it goes it's like a
neural network so you first do this
convolution that you you take a small
set of pixels and you you filter them
out then you've got these these real
sessions which simplifying it and you it
goes through a number of these layers
and there's a pool layer a number of
these layers they can be up to 100 deep
but at the end of it
it says well it's a car it's not a track
or an airplane or a ship for a horse
it's a car and this is this this of
course it's a tricky problem but this is
now really working extremely well now I
want to show you what happens if you've
got great freedom to design your leg we
know if a human lick but a robot of
course doesn't have the problem that it
has to have a thought it can have a a
wheel instead of the foot and this is
what it looks like when you've got a
wheel at the bottom of the lake this is
a an American company called Boston
Dynamics and it's really quite
remarkable how well this thing works
as you see can do
little pins with its knees I think it
might do it get there you go and because
you've got this design freedom when you
start from scratch because these things
don't have to live they don't have to
give birth to its children you just
design these things and make them in a
factory they can they can do amazing
things but they also do things quite
differently from us you know you would
never evolve a wheel instead of a foot
and you never would pick up a load like
this okay you know this makes sense
amazingly can go downstairs without
falling over which is surprising but
watch this it comes to a snowy day and
you'll see that it will slip in a moment
here we go and it didn't fall over so
the control loops that we now have I
really get getting quite good so we can
jump up and down and it even can show
emotion by jumping for joy so this
design freedom of course can be very
nice if you want to do this so let's
just go a little bit into more detail
what machine learning is and why this is
such an important development it was so
important that the science industry and
translation committee which I co-chair
at the Royal Society decided to dedicate
its first conference that we put
together on machine learning and we then
produced a report which I all if any of
you are interested in machine learning
it is a report that was written by
finest scientists in the country and
it's really a very readable report but
the definition that we agreed on in this
report is that the systems that learn
from data rather than following
pre-programmed rule
so the interesting thing is that as
we'll see in a moment it is not it is no
longer deterministic because it's not
rule-based so the programmer doesn't
determine everything that's happening in
the system but it takes its cues from
the data sets from what actually happens
out there in the world and by doing that
and doing it probabilistically as it
happens it has become the most powerful
tool that mankind has so far produced
there are different branches of
increasing a difficulty in machine
learning called supervised where you
have to label the data so if you've got
lots of pictures of people you say this
is John and the sixth Asian mrs. Herman
the unsupervised ones have no label so
you just group them together into phases
that look a bit like it might be the
same person and then you've got to add
the labels later on reinforcement
learning is an interesting one that
became very famous and successful when
you try to win a game because in
reinforcement learning the reward is so
clearly defined you know you get a
higher score in a game or you win the
game of chess or the game of Go so this
is still comparatively tractable the the
most sophisticated machine learning
environment that we've created is called
inverse reinforcement learning where you
don't know what the score is you don't
know what you're trying to achieve but
you can watch other people do it so you
basically watch people's behavior and
deduce from the behavior what they were
what they're trying to do with their
intent is what their reward function is
so some examples speech recognition I
already mentioned which is spectacularly
good now both with ok Google command or
a theory or Alexa that I'm sure many of
you have played with object and face
recognition is now better than than
human and those of you that have played
with Google photos I'm always amazed how
it finds you know my relatives in in the
photos even if they are not very sharp
and there are these recommender systems
so if you use Netflix or Amazon Prime it
will suggest a film that you might like
and sometimes you do if there is one
slide that I'd like you to remember from
this talk it's this one it's likely
involved but let me assure you it's
important it's this point about the
world not being made out of zeros and
ones you know we everybody knows that
the computer has binary systems we've
got very comfortable with that
everything is in zeros and ones and as I
said earlier on this seduced us into
thinking that we can describe the world
quite well but making statements that
are either true or false you know
something is big or something is red or
something is costs a hundred pounds or
something and you think that you can
give an answer to this question you can
say well this person is big or this
person wears a red jacket and it's sort
of seductive that you say well it's
either true or its false as it turns out
and there is a much more powerful way of
describing that and that is with a
probability you know if you see one of
these basketball players and he is so
seven foot five or something most people
would agree that he is tall so you will
give it a pretty high probability you
know does this move but most people
aren't seven foot five they're a little
pole-ish and if you say well he is of
you know 85% tall this turns out to be a
much subtler and better way of
describing people's Heights than just
categorizing it into tall or small
people and this turns out to be very
powerful so the basic concept that we've
to get comfortable with is not truce and
forceful falsehood but probabilities
said because that's the best way of
describing the world now what do we give
up we did give up determinism so the
nice thing about things being truth or
false you can then do these if sense
then statements so you can say well if
all humans are mortal Socrates is human
therefore poor chaps gonna die and this
is very seductive makes a lot of sense
but it turns out it is better if you
describe it in probabilities so you give
up the determinism because everything is
statistical
now we haven't have come across people
that haven't died yet except for the
ones in this room of course there are
some people that believe that maybe one
day we will fix this problem just
because this might just be possible it's
better to assign it a menu probability
certainly not this year but sometime in
the future that might be possible we the
the thing that we gained is that we
don't have to program it anymore and
we've got a program a bit but most of
the value of these machine learning
environments come from teaching from
providing the right training data sets
to the computer and the computer will
then figure out itself from the training
data set what the sensible thing to do
is but it does need a lot of data it
needs big data they're quite data hungry
these machine learning programs and the
big problem with this slide is that what
is it all for you know why should a
compute to do with is doing and there is
this big complex of this big conflict
because of course we respect these
artificial intelligent machines to do
something that fits in with our lives we
want to give them human goals but it is
not clear how we do this so this might
well be one of the biggest problems over
the next
a few decades I call it the Gini problem
because we're actually very bad at
wishing for the right thing so a few
words on artificial intelligence my
neighbor Steve Hawkins said that the
success in creating a I would be the
biggest event in human history
unfortunately it might also be the last
work this was a mistake here it comes
again and Elon Musk who is the sort of
new Steve Jobs in a Silicon Valley said
hope we're not just the biological
bootloader for digital super
intelligence
unfortunately that is increasingly
increasingly probable a new book has
just come out called life 3.0 button max
tegmark who is a physicist at MIT a
prophet who thinks quite a bit about the
AI of the artificial intelligence
problem and machine learning problem and
it's a very interesting concept because
he says life 180 sort of divides life
into a hardware component a software
component with a hardware of course is
our bodies and the software is our
culture and all those sort of things
that we can do when we think we're smart
so life one dot IO is the sort of
nematode worm that can evolve it's
hardware only through revolutions but it
can also only evolve its behavior
through evolution it can't teaches its
offspring where the better places to
find food etc but that's life to Dada
that's us you know we we can change our
bodies at the moment only through
evolution through lots of generations
that we've lived through in the past but
we have a culture so we teach our kids
how to speak in different languages and
so on and life 3 tato is just around the
corner now that we take control of our
bodies as well because we can now design
genes and synthetic biology is is
probably one of the most exciting
involves
scaring you a disciplines that is going
to make an impact on our health system
in the next five to ten years there are
these famous as the famous event that
happened in March 2016 it's over a year
that demis hassabis is also one of our
computer science graduates in Cambridge
wrote this program at google deepmind
that beat the best player at least at
all in korea why is this important well
until the demos devised this really a
very clever program called alphago all
the gold player all ago playing programs
were actually very poor go players and
the reason for that is that go is very
much more complex than chess chess is
actually quite an easy game compared
with with go because go is played on a
19 by 19 grid so there are actually more
configurations of these stones than
there are atoms in the universe it is
incredibly complex so there's no chance
in hell of writing a program that could
react to all these different
combinations so that's why all the
programs all the go programs were very
poor
until machine learning came along and
the way this was done was with
reinforcement learning and it started
off with a mediocre go program but then
it played itself 30 million times and
learned from every game and that was a
great success but the unexpected thing
happened in move 37 in game 2 so ago 1
alphago 141 now normally i do we have
any go players and they in the audience
good players
huh so I spent a bit of my time waste a
lot of my time when I did physics at
Cambridge Plager when I should have done
my homework and so you normally play on
line three
in the early part of the game if you
want to control the side of the board
and line four when you try to control
the center of the board
and this game 37 was played on line five
in in the first game this was such an
outrageous move that Lisa doll got up
and walked around for 15 minutes and he
couldn't make up his mind whether this
was a bug in the program it was in fact
so ingenious that the NGO community and
their about 40 million people in the
world playing go felt that this was a
move that showed intuition that photo
showed imagination so things that are
not normally associated with computers
they assigned this sort of human
qualities now to humanity's great
satisfaction
there was an equally brilliant move
Lisa doll move 78 in game form which won
him the only game that he he wants
others hope for us yet there's a bit of
history of AI but let's not go into that
let's just look at the disruption arm is
this successful company that we started
in Cambridge that produces
microprocessors and it was quite a nice
design of changing from the Intel Sisk
model or complex instruction set
computer to the risk model the reduced
instruction set computer and therefore
lowered the power consumption of
microprocessors and that's one of the
reasons why it was successful but the
bit that I want to talk about today is
not the better design but the change in
the business model the caused a
disruption in the industry
so Intel and this has to do with the
value stack so intel has the
intellectual property they design the
processor like arm does and so that's
the second thing but did it then also
manufactures it whereas arm choose the
licensing model and because we have the
licensing model we managed to license
this design to tsmc as taiwanese
semiconductor cooperation which is the
second largest semiconductor company in
the world plus four hundred and fifty
others and that's why arm managed to
become more or less a monopoly with a
ninety five percent market share in
mobile phones and intel is nowhere in
mobile phones and it's quite a
remarkable achievement for a little
cambridge company we've now shipped over
a hundred billion arms so this is about
ten times ten for every single person on
earth so you might ask well where is my
ten and the answer is in your smartphone
because i'm average good smartphone has
twenty arms in them it's not just the
main processor because but also the arm
in the USB the arm and the bluetooth the
arm and the Wi-Fi and lots of other
things they were sold for thirty billion
last year to Softbank and we're out
selling until twenty to one so Intel
really is a a niche player and in
microprocessors compared to us and it
has to do with two reasons for that one
is the low-power design which of course
is perfect for the Internet of Things
and mobile phones and the other is this
licensing model I give a different talk
at times called the six waves of
computing where I show that so far six
times that beam waves where people
dominated a particular wave and every
time the dominant company misses the
next wave the last time this happened
was with PC the PC company to see wave
is completely dominated by Intel and
Microsoft neither of them have any
market share in
mobile phones it is really surprising
that they miss it every time I thought
this was peculiar to the computer
industry I now believe this happens in
all industries and it's happening big
time in the car industry they've got two
of these disruptions coming at the same
time which happens rarely one is the
minor disruption which is the
electrification the much bigger
disruption is the disruption of
autonomous driving because it's not just
a technical disruption it is also one
that disrupts the business model so
let's look at why it disrupts the
business model it disrupts the business
model because it changes what the
customer does so the customer at the
moment goes into a showroom picks out a
BMW otezla a Jaguar by looking at
whether it's a beautiful car the
horsepower the petrol consumption the
price and then spends in tens of
thousands of pounds and buying a new car
in the new world with machine learning
and with this world of transport as a
service where you don't own a car you
make a ten-pound decision between
getting up in a restaurant and walking
out of the restaurant whether you go go
with uber or 5ai which is the the
company that wants to produce the first
autonomous driving service in London and
the people here the car manufacturers
become mere component suppliers for the
service companies so they are in real
there's a real disruption happening here
and a similar thing is happening in
healthcare where we move away from
treating no people to keeping people
healthy this 7030 thing will change to
5050 in sort of five to ten years and
that's a trillion dollars for shifts
there so this is the single biggest
opportunity I know of and again it's a a
change from treating the patients by
making sure that they never become
patients in the first place so let me
just make this point about life 3.0
again
you know we've reached I'm sure you've
seen this these sort of pictures before
but now we don't naturally select people
anymore because we've got so much
control over over our environment that
this is not the way evolution works
anymore what we really have is because
of Aristotle and Bayes and Alan Turing
we now have robots and so my conclusion
is that we have a new partner and these
are these artificial intelligent
machines and hopefully we can co-evolved
with them peacefully but there are lots
of people who paint very dystopian
futures at this mads all terribly with
them Schwarzenegger type machines
killing us all but there are equally
plausible utopian futures where we will
all live happily ever after with the
robots so I'll stop
very much indeed we've got some time for
questions perhaps I can ask for you
climb the falls on your last slide area
what impact do you think society at
large will be accepting these changes
and it's all terribly exciting yeah when
people start losing jobs yes yes well I
I was in Japan that among a number of
these panels on these issues and of
course this question always comes up on
how we relate to robots and whether
they're good good things and nice things
or bad things and the interesting thing
in Japan is they love robots because
there are lots of stories as you
probably know the Japanese society is is
quite an old society and an aging
society and one of the main uses that
they believe robots will have is
actually help the elderly and of course
they're always there they're always
patient they never get irritated and so
there's something to save for robots for
all people so I found and we also had
lots of artists people from the
humanities that we normally have on
panels here as well again their attitude
was completely different from the
attitudes that I normally find in in in
Europe but less so in the US where the
people in the humanities have this great
fear that the robots will take over or
they will create lots of make lots of
people redundant and and encroach in
there into their sphere whereas the
Chapin Japanese they're all looking
forward to having more tools to express
themselves so the artists were were keen
to have these new machine learning
abilities because they felt there and
bigger palette of opportunities to work
with one last point on the unemployment
situation this of course is not going to
be the first time that we have these
disruptions we've had these technology
disruptions as many times starting with
with the mechanical loom sulfide is
always
in the case that we've created more new
jobs than we've described then we've
destroyed all jobs unfortunately it's
not for the same people of course now in
the case of the - this was quite a
serious problem because it's very
difficult to retrain a miner into one of
those modern jobs but the jobs that
people have now are actually much more
retraining than the ones that we had
before so we hope that this will not be
as big a problem as some people make out
but we don't know because one of the
things that is true is that these
changes will happen much faster than
they ever have before if question about
can we have the microphone please no no
we need the microphone please remember
our friends in Aberdeen yeah my question
really is about data set and
particularly looking at something like
the opportunity around health do you
think we're going to be able to get
access to the rights of the databases
databases in the world now we're going
to be very careful about protecting
people's privacy now perfectly good
mathematical techniques to anonymize the
data and the power of machine learning
extracting really good information about
the likelihood and the treatment likely
that the person develops a certain
condition and the way to treat them this
is a fantastic opportunity and really
one of the biggest positive applications
of machine learning so I'm very excited
about that and there's some early
results that show that question that
could you wait for microphone please
yeah yeah
good evening my question is about the
new capacities of store information in
DNA or or quantum forests and in quantum
computers how how all of these things
fit in your talk because you didn't
mention yes machine learning that I
talked about a lot the other is the
blockchain and smart contracts because
it allows us to automate business
processes and a good example is mercs
it's the biggest container company in
the world
they spend 8 cents to actually transport
the goods but they'd spend 20 cents on
the paperwork so that goes with with the
transport so they are going to use the
blockchain and smart contracts to
automate that so it can really help us
with the productivity which is actually
one of the really critical problems in
Britain in particular Britain is very
bad productivity increases and it's only
productivity which can increase the
living standard in a country so product
is very important so machine learning a
blockchain and smart contracts in the
third is synthetic biology so the most
exciting company that I have at the
moment is a Cambridge company called
even ethics which tries to revolutionize
gene synthesis and if you can create the
genes from scratch you're basically
controlling life itself and this opens
up tremendous opportunities in
healthcare and you can fix things that
you know inherited diseases virus
illnesses called by viruses and so on
and so on so so and these are really
very very fundamental very deep
technology
changes that as I said will have you
know a significant impact on our lives
within the next three in the next five
to ten years not 20 to 30 years thank
you my question revolves around the
professions so with the increase in
capability of machines coming into play
how will that affect the professions
that we see today so accountancy law all
of these big information systems how our
machines gonna disrupt that sector yes
well they will be very disruptive and of
course hmm many of us were looking
forward to making many of these lawyers
you know redundant the and this is of
course one of the story that goes round
but if you actually look at what lawyers
like doing their it's actually like
doing the the drudgery of going through
lots and lots of documents all the time
they'd love to have that automated so
that they can do the bits that are the
clever bits the lawyers do they really
have got to think about how you know
people want to relate to each other and
what what they actually want to have
reflected in their contracts so the hope
is that this will make us a lot more
productive and will actually end up with
better contracts faster than before but
as somebody rightly said is very
difficult to make predictions especially
about the future
yeah three there could we have the lady
on the left first and then rate at the
back and then the guy could you tell me
what you think about
self-drive cars whether they're okay for
our towns or would they be of benefit
for motorway driving opinion on that yes
well I think they're wonderful and
they're wonderful the first reason why
they are wonderful is because it is
quite likely that they will reduce
accidents by a spectacular amount maybe
ninety percent now the reason for that
is not that they are particularly clever
but the the bar of being better than a
human driver is actually a very high the
autonomous driving industry
distinguishes between five levels level
five like in the company that I
mentioned five a guy is we don't have a
steering wheel anymore our pedals
because the car just just drives you and
you don't need to ever do anything and
it would drive you anywhere the weight
will start off and this is just around
the corner maybe just one or two years
is with trucks or motorways was that
where the the the driver drives the
truck onto the motorway and sends it the
next 500 miles all by itself and then
the car goes into a labor and the other
trucker picks it up again you know in
Edinburgh somewhere and then drives it
through through town or through country
lanes where it can't do it yet so this
is the first application is motorway
driving and Tesla for example provides
that now so you on an American Highway
you can go get into your Tesla drive it
onto the motorway and then sit back and
it will drive itself as you saw in the
video driving down Oxford Street is a
different matter
because this now becomes quite a
cultural thing as well because apart
from the car and the other cars are the
taxes and the buses and the bicycles and
the motor scooters and the best friends
that cross when they shouldn't you know
you actually have to track about 50
different objects and what we do so well
as humans when we look lo que de lui
didn't have any cameras in the back of
our heads we we sort of scan what goes
on and if you see a guy walking like
this oh you better watch out for this
one he might fall onto the street and we
picked this up in absolutely no time so
getting a computer to recognize these
behaviors and make the right predictions
of what these 50 different objects will
do next
this is tricky and I think it will take
maybe five years or so but not ten years
and then we'll have it in the city could
I just ask if there's anybody in
Aberdeen with a question to let
whoever's with you know and we'll
confirm the question through to here yes
I would be very interested to hear what
you might have to say about
sustainability in the future
ie you know we have all these machines
they need the energy we need our food if
we live longer and we you know populate
the planet more I mean I don't want to
become more of it and say I don't want
this but when it comes to sustainability
what's the perspective what howhow would
that be affected well it should have a
very positive effect on sustainability
because of the productivity increases so
just take you know the traffic example
the way a human drives is actually quite
stupid you know we saturate all the time
and we shouldn't that and then we break
hard if you know where the other cars is
our cars are as you would in a in an
automated environment you would never
accelerate more than
you absolutely need to and you will
break a lot less so you save a lot of
energy that way
you will always pick the optimum route
so you wouldn't go as humans do because
they know well if I go to Piccadilly
Circus and then hang a left I know I can
end up in Regent Park but you might find
you know much safer much shorter and
lower energy route so there are lots of
efficiencies that way and to be had the
the problem is a complexity problem so
one of the very interesting exciting new
tools that we have come from complexity
theory that you take very complex
networks of of things that interact you
know both human and and and machines and
the techniques are getting now good
enough so that you can optimize these
networks for particular results and
that's why I made this point in my key
slide that the the most difficult
decision that we will have to take as
humans is to choose these goals you know
what is most important to us is it most
important that we make sure we don't
heat up the the planet to mass is it
most important that we you know have
lots of fancy food or you know we're
gonna go for healthy food are we going
to go for more abit darien died and
therefore we didn't need to feed all
these cows that you know are much more
expensive than the than of vegetables
but these all become then explicit goals
that we as mankind have to make
decisions on and I'm a little worried
about that because we're so bad at it we
have a question from Aberdeen I believe
I've just received this there from dr.
Reiner Ava I'm at the university up Dean
he asks if to automatically driven cars
meet on a single track road which one
will reverse it's an excellent question
and it shows up the cultural differences
of different countries this is also the
problem of the the crossing with four
stop signs because if you've got four
stop signs in and four cars which one
goes first
and somehow humans saltless because you
don't get many four stop signs were with
for dead people because they couldn't
decide who's gonna move first so and
this is why it is likely that the
software for autonomous cars in Britain
will be different from the one in Italy
but the final answer to this particular
problem of who backs up first is it's
going to be random random you know the
final solution to all these are genuine
random number generators and that's
actually one of the interesting results
of new quantum computers you can have if
you have quantum qubits you can produce
genuinely random quantum numbers and so
there's a apakah physic solution to the
random number generation problem this
question is prompted by your machine and
brain comparisons do you see a future in
linking the two electronically so that
an individual can improve meant to brain
performance right maybe just playing
better tennis to begin with but the
sky's the limit perhaps yes yes and
there are lots of experiments along
those lines and it actually is quite
possible to grow nerve cells along
silicon chips and interact and interface
them in order to deal with a hundred
billion who we still have a big problem
because I think we can do it maybe a few
hundred those as the bandwidth isn't
isn't great but I do believe in that in
that coevolution that might also be
physical so the way people the way we
might become smart in the future could
take different paths one is the
incorporation of a more immediate
interface to computers and I believe
this makes sense especially when it
comes to memory because as I said
there's lots of it and it's actually
very reliable you know with this error
correction thing it's it's better than
certainly my memory now but the other is
that we can also improve our biological
system genetically and people are very
afraid of that because of the sort of
designer babies and all that but we will
start off dealing with lots of illnesses
like dementia and Alzheimer's and go all
that and I think this will have a very
positive effect since both might have to
be the last question how's that do you
visit your sign with a machine yeah this
is of course always one of the dangers
and this might mad well happen I hope
not but we're really getting on to the
domain of beliefs now my belief is that
there is nothing a human can do or feel
or art or music or anything that we
believe is very human that a computer
will not be able to do in the future
and the reason why I believe this is
because I believe that brains basically
obey the normal physics and chemistry
that that we know and if you believe
that we cannot simulate it and we cannot
reproduce it in a computer you basically
believe in a sort of
you know vis Vitalis or something or
some some supernatural thing and you
know being a scientist I'm just not
comfortable taking that step so I I do
believe that eventually they will be
able to do everything and sadly they'll
probably be doing it a lot better when
we are I think that's probably all we
have time for
I just like to close the proceedings
were presenting dr. Hauser with this
certificate from SC I with the Essie I
