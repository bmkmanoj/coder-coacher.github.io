tiny tiny bit behind time but that's
only because we started ten minutes
later I'm obviously in desperate trouble
with Roger for allowing it to go late
but I was trying to explain that this is
San Diego and we're very relaxed so I
hope that's okay
so if we get our speakers up on stage we
won't sit up on stage and we'll just
answer a few questions that are burning
to you we have a couple of roaming mics
do we and why don't I take a couple of
questions while we're assembling people
I'll try and remember them and then I'll
be able to speak them back and so on so
the gentleman in the black why don't you
ask the question me and then I will deal
with it in once we've got a lot of
speakers here yes right okay we've got
that one another one presentation I've
thought about this a long time myself
the difference between pleasure and pain
it occurs to me and I'd like you to
comment that it's somewhat like
dissonance you know there's pain and
pleasure is more like consonants it's
almost like some musical analogy the
musical analogy okay and one more
question I'll stack up and then I'll
stop giving them out so mutant algae
gentlemen yeah yeah this is a question
for dr. Penrose do you think that the
laws of the universe is the
consciousness or awareness of the
universe taking the fact that every
space and time moment of time in in
universe is aware of these laws itself
no I mean the universe as a whole not in
my opinion I mean you could imagine such
a thing but in my opinion consciousness
comes about when the proto consciousness
is organized orchestrated in a way in
relation to the first question which I
don't have any clear idea about I'm
afraid so I don't think the universe as
a whole is conscious it would need to
question sorry
oh I see the questions change my
question is that the since the universe
is aware of the laws every moment of
time and space knows the laws of
conservation sneed are to be true does
that mean it's awareness let's forget
the consciousness is the universe aware
of its laws constitute the awareness of
the universe not in my terminology I
mean the universe isn't universe as a
whole
is not in my view aware of anything it's
not
that's aware it's just an aspect of
consciousness and in my view I mean it's
not the whole of consciousness but it's
some aspect of it so no I mean we'd have
to the view is that you have to have
this reduction spontaneous reduction and
the spontaneous reduction is just an
element proto consciousness it's not the
universe as a whole it happens in
certain places so I can't see that the
answer to the question is yes in my view
basically to what extent is pleasure and
pain similar to music or some sort of
thing like that so when I get that you
know I felt I went already out on a limb
proposing that relaxing to a stable
state is feels Pleasant and going to an
excited state is unpleasant that just
struck me that this fits together was a
number of observations or logical
constraints so pushing it beyond says it
would be I don't know maybe somebody
comes up with sort of a measurement
protocol how we could assess I mean
obviously cannot be such a subtle
phenomenon in the human nervous system
and as of course all sorts of studies
what happens when you eat a cookie but
sort of breaking it down to at what what
are the systems that really correlate
with
Pleasant sensations that still far from
that I think pleasure is a learning
signal it's created whenever you feel
fill in need and it's proportional to
the amount of need fulfillment that you
do per unit of time with respect to
music the pleasure that's generated from
music has many possible dimensions one
of them is aesthetic you have a certain
structure discovery that possibly
piggybacks on some of the functionality
that we have for learning language then
there are physiological parameters that
might be elicited by music that you
entrain your physiological reasons and
your brain patterns visiting music which
itself can be intrinsically Pleasant
then there are social connotations that
go with music narrative connotation and
so forth they can fulfill many many
different needs in this means that the
music can be intrinsically Pleasant if
you are susceptible to one of those
needs this this question is regarding
neural networks so we have been talking
about deep view networks so as we
understand that it is a basic computing
unit and we also talked in morning about
microtubules so can microtubules be
considered as basic computing unit which
cannot have which which can you know the
quantum effect can be implemented using
it and the third part is that when we
talk about the concepts biologically
these are electrical spikes
how do concept translate to these
electrical spikes so I think the
question is is a neuron a computing unit
and how does a neuron represent concepts
gosh is there anyone here who'd like to
answer that question we don't have any
neurologists up here remember who would
like you're sure can't con you you can
do that one I don't think that concepts
are represented by individual neurons
they are represented by ensembles of
neurons and I suspect and it is this not
saying that it's completely consensus
yet because there are multitude of
theories on how that works
that concepts from a map that is
something like the address space of your
sensory motor scripts of the things that
produce your mental representations and
concepts are synchronized between
speakers through language which is why
we can use statistical analysis of
language to do machine translation these
machine translations work only on
concepts or structures nothing below
this they cannot imagine what the
concept means the concept is basically
what anchors different linguistic
symbols that are synonyms on some part
of a landscape and this landscape is a
map that is produced and held stable by
a multitude of different neurons that
are working together and forming
circuits and oscillators does this
answer your question
excellent middle middle back that I have
another question for you so in your
model what do you think the difference
between consciousness and
self-consciousness or let's say
self-awareness awareness the question -
oh sure right okay
so it's self awareness this also as time
as awareness of other things yeah let's
say we have the awareness or
consciousness about pain and you know
the awareness that you are okay I think
when you meditate you can discover that
your awareness of yourself can be
redirected on the awareness of something
else or inst you might identify as a
perspective being mr. universe itself if
you lose the connection or dissociated
to your self-concept
which means to identify for instance as
a human being or as a social person or
somebody who wants something and so on a
somewhat arbitrary it's a trick that the
mind uses to make a particular kind of
model and regulate that model and you
can change that model into becoming
aware of that you are the universe and
you have the illusion that there's a
cosmic consciousness because suddenly
your representation of the universe gets
unified with what you think is your
perspective 'ti on it but this is a
mental state
it's a difference between this
perspective self and the awareness of
having a consciousness of having
conscious access and the advances of
consciousness doesn't need to have
content it's the awareness of the fact
that there are a model of the fact that
there is a process that accesses your
own models the question was was it
itself awareness the same as awareness
of the world did I have that right I
mean the same kind of thing I would say
but self-aware I mean I'm just gonna
make a stupid obvious comment self
awareness is awareness of oneself and
awareness of the world is awareness of
the well they're just different the
awareness is the same but the different
things it's aware of three where you
said that it would be worthwhile to
replace the the top layers of a neural
network with a with a quantum computer I
would have expected the exact opposite
for example we when we do transfer
learning we remove the top layers of off
a neural network and replace it with an
SVM for example okay so why is it wise
my intuition wrong why wouldn't it be
that you would want the quantum computer
to discover better features for example
for example if you were to find I said
what we have done we have done like
little numerical tests for simulated
Quenton neural networks and then we
found for examples that we could learn
something like subset parity to a much
larger number of inputs and a classical
neural net essentially the classical
neural net would have to be larger to do
the same thing it would have more
parameters and therefore it takes a
longer time to learn so if you were to
find it's a mapping from 50 input units
to just one output unit for certain
types of learning tasks works much
better on a quantum neural network for
better meaning for example Louis
sample complexity you need less training
samples then you can easily use this in
a much bigger concept
sorry context by letting the lower level
tasks such as feature extraction be done
by the early layers of your neural
network I'm not saying this is the only
way to do it but this would be a very
straightforward way they often deep
neural networks even though they might
have thousands of output units they are
often if you use something like logistic
regression essentially each your own
fights for its itself these funnels that
end in single neurons and the output
layer so it's just a very
straightforward way to use a quantum
your network here and now as soon as we
discover even on a 50 input Quentin your
net some advantages okay so your
observation was basically about
efficiency and speed rather than better
features right that particular
observation yum in the moment I'm I'm
just after efficiency and speed yeah
okay thank you another question for
Roger maybe just a okay gentlemen on the
blue one in from the green and then
maybe you can negotiate between you as
to whether you've got the same question
or a different question okay my question
was for Roger Roger I don't understand
what your post collapse wave function
looks like if you look at the
spontaneous collapse theories developed
by a Phillip Perl and Durrani or a
median Weaver and so forth if you have a
particle which initially starts out as
confined to one dimension of space and
it initially starts out in a
superposition of two gaussians with
those gaussians are located in separate
places along the dimension of space then
the post collapse wave function is still
a superposition of two gaussians one is
just raised and the other is lowered and
there are technical reasons for why they
have to settle for this but what it
means is that the post collapse wave
function is still always a superposition
in the literature that's called the
tails problem so I'm wondering what the
post collapse wave function looks like
on your theory because it looks to me
that if your post collapse wave
functions also have tail
then you can never remove super
positions of space-time curvature don't
think I understood the question I mean
you have these ideas of yeah Corona of
involve look pre selection and post
selection and you can get cases where
you have rather extraordinary things
happening where they very rarely occur
but they seem to be rather strange I'm
not sure if that's what you're talking
about and I didn't quite see I'm Freddy
didn't understand the point at the end
okay so I under your physics is fairly
thorough so we probably that's a
discussion over a cup of coffee thank
you very much for that one gentleman the
green in the middle oh sorry
this is a question partly for Roger and
partly for everyone else and I'll set it
in context the question is very simple
why do you assume that there is only
classical physics and quantum physics
and everything you have to do with
computation computationalism
or any other computer calculations
you're using is only going to be looking
at quantum theory and quantum models
that's the question now I set it in
context in the human physiology
everything happens from criticality
everything in human regulation which
ultimately means the human mind happens
from complexity and complexity means
instability and the physics of
instability which is critical
instabilities has nothing to do with
either classical physics or quantum
physics so why'd you limit yourselves to
quantum physics well I'm gonna answer a
little bit of that question any question
ok so so that so I think that what
you're saying is that people on the
panel including me are only talking
about classical or quantum physics and I
think that that's wrong I think what
Roger is saying is that classical and
quantum physics are insufficient
right that something appears to be going
on in our heads that would require a
modification to quantum physics as we
know at the moment which is not quantum
physics as we know at the moment so
we're trying to add an additional
feature yes I mean the view I have is
that classical physics and quantum
physics are both approximations to
something that we don't know yet we get
some idea of what it's like but we need
to have a better theory than either one
or the other it's true that in many
circumstances you can treat it according
to quantum physics or according to
classical physics because the other part
doesn't play much of a role but yes
there's something more as James was just
saying and there's something more would
have us limiting cases current our
current view of quantum mechanics or our
current view of classical and general
relativity and so one has a more
inclusive theory it's not that you have
one or the other you have them the
bigger theory which may specialize in
some circumstances to look like quantum
physics or in other circumstances to
look like classical physics interesting
to see what the what I think there's a
it's a very interesting division between
us it's completely correct to say that
you are trying to go beyond current
physics you try to make an extension to
physics which is very bold because we
don't have data in particular it's more
conceptual we don't know what that is
going to be yet physics at the moment
assumes that the world is made from
quantum fields that evolve to some kind
of Hamiltonian or another mathematical
formalism that comes down to something
that is mathematically equivalent but
written down in a different way and it
could be that we change that but we
don't know about this and for us the
question is what kind of computation is
facilitated in this universe or outside
of this universe and what kind of
computation do we need to build the
equivalent of Minds what are things we
need computation that goes beyond the
computation that is known in physics
I think the classical computation is
probably sufficient
you think that classical computation is
probably sufficient but it's going to be
much faster with quantum computation
right well you hand the microphone Hamid
and he can answer that question yes so
maybe first I want to make a beat
observation in the sense that what we
observe is that quantum information has
given fields of physics that previously
were not talking to each other much the
common language so suddenly people who
wonder about information paradox of
black holes and wonder what happens if
you throw the qubit into a black hole
which is entangled with another qubit
that's outside of the event horizon or
condensed matter physicists or biology
folks they can all look at each other's
equations now and understand to some
degree what the other is doing so I
think that bodes very well for the next
10 years seeing interesting fusions of
areas of physics but of course the
fundamental part of your question is
more
Naiya and maybe a bad excuse but we just
take baby steps quantum physics is what
I have now what I somewhat understand
and we can build machines based on this
theory I'm not by any means saying this
is the end of it and of course history
of science would suggest that in
probably 50 years we will talk about
maybe Dave the torch's new constructor
theory or completely other forms of
physical theory I don't know but it's
like non-computational thank you
gentlemen the Hat I I know that most of
us here and most of the discussion
around artificial intelligence seeing as
we are human beings the model that we
have in mind the Holy Grail is to
replicate the human mind but seeing as
there are so many different forms of
intelligence on this planet is there a
benefit to the development of artificial
and tell
since looking at non-human forms of
animal problem-solving and other forms
of intelligence so this would be
squirrels and crows and dolphins and and
hands and bees and Tudyk are there
situations where non-human forms of
intelligence may be able to complete
tasks better than a human based AI
microphone the main form of artificial
intelligence will not be robots that are
existing on the same level of us the
main form of AI will be organizations it
would be corporations nation-states
universities whatever bill needs compute
to make sense of what it's doing and we
will be living inside of AI largely not
next to it it's not going to be robots
that compete with us for resources it's
going to be stuff where we are going to
be mostly the microbiome of course
there's also going to be intelligent art
effects but it makes probably more sense
to imagine robots as the extremities of
future AI in this sense we don't we
should not expect AI to be very similar
to human AI personally I'm interested in
building humanoid AI because I want to
understand how we work and also
interested for the same reason an animal
like AI because I'm interested in how
Minds work in general but in practice if
we are able build to build sentient
machines they are going to be
organizational things mostly and Roger
we've asked we've talked about whether
squirrels or dogs were conscious or
intelligent you know yes well I think
look at this question is that the reason
that AI seems to be trying to compete to
scratch the wrong word with human
intelligence is because that's what it's
trying to do I mean it's trying to play
chess or NGO or whatever it happens to
be or or do things that human beings do
and maybe sometimes try to do them
better than humans do it and we're not
so interested in trying to do machines
that do things better than squirrels but
I don't see why you shouldn't study that
it's just wouldn't you wouldn't get so
much money I suppose for studying
and a eye for squirrels but it seems to
me it's just this is the way it's
driving and that's why AI is aimed I
don't think it's at all like what humans
the way we think of what we do I think
what we think of what we do is much more
like what squirrels do than what yeah
does but that isn't perhaps the question
and heart when you're quantum AI
machines or your quantum computing
machines grow up and they become very
powerful will they look anything like a
human being or a squirrel or a dog or or
nothing like them when I wrote my PhD on
autonomous mobile robots these
strategies we use to have some navigate
as Institute and find back let's say
there's a power station that was very
much modeled after our ends or rats
navigate or simpler systems or sorry
simpler animals that was very
fashionable at the time and I'm still a
big fan of looking sort of at I think
for example the intelligence of a single
cell it's way under appreciated I think
if you look evolutionary periods I think
a single cell is probably the most
optimized machinery and I would like us
to think more what amazing feats or what
it would take to replicate the amazing
feats of a single cell the furnaces in
terms of quantum AI think I've made in
my talks as the case that I'm convinced
that's the most I think creativity can
be well described by or formalized by
finding a low point in an objective
landscape that expresses an optimization
landscape and commandment hence
optimization will be better in finding
those low-lying minima and hence will be
the most creative system we know to
build to date so they have no doubt
about that one important point is maybe
think about the difference between a dog
and a human what is that difference
between a dog mind and the human mind
one of the obvious differences of is
given by the affordances of the dog the
dog doesn't have had
it smells as much better smell than
humans and this means that the world
presents itself very different to a dog
the next thing that dog has different
needs the social needs and the cognitive
needs of a dog are very different as a
result it's going to pay attention to
very different things and it means it
learns very different things because you
only learn things that give you a reward
signals and you only pay attention to
those things that capture your attention
because you have a need that is related
to them and then the largest and maybe
most important differences that our
development is much much slow on her
brain is slightly larger than the one of
a dog which means and during our $1
cents queuing at the training phase of
our brain biz eva received vastly more
training data than the dog's brain so if
we get too much better abstraction the
dog can possibly can get too well I
think we're at time so it's a one more
burning question out there that someone
feels and must be asked will answer
today oh really but the gentleman right
at the back there that hasn't spoken so
far I have a question for a janosh and
I'm wondering if he feels up a current
modern digital computer could ever
become conscious running a software
program oh well that's that's the and
that's the topic isn't it and if not
what what hardware would be required to
make a computer conscious what hardware
would we need well to make a computer
conscious so roger penrose would say you
need to take advantage of the quantum
state reduction I mean this is a it's
not a question of using artificial
intelligence in the way we use it now
you need to have some something which
harnessed I mean it's in relation to I
think it was the first or the second
question which I didn't have a clear
answer to namely you would have to in my
view have a way of taking advantage of
what's going on in quantum state
reduction see at the moment it's very
hard even to see the effect at all and
an experiment so we're way way off it
but without doing that in
my view we don't have consciousness at
all so in my view none of the devices
artificially intelligent devices
computer driven devices have any
consciousness at all unlike us something
is going on in our brains which involves
on the view I hold the reduction of the
quantum state and that being correlated
orchestrators over large areas of the
brain and that would in in on this view
in that consciousness but we're so far
off doing that at the moment we don't
even know from physical experiments that
this process that I'm talking about
actually exists we know that something
must happen in and you're sure do you
think a computer could just do it you've
only got like a one sentence answer
roughly a year ago I taught a class at
MIT about the future of AI and I took a
small survey in that class on what kind
of hardware do we need to build a mind
that is capable of human performance and
consciousness and so on I think most of
us felt that conscience is going to be
naturally emerging as soon as the system
starts to model its own attention
properly and the capacity for doing that
the majority of the class was quite
optimistic we thought we can probably
run a person on 200 gigabytes if you
only knew how we don't know how if you
have a pretty optimistic with respect to
this but we have some reason to believe
that these numbers might already be
sufficient we had a couple students that
thought we need petabytes and we had one
student that we thought we need exabytes
but there were the outdoorsters Rocha a
quantum gravity computer you're sure a
big enough computer and I you undecided
at the moment no but you're asking the
wrong person and personally my view on
this was upon psychist the view is that
essentially I think consciousness is
associated with elementals of physics
and we should most think about it like
mass or spin or possibly a state
reduction as Roger suggests in that
sense
consciousness pervasive it's turning a
grain of salt sand I would say there is
some proto conscious present so sort of
the wrong question
you don't know machine would do it the
universal sort of computing yes of
course because because first of all it's
not quantum gravity because the term
quantum gravity means the correct
application I mean the quantity
application of what we regard as current
quantum mechanics to gravitation theory
whereas this is almost the opposite its
gravitational quantum mechanics I
shouldn't I shouldn't sorry
fated you in that way yeah we need a
good term for a relativistic quantum
computer or a quantum a modified quantum
computer thank you everybody
