you this evening my name is Megan
Cassidy Welch I'm the head of the school
of philosophical historical and
International Studies or sophist here at
Monash tonight is the second annual
sophist public lecture the lecture
series is designed to do two main things
really the first is to bring together
the wide community of those who are
attached to or interested in the
activities of the school and in this
regard I'm delighted to see students and
staff members of the wider community and
alumni here this evening so I welcome
you all very warmly the second purpose
of the lecture series is to showcase
some of the areas of strength within the
school surface is a pretty large school
we encompass history ancient cultures
international studies Medieval and
Renaissance studies the Australian
Centre for Jewish civilization religious
studies philosophy of and of course the
Monash bioethics Center and this is the
area with which tonight's lecture
intersects the Monash bioethics Center
was established in 1980 by Professor
Peter singer as Australia's first
Research Centre devoted to bioethics and
it's developed since then into one of
the world's leading centres of its kind
the initial proposal to establish a
Center for Bioethics at Monash in 1980
spoke of how recent developments in
human biological research raised many
ethical and social problems problems
which affect individuals but also
problems that have wider implications
for future generations
and that proposal asked for support to
establish a centre to research those
problems since that first proposal all
those years ago the centre has has grown
significantly to become amongst other
things a World Health Organization
collaborating Center for Bioethics its
research and training has has huge
impacts on approaches to ethical issues
around the world through its graduate
program and of course through the
expertise and reach of its staffs
research projects now of course
currently directed by Professor Michael
circulate tonight we're especially
delighted to welcome our speaker
professor Julian
Valeska a long time very close associate
of the Mohnish bioethics Center
professor savelist who holds degrees in
medicine neuroscience and bioethics all
from Monash University and has held the
uhero chair and practical ethics at the
University of Oxford since 2002 he's the
director of the Oxford Yahiro Centre for
practical ethics within the Faculty of
philosophy there and his director for of
the Oxford Centre for neuro ethics which
is one of the three strategic centres in
biomedical ethics in the UK funded by
the Wellcome Trust he's also director of
the Institute for science and ethics are
within the Oxford Martin School at the
University of Oxford where he examines
the ethical implications of technology
affecting the mind as well as leading an
interdisciplinary program on collective
responsibility for infectious disease he
is a world leader in medical and
practical ethics his Jo editor of the
Journal of medical ethics and his
founding editor of the Journal of
practical ethics and open access journal
at Monash is the saloon matheson
distinguished visiting professor and
he's held that title since 2009 and his
an honoured professorial fellow also at
the fluorine Neuroscience Institute he
received an honorary Doctorate from the
University of Bucharest in 2014 and
we're delighted to have him here tonight
professor Savalas news talk is entitled
unfit for the future the urgent need for
moral bioenhancement please join me in
welcoming very warmly professors
thanks very much meeting it's a great
privilege to be giving this lecture and
as Megan said all of my degrees have
been from Monash University so I've had
a fantastic start in academic life and I
really oh where I am today to the
fantastic education I had at Monash both
in medicine and also in bioethics with
Peter Singer so I'm gonna talk today
about a book I produced in 2012 but
actually the idea dates back to 2008
where my Swedish colleague in my person
and also Tom Douglas at the time had
just finished his his doctorate with
with me we kicked off this idea of moral
bio enhancement using the advances of
science to make people more moral and as
Rob Sparrow and my colleague at at the
centre if you involve he said you know
we really kicked off this idea which has
gained quite a bit of traction not only
now in bioethics and philosophy but in
psychology and neuroscience and actually
I think this project is it's probably
the most important project there is
today in academia and I'll try to
explain why and the predictions we made
in 2008 have sadly come true and I'm
gonna be pretty pessimistic today about
the future so let me just start off with
a quick quiz what's the cause of climate
change standard answer is carbon
emissions what's the cause of terrorism
standard answer religious fundamentalism
what's the cause of the Fukushima
nuclear disaster standard answer is a
tsunami but in all these cases these are
really the symptoms of the underlying
disease they're the proximate causes but
not the original causes the original
cause is us that's an old photo of when
I used to be live in Australia see what
it's done to me being in England for 15
years
so I'm going to tell me that when you
join an Oxford College you have to buy a
new set of clothes because you grow so
large so we know what caused the
tsunamis and we know how to avoid them
so the choice to build a nuclear
facility with a certain level of
protection a certain place a human
decision so for the first time in human
history
you know our fate is largely in our
hands and whether the century is a
stunning century Jim Martin founded
Oxford mark school with 150 million u.s.
dollars aimed at precisely this idea
that this century is different to every
other century that our incredible
technology globalization these these
features of society today mean that we
need a live in poverty we needn't have
inequality but they also mean that we
could destroy ourselves and this is a
power that humans haven't really had and
except around the Turner the middle of
last century when they developed nuclear
weapons so until that point humans had
quite a lot of power but not the awesome
power that they have today so we have
this incredible technology but just to
give you a tiniest snapshot of the sort
of idea 1% of the human population of
psychopaths that's not to include
fanatics and ideologues and other people
bent on on mass destruction and Richard
Posner a former Supreme Court judge in
the US has estimates enough plutonium
floating around the former Soviet Union
to make 20,000 atomic bombs and even
more scary oh this is a slide from a
Swedish man called Richard Heindel who
just sourced himself as a private
citizen enough radioactive material mera
curium uranium and so on - almost
fire a nuclear reactor and started
experimenting on it
kitchen and he was only caught when he
called police to ask them if his
experiments were legal
so more scary though than dirty bombs or
nuclear weapons are biological weapons
so the slide on the bottom right is
polio virus and number of years ago
scientists were able to for the first
time artificially create polio virus
using DNA subunits widely available on
the internet so you can basically build
your own polio virus smallpox is larger
than polio and so far to my knowledge
Michael can correct me because he's the
world expert on this hasn't been
constructed because it's larger but it's
only a matter of a few years before you
could make smallpox and smallpox is the
ultimate biological weapon because 30
percent of people against errors here
and correct me if this is wrong
30 percent of people who come within 3
feet of somebody infected with smallpox
will will develop it and and 30 percent
of them will die extremely infectious to
weak latent period perfect viewport
smallpox in 12 major capitals around the
world before you realize there was an
epidemic so many people would be
infected that you'd be unable to control
it and it wouldn't just wipe out a
couple of thousand people not even a
couple of hundred thousand people but
literally millions of people so there's
a film called twelve Monkeys Hollywood
is very good at you know employing very
smart people to source possible
trajectories in the future and 12
monkeys with Brad Pitt and Bruce Willis
depicts just this nightmarish biological
scenario so on the top left is is a
mouse infected by Mouse pox around the
year 2000 scientists a Canberra trying
to control a mouse play developed a
modification of Mouse pox they changed
into Luke and gene and they they aimed
at making mice just infertile they're a
humane way of controlling a mouse plague
instead they produced a super lethal
strain at Mouse pox they killed one
hundred percent of mice now Mouse pox
very similar to smallpox human smallpox
this was published on the internet
immediately obvious you could do the
same genetic modification in the
interleukin gene and change smallpox and
make smallpox or 30% lethal but a
hundred percent lethal so there is a
stash of smallpox in the US and in the
former Soviet Union that you know that
they keep but you needn't get to that
stash you could just with the
small-scale laboratory make such a
biological weapon now remember there's
seven billion people that's 70 million
psychopaths in the world not to mention
the religious fanatics and ideologues
and so on is one of those individuals to
say well I think I might want to make
smallpox and release it around the world
and and we're stuffed so it hasn't
happened yet and Steven Pinker has this
book called the better angels of our
nature and says we're living in a safer
world than ever your risk of being
murdered in the street lower than any
time in human history and that's true
but our risk continues to track the
power of technology so as technology
exponentially increases in power so does
our capacity to do enormous harm or what
Ingemar and i called ultimate heart that
is wipe out humanity so this is a
picture chart with smallpox
now the thesis of our book is that
humans we take a Darwinian view of human
beings but this Darwinian story this
evolutionary story it's not necessary
for what we want to say it's enough to
say there's 70 million so I could pass
in the world that's enough we don't need
to explain why there are psychopaths but
I think this is interesting and I find
it compelling humans evolved from apes
and they evolved in small groups of a
hundred and fifty that cooperated with
each other on the African savannah and
cooperated with their group but would
often compete with other human groups
for resources and morality and moral
psychology evolved to enable those
groups to survive those small groups of
150 so you could control problems of the
group over exploiting a resource the
so-called tragedy of the Commons
by the group observing each other's
behavior punishing freeriders and your
contribution made a difference and you
trusted each other that's how we managed
the problem of exploitation of resources
throughout nearly all of human history
so for most of human history we couldn't
see hundreds of years into the future we
didn't have science we had what was it
before us and our brains adapted to
processing the world according to the
way it was for us so we have a whole
bunch of psychological heuristics now we
understand that shaped the way in which
we perceive reality so we don't see an
accurate picture we're more averse to
losses
we're insensitive to numbers so people
empathize with other human beings but on
a one-to-one basis the more people they
have to empathize with the less they
actually are moved to to to helping
behavior so Stalin recognized this he
said the death of a hundred people is a
tragedy the death of a million is a
statistic but actually psychologically
that's that's a rule for humans so we
don't process a million times suffering
so and our moral rules evolve to enable
us to survive as those groups so we we
punished people who harmed members of
our group but we didn't require
obligations of beneficence or benefit so
we have what's called an acts omission
distinction in our ordinary common sense
morality and we think we're only
responsible for what we cause but not
for what we allow to happen so that's a
that's a standard feature of human moral
psychology that affects medical decision
making doctors are more likely to
withhold life prolonging medical
treatment and find it more acceptable
than they are to withdraw a life
prolonging medical treatment and even
less likely to provide euthanasia so
this is our moral psychology so why is
that well what's the relevance of that
as human animals we we basically are the
same as our hunter-gatherer ancestors we
have the same psychology we might have
incredibly powerful computers and
incredibly advanced language
our moral psychology our psychology is
the same as for the two hundred thousand
years in which human beings have been in
existence because in in evolutionary
trend that's a blink of an island we
have not evolved much in ten thousand
years but in ten thousand years we've
moved from living in small groups of 150
to living in megacities to living in a
globalized world with democratic
institutions and ever escalating
technological power so we're not evolved
we're not we're not fit to live or use
the world in the way in which we've
created because of our enormous
cognitive powers so the 2008 article I
wrote were thinking about person said
that our moral advancement has not
matched our cognitive advancement we can
do things that no human could even dream
of in the past but basically our moral
development is the same as Aristotle and
Plato we're not much more advanced than
people 2,000 years ago now so the theme
of this book is three features put us of
what we have created put a set at a
perilous risk today one is liberal
democracy which I'm not going to talk
about but that was the theme of the book
and the events in the u.s. have have
sort of borne out the shortcomings of
liberal democracy and Francis Fukuyama
had this incredibly naive book in the
early 90s called the end of history
where he claimed that democracy had
proven itself to be the final point of
political order and you know that's just
not true and what you see today are the
problems of democracy short election
cycles unwillingness to invest in the
far future unwilling us to impose costs
on on citizens and so on I'll come to
that but the two features I want to
concentrate on globalization and
technological advance the globalization
means that you know we are now in a
power and we now have the power to
affect people all over the world but we
choose not to so two of the features of
our moral psychology as we focus on the
book sorry then of the result of our
moral psychology
our failure to aid so in 2008 only five
countries all of them Northern European
gave the very modest amount of 0.7% of
GDP to foreign aid and I think the UK
now also gives two point seven percent
and the two biggest economies the u.s.
and Japan gave the least at that time so
we could we could cure poverty it's a
choice not to cure and in fact
inequality increases so when we wrote
this you know the three richest men had
owned once one hundred two hundred
billion dollars in the wealth wealthiest
fifth of the world's population stood
for eighty six percent of the world's
GDP last week I just told that the
richest 500 individuals in the world now
own what I think two or three years ago
the richest 1000 individuals in the
world owned so inequality is actually
increasing and and the reason for that
is the acts omission bias and a number
of other moral biases and heuristics
that we employ another problem that we
face is climate change which is
essentially a global tragedy of the
Commons
and as I mentioned through most of human
history we're dealt with these through
observing each other's behavior
punishing free Weider's trusting each
other
however climate change is a problem
we're not psychologically fit to deal
with because it involves huge numbers of
people millions of people who are
anonymous to us our contribution makes
no difference we can't observe
freeriders we don't trust the effects
will be borne by people in other
countries far in the future to whom we
don't care about there are a whole bunch
of psychological reasons why we're
unlikely to voluntarily agree to the
sorts of cuts that need to be made to do
with something like climate change we're
just psychologically not fit through a
through a liberal democratic political
arrangement to come to those sorts of
agreements now I'm not saying we
shouldn't try and I'm not saying we
can't use the knowledge we have of human
psychological biases to try to engineer
that sort of
census so the point of our book was not
to say we should give up what we've been
doing indeed we should use a scientific
knowledge of human psychology and
cognitive science to try to better
engineer political processes and to
better engineer policies that will
secure the values that are important to
us like moving to an opt-out system for
organ donation this is a simple strategy
that takes account of status quo bias in
order to increase the supply of organs
so again
Australia does incredibly poorly in
terms of organ donation despite spending
millions of dollars in donate life and
Kevin Rudd you know talking up you know
involving families Spain has an opt-out
system it has double the organ donation
rate we should just move to an opt-out
the organs are no use to you after
you're dead it's a zero cost rescue it's
it's an ethical no-brainer now the fact
that we haven't moved to an opt-out
system and the fact that we even think
is as an issue shows how backward
morally we are it's it's it's not it's
not an appointment to this death with
dying being at the Monash Medical Centre
the fact that we're still donate
debating voluntary euthanasia is an
expression of these sorts of
psychological obstacles we have to
making even minimal moral progress so
we're not going to deal with climate
change and since we wrote this every
year the you know our predictions have
come true so we had the idea that not
only should we look at political reform
look at liberal institutions look at
human psychology but we should also look
at changing the underlying animal the
human being for the better to make human
beings morally better now you might be
skeptical that you could actually bring
about such a lot large-scale change in
humans but looking at our previous
successes I'm sure that it is possible
there are 300 different breeds of dogs
all of them come from a small group of
canyons and wolves some are smart some
are stupid summer lazy some are
hardworking some vicious summer
Placid at all genetic it's all the
result of what's called selective
breeding and we're not that different
from dogs but I hate to tell it tell you
but you know we're pretty we're more
similar to our animal relatives than we
are different now what took us ten
thousand years you could do today so in
2012 I wrote a paper with Tom Douglas
and Abby Mets I student from from Monash
who we've got to be mid side now had a
born who's now Pediatrics registrar
looking at what we call in vitro
gametogenesis so you could take today a
skin cell and develop pluripotent stem
cells from it using Yamanaka factors
that Shinya Yamanaka won the Nobel Prize
create germ cells and produce eggs or
sperm you could even produce eggs if
you're a male and sperm if you're a
female
so homosexual couples in principle could
have their own child with a mixture of
DNA from both of them but what you could
also do is you could produce not just
ten embryos not just 20 embryos but a
hundred thousand embryos and then you
can start to test for large numbers of
genes that would enable the sort of
genetic selection that would be
necessary to bring about major changes
such as in dog breeding in fact Rob
Sparrow my colleague and Nick Bostrom
one of the sort of world's leading
transhumanists have talked about another
version of this called iterated embryo
selection this is where you use
pluripotent stem cells to produce
embryos that then you take stem cells
out of you again derive eggs and sperm
and you do iterated cycles of embryo of
producing new embryos using new selected
trays compressing you know a thousand
generations into a few years so you know
they looked at the impact this could
have on cognitive capacity and they
estimate and again even if these
speakers are wildly out the power to do
something very significant is there so
they estimate that
with ten generations of selecting one in
ten embryos you could raise IQ by more
than a hundred points and so if this was
widely adopted so that you had greater
than 90 percent adoption and you had
this iterated cycle of embryo selection
you could achieve more than a hundred
plus points across a population and
completely change society so if you
could do that for cognitive ability you
could also do it for moral ability or
moral skills and I'll talk a little bit
about what they might be in in a moment
so that's embryo selection so that is
one way in which you potentially could
change the future generations of human
beings of course there's also simple
enhancement technologies and the world's
second largest export is an enhancer
it's caffeine but there's Ritalin
Adderall human growth hormone and a wide
range of other enhancement technologies
now all of you have seen the power of
enhancement to change performance it's
been very high-profile in sport because
it works and it's safe and it changes
human performance but any human
characteristic can be either reduced or
enhanced not only physical capacity not
only memory not only cognitive ability
capacity to love moral behavior anything
that has a contribution from our biology
can be bio enhanced and everything that
matters about us has a roughly 50%
genetic and contribution so on the left
is a fluorescent rabbit on the right is
a fluorescent human embryo created by
transferring a gene from a jellyfish
into the rabbit or the human embryo so
this shows you can you can make huge
changes you can make a fluorescent human
being I hope I've had this slide for 15
years in fact today
gene-editing is a much more powerful
technique of doing the same thing so in
the front is a genetically modified
Mouse and in the back is a normal Mouse
and they're hungry and they're running
for food and they're running at the
basically limit of what mice can run is
20 meters a minute and after 200 meters
the normal Mouse is exhausted collapses
can't go any further the genetically
engineered mouse goes not for 200
kilometers it goes for 5 kilometers its
orders a magnitude greater and what was
this genetic change it was a small
change in the sugar cycle the way in
which sugar was metabolized by the mouse
so why don't we have super mice in
nature well the mutation just might not
have naturally occurred or it might have
been too expensive you had you have to
eat twice as much if your super Mouse
and so they didn't they couldn't survive
but today we can create super mice in
the laboratory and we can create
superhumans again the mouse sugar cycle
is very similar to the human sugar cycle
so this is a Belgian blue cow it's been
it's been created by introducing a gene
that inhibits myostatin a hormone that
normally stops muscles from growing and
these are some dogs that have been
enhanced using the same myostatin
inhibitor and actually this was
originally found you know in a German
family where the children from a very
early age started developing muscles the
size of Arnold Schwarzenegger was found
they had a natural mutation in the
myostatin gene so not only could it
happen in animals he could or non-human
atoms would happen in humans so CRISPR
is the sort of new way of doing precise
genetic engineering but it's nothing
really
that new in terms of concept it's just
about modifying genes and inserting you
see it's just means you'll have less
off-target mutations and again another
genetically engineered dog not only
could we do gene editing we can use
conventional technologies oscar
pistorius could run faster than Usain
Bolt it's just that we put
it's on the quality of the Kevlar and
the construction of his artificial limbs
we can also use neuro technologies to
modify human behavior this was depicted
in the book by Anthony Burgess in the
film by Stanley Kubrick Clockwork Orange
and whenever I give this talk mr.
Hubbard it's just like Clockwork Orange
well it could be but it could also be
like this my favorite study of real-life
moral bioenhancement or the potential
for it comes from Israel where
researchers studied judicial decisions
and they looked at the time of the case
during the day and they found that your
chance of getting parole dropped off
markedly from the time the judge last
ate a meal this is highly statistically
significant so whether you get parole
will depend on how hungry your judges
that's a physiological factor now maybe
they were too lenient and when that was
at all sleepy and happy or maybe they
were too severe at the end but what
seems pretty clear is that whether you
go to jail or not should not be
determined by the physiological state of
your judge the hunger and that's
something that could readily be
corrected you could require simply
judges having regular meal breaks or
more regular meal breaks in the extreme
you could put them on glucose strips no
both of these would be a form of moral
bioenhancement very simple and crude but
it could make a life-or-death difference
to people this is one of the crazier
ideas people had for dealing with Hitler
in the Second World War people proposed
putting estrogen in his food to make him
more like he's docile kind sister and he
was that's crazy in fact that's what we
do for pedophiles hormonal castration is
a crude form of moral bioenhancement
it's changing people's motivations it's
changing their behavior in order to
control or suppress an undesirable a
socially under
or morally corrupt behavior five states
in the u.s. employ hormonal castration
I think the Czech Republic even has
surgical castration for pedophiles now
another paper that I wrote with Neal
levy and colleagues in Oxford looked at
it from the angle of what we're already
doing many of you are on drugs which are
affecting your moral decisions so here
are some examples antidepressants like
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
one of the commerce forms of
antidepressant some of you probably on
my mother's on them okay what do they do
well they reduce anxiety they reduce
depression they increase cooperation
they reduce your criticism of other
people they lead to fairer distribution
of resources they need to increase
diversion to harming people
and essentially facilitate cooperation
they also make you less able to cry less
able to orgasm less able to empathize
with others so they have moral downsides
or they have a complex range of moral
affects it's not that there are
straightforward moral enhancer but they
have moral effects and most people are
unaware that the drugs that are taking
having those sorts of effects another
one
it's the oral contraceptive pill or some
of you may be on glucocorticoids like I
am for asthma these release oxytocin
oxytocin is a neuro hormone that's
released during sex during breastfeeding
during touching during massage and it
increases Trust increases
trustworthiness increases cooperation
but all of these effects are only within
your in-group what your baby or your
partner they actually reduce cooperation
without group members so again they have
a complex range of effects but some
people have been using like Adam
descaler in New South Wales oxytocin can
be delivered by nasal spray as a part of
couples counseling therapy and in a book
I'm writing with Brian upon love drugs
on enhancement of love
we use this as an example of a potential
love drug in combination with couples
counseling MDMA is another example of a
drug that has in some studies had
beneficial effects on dysfunctional
relationships so testosterone another
substance a morning the morning
testosterone level in a male trader in a
strong market predicts his profitability
testosterone reduces empathy in women
who take it it doesn't increase
aggressiveness it increases concern with
social status so people who don't know
they're taking testosterone Canning
you're engaging in Farah bargaining so
it has a complex range of effects in
Oxford we Sylvia turbek one of my PhD
students study the the provider and if I
still use the anti anti hypertensive and
anxiolytics propranolol a beta blocker
it's a widely used drug very old drug
this drug reduces unconscious racial
bias another feature of our moral
psychology which you can see writ large
in the United States and Europe is we're
all racist we are all racist because
that's humans are programmed to identify
in-group members and pick out our group
members and to be wary and distrustful
of them because through most of human
history you could be exploited or even
directly harmed by any aggressive out
group so we're very very quick at a
subconscious level to identify people
from in our group and this has picked up
on what's called the implicit
association test now of course you can
overcome this it's not that it's
inescapable but it's difficult and
Americans value an American life at
2,000 times the value of a non American
life and that's an expression of our
in-group moral psychology now Sylvia
showed that the drug propranolol can
reduce this unconscious racial bias
so what's suggesting here on goes
entrepreneurial what it shows that and
it probably acts at the level of the
amygdala or other other areas involved
in emotional processing but what it
shows is that the stuff we put into our
body not just affects how hungry are and
how likely how angry we are and how
likely we are to give somebody parole or
not it can also affect ordinary
behaviors and the way which we treat
each other not only drugs nolle genetic
engineering but brain stimulation or the
magnetic or electrical can course modify
the brain and so modify moral behavior
in one experiment people use
transcranial electrical stimulation to
make people better Liars in another
study stimulating the right
temporoparietal junction which is an
area of the brain here which we use to
ascribe what someone's mental state is
when they when they acted so we had to
read each other's minds to work out what
people were trying to do and whether we
could trust them and whether we could
cooperate with them and so when they
stimulated this area they found that
people were less likely to judge as
wrong attempts to harm people other
people that were unsuccessful
so essentially change the way in which
they screw ascribe blame so our moral
psychology is not as people like Michael
Sandel and John Harris think is some
pristine forest that you know giving
drugs or using technology would bulldoze
down everyday everything every way in
which we behave shaped by our biology by
experiences by our environment and it's
not as if we're all the same another
basic fact about human beings is there's
a variation in every characteristic
height/weight empathy cognitive ability
trustworthiness psychopathy and we draw
a line between health and disease and we
draw a line by
on a statistical point two standard
deviations below the mean but that's
just a point that cuts out the bottom
two percent so the people on the
left-hand side of the curve may well
have all the people on the right-hand
side of the curve all half of the
population may have a disadvantageous
tray given a certain value so we're
increasingly able to use technology like
neurofeedback twing improve our skills
so this has been used in trying to
rehabilitate criminals even altruism has
genetic variations different variants of
the comte gene are associated with
greater altruistic behavior empathy is
another area where society is changing
so a large meta-analysis of the United
States psychological research a large
collection of all the research and last
40 years showed that American people are
becoming less empathetic now that might
be a good thing or it might be a bad
thing or it might be an indifferent
thing but it is happening and given that
we have the potential to change that
which would ask is that a good change is
that the sort of thing that we want to
encourage or is it the sort of thing
that we want to discourage through
education transcranial electrical
stimulation is something I've mentioned
that we were working on in oxygen and in
my view the most likely way in which
moral bioenhancement could potentially
occur is actually in our children I
think what we need today is the secular
moral education in education around
certain moral values like equality
justice respect for autonomy
non-discrimination and I think people
need to learn to assimilate those values
and develop moral skills that we need in
a population so I don't think that we
will find those in religious education
and once we have a program of moral
education that's secular that we can
agree on that
embodied the sorts of values we want to
encourage it's quite possible that
technology will accelerate our ability
to learn those skills and concepts
because tDCS is one example where it
increases the acquisition of any skill
motor skill
numeracy language by selectively
stimulating the brain you can of course
change its function and I believe we
ought to research ways in which this
could be done to achieve our goals
because we are at a crossroads because
of the problems of globalization and
massive technological advance so some
people are puzzled about why doping is
so widespread in in sport and here's the
explanation this is a humanik graph of
population hematocrit which is the
percentage of red blood cells in the
blood and as I said it's a normal
distribution so the more red cells
you've got the better you'll be at
distance events involving a carriage of
oxygen it's no advantage to you you say
in volt great advantage if you're at
Lance Armstrong or a marathon runner so
those people on the right hand side
curve massive advantage so what do our
eats do they go and train at altitude or
they go into a hypoxic air tent which
pushes their haematic return a chiral
across to the right or they also take
drugs like Ipoh which mimic a natural
hormone in the body or they only just
take their own blood back as a
transfusion so if you find somebody with
hume addict root of 50 they're gonna
have an advantage over somebody who's 42
and how will you know if they don't with
EPO or their own blood the only way to
tell is if you saw a sudden increase
from 42 to 50 because they could be
naturally at 50 and it's completely safe
because 50 is within a normal
distribution and if you take micro doses
of Ipoh or you take the blood donation
at the right time you won't be caught
and the whole idea of a biological
passport is meant to pick out this
difference but as soon as you work out
how it's done you can get around it and
the reason why doping must fail is
because people are doping with natural
substances that aren't harming them and
also it's perfectly safe so one of the
things I've argued is that we should
allow physiological doping these not
these distribution curves have profound
effects for individuals the IQ curve
will
determine what sort of job you can have
whether you can be a professional or not
you need an IQ of 95 to complete a tax
return in the US and it's also important
for society a three point increase in IQ
across the whole population would add
one and a half percent to GDP and about
150 billion to the US economy so the US
military has said even a small increase
in population level like you would have
the same effects as the introduction of
the internet reduce poverty by 25% males
in jail by 20 the massive effects all
could be achieved through a very very
modest bioenhancement okay so how should
we decide on whether to go down the path
of this kind of radical application of
technology I should say that my idea of
ethics is it should be stimulating to
you to think I'm I'm sure at this point
none of you agree with what I've been
saying which is fine
hopefully I've highlighted some things
to think about and I'm going to give you
my way of thinking through it but I
don't expect any of you to agree with me
and that's fine because what a healthy
society needs is people thinking and
disagreement so ethics for me is about
reasons and reasons are like vectors in
physics they have a direction and they
have a strength and to work out what we
should do overall is a matter of way all
of these vectors or reasons finding out
what we have most reason to do so you
this is what you do every day of your
life when you have different values like
cost safety and status when buying a car
for example and then you weigh the
strength of these vectors pushing in
different directions to decide on which
car to buy now what are the what are the
vectors what are the reasons that are
important in making ethical decisions so
how should we decide whether to give
people propranolol to combat races
racism the the most important vector is
not health because people trade health
for their goals and they trade health to
achieve other things that are important
in their life is well-being and there
are three basic theories of well-being
or what makes your life go well
happiness desire satisfaction or so
called objective goods derive from our
nature as human animals so we're social
animals having deep and rich social
relationships family and children are
important constituents of our well-being
regardless of whether we want it they
are things that make a human beings life
on this view go well such as also
developing talents achievement gaining
knowledge originality creativity the
kinds of things that are often held out
to be valuable and and this is what of
course we use when we desire design
educational institutions when we parent
children and this is what we should use
in deciding whether we employ a
particular intervention the second one
is freedom an important true an
important value in the liberal democracy
is the way to gives to individual
liberty we're all individuals were there
different ideas about what's good in
life and insofar as our actions affect
ourselves we ought to be free to act on
them even if we don't promote our own
well-being so it can be in tension with
well-being so freedom
so basically Dostoyevsky recognized this
in Brothers Karamazov when he has one of
the brothers Ivan having a conversation
with the Grand Inquisitor who is the
devil and they're debating whether it's
freedom or happiness that and the devil
the Grand Inquisitor offers to give you
know people happiness and Ivan says no
freedom is more important than happiness
basically all ethical debates in my 25
years of experience boil down to three
values two of them well-being in freedom
and then the third one is justice about
how to allocate resources when they
can't be made available to everyone or
how to limit people's freedom when their
actions will affect others so these
three values freedom justice and and
well-being are I think the cornerstones
to making these decisions and I'll talk
about one example different theories of
justice some people utility area
say resources or you know arrangements
should be made to bring about the
greatest good to the greatest number
some people are egalitarian that say
it's not the outcome that matters but
treating everyone equally or treating
everyone's needs equally regardless of
how much they can benefit a variant of
egalitarianism is is is what I called a
fair go or sufficient arianism setting a
threshold of a minimal minimally decent
life and trying to get as many people
about that as possible there are many
different theories but having some
theory is important now you might say
well how does this apply to enhancement
here's an enhancer here is a moral
enhancer it's called Ritalin so 10% of
children have this disorder called
attention deficit disorder in my view
this is not a disorder like cancer it's
not really a disease it's a variant of
normal it's being at the bottom end of
the curve for impulse control
now what's impulse control it's the
ability to delay small gratifications
now for larger ones in the future this
is an essential trait that humans have
have that enable them to plan and
maximize their own well-being and a
maximized moral goals because you have
to give up some small things to get
bigger things in the future it doesn't
matter what you want to do if you can't
control your impulsive you don't have
sufficient self-control you're just
going to be driven by your instincts and
what happens with children with
attention deficit desire poor
self-control so they have less friends
less motivation to see less likely and a
university and likely to end up at the
bottom of socio-economic scale and in
jail and there is an effective treatment
for this it's called Ritalin it's a
cognitive enhancer children do better
cognitively but it's also a moral
enhancer because it stops impulsive
aggression now one study of adult
criminals with attention deficit
disorder found that giving adults who
had committed a violent crime riddle and
reduced violent Aria fence by 30%
played some social program that could
reduce violence by 30% people
fall over themselves to implement it but
ritalin will do that if you've got
attention deficit disorder that's a
moral enhancer just like hormonal
castration is a crude moral enhancer now
should we give this let's go through
let's go through the three values well
being will it make a child or an adult
their life go better yes it will because
they'll be able to get a better
education they'll be able to delay
gratification and obtain greater rewards
from themselves will it reduce their
freedom or increase it it will increase
their freedom because it gives them
long-term options instead of just
short-term options is it just we as it
is it's a very cost effective use of
resources and it also promotes reduction
of violent crime
I mentioned bias before all of us have
these psychological biases and you know
one of them is the status quo bias so
one way to think about proposed changes
or interventions is is to ask what would
happen if you change the status quo so I
use this in the brexit debate when when
when everyone was saying it was
ludicrous to for the for the UK to leave
Europe I said well I think it's actually
more complicated than that
imagine the UK wasn't a member of the
European Union now and it was invited to
join do you think it would be rational
to join in the current situation with
the problems in Greece the southern
economies which got more debt than GDP
problems with immigration do you think
that people would vote to join the EU
now and no they wouldn't
so then you think we should remain in
the EU because of the transition cost or
because you made a commitment now that
means you don't really think it's in the
UK's interests except if the transition
cost is too high but that wasn't the
argument most people were giving most
people saying I know it's actually
better for the UK that's an example of a
thought experiment another one around
enhancement is pick any property that
you think is valuable so tight say say
you think general intelligence IQ is
valuable it doesn't matter could be
empathy or it could be self-control or
could be musical ability or it could be
hedonic tone your he don't accept point
your level
general happiness but let's just take IQ
and say you've got a child with
naturally occurring IQ of 150 extremely
high you can basically do whatever you
like with that IQ and you'll be able to
produce eight times as many patents as
the average person now let's say that
child develops a condition so that if
you do nothing that Charles like you
will go down to 100 absolutely average
so not disabled doesn't have a disease
we just go back to average and there's
something you can do about it you can
give the child by demand b6 every day
and then the IQ will stay 150 so you do
nothing IQ goes down 100 give b6 stays
at 150 what do you think parents should
do I should give the B C's if they
unless they have a good reason not to
there's some countervailing force
there's a force to giving the b6 and
that is to keep the child's IQ at 150
now of course if it's expensive or it's
got side effects or if they can't get it
because their child's dying of leukemia
those are all good reasons not to give
the b6 but absent some excuse they
should give it all right everyone
normally agrees alike when I say that
now you take an average child an IQ of a
hundred and if you give this Charpy six
every day it's IQ will go up to 150 do
you think we should enhance the child
there was a notation in has a child
Charles normal no but if you had a
reason to preserve the child's like
you've got exactly the same reason to
enhance the child's IQ why because
having an IQ 150 is good now there's no
difference between gene editing and
giving the child basics except the risks
and its heritable but neither of those
mean should in my view should rule out
safe gene editing if you could reliably
produce the effect okay Judy of easy
rescue I mentioned harm principle people
ought to be free unless they're harming
other people we had this euthanasia
debate today the ladies that your
audience said I've got intractable
epilepsy I'm not about to die but I
don't want to keep living if she wants
to die and someone wants to help her
state has no role in interfering unless
somebody else is going to be effective
likewise if I want to sex select my
third child to have a child of the
opposite sex to the previous two I'm not
harming anyone yet we have laws in
Victoria that prevent that we're
relentlessly moralistically introducing
laws that restrict Liberty for the sake
of our own morals okay I should finish
another important principle of people
often bring out is called the
categorical imperative from Immanuel
Kant that we should always treat people
as an end never as a means that means in
practice we should get people's consent
it doesn't mean though we can never try
to achieve values through our treatment
of people it means that we shouldn't
treat them like slaves
we shouldn't disregard their wishes and
ideas of the good life so people will
tell you you shouldn't select embryos
because you're deciding what the future
is for them you're only deciding to the
future for them if you constrain what
they do once they come into existence
that would be treating the child as a
means but the mere selection of them
doesn't itself imply any form of
treatment okay let me finish we are
morally responsible in my view not just
for what we cause but what we allow to
happen and once we know the outcome of
our acts and omissions and we can avoid
that we're responsible for them so if
you choose to do nothing about the
decline in empathy knowing that it's the
case you're responsible for it if you
choose not to legalize euthanasia you're
responsible for the suffering that
people experience when they can't choose
to die if you choose not to act when you
hear of cases of pedophilia you're
responsible for those cases and you're
complicit and you should be held to
account for that responsibility
so with knowledge and power comes
unfortunately responsibility you can't
just say well I'm just going to do
nothing because doing nothing then
becomes something you're responsible in
a way that when you didn't have the
parity didn't have the knowledge you
weren't responsible okay so we ought to
use science to understand our
limitations and use it more to construct
policies like the opt-out system
or revise our political institutions
advance liberal democracy um but here's
a is a basic common-sense truth there
are four ways to bring about any valued
outcome if it's a better life yourself
or a more secure society or whatever it
is that you're aiming for there's four
ways you can do it you can change the
natural world you can change the social
environment through policies laws you
can change people's psychology or you
can change their biology and the thesis
of our book is that we need to look at
all of these things and our biology
plays a major role in determining what
kind of animal we are and how we're
going to behave and we ought to look at
how at the effects of sign of our
technology on our biology not only
because we should take responsibility
for it because we're already doing it
through the drugs that we take and and
the ways in which we the computer and
the internet are affecting our lives so
the thesis of our book was not that you
all ought to go out and take oxytocin
you we ought to start to fund the
systematic study of human moral
imitation because that's the biggest
determinant of our future and try to
find ways of living with ourselves and
if we can't live with ourselves changing
ourselves thank you
thank you very much I'm sure that there
are lots of reactions and lots of
questions we've got probably just under
ten minutes for questions and I'm going
to hand over to Professor Michael
cellular he's going to share the
question time is the director of the
Monash bioethics Center and I'll roam
around with a microphone and
Thank You Megan and Thank You Julian for
that talk and as Megan say the said the
floor is open for questions so if you
raise your hand
Megan will bring the mic to you hi
thanks for the talk
Julian so I just say the thought I've
having here is that it seems like in
some respect the end of moral
enhancement is the reduction of
vulnerability you know were as you said
because we're I'm fit for a future where
you know securely especially vulnerable
now to the way the world is technologies
like a past climate change and so on and
so it seems like reduction of
vulnerability is at least one at the
ends if not the one of the main ends of
moral bioenhancement
and I think in the case where you know
if there's some kind of a drug like
oxytocin or something like that or
dopamine that I can take that makes me
that gives me Marley batter Moto's and
therefore it gives me sort of makes them
more likely that I'll behave more
morally then there's a sense in which I
think ok at the end of attenuating the
vulnerability that everybody else might
have respect to my behavior or surely
met right but my question is whether
that would carry over into the case of
Marley enhancing relationships because
at one point in your talk you said that
chemical chemical castration is one type
of crude moral bioenhancement right so
suppose I'm a you know terribly fuller
and slanderous partner who sleeps around
on my you know my girlfriend all the
time and I could take you know get
chemically castrated voluntarily in
order to stop that from happening
sure there's a sense in which that will
at a very basic level will make her less
vulnerable to me sleeping around insofar
as I'll just be robustly not having sex
with other people all right
but it also seems to me that there's
another sense in which the fact that I
had to take that measure weren't on a
deeper level make her feel less
vulnerable as a result of the boy bar
enhancement and thus if the end of moral
bioenhancement is the reduction of
vulnerability I'm not sure that it meets
that standard in the relationship case
yeah Michael made this objection earlier
in this work that you know if you're
talking about so in this case let's
assume it's just changing your behavior
all right that hasn't really morally
enhanced you it might mean that you're
no longer cheating you know sleeping
around but just like the threat of
imprisonment might stop somebody from
murdering who wants to murder you
wouldn't really describe the law as a
moral enhancement in that case what you
want is something that issues from the
individual and their own moral
decision-making such that you don't want
a murder or you don't want to sleep
around so actually you're correct in the
sense that you know if if if hormonal
castration just you know drops your sex
drive but actually you you still have
the background desires it hasn't really
done anything to morally enhance you
it's just meant that people aren't
harmed as much just like laws amping up
the penalties might stop people behaving
badly so I agree with you and how much
of this will will turn on how you define
a moral enhancer but you know if people
if somebody if reading Tolstoy makes you
less likely to cheat on your girlfriend
or murder somebody it was how you should
read Tolstoy but all Tolstoy is reading
Tolstoy he's doing is causing your
neurons to fire in a certain way and
there are ways in which you can achieve
that without reach reading Tolstoy so if
if the if the end is is actually you
removing that so I've showed
neurofeedback
that might be another way of removing
that desire in my view and again Rob
Sparrow disagrees with that he thinks
there's a deep distinction between
reading Tolstoy and and having
neurofeedback or taking a pill that is
gonna mean that you lose your desire to
achieve so you know the love drugs but
we don't know and we're not advocating a
monogamous lifelong relationship in that
book we're saying if your goal is X to
get over jealousy for example you might
be able to use the advances of science
to do to achieve that and there's
nothing intrinsically wrong with that
there may be reasons not to do it but
the reason to do it is the value of
whatever it is you think is important in
a relationship just going off your idea
that a meeting to act is tantamount to
causing an act if we can convince the
population and maybe through education
that that's the case
assuming that seeing goal what's your
perspective on a parent's responsibility
for a child's genetic defects if they
choose not to terminate the pregnancy
yeah great question sorry I'll just
finish by wondering if you've done any
research into how that might interplay
with with what the children might then
think about their parents or whether it
might impinge on some sort of freedom of
religion okay so there's a big debate in
the enhancement which returned the
disability literature around what is
disability is it a difference so one
example is people in the deaf community
argue deafness is not a disability it's
a difference and they want to have a
deaf child okay so that here are three
ways you can have a deaf child if you're
a deaf couple why don't you can have IVF
you can test the embryos and you can
select one of the embryos that's you
know is going to be a deaf turn into a
deaf child second one is you can have a
hearing child and you can definite you
can give it streptomycin and make a deaf
well the third way that you can do it is
you can have a deaf child and refuse to
let it have a cochlear implant
so it'll remain deaf there are three
ways that bring about the outcome of of
a deaf child I think you're responsible
for the deafness but the first case
where you select a child the child can't
blame you later in life for being deaf
because that child wouldn't have existed
it would have been somebody else it's
true I agree with you they are
responsible for bringing deafness into
the world but they're not responsible
for harming a deaf child so I think even
though I think they're wrong
deaf people ought to be able to select
deaf embryos however I don't think they
ought to be able to defin their children
or refuse cochlear implants because that
will harm the child if they fail to give
the child a cochlear implant in my view
and we can talk about where the deafness
really is a disability let's assume for
a moment it is in that case they are
harming the child and they are
responsible and the child can blame them
and the court order intervene to require
that they not defin the child or that
the child have a cochlear implant just
as the court will intervene if a
jehovah's witness parent refuses a blood
transfusion for the child and that the
child would die that's different to the
selection case because in the selection
case although a deaf child will come
into existence that's their only chance
so I agree with you they are responsible
but then the blame is much greater
because the harm is much greater in the
cases of deliberately deafening the
child all refusing the cochlear implant
versus the you know failing to select a
hearing child is that it's kind of
complicated question you know and the
other thing that people say to beam up
my view is oh but your view implies that
people who choose not to have Down
syndrome screening are responsible for
having a child with Down syndrome and a
blameworthy rob Sparrow is sort of given
a subjection to my view and I think it's
a good objection and I think being
responsible does not mean that you
should necessarily blame people or even
hold them accountable
or punish them in any way particularly
in the case of failing to choose child
without a disability the child is
already going to face obstacles and the
parents already know to face obstacle
they need support rather than blame at
that point so given that they're free to
do that we ought infer the prejudice
them but you're right
taking another objection to taking
emissions into account that Peter Singer
gets a lot of time is we're responsible
for all the people who are dying around
the world in just the same way as we
would be if we sent them poison food so
failing to give money to alleviate their
famine is just like sending poisoned
food parcels and people are inclined to
say no they're different it might be bad
to fail to save them but it's not the
same as as killing them and I think
that's it's a complicated debate good
evening thank you and I've got it I
don't know if it's a question I think
it's a problem something that isn't
sitting comfortably with me with two
parts of what you're saying and one of
it is this issue which I'm hoping you
can clarify for me in terms of what's
what I'm thinking or what I should be
thinking or what you'd like me to think
that and that is this issue of you there
are a lot of problems that you raised
which were around large scale issues of
morality such as climate change such as
organ donation that you suggest require
a kind of legislative solution and it
seems to me that this is sort of somehow
you know a version of legal moralism you
know in in the sense that sort of you
know what we're trying to do is actually
create a kind of a society in which
there's more good than harm and I'm
referring here to HLA Hearts sort of
little argument that I'm sure you're
familiar with where he's simply saying
sort of you know the legal moralist
wants to create a particular society in
a particular way
and the response from a liberal position
is generally well no we can't actually
legislate that and we shouldn't because
that's not true morality and that true
morality is where individuals choose
something yeah I think that's a problem
with what's called liberal neutrality
and and tolerance it's it's it's it says
we should treat all values equally we
should allow people to act on any values
and I think that's you need to have
values that inform society and you need
to get off the fence and so I said today
this meeting you know you should go off
the pin to euthanasia it's a good thing
it's not something to be embarrassed
about it's actually a value we should
stand up for non-discrimination or you
know being against sexism is a value
even if certain groups in your community
don't sign up to that value it it's
they're wrong well you know or use your
entire to treat it as wrong and I think
that what our society lacks is a is a
substantive value commitment it's this
is the the problem of liberalism as it
tries to treat all ways of living on a
par and they're just not well some of
them are going to be destructive to
others and you can't be tolerant to
intolerance and so on so I think that
you're right that's the dominant way of
thinking about these problems but I just
don't think that's fit for the future
either I think we actually it's true we
don't want the wrong set of values and
it's really hard to find out what the
right set of values are and and maybe
liberalism has served us extremely well
in the market and capitalism has served
us extremely well until this point in
time market is great at driving
innovation creativity it's hopeless at
tracking value objective values because
you just get enormous ly powerful
corporations that can manipulate the
market and manipulate people's
consumption and desires and values and
that's why you have an obesity epidemic
it's an expression of capitalism plus
human nature so but it's good for
certain things
but I think what we do need is is is to
take is to take us down on some values
and and to try to work out what they
should be and that's an arts project so
we need more investment in research into
the arts I mean the most important you
know you need science but so it's never
going to tell you what you should do
it's just going to tell you what you can
do or how to do something that's gonna
tell you what the value should be and
and but you know I think that we're
facing a time where we have to decide
what what our values are and what we
stand for and what we teach our children
and what we don't allow and what we do
laugh so you're right that is the sort
of upshot so I'm afraid that's all the
time we have for questions and

more opportunity after the formal
closing of the event before handing back

all know that if you're interested in
future bioethics events hosted by the
Monash bioethics Center there's a
sign-up sheet on a table outside if you
give us your details we'll put you on
our mailing list so you can be informed
about future events if you fill that out
and leave it with us here tonight that
would be fine or you could also send it
send in that form before handing back
over to Megan I want to thank you all
