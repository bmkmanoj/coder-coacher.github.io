serious sponsored by the VBA foundation
and organizing coordination with the Lum
pop Oregon 2020 project and we have the
real pressure to have today here
Aubrey de Grey who made the spacing he's
a very busy at the agenda to be here
with us for some hours
Aubrey de grace doesn't need much
introduction because he's quite famous
internationally he is a biomedical
gerontologist Base in Mountain View
California USA is that she's the chief
science officer of cents Research
Foundation which is a california-based
biomedical research charity that
performs on Fran's laboratory research
dedicated to convey combating the aging
process he is a editor-in-chief for
rejuvenation research they world highest
impact Peer Review Journal focus on
intervention in aging his yes his BA in
computer science um and his PhD in
biology from the University of Cambridge
his research interest and compassed the
characterization of all types all the
types of self-inflicted cellular and
molecular damage that constitute a
mammalian aging and the design of
interventions to repair an or obviate
the damage dr. de Grey is a fellow of
both the gerontology Cal gerontological
Society of America and American Asian
Association and seats of on the vitória
and scientific advisory boards of
numerous journals and organizations as I
mentioned his quite famous
he was just mentioned in that case as
moving from here to work along a
tomorrow and then to different countries
in Europe just to give letters and he
was here during the weekend on another
conference and as well presenting this
book that you can download as well from
the BB a foundation open mind webpage so
thank you very much agree and as usual
we allow the speaker just to have plenty
freedom one hour one hour 15 minutes and
then we will open the floor for
questions I understand that this
audience is quite varied in terms of
expertise in demography so I am going to
copy that
with my talk I will have some quite a
bit of material which is rather
technical and it may be difficult for
some of you to understand all of it but
I will also have plenty of things to say
which are very much more general and
non-technical I hope that's okay the
final thing I want to apologize for is
that this is the first time that I have
given this particular talk many of you
may know that I am really a biologist I
am NOT a demographer but I do demography
for fun sometimes and I am going to
present today some new ideas which I
think are valuable but I could be wrong
but the point is I have never presented
them before so of course that is a good
thing and a bad thing it's a good thing
in that you have the luxury the
privilege of being the first people to
hear these ideas but it's a bad thing
because I'm going to present them very
badly because I've never done it before
so we will see how it goes alright so
this is really just a way the pointer in
any sense not really okay um I'm right
so this is what I'm going to do I'm
going to talk about the limits to human
longevity the very longest lived people
what we can learn about them and in
particular what we can learn about their
ages at death the age at which they died
the the topic is very fashionable many
people say
about it and talk about it a lot and I'm
going to collect and tell you something
useful about it and of course the main
reason why people are so interested in
it is because they have a feeling a kind
of intuition that if we study the ages
that people can currently get to we
might get some ideas about how to do
better than that how to develop
medicines and such like that would help
us all to live longer healthier lives
which everybody wants so I'm going to
start with a few little pieces of data
the first thing I'm going to mention is
the current world record for longevity
which is held by a lady from the South
of France
named Jean coma she died at a 122 years
and 164 days so nearly 120 two and a
half and that record has not even been
nearly approached let alone beaten since
that she died 20 years ago
in 1997 today the world record for how
old somebody is who is alive today is
held by a Jamaican lady named violet
brown and she is more than five years
younger and actually only I think three
people have got has become I got closer
than that to Jan koum are in 20 years so
it's a pretty amazing data point and
it's particularly amazing if we think
about people who are slightly younger we
all know that people are living longer
than they used to but if we drill down a
little bit and we try to ask you know in
what way are they living longer you know
who is living longer then we come up
with some very interesting conclusions
are more a higher proportion of the
population get to sixty than fifty years
ago and a higher proportion of the
population gets to 70 than they did 50
years ago but the difference is bigger
at 70 than it is at 60 in other words
the the whole the whole population is
getting more biased towards older ages
and that's phenomenal an extent the
number of the proportion of people who
get to 80 is much bigger than it was 50
years ago and the proportion of people
who get to 90 of course it's much
smaller than the proportion who get to
80 but it's enormously bigger than the
proportion who got to 90 50 years ago
and so on it's true for a hundred there
are perhaps even if we even look at a
difference of twenty years in other
words now versus 20 years ago there are
at least three times more people in the
world today who are over a hundred than
the word twenty years ago so what's
going on why aren't we constantly
beating the world record for longevity
it's very strange and it's something
that we ought to be studying we ought to
be trying to understand what's really
going on whether there is some kind of
biological limit to the arm to how long
people can live if there is then people
like me biologists should be studying it
and should be figuring out the basis of
it so that we can fix it but we need to
know whether it's really there first of
all and that's a big problem because in
order to study anything in science you
need reliable data and there is almost
nothing in the whole of science in which
it is harder to get reliable data than
extreme longevity because everybody lies
about their a I mean like everybody it's
just insane
some people want to pretend that they're
younger than they are some people want
to pretend that they're older than their
and in particular and awful other people
who are very old want to pretend that
they're even older and people are good
at pretending this thing so you can end
up in a situation where people really
really really clear that somebody really
is the age that they say they are and
then 10 years or 20 years later it turns
out that actually that was the age of
their brother or something like that
that's exactly what happened with this
guy called Izumi in Japan so if you look
at the Guinness Book of Records from
let's say beer 2000 you will find that
the second oldest person ever if this
guy from Japan called Izumi who lived to
120 only two years less than karma but
in some sense it's just not true it
turned out about ten years ago that it
was actually a brother um you know and
that was it was well enough clarified
that it got into the Guinness Book of
Records so it wasn't just somebody said
so and this happens all the time so we
need a system we need to develop a
system for verifying data about people's
ages now of course as time goes on it
becomes progressively easier more and
more countries have data on the date of
birth and the date of marriage and other
things census reports and so on that's
really really solid so it becomes easier
to make sure that the dates that people
say they live - they really did but
still in most countries in the world
that's not quite true you know at the
moment the oldest person in the world
was born in 1900 and in 1900 not very
many countries cared very much about
this kind of thing so the records are
really patchy and of course in many many
big countries the records are almost
non-existent way back then so it's very
hard um however more than that we need
balance at the end of the day the reason
we care about this
is in order to be able to identify
trends to identify what is happening in
this data and you don't need or you
don't need totally comprehensive data to
do that you just need to try to make
sure that the false negatives and the
fourth positives balance cancel each
other out reasonably well in other words
that the people you are believing when
you shouldn't are about as numerous as
the people you're not believing when you
should if you can do that then you're
out you're kind of okay and um in
particular what this means is you want
to go through the trick okay um you want
to avoid systematic bias it could be for
example that the things that you're
believing are mainly male longevity and
the things that you're just believing
are mainly female 1 Timothy and that
would be a big problem
you know you'd really mess up and that's
it that kind of thing could happen for
example some of you may know that there
are certain places in the world where
life expectancy at birth is a bit higher
than in the surrounding population
Okinawa is a famous example of this an
island at the southern end of Japan
where they live nearly two years longer
than the rest of Japan there are various
places like this and one of them one of
those places a part of Sardinia is
particularly famous because of the
gender ratio you almost certainly know
that almost everybody who lives to 110
is female like 90% or more are female at
least 80% of the people who live to a
hundred a female just women tend to live
a bit longer but in this one place in
Sardinia it's not like that the men live
just as long as the women even out to
the age of 100 or 105 and nobody has the
faintest idea why so you know it's a
really important thing to study but it
could easily have been missed if you
were over simple
mystic about gathering data so we have
to be really careful about this now
who does this how do we get to be really
careful about it well the good news is
that extreme longevity is fascinating
not only to academics but to the general
public and some members of the general
public have time and money or whatever
to actually dedicate themselves to this
and the result is that over the past 20
years or so a group has emerged which is
centered in Los Angeles California it's
called the Los Angeles gerontology
research group and almost all of them
are not academics they are just people
from the general public with other jobs
but they really look over there really
interests in all of this and over over
the years they have become really good
at sifting out the data at getting to
the bottom of whether a particular
report of somebody's longevity is true
and they are they have become really
well-respected pretty much everybody in
the world now agrees that these people
know what they're talking about so they
have become the world authority for the
validity of they claim to live to a
hundred and ten or more greater that's
the definition of the word
supercentenarian furthermore they
provide multiple levels of validation so
there are people who are absolutely hard
you know
ironclad valid you know they are totally
certain that this is true and then there
are people where the level of
documentation is not quite so good but
it kind of looks okay and they think
that it's worth mentioning these people
in a kind of second level data set so
you know it's all pretty good it could
be better but it's it's pretty good the
data are okay so now there's a problem
element
and lots of people are fascinated by the
concept by the whole area by the whole
topic of extreme longevity some of those
people are professional demographers who
know what they're doing some of them are
amateurs who have spent plenty of time
haven't got any qualifications but they
spent plenty of time studying it and
they know what they're doing but
unfortunately some of them are academics
who think they know what they're doing
but they actually don't have a clue and
this is a good example this is the paper
that came out a few months ago and well
the very little I can say that's
printable about this paper it was
appallingly bad this is a firm mistake
and it got published in nature for
crying out loud I mean in a very very
prominent journal you know this is the
author's attempt to derive some kind of
fit to the data points that you can see
on the screen which are the average age
at death of super centenarians between
1967 or so and 2009 or so and they
fitted it for whatever reason using
whatever a cubic smoothing spline is I
have no idea what that is but anyway my
thought was I had recently seen a
cartoon on a comic strip called xkcd I
think this is probably about as good as
so for those of you who read English you
know the thing on the left is a
regression and the thing on the right is
the same data points and a constellation
in the sky and it says I don't trust
linear regressions when it is harder to
guess the direction of the correlation
than it is to find new constellations I
and that's about what I thought of that
paper um so it's it's spectacularly
embarrassing it's so bad that's not true
but that's not what I came here to tell
you what I came here to tell you about
is whether we can do better and it's not
obvious that we can do better
but is the very definition of extreme
longevity is the Lindt extreme there are
not many people who get to extreme
lifespans and you know if you haven't
got very much data you can't do very
much statistics the nature of
statistically if you need more data to
get more reliable answer so one might
say well maybe it's a shame that people
pretend to be able to derive actual
conclusions from studying this small
amount of data when in fact they can't
but the fact is they can't nobody can
because there's nothing updated so
willow come here to tell you today and
this is where I'm going to start getting
pretty technical is that actually we can
do a lot more in terms of the analysis
of this small amount of data than people
have previously realized now here is the
fundamental problem when you study the
ages of death of people in a given
population at a given range of Ages what
you are really doing is you're trying to
extract from that data a kind of
generalization about the risk of death
at any given age you're trying to say
okay here is the actual you know you've
got this certain number of people a
finite number of people they died at
these particular ages but they might not
have done you know anyone could have
died at any particular age what you want
to extract from that is a probability of
death that was experienced by each of
those people at each age which is called
the mortality race and it turns out to
be rather hard to do that with small
amounts of data if you have large
amounts of data it's not so bad what you
do is you just split up your data set by
eight typically you might say okay here
are the people that died at 110 here are
the people that died 100 and all
here are the people that died at 112 and
so on and you simply ask okay
out of all the people that were alive on
the one hundred and tenth birthday what
proportion of them didn't make it to the
hundred and eleventh birthday and so on
that's the mortality rate and if you do
that you can extract a set of data
points for probabilities of death at
each age and you can ask questions about
what that trend looks like does it go up
are people more likely to die in the
hundred and 11th year than they were in
the one hundred and tenth year and so on
and you know these are important
questions because you can actually guess
you can actually make biological
inferences from them but if you have
small amounts of data you have a problem
because with small amounts of data you
have one calling here a tension between
granularity and scatter now what do I
mean by that exactly if you have this
data set that it's up to you what the
size of your intervals of age are the
example I just gave was the standard one
people just say the interval will be one
year so you'll say these people died
between the hundred and tenth birthday
and 111 birthday but you didn't need to
the year you could have chosen a month
you could have said okay these people
died in the first month after that I'll
give you ten Thursday these people died
in the second month and so on
you're probably free to do that but
here's the thing if you do that of
course then you have fewer people in
each of the slots in each of the time
intervals and that means that you have
more scatter you have more you know
randomness in the data so you have less
ability to extract accurate
probabilities from it however if you go
the other way if you choose large
intervals so that you have large amounts
of data points in each interval you have
a different problem the problem you have
is that you may simply smooth away the
thing you're looking for
supposing you'll want to find for a
example that the change with age is
exponential or linear or logarithmic if
you are looking at the interval they're
too small you may not be able to tell
because you have you're just not seeing
you're just you're just throwing away
the variation that you're looking for so
we need to try to avoid doing this we
need to try to minimize this tension
between glare granularity and scatter if
we are to get good information out of
small data sets so now I'm going to go
at the bottom ethical I'm sure that
every demographer in this room has heard
of the grumper to make an equation which
was developed in two stages first of all
by Benjamin Gompertz
in the early 1800s almost 200 years ago
and then refined a decade or two later
by make'em and of course the trick the
equation for the mortality rate that is
observed the change the relationship
between mortality rate and age that is
observed in human populations and indeed
in the populations of the barclays
animals and it's a very simple thing it
says that the probability of death at
age X in other words the mortality rate
is age X is the sum of two terms one
constant term which is simply a number
and one exponential term which is an
exponential function of x over a v8
that's all about the Gompertz make them
equation says and it turns out that it
describes the risk of death in human
populations really rather well over most
of the lifespan of the population you
have to be a bit careful with it when
you get to extreme ages because of
course the mortality rate is a
probability which means that it cannot
go larger than one and so you have a
kind of mathematically enforced plateau
that occurs and the only way to get away
from that is to chop your dataset into
smaller intervals so the probability of
death in any interval is much smaller
and therefore you don't hit that plateau
until
later but I'll talk about that later on
the main thing is that this equation
really works if you take any human data
set
you always find that you can find values
a B and C for which that equation really
accurately predicts the number or fix
the number of people who died in the in
the population at any given age that's
great and everyone using this equation
all the time but this equation here
underneath it is an equation that I bet
none of you have seen before and hope
anyone who thinks that equation before
right now it turns out that that
equation is the same as that equation I
got that equation just by integrating
that equation that's all I did px is the
survival function in other words the
proportion of the initial population
that is alive at age X now of course
that is simply the integral of the
mortality rate because the probability
of dying each year is a probability the
probability of that the proportion of
people who are alive at Ajax is simply
the product of all the probabilities
from 0 to X of point 1 minus the
probability in other words in order to
get to Ajax you have to have not died at
age 0 and not die to age 1 and not died
at age 2 and so on so that's all that
the survival function actually is and
this is simply the integral of that but
all it is front of us but what the hell
youth is this horrible equation well
that's what I'm about to tell you here's
a horrible equation again right at the
top now I'm going to consider a
particular type of data of data on ages
of death it's going to be a situation in
which these two things are true now look
at what those two things say this one
here says that the constant term what's
called the Makem term in the Gompertz
Makem equation it's really small
it's saying that C
is so small that for all our load effect
essentially this number here is much
less than this number that's the first
thing unpack now look at these two terms
and find them in the original equation
at the top you can see that the original
equation at the top has this big sub sub
equate sub formula here which is the sum
of these two terms now that means that
if this is much smaller than this that
we can just delete it from our equation
and we haven't changed things very much
we could just lose it and we've still
got something that's more or less the
same equation and it's more or less an
accurate description similarly if we
know that this second criterion luanne
putting where e to the power BX is much
greater than 1 we have the same
situation look at this formula here if e
to the BX is much bigger than 1 then
let's just forget about the 1 just call
it e to the B X so now here I have the
version the simplified version of this
equation where I've done those two
things I have made these two assumptions
okay and this is what I get as a result
a much simpler equation that's great but
the big news is this because this is
what you get if you take if you take
logs of this equation twice you see
there's an exponential term here and
another one here if you take log logs of
this equation twice this is what you get
and look at it in familiar in X there's
only one X in this equation that is
fabulous news and I'm going to explain
why it's fabulous news right now here is
kind of a a graphical illustration of
what I just told you and why would I've
just told you it useful I'm going to go
back and remind you of my criteria here
these are there are somethings I'm
making now are these are something's
true in what circumstances are these
assumptions true well it turns out that
in the scenario where we're we're
studying older people they are totally
true and that's what this graph shows
you
as you can see there are two plots here
there's a blue one and an orange one and
they're not plots of data this is just
purely the behavior of perfect a
hypothetical perfectly Gumpert makin
population that has coefficients that
are typical of human data so the series
members here the slope of nor point one
that's pretty much exactly what human
populations actually have intercept of T
to my Explorer
until I settle my book and make in terms
of one in a thousand this is roughly
what human part human populations
actually behave and if you plot this as
a survival curve it looks like a normal
survival curve but what I've done here
if I've plotted it in both of these ways
in the first way is log mortality which
is what you typically do with the
Gumpert to make an equation right you
just you know show that the exit once
you're at ages where the exponential
term is outweighing is overwhelming the
constant term a can term then you get a
straight line and that's the blue line
you're all familiar with that but the
orange line behaves exactly the same way
and if you can see the orange line is
what I just did on the previous on the
previous slide where I'm taking the
survival version of the make the compass
making equation and I'm taking large
twice rather than what and then there's
this constant term that you have to add
it so they are identical up one tear
beyond about age sixty in it was nothing
between them and that's what's going to
be useful going forward so let us say
we're interested in these two particular
assumptions and we can we can actually
accept those assumptions for any
analysis of the elderly of elderly
humans but there's another assumption
that we have to make or another feature
of our data that has to be true if we
want to actually use this survival
version of the Gompertz Makem equation
for any kind of analysis and visit it we
have to make sure that there are not
many cases where people died at the same
a
if people died at the same age then we
can't really essentially our granularity
goes away we can't really have a
kaplan-meier curve we can't have a plot
of the proportion of people alive at a
particular age but now we can go back to
what I said about it being completely
open what her granularity is 4:8 we can
talk about how many years old somebody
was when they died but equally we could
talk about how many months old somebody
was when they died and in particular it
turns out that's a super centenarian
data we can talk about how many de Vil
they were when they when they died
because that's the data that of the Los
Angeles gerontology research group
record we have supercentenarian data
known to the day and that turns out to
be very handy so actually among agogo
yet
um-um question then is you know can we
actually find anything else using this
new analysis now I started 10 or 15
minutes ago by mentioning how the
standard analysis where we know reduce
each year of life to one data point the
probability of death the mortality rate
you know that's that doesn't work very
well for for small data sets but what I
want to persuade you of now is that the
reason it doesn't work is not inherent
in the size of the data set the reason
it doesn't work is because that method
of analysis automatically throws away a
huge amount of statistical power and
this approach used looking at survival
especially when especially when these
three conditions are true retains that
statistical power so that we can draw
conclusions where
are far more robust than we could if we
did things the traditional way so now
I'm going to try to explain what I mean
by that and here's where I start to
really realize that this is the first
time I gave this talk and I really don't
quite know how to say this well so I
hope I'm going to be able to convey
enough but at least you'll be able to
ask the right questions later um so um
here is an example of the kind of
analysis that I've just described the
act of the workers here is a double log
number of the sort that I mentioned
earlier the x-axis is 8 and you may be a
little bit shocked by the numbers there
but if you think about it these are
simply ages in days 115 years is almost
exactly 42,000 days just yeah just know
that alright it's a just just for
benchmarking so what I've actually got
here is the entire 303 day set the
entire supercentenarian dataset from age
110 to 140 that's what we have here and
as you can see the data points are very
very lined up and we can draw a
regression through it in the R square is
something like naught point nine nine
nine five but here's the thing that's
nonsense
that's actually not an R squared and of
course the reason is not an R squared is
because the data points are not
independent any survival curves a
survival data set is monotonic because
once you're dead you stay dead right so
the proportion of people who are alive
at 8 X is always less than the
proportion of people - all over their
age X minus 1 so the data points are not
independent which means that this is not
an R squared you can think of it as a
kind of nominal R squared but it's not
an R squared so this is the question at
the top how can we get an actual R
square actual confidence level from the
data that I'm talking about well the
answer is go to monocot Gautam
DeCarlo you probably know how to do
multicolor analysis most of you you just
make up data and see what happens
and see how often it goes either side of
what you're looking for now what are we
actually looking for here here's the
first thing I want to emphasize what
we're looking for here is deviations
from a Gumpert Makem curve but if you
like the null hypothesis the default is
that the probability of death of these
supercentenarians will be rising
exponentially just as the probability of
death seems to rise exponentially
through most of the life course at
younger ages the question we want to ask
it is actually rising exponentially or
is the some deviation from that and if
it is writing exactly exponentially then
we get a straight line on this plot
because of what I've told you earlier
with that horrible algebra I showed you
but it might not be a straight line so
that's what we want to know now it turns
out that if you do this Monte Carlo
analysis you guys throw random data at
this kind of manipulation and you ask
what happens then yes we're in it turns
out that this correlation even though
you totally can't believe the actual
number nevertheless the number is
actually even better than it would be
with random data most of the time this
result means that yes we can for
practical purposes view the
supercentenarian data from age 110 to
114 as fitting a Gompertz curve and the
stuff that I'm not even going to get
into this a bit horrible we would regard
to exactly what the coefficients of that
Gompertz
relationship after this data but let me
just cut to the chase and tell you it's
a bit flatter the mortality rate
doubling time is a bit longer than it is
for people in the 70s and 80s and 90s
but only a bit larger it might be up
around 10 years rather than seven years
it's definitely a very straight line
so well that's great we've got this
result but it's very boring so why am i
bothering to come here and talk about it
the answer is what happens if you go
beyond 140 no it turns out that not very
many people have lived beyond 114 only
100 are in fact in the GI gfs but even
with that tiny amount of data a hundred
one hundred and twenty people something
like that you can get some rather
interesting conclusions this is exactly
the same analysis if you go all the way
out to the very oldest people that
person at the top right there that is
obviously Jan koum or herself who lived
one hundred and twenty two and a half
and you can see that it doesn't really
fit quite so well you've got this lovely
fit out to 150 140 and then it can get a
little steeper and then it gets a little
shallower again no it doesn't look very
impressive when you look at it like that
but it turns out but if you actually do
the numbers it is impressive the
r-squared that we get there by Monte
Carlo analysis the same that I just
mentioned is very low indeed what this
says is that we can be more than 99%
sure that the behavior of mortality for
people at the age of a hundred and
fourteen up does not follow the same
exponential curve with the same
parameter and Gompertz parameters as
people from 114 down it just doesn't we
can say that with more than 99%
confidence now what the hell I have no
idea another biologist I ought to have
some ideas at least even if I don't know
whether I'm right but the fact is it's a
very paradoxical result and in case you
were beginning to worry that I might
have got the master on or anything
here's the result if we actually plot it
a bit differently what I have here is
the same data that I showed you a moment
ago with the with the earlier flow
subtracted I just said okay let's go
back let's go
let's just subtract that slope from this
data and then would it look like and it
looks like that and that's pretty damned
unmistakable that is not a straight line
that is not a horizontal line anymore
right
but the fact is we need to understand it
now I do not understand it but I sure as
hell want to know I feel it I want to
understand it
because it's real this phenomenon of a
kind of wall of death at age 150 116 was
observed by the gerontology research
group several years ago but of course
they didn't know how to mathematically
analyze it they said it looks like it's
going up really rather fast what's going
on and all the pompous academic said oh
go away there's obviously not enough
data this is obviously going to
disappear once we have more data well it
turns out the amateurs were right the
amateurs were right this is real so I'm
going to quit the maths there that's
basically all I have to say about the
analysis and I'm just going to talk now
at the end about how we might be able to
move forward medically in other words
I'm going to give a kind of one slide
summary of my day job if you want to
understand in depth the kind of stuff
that I do and the kind of stuff that
sense Research Foundation does well
there are about a thousand videos of me
online on YouTube so that's probably the
best way though of course I'm happy to
answer questions about any of that right
now and I am grateful for the
opportunity to give a very different
talk today but I will nevertheless spend
a few minutes now just talking about
what to do because of course the main
reason why we study the oldest told is
in order and I said at the beginning of
the talk in order to get some ideas
about how we might keep all of us
healthier
into older ages because the people who
get to the extreme ages they didn't get
there by staying alive for a long time
in a bad state of health in
senescent athena effect invariably
the way you get to be a hundred and ten
is by getting to the age of a hundred
and the same state of health that your
average person is when they're 80 and
getting to the age of 90 in the same
state of health that the average person
is when they're 70 this is universal so
it's really something we need to
understand and if we want to understand
how well how likely we are to actually
do it to develop medicines that do keep
people alive for a lot longer in a good
set of help then and how soon we're
going to do it then we have to ask how
we're going to do it we have to look at
what's going on in laboratories like
ours and where it's going how much
further there is to go before it hits
the clinic and so on so I'm just going
to briefly explain what we do we can
also start that I'm going to just give
you a definition of Aging and this is my
three word definition of Aging
metabolism causes damage causes
pathology metabolism of course is the
word the biologists use to encompass
everything that the body does to keep us
alive from one day to the next this huge
vast network of complicated processes
the thing is that metabolism creates
damage in exactly the same way that
using a car creates damage to the car
you know rust and stuff like that
gradually accumulate similarly for any
machine whether it's alive or not the
operation of the machine creates damage
throughout life lifelong that's clear
really important damage starts to
accumulate in our bodies even before we
are born and that damage is eventually
problematic it's not problematic first
because the body is set up to tolerate a
certain amount of damage without
declining function but eventually the
damage becomes too abundant and we start
to get sick the pathologies of old age
emerge in late life and of course
eventually they become completely inter
portable and we die now this means that
the
main way that people have adopted to
actually keep people healthy in old age
we're never going to work that's what I
call geriatrics here geriatric medicine
geriatric medicine is all about
attacking the ill health of old age
Alzheimer's disease most cancers after
expressing some attacking these things
directly as if they were infections that
could be eliminated from the body
it's obviously completely misguided
because the damage that is causing these
pathology is continuing to accumulate as
metabolism continues to operate and
therefore we end up with any geriatric
nurse and any medicine that attacks the
consequences of damage becoming
progressively less effective as the
person gets older just a completely
misguided way of thinking the approach
that has been adopted over the past
century by a small but you know
determined community of biologists in
response to the realization that Gary
attic medicine was never going to work
has also not work unfortunately it is
essentially to clean up metabolism the
whole field of the biology of Aging is
focused ultimately on the idea that we
might be able to actually reduce the
rate at which metabolism creates damage
call it cleaning up metabolism if we
could do that of course we would
postpone the age at which the damage
reaches a problematic level but that
hasn't worked either because it turns
out that metabolism is just too
complicated we just can't mess around
with metabolism in such a way as to stop
it from creating damage without having
unintended consequences but stop it from
doing the things we needed to do so
that's not work either but luckily there
is a third approach which is the
approach that I essentially pioneered
and have been promoting for the past 17
years or so which is the maintenance
approach the damage repair approach here
what we say is let's leave metabolism a
lot let's actually let metabolism create
damage at the next
all rates if it can then if we're
letting it do that then we don't need to
understand metabolism we don't need to
worry about the fact that metabolism is
so impenetrably complicated but still we
get the results if we repair the damage
periodically then the damage will not
get to the level that is problematic and
pathogenic even though it's still being
created at the normal rate so this is a
approach that I believe is extremely
promising and it turns out that if you
get down into the details of what the
damage is that you need to repair you
can describe it quite simply as you'll
see in other videos that I've talked
about given I normally describe damage
of having just seven constituents seven
different types of damage that need to
be fixed and we're getting there so if
you actually wanna know how long people
born today are going to live then think
about some kind of trend line from the
rate of increasing longevity that
happened over the past century because
that is not going to give you anything
near a reliable answer the only way to
predict how long people who are born
today will live or could live is by
looking in the laboratory at the kind of
work that is being done and the kind of
predictions that people like me are
making about how soon that worth will
translate into medicines that actually
succeed in this goal that is how to
predict longevity in the future so I'll
stop there thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
