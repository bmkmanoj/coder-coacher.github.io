serious challenge from technological
innovation from artificial intelligence
when robots and artificial intelligence
and powered machines more generally pass
the so-called Turing test that is the
man we reach a stage where you pick up
the phone you can call your bank you
call a restaurant to order takeaway and
you cannot distinguish from the voice of
the of that you hear on the phone
whether this is a machine speaking to
you or a human being because they sound
similar and they do the same job talking
to you then suddenly you can imagine the
impact this is going to have an
employment throughout capitalism in the
1970s and 80s where the shift of
employment from industry to sell the
service sector to banks supermarkets to
restaurants yeah the moment machines
have overcome the Turing test pass it
you can have for the first time in the
history of capitalism technology
destroying a lot more jobs and it is
creating so you can have a massive
reduction in aggregate demand this is
going to create more deflationary forces
income will become even more
concentrated in the hands of those who
own the machines but even they will
suffer in a long term because the demand
will not be there for the product of the
machines so this is something we really
need to look to to think very carefully
about it is clear that the returns the
money earned by the machines must be
spread out the solution so we need a
universal basic income but not one
funded by taxation we need effectively
to take the returns to capital the
returns to automation and spread them
throughout society because let's face it
all these are deficient take your smart
phone your smart phone whether it's an
Apple Samsung Sony whatever it is most
of the technologies in there
we're provided by public funding every
time you search on a search engine you
contribute to the capital of that
company Google Microsoft whatever they
are so the capital based on which these
new products are being created in the
robots is socially produced those who
the capitalist one of those companies do
not have the right to hold the returns
to capital because they did not produce
that capital it was produced by the
state with produced by public its
crowd-sourced so we need to socialize
the returns to capital and that is non
taxation effectively what we are saying
is a part of the rights the property
rights to the returns of capital over
the property rights over a segment of
the returns to capital must be flowing
into a social fund Social Welfare Fund
or well fund from which everybody gets
paid a dividend as if we are
shareholders because we are shareholders
in artificial intentions we should be
shareholders so this is the fundamental
distinction fund a universal basic
dividend but not from taxation but from
there in terms of capital and that's the
m25 s position</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
