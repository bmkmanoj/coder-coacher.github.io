two seconds too but just a little bit of
logistics it's been 87 years since John
Maynard Keynes wrote the economic
possibilities of our grandchildren he
wrote about the relationship between
economics and work and of course he
argued that technology displaces jobs
but not work and so we have this
remarkable puzzle and that makes me
today a little bit like a tour guide at
a Rorschach test so a note about process
I'm going to bring out the speakers I'm
going to just introduce their names I'm
going to invite you to look at your
program for their Biograph biographies I
also want to ask you to help me if you
will tweet questions that's 140
characters to hash tag MIT AI jobs I
will do my best to weave your questions
into our conversation which are going to
be short and so then the only question
is whether I can walk and chew gum at
the same time so if we can bring out our
first panel Erik Brynjolfsson kai Fuli
James moneka and Mona Burnett yeah
actually bonus at the far end you sit
there yeah that's great and why don't
you know I'll take this one you take
that one yeah and you're first so good
morning I'm Erik Brynjolfsson I'm the
director of the MIT initiative on the
digital economy and the first thing I
want to do is add my welcome to Rafael
rice and Daniella ruses I'm so glad that
you guys are all here I see what we're
doing is one of the the biggest
opportunities and one of the biggest
challenges for our society for our
generation maybe maybe for all of
history and as you know we have an
amazing line-up of speakers but I also
want to underscore what John just said
that we want to engage all of you so I
please encourage you to please go ahead
and tweet your questions and ideas to
that URL hashtag MIT AI jobs and we'll
we'll do our best to incorporate those
and collate those so let me talk a
little bit about this great challenge
and opportunity we have right
and a fun way to start the conversation
is just to ask a question which is what
do you think were the most important
events in all of human history and this
is a thing I sometimes do at dinner
parties and discussing it you get all
sorts of interesting answers to this
people will say they'll talk about the
rise and fall of the Roman Empire or the
invention of paper 2,000 years ago in
China or the discovery of America all
sorts of different ideas it's Lively
and so I encourage you to do this one
time and let the discussion run a little
bit and then and then show them this
chart and if you think about it there
are all these amazing things that happen
through history about new religions
kings and emperors black plague but the
living standards of the average person
the typical person didn't really change
all that much for thousands and
thousands of years until the Industrial
Revolution until James Watt invented a
better steam engine until a bunch of
people figured out ways of incorporating
that into their minds their factories
into their transportation systems and
all sorts of metrics of human progress
all just started improving dramatically
and the reason that we today in this
room and really around the world are
tens or even hundreds of times wealthier
than our ancestors a couple of hundred
years ago is because of Technology and
as Raphael said this morning here at
this Institute of Technology we're very
proud of the role that technology has
played to lift so many people out of
poverty the technology that really
triggered the Industrial Revolution was
all about augmenting our muscles the
steam engine the later the electric
dynamo the internal combustion engine
they basically brought more and more
power to us to be able to shift around
the physical world but you know we're
now in the early stages of another
transformation Andrew McAfee and I
called the second Machine Age we're we
using technologies to augment not just
our muscles but our brains allow us to
control the world and make them figure
things out more effectively and this I
think has at least as much potential as
the first machine age the one that
augmented our muscles for most of that
period in this second Machine Age the
machines had to be told very explicitly
what to do what Jana McCune was calling
good old-fashioned oai and just
traditional programming and any of you
guys who have coated you know you have
to be very precise when you code things
you have to write down in detailed
description of what you want the machine
to do we're not in a second wave of the
second Machine Age where machines are
beginning to learn how to figure out how
to solve problems on their own Yann gave
a bunch of great examples one of the
ones that really was an aha moment for
me was when a team at at google deepmind
developed a system to play Atari video
game something I spent much of my wasted
much of my youth doing maybe some of you
did as well so I was impressed when they
gave just the raw pixels of Atari video
games to a machine reinforcement
learning system and they gave it to
other pieces of information they gave it
the score and they gave it a controller
that could move around I think but they
didn't explain the rules they didn't
even say what the objects were that
whether these pixels represented blocks
or a ball or a paddle and they just let
it run and giving it this raw
information what you saw was that at
first it sort of randomly just wiggled
around the paddle and sometimes would
hit sometimes wouldn't but the
reinforcement learning system taught it
to try to more and more use it
effectively and so after about 300 games
the machine started getting to be pretty
good as good as I was when I was a
teenager hitting the ball most of the
time and being very successful and so
I'd learned this entirely on its own
without being hard-coded what it was
supposed to how what strategies are
supposed to use they let it run for
another few hundred games and it started
figuring out new strategies that none of
the programmers had figured out for
instance it figured out how to send the
ball around to the back of the thing
there and get a lot more points and the
guys who wrote these reinforcement
learning system says they didn't even
know you could do that strategy that was
something obviously they hadn't spent
enough time playing breakout but but
this is something that shows that a
machine can learn on its own in
remarkable ways and these technologies
now are being used
just to play video games but to help
cure cancer to run data centers more
effectively and a whole host of other
things we're going to hear about we
heard something this morning we'll hear
more in the rest of the conference but
this is a real milestone in human
history and machine history I guess
because we are now able to have machines
that figure out how to solve problems on
their own and potentially do a lot of
things that make us all much wealthier
and healthier and better off but before
we get to the other panels just want to
leave one last point and we've heard
about this a little bit this morning as
well which is that it's all not all
roses and butterflies
while labor productivity is up and it's
at record levels the United States and
around the world other economic
indicators aren't doing as well
Andy McAfee and I wrote an article
called a great decoupling that describe
how many of these economic indicators
that used to be tightly coupled for most
of the past couple hundred years rising
median income rising employment have now
become decoupled and although
productivity continues to grow median
income the income of the person at the
fiftieth percentile in the United States
is basically the same now as it was in
the 1990s so most people have not
participated in this games but I agree
with what Rafael said that this is not
function necessarily of the technology
this is a function of how we use the
technology and we have different ways of
deploying the technology and different
kinds of institutions different
investments we can make in education
that lead to different sets of outcomes
ultimately we can create more inclusive
innovation and more broadly shared
prosperity but we have to take on these
challenges not just of making amazing
technologies but also changing the
future of work in a way that everybody
benefits so let me leave it at that and
turn it over the other panelists thank
you my name is Kai Foley I'm a venture
capitalist from China we make
investments in China and the United
States and moat and about half of our
investments are in artificial
intelligence so you've heard about the
research aspect of AI but I want to
share that from a product ization of AI
that's really the age that we're
entering
even if we freeze all the AI research
right now the existing technologies that
are known to us turned into products
apply to many domains will generate a
phenomenal amount of value for mankind
so as a venture capitalist or as a large
company that can harness these
technologies and make money and build
value from them
this is the Golden Age of AI now of
course with the research things will go
even faster the first picture shows from
my company salivation Ventures well we
see about the four waves of AI they're
not stages they all happen together not
some earlier than others but they're not
sequential the first wave can be
considered the internet data wave that
is AI is driven by data the more data
you have the better off you are and the
first set of people who got the huge
amounts of data from us are the internet
companies not only did did we become
data contributors we became free data
labelers every client you clicked on an
Amazon result or Google result you're
giving them training data to make their
AI stronger and that made them the first
powerhouses in AI in the US that's
Amazon Microsoft they speak book Google
in China it's Baidu $0.10 Alibaba and
there are many more companies coming
that way building consumer internet
applications mining the data and doing
essentially Big Data AI to create a lot
of value that wave is happening right
now still very strongly probably the
largest legacy that we'll know is that
it has created these giant internet
behemoths that may end up becoming
monopolists or very powerful companies
that will make it difficult for startups
and professors the second wave is the
wave of commercial data that is
companies like banks and insurance and
hospitals have accumulated records
digital records for the purpose of
archiving or legal reasons now they're
sitting on a data mine and that can be
used for medical diagnoses credit fraud
and so on and so forth and that's a huge
that's emerging now the third is what
about people who don't have digital data
can they collect it and create
applications that were not in place
before so Amazon echo is in your living
rooms collecting data right now that
wasn't possible three years ago and as
are the cameras in the shopping malls
airports and so on collecting data and
all that data can be billed for
smart home intelligent traffic smart
City the brain of a new city and so on
that will revolutionize a lot of things
and then lastly is the full automation
robotics and autonomous vehicles you've
heard enough about that in the press I
won't go into it they're increasing in
difficulty but they're all going to
happen now if we switch gears to the
topic of today that is the future of
work the first wave isn't much about
work replacement it's largely a
Productivity and something we enjoy as
internet apps and websites but the
second wave will replace a lot of white
collar workers in legal finance and so
on and the third wave will replace even
more people and then the fourth wave
will replace the blue collar workforce
in my opinion the white collar for work
force actually gets challenged first the
blue collar later different from what
you see from a lot of industry reports
so let's make that practical what really
happens let's look at the right side for
example those are three portfolio
companies that we fund so I'm not
talking out out of theory or anything or
not out of theory but in real practice
so the first company we fund on this
list is called face plus plus you may
have seen earlier this week they
obtained 460 million u.s. dollars in
funding not valuation but funding
because they have a massive amount of
data that's making them probably the
best face recognition and in fact human
and gesture recognition and tracking
company in the world in reality they are
replacing security-guard front desks and
some work of the police by deploying
this the accuracy of tracking down
criminals have gone dramatically up with
cameras being deployed
in places like airports they can
recognize some 3 million faces
simultaneously pretty much the database
everyone wanted on Interpol and there
will be no more 9-1-1 if this were
deeply broadly obviously some privacy
issues can not subjective this
discussion the second one is a bot which
is the customer service replacements
basically a deep learning algorithm plus
the search engine applied to answer
questions for a company to its customers
it's replacing tens of thousands of
customer service reps the third one is a
credit basically loan approval officer
is for smaller loans so actually there
are no officers doing smaller loans but
but this algorithm will apply to bigger
loans and they're equivalently doing the
work of tens of thousands of loan
officers so this job replacement is
happening now and is happening in the
true complete decimation this is not a
replacement of work many optimists say
that when a tech tech revolutions come
with jobs will go jobs will come like on
the left side you see that in the
Industrial Revolution artisan jobs
became assembly line jobs
so naturally jobs were lost jobs were
gained but on the right hand example the
jobs are completed and gone completely
so while there are cases where new jobs
will be created I say that's the
exception and we have to somehow as
mankind
deal with this massive decimation of
jobs over the next 10 to 15 years my
views i I can prop I'll go over quickly
and then maybe can talk more about it
one there's a lot of people talk about
ubi I think eradicating poverty is our
responsibility giving everybody $20,000
might be overdoing it reinventing
education because will find that the
jobs that are clearly not replaceable
are of two kinds one is creative job and
the other is social service jobs of love
because machines a is as we project
forward cannot yet create anything out
of nothing and that creativity whether
scientific artistic or storytelling are
for people and we need to find talent
and train them and hone our education to
make those people learn the skills that
they need to change
the world because the value of each
country will be measured by the
percentage of creatives they have not by
the size of population the size of a
population may become a liability in
fact the third category is what about
all the people who are displaced what
job will they do and can they do I think
is hard to train someone from an
assembly line to become a rocket
scientist but one could consider service
jobs jobs that are touch people jobs
that help people tourist guides
concierge even jobs like just talking to
people taking care of older people
taking them to hospitals these are jobs
I think we have to create and I don't
think they'll come out of simply out of
corporate retraining and staff people
are going to companies will downsize
people will be gone and will we have to
figure out that's governments and as
socially responsible people to push to
help move them to a service level
profession and change our work ethic
today which is largely simply described
as if we work really hard even if it's a
retail routine trivial job we can get
respect dignity and wealth and that's
what we want in life that work ethic is
just wrong because if we hold on to that
work ethic as our work is replaced what
will happen to the sense of
actualization of the people whose jobs
are gone so I think we really have to
think about how that can evolve so over
overall I believe will end up as human
beings in the smaller circle of creative
jobs in a much larger circle of social
carrying jobs using tasks AI created and
that's how we might be able to coexist
with AI thank you
thank you my name is James manuka think
as you've heard for most of the talks
today I'm gonna draw by the way on work
that my colleagues and I do quite
frankly with the help of some people in
this room I can actually see some of
them in this room and Andy and Erica
among them I'm gonna talk about a couple
things I think first ones it's already
very clear from the talks you've heard
today that we've made amazing progress
in AI or autonomous systems and and
robotics in fact we've made more
progress than I ever imagined 20 years
ago and I did my research in air and
robotics the second thing that that
we've also heard and I think Eric
touched upon it is that for the most
part this is actually huge brings huge
benefits to businesses and we spend a
lot of time working with companies and
looking at all kinds of use cases and
undoubtedly there's a plethora of use
cases and applications that are going to
enhance business performance ability of
businesses to predict and so forth it's
also good for the economy in the sense
that much of the productivity gains come
from using and harnessing the power of
these technologies and autonomous
systems to contribute to productivity
growth which also contributes to
economic growth so good for good for
businesses good for the for the economy
in that sense and I think also good for
society in the sense that a lot of these
techniques are now making it possible
for us to address and solve if you like
societal moonshots we're going to make a
lot of progress in climate science in
healthcare harnessing the power of these
technologies but I think the question on
on most people's minds these days is
what about work as kind of the question
so this is all good for the economy for
business what about work we spent a fair
amount of time looking at this question
and what we've done is taken almost a
task activity level view of this in the
US economy the BLS typically categorized
is something like 828 occupation
categories there's data sets available
out there owned as being one and a few
others that capture something like over
2000 activities so we know what people
actually doing those occupations there's
something like 18
so different capabilities where you'd
want to think about what the machines
can do these things are not there range
from sensory activities to perception
cognitive tasks but also physical gross
and motor skills and so forth when you
put all that together and try and
understand how much of that will
actually affect an impact activities
that are done in the economy what you
come up with is something like this
that's what we came up with this is
based on what current technologies can
do and we put the activities here in
roughly eight categories what you see is
that the activities over to the right
that are in the blue are the kind of
categories of activities that are most
easily automatable with today's current
it currently demonstrated technologies
either technologies that already there
are in labs at MIT in other cases or
actual products what you'll see and
these are those three categories are
activities that involve collecting data
in some form of fashion processing data
in some form of fashion making sense of
it as well as physical work in highly
structured environments robot turns out
robots actually work pretty well when
they're in very structured lighting
control things laid out exactly you want
them to do to be and so forth those
activities on the right are turn out to
be a big chunk of what people I should
do in the economy today they make up you
know 50 51 percent of this is us data of
what people actually do in the economy
and what they get paid to do the things
over on the left and the orange brown
colors are the things that it is for now
are harder to automate so already start
to see that a big part of what people do
could be automatable this is just a fun
chart these are all the dots here show
occupations and and they indicate the
purport so the higher up your on the
vertical scale is an indication of what
proportion of your activities are
technically easy to automate if you're
lower down it means it's harder it's
smaller proportion of what you do is
easy to automate and it's actually quite
interesting facts tend to be higher up
on the scale because a lot of what they
do is most computational in a very
structured in
you know highly you know easy to
automate environment a fairly routine to
some extent although you see that for
example I think I foo made this point
people doing landscaping groundskeeping
work are much lower down because it
turns out that even though we've made
progress with physical robots that can
operate in physical environments that's
still relatively harder to do and by the
way and so so that's a and it's these
are typically people working in highly
unstructured environments are much
harder to do for fun with outreach or
where CEOs but you start to see that
there's a there's an interesting view
here to what could be automated the
other point I'd like to make is this one
which is in some ways perhaps a bigger
point when we look at occupations and
try to understand
so which occupations have close to most
of their activities easily automatable
turns out is actually relatively small
number it is based on today's technology
it's about 5% of the occupations but if
you look at the other side of this you
certainly see realize that something
like 60% of occupations have something
like a third of their activities that
are easy to automate so what you then
realize is that many more jobs are
probably going to change than go away as
people start to work alongside machines
and that's actually a bigger phenomena
it's already happening today
think about how any of our jobs have
changed and we're probably going to see
even more of that as you kind of see the
cognitive organ tation that Erika was
was talking about so this question of
jobs lost but also jobs changed is an
important part of how to think about
this question of the impact on work so
the question that ends up on everybody's
mind then is therefore okay so with all
this change between some jobs lost jobs
changed maybe even jobs gained because
of course part of what's gonna happen is
that some of the new categories are
gonna get created in fact we know that
if you take any period its what dick
Cooper at Harvard called the other other
the fastest-growing category of work of
occupations tend to be the other
category which are the occupation we
didn't know about that keep growing and
getting created every single time so if
you looked at the road
Sudi so you're gonna have some jobs lost
some jobs changed in some job change so
where does this all net out well rather
than try and make a prediction there are
a couple of scenarios that are worth
thinking about the first one is you know
a lot of this obviously depends on the
rate and extent of adoption of these
techniques into what people actually do
and by the way a lot of what I just
showed you is largely trying to answer
the question about technical feasibility
of automation we know that that's not
the only factor that matters in a
digital technical feasibility you have
to take into account the cost of
deploying these technologies you have to
take into account how that plays into
the labor markets and what wage
structures are so if you're trying to
automate for example somebody who earns
an occupation where their wages for that
are $8 an hour that's going to be much
steeper than if you're trying to
automate somebody whose average wages
are say $40 an hour so you have to take
into account the labor quality and
supplies there to take that into account
you also take into account factors like
social acceptance and we know that in
fact some work that's been done here at
MIT in the Media Lab also points to the
fact that cultural acceptance of
automation systems is actually quite
varies across domains and application
areas we know that many of us who've
written in driverless cars the scariest
things when you sit in that car in
Mountain View and you see the empty
driver's seat and this thing is going at
50 miles an hour that's actually quite
terrifying whereas most of us are quite
happy to fly in a plane when we don't
know what's going on behind the cockpit
door the fact we know that pilots rarely
fly out the planes these days but
because we don't see it we are ok with
it so these questions about social
acceptance are a big part so we have to
see how this all plays out but so rate
of adoption is one question the other
question of course is the rate at which
the economy grows drives demand for more
work so where this all Nets out tends to
determine what happens we know that at
least there's one scenario up in the top
where one of the you know this is
scenario which if we if we embrace these
technologies the good thing about that
it actually dries in contributes to
economic growth which also contributes
to creating new jobs
work but we also know that in that
scenario where we had embracing these
technologies it's probably going to lead
to higher rates of churn and change in
the in the in the nature of work but
that's one quadrant you could imagine
another one you could imagine is there
case of which the economy doesn't grow
very much and demand for work actually
you know stagnant or slows down but we
actually adopt all these technologies
that's a person more worrisome future
where you might imagine if you like
jobless productivity where we might
actually have net job growth below but
in fact we're getting the productivity
efficiency benefits from these
technologies there's also another
somewhat worrying scenario which is the
you know in a case where we have much
slower adoption of these technologies
which also then doesn't which slows down
if you like the contributions to
productivity and and also which in turn
lead to slower economic growth but you
could imagine in that world where there
are more jobs available because we're
moving through this much slower but
those jobs will tend to be you know the
churn is lower but you might then start
to worry about the nature of incomes
away to wages what happens in a
relatively slow growth economy and has
all these other issues then of course
there's a scenario in which we don't
adopt these technologies at all the
economies don't grow at all and you kind
of has circular stagnation so I think
there's obviously we can have a long
debate about where we think we ought to
be end up in what what should happen but
what we do know for sure are a couple
things we know that the mix of work and
occupations are going to change we know
that with the adoption of these
technologies there's categories of work
that actually are very large in the
economy today that in fact you know over
time they're likely to decline in terms
of the share of them in the economy and
others and I think I've made this point
that are likely to grow so we have to
think about what that means is the
occupation makes changes we also have to
think about the implications on skill
and educational requirements both
because of the nature nature of mix of
occupations but also in terms of this
idea of jobs changing and then finally
we also have to think about you know
what kind of educational requirements
are going to be needed we know that in
fast economies is quite likely that in
fact the entry-level requirements are
actually going to grow are going to are
going to increase so the kinds of jobs
are going to need more people with
higher levels of education and skills
are only going to go up
whereas in rubbing corners you have a
slightly different picture but that's
the story for another time let me stop
at that point thank you so this is a
great segue to what I want to talk about
some from Thomson Reuters and I look
after our R&amp;amp;D and AI and one of the
thing we do we're one of the second wave
companies we are in the commercial data
business but one other thing we look a
lot at is how are how is work changing
for knowledge workers so we sell data to
in the financial industry we serve
lawyers accountants people that are
broadly in this knowledge work category
and I think the conversation around
automation might be missing in your ants
that's really important which is the
idea of providing cognitive augmentation
for for people so we think about how do
you take a lawyer and give him super
power and I think if you look at that
equation then maybe the conversation
around the future of work might be very
different so in our case some of the
thing we are looking at quite a bit is
advanced in AI creating more
sophisticated solutions like billing
massive knowledge graphs which we we've
been my team has been working on but
really the the part I wanted to talk
about here is that we've talked a lot
about the demonstrated technology so we
have a great algorithm that can play
Atari that's awesome in fact I work with
lots of universities when we reserved
Toronto too and I teach University of
Waterloo to various things we see in the
laboratory that is awesome in fact you
can predict the likelihood that queries
of humans can tell better than a CDC if
there is a flu outbreak well it turns
out that demonstrating the technology is
awesome and exciting getting into the
point where it becomes part of the way
humans are augmented is a big leap
I want to talk a little bit about that
since in my world we have to go beyond
the demonstration and actually make the
thing work and be part of a tool so one
of the tool I wanted to describe here is
so Thomson Reuters has an army of
brilliant journalists working around the
world and one of the things we did for
them is figure out how to give them
superpower it turns out there is a
problem called fake news that is kind of
a big deal in the u.s. these days and
one of the thing that journalists I've
been doing if you look at their workflow
is understand when there is breaking
news by looking at social media well it
turns out that working with them
understanding the way they work we've
been able to use machine learning to
give them a tool that is better than the
human to help them identify breaking
news in social media and at the same
time basically a system and identifying
fake news from breaking news so the
journalist is still there but he has
better power super power and I think
that's the kind of example of things
were working for lawyers for accountants
for financial advisors and so on so what
I wanted to talk about something I've
been thinking a lot about is a few
heuristics being an MIT alumni I think
about systems a lot and so I wanted to
talk a little bit about what I think AI
is doing if you think about the firm and
I think AI is changing the architecture
of the firm
so yes technology development gives us
the ability to answer great questions we
couldn't answer otherwise and because we
have big data now and we have this
stronger smarter compute power and lower
storage cost we can bring lots of noisy
data and you know look at what it does
an algorithm and answer this question
that's really awesome the thing is
there's a big leap between the art of
the possible demonstration the thing
that gets us an awesome academic paper
that gets you know the guys in my heart
and d-lab really excited to something
that actually gives super power to a
lawyer over and over again that is a big
leap and there is a reason why this is
not happening is that I think somewhere
along the line we forgot about this
being called industrial process control
okay so you hire a bunch of really smart
AI researchers but somewhere you have to
monitor the data monitor what's change
in the system waters characteristic of
the data model and understand what's
happening is your model as performant as
it used to be and basically create a
whole new category of quality control in
the in the organization in the
manufacturing plant in the operations
research operations folks that are
running all those things and that I
don't think when I talk to a lot of
companies is still front in mind in fact
I don't know how many job descriptions
say something different done I'm looking
for this awesome Rockstar data science
unicorn and actually says I'm looking
for someone who sits there and
establishes industrial process control
for modeling the data validating that
the parameters haven't changed and if
they've changed what the consequences
are in the performance of the model I
haven't seen a lot of those job
descriptions but my prediction is
they're coming because we are going to
get we see so much value from AI that we
want to turn it into a day to day
superpower and the other piece which of
course is exciting the research for my
colleagues at the Sloan School and other
Business School is that the architecture
the firm has to change there are going
to be perhaps paradox and different
pools and pull between a business goal
and running the appropriate experiment
to be able to collect sufficient data to
validate that the model still works
that's a very different thing if you're
doing agile and constantly rewriting
your code that might be a different
behavior to say sit still collect three
weeks of data hidden algorithm and do
nothing really do nothing that's agile
that's really weird how do I do that
project management skills how do you
explain to our product management how to
design and sell a I products what's
happening to business model what's
happening to pricing of information
goods as you're starting to deploy AI
what are the expectation of your
customers if they're used to highly you
know customized features and now you're
saying you know what let the Machine
make all this decision so there is I
think in order to get adoption real
value augmentation of cognitive power
for humans it's not only the technology
it's really thinking about its maturing
and operationalization and how is the
firm changing in order to make that
happen
Thanks this is great we don't have
complete consensus but let's start with
our title the AI revolution why now what
it means and how to realize the
potentials so Eric why now that's a
great question and the question is is
this time different and and and what is
different now
and I think that there are three really
powerful trends that have come together
that really are driving this revolution
the first disk i few mentions is just a
lot more data and we have so much
digital data now twenty years ago most
data was analog think of photographs or
most other things and that's the
lifeblood that's the driver of these new
machine learning systems the second
thing is vastly more computer power the
computers today are hundreds of times
more powerful than they were a few
decades ago we did the arithmetic and
some of the systems that now figure out
voice recognition if you ran them on
1990s vintage computers they would have
taken 250 years to to run so we have not
just Moore's law but new processing
chips like TP use and then last but not
least is incredible improvements in some
of the basic algorithms people like Yann
laocoon and geoff hinton and others have
made some breakthroughs and that allow
us to use these technologies more
effectively so you put those together
there's been roughly in some categories
about a million fold improvement between
the the vast increase in data
availability the more computational
power and the better algorithms so for
instance recognizing pedestrians for
self-driving cars that is about a
million times more accurate than it was
in some of the early systems and I'm
very optimistic that this trend will
continue to accelerate Keiko and James
both talked about what would happen if
we just froze technology and use today's
automation technologies and all the jobs
the economy would be affected and I
agree with what they're saying but of
course the technology is not frozen I
think that those three trends I just
mentioned are not stopping with the
Internet of Things and continued
progress and computers and new
architectures and of course far more
people going into the field there are 10
times it up if you look at the charts of
people going into AI research it's
almost an exponential trend itself and
each of them are inventing new ways of
using the technology let's stay on this
team a little bit longer Caillou
let me push back on just a little bit
we've had integrated circuits for 70
years we've had microprocessors for 60
years to take a question from David
autor and MIT labor economist why are
there still so many jobs now well the
current generation of GPU plus CPU is as
Eric said so much more powerful than
during the days when I was doing my PhD
right I thought I was talking about me
that it literally took us several days
to recognize one sentence of speech and
in fact I think you know back then it
was impossible to do the experiments
that are being done now with the massive
amounts of data and training and and
that's just with the data that we can
collect and use there's a lot of
imagined applications we can we don't
yet think about that will further push
push this out imagine I think the
computation will probably increase
another million times in just the next
few years with all the applications we
can't imagine not that the CPUs will get
faster but their proliferation all of
our phones will be able to do deep
learning our traffic lights will be
hooked up as an example recently in
China one company basically put cameras
to see what care cars were going where
and used that to modulate the traffic
lights and and the the traffic the time
to destination was reduced 15% for the
drivers on the road during busy hours so
the and that kind of application you can
imagine needs all kinds of sensors on
cars roads everywhere so the age of IOT
will come and that level
computing will be even you know a
million times more than now and we are a
million times more than when I did my
thesis so I think the computation
problem will be solved James let me ask
you just a little bit about task
automation so James Besson at Boston
University has done a fascinating piece
of research where he points out that
it's actually a positive coral is a
correlation and these si si codes
between the degree of automation and the
rate of job growth which is totally
counterintuitive did you find that in
your research and does it mean if we're
automating tasks that actually the
number of jobs will grow overall so
short answer is yes that correlation is
actually the case and I think the reason
why - David there are just question
about why they still work I think then
at least two or three reasons I can
think of one is the fact that economies
grow and there's always a level of
dynamism and new job creation and shifts
think about what happens when people
move from our green culture - to
manufacturing and then out to the
service economy so we're always creating
new occupations and new jobs the other
thing to keep in mind is that it's one
thing to talk about technical
feasibility it's quite another to think
about the economics and deployment and
how this plays out in the labor markets
one way to think about that as an
example is think about the electric car
when did we demonstrate it was
technically feasible to build an
electric vehicle four or five decades
ago when did they actually show up on
the street a decade or less ago that
because what had what happened between
those two points was the we needed to
build systems that actually worked and
within certain cost parameters and
certain performance parameters and it's
all these kind of replacement questions
and rates that kick into the pace of
adoption so when you talk whether the
rate at which the chickens are gonna be
adopted and become pervasive that's
actually much slower than the rate of
technical feasibility to do these tasks
so that that's actually one reason but
your point about tasks is as I said one
of the things that's interesting is that
you know there are going to be fewer
instances when we're automating entire
jobs relative to partial automation and
we know that when people work alongside
machines often magic happens there's a
higher productivity but that also raises
the skill requirements and so to the
extent that we can up the
skill requirements and in fact create
demand for work we will create jobs I'm
actually less worried about will there
be enough work I'm worried about other
things I'm worried about the skill gaps
and the transitions and how we deal with
that and I worry about the income
effects but I'm less worried about the
will there be enough jobs question Eric
quickly and then I have a question well
yeah I just want to also I want to push
back on the premise of that question a
little bit yes there are lots of jobs
created but as I showed in that chart
there weren't certainly good jobs and so
a lot of the median income actually has
been falling so there been a lot of
people struggling it's not like it's
been great over the past 40 years and
you even you go back to the 1800s people
say well we survived that just there was
there was this period of about 30 or 40
years Angles pause some people call it
where wages did not rise and do was you
know near revolution or was revolution
in some countries so this is not at all
automatic in the past and and this time
around I think as we've just heard
there's some even bigger waves and
happening so I don't think we should be
at all complacent about what could
happen I want to stress though that that
both in the 1800's and and more recently
there are things you can do in terms of
education entrepreneurship and other
things that drive new job creation and
drive wage growth but but this is not
something that just automatically works
itself out and that would not be the way
I would read history so how darkly are
you about this you know there there were
those who argued the middle drops up but
there's growth of the top bottom at them
there's been recently research that
shows that perhaps we're on a sliding
scale and the only place that we're
really getting growth is at the bottom
is it that serious to you it is and I it
is exactly that serious and some of
these technologies that are affecting
radiologists and maybe college
professors I don't know see II always
seem to be somewhat immune I'm not sure
those there's a lot of high end jobs
that will be more and more affected
Caillou and I were talking earlier that
a lot of white-collar jobs are going to
be more effective than in the past but
but I also want to stress that this is
there's not a technological determinism
that that drives this I'm glad that
James put up that that two by two with
the different scenarios we have a lot of
choice as to whether we end up in that
upper right quadrant or we I think most
of us want to be and I don't think we're
making the right policy choices I think
it's wonderful that these technologies
are giving us some options but it's up
to us to up to us to decide where we
want to be on using those technologies
Mona so if you had enough experience
inside Reuters Thompson to see what the
job consequences of deploying machine
learning are what does it look like
inside so I think this is the point I
was trying to make is that you know if
you look at augmenting you know the
process of running a financial audit as
a tax auditor for instance they are a
couple of scenarios I think the
economics of it needs to be studied
right so I'm really excited that your
colleague Josh Ganz are starting to look
at this stuff we can see you can give
super power to a knowledge worker the
question is when you get to a place
where the economics of it change where
you might need ten lawyers and not 20 to
do the work because they're augmented or
do you then have the same 20 lawyers
that are now super effective because
they can use predictive analytics to
figure out how to prepare for their
litigation and that the economics of
their relationship with the customer is
such - what there isn't a demand for
them to be right so it's I think a bit
too early to figure out how that plays
out I live in a knowledge worker area
but the thing that is clear is that a
basis for competitive advantage is to
add AI enabled cognitive augmentation
for those jobs so a quick comment on
your tracker so if you can identify news
in social media why not take people out
of the loop you're in a competitive
business why keep the humans in the loop
because it's not at the point if we can
detect breaking news but it's not to the
point where we can do the analysis and
and really take the story so this is
essentially an alert system for the
journalists as you know there is you
know machine generated news for the very
simple stuff so what that does is it
enables our journalists to focus their
time on the part they're really good at
we're some of the simple sorts of news
stories that are done automatically I
mean they're happening you know for
financial reporting those are happening
automatically I mean there anything
that's very structured can be natural
language generated which i think is
really good news for journalists right
so because we're really relying on their
expertise so the main thing here is a
alone doesn't exist it's the domain
expertise that really brings white the
right question for creating the
augmentation and actually provides the
domain expert the bandwidth to really
think and be more creative and ask the
right questions and then also make the
analysis that only today the humans can
do so let me try to get our audience in
Mary gray asks could speakers talk more
about the role paid workers the role
paid workers play in both training data
and doing quote quality control when AI
gets stuck what happens when the eyes
fail so so that's the point I was making
right which is that in order to have
this technology is being
industrial-grade there is a whole set of
expertise required to monitor the
quality of the data the quality the the
condition in the system in which the
data is collected characterize it model
it and then those don't necessarily need
to be rocket scientist but there's a
whole set of essentially what we used to
do in manufacturing right like the way
we went from used to be that you know
every other car may have been terrible
and then Toyota brought in you know
system control and lean and so on it's
that sort of discipline we're going to
create a set of jobs that may not be
here may be evident for all the first
wave you describe the digital native
company but if you're you know in the
business of building tractors and you
have lots of sensors you may not have in
your factory people who are expert in
understanding how do I monitor the
sensor data in order to build AI enabled
so we're down to our last minute quick
hi food so it doesn't feel a I fails a
lot less than people in the three
examples I gave the AI and long officers
are much much better than human law
officers in terms of bad lungs the face
recognition algorithms are much much
better than people so yes they will fail
occasionally and when they fail there
will be an outcome that can turn into
training data to make it better so let's
say you let someone in to the country
that you shouldn't have they were a
terrorist they got arrested that data
will come back to frame and say okay
next time I'll do better say you gave
along and someone didn't repay that data
will come back to Train so hey I will
keep it getting better unlike people but
you
human to identify those the new data
said today that the machine cannot find
the wrong date occasions you do not
because it's the outcome driven my watch
is buzzing we are you're a good loan or
a good risk is not relevant whether you
repair or not
so thank our panel and we're gonna take
a quick five-minute break and we'll be
back to try to get a little bit back on
time this morning thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
