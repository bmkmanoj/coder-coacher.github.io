us this morning from San Francisco
senior writer for Wired magazine Tom
Simon night to talk about artificial
intelligence in the workplace
Tom Simon Simon ayat what is artificial
intelligence I have it to be here yeah
that's a good question it's one of those
terms we're hearing a lot lately and and
it covers a lot of things so in in the
broadest sense artificial intelligence
is the area of science and engineering
it's all about making computers able to
do the kind of things that humans can do
so look around at the world and make
sense of it solve problems for
themselves pick up new skills through
experience and use the experience
they've had in the past to solve any
problems in the future
recently one of the main ways that
people build these systems is using a
technique called machine learning that's
another term you might hear and that's
that's really kind of simple you
basically take a bunch of example data
and use that to show the software what
it needs to do now we've all been
exposed to artificial intelligence
programs in movies and TV shows that
really are like humans and can you know
walk around and lead their own
independent lives and the reality of the
technology today is is a long way short
of that like the systems where you can
build today they can be smart but in a
very focused narrow narrow way so we can
build these kind of wedges of
intelligence that do one thing pretty
well and a great example of that in
everyone's pocket today is that you know
you can talk to your smartphone and it
will recognize your words and transcribe
them into speech that's thanks to some
recent advances in machine learning that
that's very accurate now but that system
really can't do anything else so it's a
very focus thing sometimes can recognize
your voice ah yeah yeah that's true and
you know people with non-standard
accents certainly have problems and and
there are still lots of wrinkles to be
fixed well times I mean when did this
technology begin how is it evolved and
what is that what is the future okay
well it begins a long time ago the field
and the term artificial intelligence
began in the 50s
and you know we've seen progress since
then but you know we're still a long way
short of robotic Walker and by
themselves the reason we're hearing a
lot about it now is that over the last
five years there has really been a rapid
improvement in the power of machine
learning so this technique where you
take a bunch of data and use it to Train
software and that has led to some very
big increases in accuracy of speech
recognition as we just mentioned and
also image recognition so it's why both
Google and Apple now will let you search
your personal photos for we're using
terms like dog or tree or Beach that
kind of thing and so yeah recent
improvement in those techniques has
really led to some very impressive
scientific results some impressive kind
of new business applications of the
technology as well and and you know out
here on the west coast there is a huge
amount of money being invested into this
technology now and why what is the hope
what is the goal of investing and how
much money are we talking about that's a
good question I mean we've if you add up
all the big companies and the venture
capitalists I mean you know probably
talking figures in the billions over the
last few years I mean just to take one
example Google paid around 600 million
for a uk-based artificial intelligence
company called deep mind a few years ago
I mean this is a big bet why are they
making it I guess because computers
already do so much for us and it's
pretty clear they could do a lot more if
they were they were smarter and so there
are all kinds of applications for this
some of them kind of not the kind of
thing you might notice every day I mean
just improving the targeting of
advertisements would make a big
difference to the bottom line of some of
these big companies some of them are
more transformational and so you can
think about work on robotics and you
know this could lead us to having drones
or household robots that are smart
enough to kind of navigate around the
messy front room in your house or help
you with the chores that kind of thing
probably most of us have been exposed to
these voice assistants where you know
you can talk to Siri or Alexa and I'm
sure we've also seen that those things
are very limited I mean back to my
earlier point you know when we're a long
way from you know AI systems that have
an independent existence but as these
things get more powerful they're really
going to allow all of us to do more in
less time I guess and businesses to do
more things with fewer people like you
know doing the manual work yeah and what
about that I mean what about AI in the
workplace and we were as you were
talking showing our viewers an image of
a robot making a pizza I mean how do we
know what jaws will be replaced by
artificial intelligence what are the
numbers saying yeah great to bring it
down to the numbers
right now the numbers are not suggesting
the you know the machines are taking
jobs away from people this is actually a
point of argument among economists and
business people who think about this so
on the one hand you know we are seeing
the technology get more powerful and you
can certainly make the argument that
that means we can replace people with
machines on the other hand if that was
starting to happen you would expect
businesses to become be becoming more
productive because they could could do
more with technology and and the
economic figures really don't show that
and if we look to the past there are
examples where bringing in machines to
to directly replace people doesn't
actually reduce employment and and so a
good example here is the ATM now the ATM
directly replaces people sitting behind
the counter of a bank handing out your
money and yet when they were introduced
and they were very rapidly adopted by
many banks because they're extremely
convenient the number of bank employees
in the country went up not down because
it freed banks to open more branches and
expand their businesses in other ways so
I personally I'm not picking a soccer
staying on the fence I think there's
good reasons to think that more
technology in the workplace doesn't have
to mean fewer people what about the
other side though folks like Elon Musk
who told governor's at their recent
gathering in Rhode Island that AI is a
fundamental existential risk for human
civilization and I don't think people
fully appreciate that he said he has
access to cutting-edge AI technology in
that based on what he's seen AI is the
scariest problem yeah well this you know
most certainly does have access to
cutting-edge AI technology no one was
disputing that but there's definitely
some argument about this at this point
on the existential threat I spy I wrote
about Musk's remarks to the governor's
and and where I spoke to other people
who work on AI and who's been more time
on it than Elon there was always getting
a sense of disappointment because this
idea that you know at some point in the
future
super intelligent machines will perhaps
harm humanity I mean that is such a long
way from where we are today you know
today we have these simple systems they
can do one thing you know they it's not
a generalized intelligence that can take
on multiple tasks and so it's quite hard
to actually have a proper debate about
that because it's just so far in the
future it's very speculative and so I
spoke to researchers who not only work
on AI but think about the impacts of it
on society and and they saw master
Marx's as kind of a missed opportunity
you know he had a few minutes in front
of some of the most powerful leaders in
the u.s. to talk about this technology
which is going to potentially transform
every aspect of our lives and he chose
to direct it on this very far-off future
scenario which we really I mean okay we
can talk about it right now but we can't
really do much and other people in the
field think you know we should think be
thinking more now about maybe questions
of employment although it must did
mention that as well to give them credit
and questions of you know what about
when the government is using these
technologies maybe for surveillance in
and other areas like that let's hear
what our viewers have to say your
questions and comments here on
artificial intelligence in the workplace
John eastern North Carolina and
independent you're up first
yes yes Tom back in 1996 97 98 I was
working with a group called Spartan that
worked with Blackwater and they were all
into computers part of part of it and we
were sitting around throwing ideas
around and at that point the cloud was
just that the thing the idea of the
cloud was just coming into existence
and I had a cousin that went to how to
math degree from UNC Chapel Hill and she
told me back in the late 60s when she
worked for IBM that Google is just like
a large number it's this like it was a
name that people were messing around
with there were mathematicians that was
the largest form of number that they had
they had come up with with a name and we
tossed around an idea about a word
search algorithm that would actually
take for the there is a nays and the
small words out of a statement sentence
like you'd see on a website and it would
try to prioritize the the most important
words and then it was search for lists
on what was then the cloud that would
actually prioritize and pull up sites
and that's how Google got started cert
they went these people from Spartan
whence New York there was a group of
programmers there about two years for
Google took home and they started
working on word search algorithms that
would apply to the what was available
from the internet and Sergey Brin and
Elon Musk came up with well Sergey Brin
and one of his partners came it up they
dropped out of Stanford and they
perfected the word search algorithm and
that's Google and I think that I had a
partial hand in naming Google thank you
very much Tom Simon a thoughts
John what a great story thanks for
sharing it yeah well I won I could just
kind of riff off that is that yeah I
mean we think if Google is kind of
solved you know we just we've been using
for years now but this question of how
you get computers to understand language
is one of the trickiest in this field of
artificial intelligence and so while
search works pretty good
and so speech recognition is not bad
either translation is getting better but
computers still have what one expert
described to me recently is a literacy
problem you know they describe them as a
literate you know they can't read a
sentence or ingest a paragraph of text
and really get a grip of the meaning of
it and for people that work in this
field you know that's one of the kind of
questions that's hanging over hanging
over them really which is you know if we
really want machines to have
intelligence like as they've got to be
able to to understand language and how
are we going to do that and we really
don't know right now and what happened
Tom Simon I with Facebook recently in
the research they were doing and the the
bots that they had to the program to
understand language and created their
own language and the controversy that
surrounded that yes so earlier in the
month we saw a flurry of alarming
headlines about some research in
Facebook's artificial intelligence labs
that got out of control and and how the
scientists there panicked and had to
shut down it really kind of Hollywood
imagery and that really that really
isn't what happened that the reality of
this experiment is kind of eyes I still
think is interesting but it's not quite
that lurid so this was a research on
pieces of software that are called chat
BOTS so they can generate write simple
sentences and have a back and forth
conversation with with a person or each
other in a very narrow sense and they
were created and programmed to do one
specific thing which was play this game
where you have to negotiate with your
another person a partner and trade
certain items hats and books and balls
and this was a test of a machine
learning idea and so these chat BOTS
could play the simple game and you know
come up with sentences like I'll swap
two books for one ball and they could
experiment a little bit or they could
just like randomly
my things and and see what worked and
then if something worked they would do
it more and initially they had two of
these programs play with each other and
they were experimenting back and forth
and playing this game and then they
started to write come up with sentences
that didn't make sense they just kind of
repeated the same word over and over
they were just kind of garbage really
and and that wasn't scary that was
actually failure the experiment had just
hadn't worked at that point and so well
they realized that they programmed these
things to play the game but they hadn't
you know coded in there a restriction
saying by the way you need to use proper
sentences and when they put that in
these things did learn to play the game
and they could actually play with humans
which was kind of neat I mean they can
play this one particular game can't play
any other game but but that work and so
where the misconception came in I in
some media outlets was that this kind of
initial initial failure of the
experiment was kind of casters like this
kind of creepy a kind of almost
malevolent accident and and that that
really isn't what happened William in
Buffalo New York a Republican good
morning your question or comment I guess
where I'm coming from might seem like a
bit of a curveball for you because it's
similar as you were discussing what the
side effects are on the general populace
we saw what innovations did to the
blue-collar sector about 30 40 years ago
and that had a generational effect
hollowing out communities now we see
technology is coming into the
white-collar sector even I'm sure you're
well aware is a right that there is
software they can write great articles
for you we've seen it with baseball sets
and things of that nature
but I'm not a bad sci-fi movie angle
where we just have droves and negative
situation in more of a positive approach
to this since yes this is coming it can
all be very good for Humanity utilizing
these things to do things for us how
from your perspective can you see us as
people actually utilizing this to our
advantage and not having droves of
surplus population we have to figure out
what to deal with ya really important
issues William and I I have to tell you
I don't have a great solution for you
but yeah you're right I think you know
we as a society do need to engage with
this and in some ways we're already
behind on engaging with previous
technological shifts in how the economy
works I think some people will probably
tell you that this shift with software
becoming smarter and much more flexible
is happening faster and so you know
maybe that raises the stakes even more
but I think you do see in countries
around the world that governments and
policy makers are engaging more in this
topic towards the end of the Obama
administration the White House organized
a series of big workshops around the
country where policymakers and experts
and IO technology came together and
discussed all kinds of things you know
the effect unemployment was definitely
one of them you know please saying all
these other things and so yeah I think
we need to engage this as much as
possible and and you know think about it
at every level well go to Jack next
who's in Fort Worth Texas and Democrat
by hey I would compliment you on the
article that y'all had last week on
DARPA that wants to build a BS detector
for science I thought that was a very
necessary step and what I see is a is a
way to kind of clear out this fake news
and and kind of clean up the sources of
information and I'd like to tie that to
another project that I hope is under
planned enough to use AI system to
validate our climate science there is so
much debate in rancor over consensus and
what is the effect of humans on the
planet biosphere I think AI would play a
crucial role in helping us
clear out all the skeptical fake
arguments that I feed twittering on the
whip
okay tonight yeah Jack thanks very much
yes that article written by my colleague
Adam Rogers about a project of DARPA
DARPA is the advanced research group of
the Pentagon they're looking into this
idea of having AI systems that can kind
of detect anomalies in science
scientific data you know arguments that
are incorrect and they were particularly
interested in using that on scientific
information about kind of social trends
and that kind of thing I don't think
there's probably the kind of good news
of better and bad news on this on this
point you raise so the good news is it's
becoming very clear that AI is going to
be a great help to scientist and we're
already seeing that you know systems
that can kind of learn about the
structure of molecules and even generate
new ones I wrote about some research
last year where you know a scientist
could go to a program and say okay well
I want something that's kind of halfway
between I don't know aspirin and
paracetamol and it would use its
understand you have chemistry to say
well we could try this I mean I think
that's going to accelerate the
development of new medicines the bad
news is that I well it's not really bad
news I mean it's just the reality that I
don't think we can assume that everyone
is going to agree with what these
systems come up with and so you know
just because I create a piece of
software that analyzes a bunch of
information and says look this is the
way we should interpret it all right you
know human nature being what it is I'm
sure there will still be plenty of
people that disagree and so you know
ending the debate about climate science
I think that's on ours not on the
computers if you see what I mean
Ringwood new jersey steve is watching
there on our line for republicans you're
on the air yes thank you for receiving
my call I'm an accounting instructor I'm
also a CPA I've been an accounting
instructor for about 20 years at a State
University and I've found in the
educational form that
there is definitely an over-dependence
on artificial intelligence
especially the computer the cell phone I
think it creates more of a
one-dimensional lifestyle and also I
think that from a student standpoint it
has it creates a tendency for students
not to utilize their long term permanent
memory let me give you an example I'm
just thinking of one class that I
thought I teach normally every semester
in the class I teach annuity formulas in
in let's say an intermediate accounting
class and I find the tendency is for
students to immediately go to their cell
phone to put the annuity formula into
the cell phone instead of into their
long-term permanent memory and since
that time I've really disallowed cell
phones and computers into the classroom
because I feel like the students aren't
utilizing their their brains basically
they're they're overly dependent upon
some one-dimensional screen to store
everything for them and I think that
that's a dangerous way for society to
become okay Tom so I'm going to give any
thoughts on that yeah a really
interesting issue I mean I think by now
we have a lot of evidence that you know
well humans are easily distracted and
smartphones and things like that you
know do distractors distractors easily
and I believe there's also research out
there that you know shows people have to
rely less on memorizing facts now they
know they can turn to Google I guess the
question is you know are there
situations in which that's harmful it
certainly sounds like the classroom
might be one of them but also know maybe
maybe if your brain isn't devoting
energy to storing facts hopefully we
could use it for something else that
maybe you develop your abstract
reasoning powers more or that kind of
thing I mean it's certainly something to
think about and this question of how
humans and machines work together is a
very important one and it's one that's
being investigated more and more by
academic researchers and in industry as
well so just last month in fact Google
spun up a new research initiative around
trying to understand how humans and AI
systems can work together so
yeah it's a big question I think it's
great that more companies and
researchers are now working on it and
hopefully we can figure out some answers
that allow us to continue to you know
develop our full potential but also get
the benefits of this technology will go
to lead in arab alabama independence yes
i had the software the software
configuration management organization in
red at Redstone Arsenal with a software
engineering Directorate and dr. Minsky
of MIT had taken leave and was teaching
an artificial intelligence course at the
University of Alabama in Huntsville and
I took that course and he talked about a
program that he had designed that was
called Pogo and he this would answer any
kind of a mathematical problem and and
he had taken kids in Boston that were
considered literate in math and they
took his artificial intelligence Pogo
and they were able to advance in math
way ahead of any average student in the
Boston school area and I just wonder
what happened to dr. Minsky and his
studies in artificial intelligence maybe
you know yeah so Marvin Minsky a an
incredible scientist both the MIT for
most of his life and really a pioneer in
the field he died I believe into 2015
maybe last year anyway he I mean he but
he continues to exert a huge influence
on the field today I mean he laid the
groundwork for a lot of the work that
goes on today and you know frequently
referenced a new work and that work on
education is very interesting and and
certainly know that's kind of a torch
being carried forward by people
the AI community today you know I think
most of us can understand how having a
personalized kind of educational program
developed for you by a one-on-one tutor
would would be ideal
you know the nature of the world is that
not everyone can have that but if
software is involved in in assessing
your work or monitoring your work you
can you can generate that kind of
personalised material for every student
and there are certainly companies
looking at that and I think some
promising results we have a couple
minutes left here Susan in Richardson
Texas Republican thank you I've been
reading a lot lately about quantum
computing which is of course
revolutionizing how we think about
reality and I'm a non-technical person
but it's really a very simple concept
apparently IBM and other businesses have
been working on this for years and what
I'm wondering is why aren't more people
delving into this everywhere for example
when I put the word Elon Musk and and
paired it with the word quantum
computing on Google nothing came up Tom
tryman right yeah quantum computing is
something I write about very frequently
and so very briefly there very small
scales you know smaller than an atom you
quantum physics becomes very important
in understanding how physical matter
operates and weird stuff can happen and
if you you can exploit that to to create
a new kind of computer which the theory
says would be incredibly powerful many
many more ties powerful than that super
computers we have today and there is
indeed as Susan says a lot of activity
and interest credibly powerful many many
more times powerful than that super
computers we have today and there is
indeed as Susan says a lot of activity
and interest in this and so the US
government in both civilian and military
ways has been investigating this for a
long time IBM is is one of the pioneers
Google has built out a lab in Santa
Barbara in California to work on this as
well and there are startups too in the
Bay Area
the the quantum computers that have been
built so far are pretty simple they're
not really very useful right now but the
basic principles are being proved out
the theory is holding up and so over the
next five to ten years I think you know
we could see these things start to be
very useful when and artificial
intelligence is one of the uses we will
see them put - which will be very
interesting that has the potential to
maybe allow some kind of big jumps
forward in what machines can do let's
get in one last call Mary in California
Democrat Mary you're on there okay thank
you very much
Thank You Greta and thank you dear Lord
for c-span Washington journal it's kind
of been a rough morning I was just going
to ask Tom if if a I can help in some
future time people with Alzheimer's if
we don't find a cure for it I mean if
there can be a download of our of our
brain and and our thoughts and memories
or that we want to keep that that could
chip could help us I'm 68 and I'm
thinking about things and what's going
Campbell just passing away with
Alzheimer's it's a shame it's I mean
it's I hate the disease more than cancer
it's just yeah they'll give you a chance
Mary we'll take that question Tom Simon
ight yeah thanks Mary and that's a it's
a very good question and you kind of led
us into an interesting area so there is
growing interest in in directly
connecting computers with the brain and
work that's been done on that so far has
shown that you know you can do it there
are people who have become paralyzed to
regain control or they can control a
robotic arm using this thing that plugs
into their brain and things like that
and there is interest you know in the
long term it's it's very unclear how we
would do it but building chips that
would can
with your brain and enhanced perhaps
your memory or other faculties so you
know it's not pure fantasy people are
thinking about it people are working on
it that name Elon Musk comes up again
and again he has a company called neural
link which is is working on some mondays
and this technology and the Pentagon is
also funding a lot of research one of
their motivations is injured soldiers
you know wanting them to regain control
of limbs they've lost perhaps or giving
them control of robotic assistance
devices that kind of think so
I think progress on that is going to be
really quite slow it's very hard to
connect computer to the brain you know
you have to cut through the skull and
all these kind of things there are
issues of making things compatible with
the human body that need to be figured
out but in the long term I think you
know there's a feeling that yeah it
could be possible if you want to follow

artificial intelligence you can go to
