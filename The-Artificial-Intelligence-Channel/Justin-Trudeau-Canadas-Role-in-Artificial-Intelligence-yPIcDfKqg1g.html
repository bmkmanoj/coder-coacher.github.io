and for supporting Canadian AI as you
can see you are not the only one
very exciting great to see everyone here
it's a great opportunity to talk about
everything we've been doing but mostly
all the exciting things to come and I
know everyone here is a big big part of
that so it's great to be here awesome so
a bit of context to start this is the
third year we've done this conference a
Jay and I had felt very lonely thinking
about AI in our little corner for a
while and in 2015 we decided to give it
a shot see if we could get a room
together and I gotta say it was pretty
lonely we had to pull teeth to get
people here the first time speakers it
was December actually right after you
got elected and we offered people like
aw it's Canada it's cold why do we have
to do this ái thing why do we have to
do it in Toronto and you know I offered
out bottles of brown liquor to keep
people warm and offered to name my
firstborn child after speakers to come
in keynote so you have to make good on
that one one day but you know Jay and I
were marking on the fact that we had to
convince people to think about this and
now you know especially since you got
elected you can't help but be bombarded
by a I left right and center so I wanted
to start by going back a little bit
though Jay and I were talking about you
know when was the first time that we
really started thinking about artificial
intelligence and so I wanted to ask you
the same question when was that and what
were you thinking about oh I think I got
into it through through sci-fi like most
of us did whether it was Asimov's three
rules of robotics or looking at watching
wargames and thinking about global
thermonuclear war versus a nice game of
chess it was just getting a sense of
computers that would be smart I mean
that was the big thing about wargames
right we're where we taught the computer
to learn and I thought oh well that's
really really interesting and I remember
as a kid playing chess on my Mac in the
in the 80s and there was a degree of
difficulty setting that you'd actually
set based on how
much time you let the computer compute
and it it was my vision of it anyway it
was allowing the cubic computer to go
deeper and deeper into all the different
possible you know decision trees all the
different that moves that it could make
and to figure out the very best one if
you give it just one second or five
seconds or ten seconds it would go a lot
deeper and get a much more difficult or
advanced moves and that was sort of me
thinking about where as I was never a
very good chess player but I you know my
my moves were two steps one looked if
I'm in immediate or an imminent danger
anywhere on the board and then go with
my gut and like I said never a very good
chess player but now to see how things
have evolved into computers because of
the work of geoff hinton and others on
deep learning doing that gut step a
little more tangibly than just what is
the perfect logical logical step is
amazingly excited but also challenging
for us to think about in an ethical and
moral frame but also as a legislator and
as someone who's trying to build a frame
for us to succeed in a safe and fair
world there's a little too much black
box thinking in there for us to be
totally comfortable with it so I hear
you're an expert in quantum computing
given that you know these neural
networks deep learning was kind of
pioneered very close to here Canadians
are being forced to figure out what
artificial intelligence is what neural
networks are I was hoping you'd give us
a little bit of a primer like anyone in
this room knows more about AI than I do
it's just it for me it's understanding
that a computer can make in a video game
or in a simulation massive numbers of
experiments to try if I do this what
results is it okay if I do that what
result do we get whether it's solving a
problem or you know following a car down
a road or whatever it is computers are
allowed to experiment basically so much
faster than anyone can I mean a doctor
will see you know many thousands of
patients in over the course of their
career and develop an extraordinary
level to analyze and understand what's
wrong with someone but a computer can do
that many tests and simulations in a few
minutes or in seconds and you know
there's there's a capacity to accumulate
data an experimental paths and that's
sort of that the machine learning
element of AI where you try all sorts of
different things and figure out what
works and what doesn't and for simple
things that's reasonably effective but
we're just feel like I'm getting a test
here but what's really exciting is
taking that step that simulates a little
more the way the brain works where we
don't work in perfectly linear
algorithms in our head logical steps we
make leaps of intuition leaps of love of
analysis based on experiences based on
AI I think about it in terms of you know
what I studied in university which was
poetry and trying to explain why a poet
wrote a particular line and you get
really into analyzing oh did he mean
death was he's talking about his mother
and there
you could go back and take an interview
with with the poet who'd say no no I
didn't mean any of those things you're
completely wrong but the poet could be
wrong because maybe they didn't know
what they were packaging into that line
they just knew that that line felt right
it was the right message for them on an
intuitive on an artistic level and
therefore there's always more to be
hidden in there so mimicking that leap
of intuition of patterns with
forward loops and then recursive loops
says we're starting to develop within
those hidden layers is really really
exciting but also as I mentioned lends
us to a place where maybe the computer
can't justify the decision it's taking
or we can't explain why a particular
decision was taking take it take the
example of self-driving cars that
everyone's thinking about now if you're
stuck in a in an emergency situation and
you have to choose between veering into
oncoming traffic or risking a hit the
little girl that ran out into the street
after her at the ball you're gonna you
know struggling you're gonna make one
decision and then if ten minutes later
the police officer is grilling you on
why you made that decision you won't
maybe know it was instinct will you be
held accountable for it probably not if
it was a reasonable decision that anyone
in a high-stress situation make well
self-driving cars might have to make the
same will have to make the same kinds of
decisions
Goudas aren't going to be our
expectations of what is the right
decision and how accountable are they
for the right decision and how did they
come to that right decision can we check
every step of the program to see that
they came to the right decision that we
charge the programmer or can we charge
the the coder that missed have a line of
code or do we say no the computer made a
leap of judgment well that's something
that's challenging for us to try and
figure out how to think around in a
legal moral ethical framework and all I
can say is I'm glad we're having the
reflections around a
here in a country where we have a
charter of rates of freedoms where we
have a decent ethical and moral frame to
think about these consequences in these
contexts and the benefits of diversity
and all the things that we do well in
Canada because there's some parts of the
world where those decisions wouldn't be
as top of mind and I'm glad we're having
this conference here today so do you
think AI will ever be a poet well one
may be totally consumed by other ai's
you just got was it due to n for his
dream with sheep what is it the right
elector chief I've got the Blade Runner
a reboot on my mind right now amazing
electric sheep let's uh you know we were
chatting a little bit earlier one of the
reasons I'm so passionate about AI in
Canada in particular as as you know as
everyone in this room knows I'm a very
biased super Canadian and so one of the
things you know especially being in
Silicon Valley if I talk to my friends a
lot of our brains are there because it's
really exciting but our our hearts are
in Canada right and part of the reason
for that is we just there's this
beautiful moral compass that exists here
and you know as a eyes become more human
as they touch society more I really hope
a lot of that happens here so let's
delve into a little bit of what does the
future of AI look like in Canada let's
start a little bit with research and so
Canada started that with this great
advantage of CFR during the AI winter
putting in a lot of research funding a
lot of the pioneering work you know
geoff hinton we've got rich sutton in
the room today has been done in canada
as of about two years ago there were
some criticisms that hey Canada Dan
didn't wake up to this the u.s. woke up
to it first
a lot of that talents leaving you know a
J and I had a conversation a year and a
half ago we're like is it too late and
to Canada's credit we've fought back
really really hard and so what do you
think the state of AI research is in
Canada and where do you think we need to
take it well I think first of all the I
mean I'm glad it's not being asked here
but there is a question out there is
automation good is AI good is it
I think we need to move forward with or
is it something we need to try and
resist because it's going to be
tremendously disruptive to our world our
economy our jobs as it stands I think we
all understand certainly in this room
that this is the way the world is going
so let's be part of it and let's help
shape it and let's make sure that we're
benefiting from from the innovations
both the designing of them and the
applications and the jobs that are going
to come through it so that is there's no
question for me that Canada if all our
natural resources our greatest resources
always been the human resources that
figured out how to get those natural
resources to markets and success but now
more and more are creating solutions for
our everyday lives
investing in people investing research
investing in the quality of life that
people get in high gear Silicon Valley's
getting very expensive and crowded and a
lot of people I mean the number of
stories of people who are coming back to
Canada is talking with Mark from vidyard
a few months ago saying you know what
that it used to be that it was very much
you know heading down there now a lot
more people are coming back a lot of
capital from there is coming here
because they're realizing that you know
the the clusters we have are really
exciting and yes we have big companies
you know the big giants still buying you
know Canadian startups but instead of
you know sucking them down to their
center of gravity south more and more
they're leaving them here and allowing
them to flourish in what is a great
ecosystem here so our focus is on making
sure yes we're investing in the science
whether it's superclusters whether it's
the AI initiative that we've invested a
hundred and twenty-five million in you
know making sure we're successfully
drawing in investors who want to set up
shop whether it's Microsoft looking at
the Cascadia corridor Vancouver whether
it's the big announcement we may wish or
what if you know in in Facebook in
Montreal whether it's the alphabet
waterfront project we just did here in
Toronto
examples of all of those companies are
Amazon maybe coming to Canada as well
well on top of the billion or $2 they
already have in Canada you know there's
a lot of big interests there but we also
know they're coming up here not just
because rent is cheaper than then then
in Silicon Valley they're coming up here
because we have an extraordinary
pipeline of stem graduates that we do
need to do better on we have a diversity
that makes it easier to go global at a
time where some countries although I
can't think of any examples right now
seem to be closing in and and pushing
away immigrants we recognize that it's
extraordinarily valuable to to you know
to welcome in people and give them the
tools to work actually when I was down
at a conference in the US year and a
half ago I was talking to a number of
people including Reed Hastings from
LinkedIn and he basically said look if
you could make it easier for us to bring
in top talent from around the world to
help run our offices we'll hire as many
Canadian young engineers and graduates
as we can possibly find because we want
to you know do more and more and more
and that's true across the tech tech
sector so yes there's a certain amount
of bringing in you know big American
companies but there's also creating
those successes here and allowing those
successes of those young people in those
startups to develop the next platform
the next Nortel or blackberry hopefully
with a happier ending on on those but
you we know we're capable of building
those frames how do we create the
ecosystem and quite frankly the quality
of life around it yes we'll always have
winter but that means you know you learn
how to hug and the quality of life is is
is what a lot of young people looking to
succeed in the world and you eventually
start a family and build a good life
it's not just about the the rat-race
anymore
and it's it's about living in a great
place that reflects your values and that
you want to eventually build a family in
and you build a better success for your
neighborhood and that's that's a place
that Canada has a lot to offer I didn't
want to ask you a little bit about the
point you're just talking about which is
the tech giant's really taking notice of
Canada you know obviously we saw a deep
mind come in Edmonton and Montreal in
our place I think labs Facebook you
mentioned someone made an off-color joke
to me in Silicon Valley being like Oh
Google just bought your country and I
was like no no I didn't happen and
nothing else go go but like nobody buy
my country place this how do you think
about that balance between again these
tech giants coming in but then also
nurturing local innovation not that
there's like a one to one trade-off
between those two things but you do have
to be thoughtful about it right Howard
how are you thinking through that
challenge well you got to think about it
in a couple different levels one is sort
of that the clusters are always being uh
you know some what works for Google for
a few years then gets a great idea and
decides I don't want Google to own it
I'm gonna develop it on my own and so to
sneak out the back door and start up a
little a little company that that then
hires others and I mean we saw this a
lot it when I was living in Vancouver in
the late 90s in the video game industry
around EA weather lots of little
exciting startups that got really
innovative and you can create a cluster
of ecosystems that really end up you
know spreading and and supporting an
awful lot of very exciting innovation
and advances at the same time in the
number of top folks for multinationals
whether it's in the tech world or
elsewhere who I've met who of like ya
know I came up you know - from sent up
from the head office here to Montreal
and I'm I'm staying I you know I started
my family here and we're now Canadian
and we're gonna stay here for the rest
of our lives it's this idea that if
people have a choice they'd rather live
in a place that is nice and accepting
and where diversity is celebrated where
they reflect their values in a way that
that works and it's not always
how do we you know absolutely maximize
the economic benefits because what we're
seeing now is the quality of life
benefits combined with very very strong
economic outcomes is something that that
people are totally looking at so I'm
very aware that we don't
well one of the challenges of Canada's
always had was for many many years
through the 20th century and the big
American companies with whom we were so
closely integrated in so many ways would
see Canada as a bit of a branch economy
so they'd have you know offices and
things there but they wouldn't do as
much R&amp;amp;D they wouldn't really create the
high value propositions it was just sort
of a an extension or a satellite and
what we need to get away from is the
idea that oh it's just another market
the size of California instead we need
to say okay this is a place where
exciting things happen that if our
country wants to if our company wants to
be successful in the global stage we
want to be part of we need to be part of
because that's where really exciting
innovation is happening that's where
people are really thinking about how the
world should work what society could
look like 50 years from now a couple
hundred years from now when we no longer
you know fear differences and and we
understand that working together is a
much better way of solving our
challenges rather than pointing and
blame and and being scared of each other
I mean that's where the world's going to
eventually have to go and I think Canada
has a very important story and a very
important role to play in shaping that
future I think a lot of people get that
so I'm welcoming people to come here
because they're gonna find that you know
hiring Canadians and creating success
here is a great way to benefit both
their country and the companies and the
world awesome so speaking about Canadian
successes this is something like came up
briefly look the last time we tried it
you mentioned called poppy syndrome
which is an interesting term because of
existing Canada and I looked it up
basically across the Commonwealth but no
one knows what it means the United
States
it's kind of in tentacle 2 for example
the Silicon Valley ideal which is like
go forth be superior
go do your thing to be the best when we
think about AI there's actually a new
market dynamic that comes up which is
we're seeing winner-take-all type
environments right and it's because once
you have the data you create the product
you deliver that product to the
customers those customers deliver
valuable data back your algorithms get
better it's this vicious or virtuous
cycle depending on you know how you want
to categorize it then a busy reading
Scott Galloway is the for right now
which is if anyone's read it's the story
of how Amazon Apple Facebook and Google
have become the extraordinary dominant
countries the companies they are and you
think countries it's a little bit
frightened yeah exactly yeah everyone
knows what a 40 in slip is it's when you
say one thing but you mean your mother
[Laughter]
it's better than my usual dad yes
wonderful in a minute after that that's
great and so you know one of the things
that we're gonna have to do is figure
out how to double down on the things
that even show just a spark of again
potentially being one of those next big
four and we're gonna have to do it
quickly
and that's gonna be an interesting
challenge for government because
government historically has been very
evenly distributed to all the people and
we're entering an era where there will
be massive economic prosperity by the
winners in AI but energy into them is
very asymmetric so well that's that's
why we've put such an emphasis in our
government on growth for the middle
class and trying to figure out how to
make sure that the rising tide lifts all
boats and that's the real challenge we
we have a an economy now that you know
rewards superstars with
outsized payouts and everyone else sort
of is is is left out of the benefits of
the extraordinary innovations that that
happen and the fact is that's simply not
sustainable
that's going to lead to
angst anxiety jealousy anger class
divisions the pitchforks are coming all
those kinds of things that we know is
simply not good for us as communities of
society as as a world so what we're
focused on in Canada is saying okay the
deal was we create growth and growth
would be good for everyone but there's a
whole bunch of people who said wow
growth offshoring automation robots
imperfect productivity gains
efficiencies hasn't been good for me
hasn't been good for my family is not
gonna create jobs for my kids and their
future and they're starting to want to
pull their support away from a growth
agenda so we've been trying really hard
over the past two years to try and reset
that event despite what a lot of classic
economists we're telling us we said no
if we start putting more money directly
over the pockets of the middle-class if
we raise taxes on the wealthiest 1%
lower the moment middle class if we
support small businesses by lowering
lowering small business taxes but we
made sure that it's not a way for the
wealthiest to pay less taxes we do all
these sorts of things that a lot of
people are disagreeing with we're going
to create economic growth and confidence
in society that will itself reassure
people about the direction we're on
because that's that element of
confidence in the future is one of the
best predictors of whether a society is
going to make drastic decisions in the
wrong direction um that that are not
maybe as productive as they'd like it to
be being thoughtful about how i phrase
this but yeah we need to have people
realize that yes we're facing challenges
but if we work together we can solve
them in a way that everyone will benefit
from and that it is while less
attractive perhaps then the you know a
competitive survival of the fittest or
lynnie an environment that
that you know the pressure cooker of
Silicon Valley sometimes creates I truly
believe and I think Canadians believe
that it would not be sustainable to be
exacerbating that inequity and
exacerbating the haves the have-nots to
have yachts and instead make sure that
there is a path towards success for
everyone and that means investing in
better education more coding for for
elementary school students that are stem
programs for high school and university
students more skills and training
opportunities for someone who's
mid-career in their in their mid 40s and
looking at the fact that perhaps they're
going to be replaced by automation in
the next ten years and they won't be
able to to have a good job to bring them
towards retirement unless they do go
back to school and get a little more
training and become more powerful users
of the technology that arounds us that
surrounds us those kinds of things I
think are going to determine how and
quite frankly whether we are successful
as as a civilization in the coming
coming decades we're going to live up to
that one right we're doing it together
well I wanted to thank you so much all
of Canadian AI thank you for being here
today it's clearly going to be the most
important technology that humanity has
ever created we need to make a fire was
pretty good but okay
that is the best one until the next one
the line I think about all the time is
the pace of change has never been this
fast but it'll never be this slow again
we're accelerated so we're gonna end on
a light note which is we're doing a
lightning round on AGI later and one of
the questions we have so preview for all
of you guys in that panel is in what
year well a human first marry a robot
you know what I have a suspicion it
happened somewhere in Asia already thank
you everyone
you might say
can you hear me now perfect okay we
wanted to take that on behalf of the
conference thank you so much for being
here we wanted to give you a true tech
startup style thank you by giving you a
hoodie exploit your nerd passport if you
will and also a pair of creative
destruction lab socks add to your
collection thank you so much thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
