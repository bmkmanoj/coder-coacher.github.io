some of the top AI companies in the
world are in China what is your sense of
how the United States is relative to
China in terms of the talent and
innovation or Force intelligence so I
don't know if you all saw but a month
ago China actually announced its AI
strategy and I actually read it and it's
pretty simple by 2020 they will have
caught up by 2025 they will be better
than us and by 2030 they will dominate
the industries of AI just just to stop
for a sec that's the government said
that weren't we the ones in charge of AI
dominance here in our country weren't we
the ones that invented this stuff
weren't we the ones that we're going to
go exploit the benefits of all this
technology for betterment and American
exceptionalism in our own arrogant view
trust me these Chinese people are good
right we were in in April we brought our
alphago game which is a remarkable
refuge reinforcement learning activity
and brought it to Shanghai Liu Shen
technically and I had a series of
demonstration games against the very top
go player in the world and we won we won
every game and he was a road player and
he invented new moves we invented news
of a historic Oracle player and then we
retired the game the game that was
played learned how to play go in seven
days from zero right that's how smart
these systems have become and beat the
top human in a game that's 2,500 years
old old but to me the more interesting
thing about going there was to see that
all of the top computer science people
from China had shown up and my
conclusion was they are using going to
use this technology they're going to use
it for both commercial as well as
military objectives with all sorts of
implications over that period but we
know what they're doing they have
announced their strategy okay so you're
crazy to treat them as somehow
second-class citizens they have another
example we do tests globally there are
these things called TopCoder contests
where you have a
coding program clearly for programmers
and Asians in as a general statement and
Chinese in particular tend to win many
of the top spots right so if you have
any kind of prejudice or concern that
somehow their system and their
educational system is not going to
produce the kind of you what I'm talking
about
you're all right so what steps should
you be taking it to remain competitive
right presumably that's not where we
would like to be in 2030 well for one
thing we don't have a national strategy
that just said that right so if you
believe that this is important as as I
suspect all of us do but certainly I
believe then we need to get our act
together as a country all right so give
you another example look at the history
of Sputnik and the highway system right
so Sputnik what happened was the
Russians everybody knew the Russians
were going to do this and then the split
wasn't moment happen and then NASA
happens right Eisenhower and the
interstate highway system in the 50s
right this is that moment this is the
moment where the government collectively
with private industry needs to say these
technologies are important and by the
way whether they really needed the
interstate highway system to move all
the missiles around the country
benefited by the interstate highway
system enormous Lee right just think
about it right so whether it's it's it
from a position of fear right that
people are afraid of something or
whether it's a position of leadership I
don't really care how we get there but I
do think a national focus on investing
starting with and so the specifics are
pretty straightforward investing in
research America is the country that
leads in these areas there's every
reason to think that we can continue
that leadership it's also how we will
differentiate our businesses globally my
software is the leading Softee the
leading place their software zone in the
world is done in America for many
reasons including cultural and so forth
there's all sorts of reasons to do that
I'll give you another one let's talk
about immigration shockingly some of the
very best people are in countries that
we won't let in
to America would you rather have them
building AI somewhere else you would
rather have them building here I'll give
you a specific example Iran produces
some of the smartest and top computer
scientists in the world I want them here
right and I want to be clear I want them
working for alphabet and Google I'm very
very clear on this it's crazy not to let
these people in right so I can go on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
