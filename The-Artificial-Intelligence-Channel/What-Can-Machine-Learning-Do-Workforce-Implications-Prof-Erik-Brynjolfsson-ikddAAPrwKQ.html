Vincent and I'll be chairing the first
session it's a great pleasure for me to
welcome as our invited speaker opening
the iclear 2018 conference Eric Brian
Johnson who is a professor at the MIT
Sloan School of Management directs
director of the MIT initiative and
digital economy and a research associate
at the National Bureau of Economic
Research Eric has been passionate for
many years on researching the effect of
information technology on our economic
life and in addition to too many
scientific publication he's also the
author of New York Times bestseller the
second Machine Age and 2017 book which
platform crown'd harnessing our digital
future he's certainly a person to turn
to to if we want to get answers to the
all-important and very delicate question
that you may be asked by friends or
strangers alike is AI going to take away
our jobs
so please welcome Erik Brynjolfsson
all right thank you very much Pascal and
thank you to Yahshua and Yann for
inviting me here it's a it's a real
honor and a privilege to to be at this
conference I'm very impressed by the
exponential growth and I hope this is
part of a continuing long-term trend I
actually the first AI conference I went
to was back over 30 years ago
triple AI in 1986 and I've continued to
be very involved and I'm very impressed
with progress that has really
accelerated recently I think we may be
on the verge of an era where you can
take an ordinary laptop like this and
plug it in and just instantly have a
display on the big screen without any
dongles and so I think we call that the
singularity and I hope you guys that
soon but but seriously I do think it's
it's quite remarkable what's been
happening in in the field and economists
like me have been taking note and paying
more and more attention and I used to be
a bit of a lonely voice looking at this
question but now there are half a dozen
Nobel Prize winners that are doing
projects on it there are economic
conferences are our main economic
conference the annual economic
Association had about a dozen sessions
devoted to some aspect of artificial
intelligence and machine learning and
the effects on the workforce so you guys
are having a really big impact on the
rest of the world the rest of society
and it's something we're taking note and
Pascal was mentioning I'm sure you're
getting some questions now about what
you're doing and maybe even a bit of a
backlash so I want to talk a little bit
about some of the economics behind that
some research we've been doing to
understand better what the effects have
been of some earlier and related
technologies and then what is likely to
happen going forward what potentially
could happen port going forward
depending on what we all do so let me
start by giving you sort of a a really
big picture perspective and take a look
back a couple hundred years two hundred
fifty years ago or so because this is
not the first time we've had these big
momentous
technological changes and although
history doesn't repeat itself I think
sometimes we can learn a bit from what's
happened in the past and if you look at
the economic history of humanity what
you find is that most of it was
extremely boring for centuries actually
millennia the living standards didn't
change there were kings and queens and
empires and philosophers and religions
and natural catastrophes and diseases
but the average person's life really was
pretty much the same day in and day out
but then something changed if you look
at the late 1700s things really started
to change for the average person and you
can measure this by GDP per person or
population or Social Development Index
they all are very correlated and things
took off and I think and I think a lot
of my colleagues think that this was
because of technology invention of some
amazing new technologies most notably
James watches watts is massively
improved steam engine which as you know
ignited the Industrial Revolution and
set off much much steeper economic
growth a couple of percent per year
compounded annually and it starts adding
up very quickly over time doubling and
growing exponentially not quite as fast
as the exponents on the conference here
but still some pretty good exponents and
and the real driver of that is that was
the steam engine which economists now
recognize as one of the first really
powerful general-purpose technologies
general-purpose technologies are special
because they not only help a particular
application but they had these three
characteristics they're pervasive
they're able to be improved over time
and most importantly they spawn
complementary innovations so the steam
engine originally was used to pump water
out of coal mines but as you know it
could be used for many other things
locomotives and many kinds of
transportation steam ships powering
factories and as people figured out how
to harness this muscle power this
substitute for muscle power they were
able to add tremendously to
our living standards now there are other
general-purpose technologies that have a
big patent impact the internal
combustion engine electricity that is
powering our lights and our computers
and continues to spawn new innovations
and I think you can probably guess where
I'm going with this ai is a GPT it's
pervasive the applications can be done
in so many different areas we're only
scratching the surface but these core
breakthroughs that you all are
developing in classification labeling
perception etc have applications in just
about every part of the economy
certainly the essence of it is that
improves out over time Tom Mitchell and
I wrote an article in science last
December where we discussed this a
little bit more and I'll dive into that
a little bit later in my talk but the
essence of it really is improving over
time and the fact that it can spawn
these complementary innovations that
these core capabilities like like vision
give rise to all sorts of other
capabilities in medical imaging and in
driving cars and you could go on with
the other things that the other
innovations that build on machine
learning and artificial intelligence in
fact although there's been a lot of hype
and exaggeration and I don't want to go
too far out as you know we're very very
far from anything like artificial
general intelligence or the stuff you
see in Hollywood it's also true that
this is a I think at least on the scale
and scope of those other GP T's like the
steam engine electricity in fact I think
you could make a case that AI is the
most G the most general of all GP T's I
mean intelligence is a really
fundamental capability a Dennis casabas
puts it in their in their mission
statement at a deep my our goal is to
solve intelligence and then use that to
solve all the other problems in the
world so that's a very general type of
technology if that's achieved or even if
some piece of it it gets achieved so you
know that's there's some good news and I
could talk about the remarkable things
that are happening but I also want to
remind everybody as you know from from
watching spider-man that with great
power comes great responsibility
and I'm not with those technologists
some of whom I've baited recently who
say hey our job is just to make the
technology and not think or worry about
what happens you know that's for
somebody else to think about and there
is a school of thought that says you
know science should be pure and
unfettered and and not consider the
consequences I strongly disagree with
that and one of the reasons I'm giving
this talk to you all today is to get you
to think a little bit about some of the
consequences because I do think that you
can steer the direction of technology
and technology is not neutral technology
is not completely unbiased that
depending on the innovations you could
make a smallpox vaccine or you could
make a killer virus that could be
weaponized and you could make nuclear
power for weapons or you could make it
for peaceful purposes and so it is with
just about every technology and as you
develop them I think as it becomes more
and more powerful you need to be more
and more thoughtful about what those
applications are and don't just do it
you know for your own sake all I think
that would be a good reason and for
society's sake but also you have to
realize that if you don't other people
are going to step in and if you you know
pay attention to the news or talk to
your colleagues outside of machine
learning you probably noticed that
there's a brewing backlash against
technology that you're hearing more and
more people worried about it this
happened back with the steam engine and
these are the Luddites Ned Ludd almost
exactly two hundred years ago a
fictional character helped inspire a
revolution where people literally smash
the machines the spinning machines that
were automating the work of Weaver's and
they saw that as a threat to their
livelihoods and actually you know to
some extent they were right a lot of
them did lose their jobs their wages did
go down other people benefited even more
than than they were hurt but from their
narrow selfish perspective this was not
a good good technology for them and
today you know you see Mark Zuckerberg
being hauled in front of Congress and
and their articles I guess the cute word
that call it is a tech lash against many
of the
companies and literally just yesterday
sergey brin was writing about the the
threat that AI poses as well as the
benefits in particular he said that
their company is giving serious thought
to problems like job destruction from
artificial intelligence and in other
work i've described six specific
challenges for technology the first one
is this economic one about automation
inequality will willow robot eat
people's jobs but there are others and
I'm sure if you you know you think about
you've heard discussion of these there's
the whole issue of false news and cyber
of organizations and algorithms affect
you know maybe amplifying and spreading
sensational news which increase this
engagement but also sensational news you
can think about it's not surprising
tends to disproportionately be false so
if you if your algorithm is tuned to
maximize engagement you may
inadvertently also be maximizing lies
and that's something you need to think
about there's issues around algorithmic
bias when we use these machines to hire
people to decide who gets parole who
gets credit and who doesn't get
financial credit if those are trained on
biased datasets if the people who made
the hiring decisions before had some
kind of explicit or perhaps more
invidiously subtle biases those could be
perpetuated in the algorithms and
amplified and extended and so that's
something you need to be paying
attention to their issues around the end
of privacy winner-take-all markets is a
bigger and bigger issue whether or not
our capitalist free-market system that
depends on lots of competition is robust
to technology production functions that
tend to have a winner-take-all
characteristic where someone gets a lead
they get put forward further and further
ahead
that's an unstable equilibrium that that
isn't conducive to competition and then
there are a whole set of cyber risks and
you know one that I'm very worried about
is versus our voting systems but our
anytime you hear about the millions of
bots that are fighting each other right
now on the Internet
attacking and defending our key systems
and other people's key systems you can't
help but be worried about it I'm not
going to talk about all of those in any
detail just for the given the time
available I'm going to zoom in on the
first one which I actually think is
perhaps the the greatest challenge of
our era the greatest thing that we need
to be concerned about and people have
put it different ways I mean one way of
framing it is will humans go the way of
horses you know horses were once very
productive important parts of our
economy they all had jobs and there were
millions of them doing all sorts of work
in the economy when the steam engine
came along actually it didn't do much of
a dent in horses at all they were the
number of horses employed increased but
then later technologies particularly
internal combustion engine kicked in and
then you started seeing that there was a
lot less demand for horses so peak horse
was right around 1922 after that it was
all kind of downhill actually I did some
further research and lately there's been
a little resurgence horses you know not
used for so much for transportation but
for recreation and it's probably more
fun for them to the extent that they
have those jobs but but this is
something that number of people have
asked is you know is there something
similar to what could happen to human
labor that happened to horse labor and
as you can see we wrote a whole article
describing that in some detail and I
won't go through all of the parts of it
but the the short answer is no it's it's
too soon to worry about the end of work
or the end of labor i what i know about
artificial intelligence and what i know
about human capabilities i come to the
very strong conclusion that there's no
shortage of work that only humans can do
at least right now and probably for
several decades it may be and i think is
even likely that someday some decades in
the future we will be able to make
machines that do the full spectrum
what humans do but that's not the
challenge we face today in fact there's
so much work that needs to be done in
areas like health care the arts cleaning
up the environment science and medicine
and just anything that involves sort of
a human touch that I feel it's very
premature to be planning an economy for
a world with the end of work and you
know but people are just all on say
universal basic income and machines do
everything again maybe someday but the
challenge we face right now is a little
different and that is a challenge of
income distribution because while
there's a lot of work that needs to be
done that only humans can do machines
cannot do them currently the way that
the income is distributed is becoming
increasingly uneven and a lot of that
has to do with technology the
first-order effect of the technology is
that it's making the economic pie bigger
it's creating a huge amount of wealth
but if you read the economics textbooks
carefully you also should be aware that
there's no economic law that says that
everyone or even that most people are
going to benefit proportionately it's
possible for some people to get nothing
it's possible for some people actually
to be made worse off
like those Weaver's who are affected by
the Luddites and if you look at the
equations carefully it's possible for
majority of people to be made worse off
even as the pie is getting bigger now
how can that happen obviously it can
happen if that group that's getting more
is getting so much more that there ends
up being less in the remaining 50 60 70
percent of the population now that is
absolutely not what's happened for most
of the past couple of hundred years it's
been mostly a rising tide that you know
with certain exceptions here and there
if you happen to be making you know
horse buggies or something you had to
retrain but by and large it's been
benefiting broad sections of the economy
until about the past 20 years and
something very disturbing has happened
that's one of ice tarted writing my book
about on this topic Andrew McAfee and I
call it the great decoupling
productivity or output per hour has
continued to grow in the United States
and that's the blue line there so that's
good news the pie is getting bigger each
one of us on average is able to produce
more output more wealth that we did
before and historically the red line
kind of tracked it pretty close that was
the income of not the average but the
median and you guys all know that the
medians at the 50th percentile so it's
nothing there's no law that says that
has to track the average and in fact
it's become more uneven and if you look
at the 50th percentile and you adjust it
for inflation so we make it real income
it's been kind of flat since about the
year the late 1990s the year 2000 or so
and that's kind of disturbing again how
can that happen it can happen if the
growing pie is disproportionately going
to one group and I'm gonna show you some
of the economics but just to motivate
this I want to remind you that this is
not just an economic problem the effects
go well beyond economics so for instance
here's something that in case the great
economist and her husband Angus Deaton a
Nobel prize-winning economists have
described they call it deaths from
despair and they got a lot of attention
for pointing out or recognizing that
these deaths from despair have really
gone up quite traumatic the United
States this is something that didn't
happen before death rates used to be
going down in America and all the world
and now there are certain groups
particularly white Americans males with
less than high school education who are
dying at a much higher rate and you can
see that the darker areas of the other
in the United States here are the areas
with more deaths from despair they're in
in Appalachia big parts of the south and
southwest very disturbing trend gotten a
lot worse and as I mentioned it's the
less educated workers that are
particularly
affected there you go back to the year
2000 and the rates were much lower and
the bottom sort of lighter gray lines is
people with college degrees but the
rapidly rising lines are people with
high school degrees or less are dying
from drugs alcohol and suicide and
that's how case and didn't define deaths
from despair and so you can look more
specifically at things like poisoning
chronic liver disease diabetes these are
are going up at frightening lis scary
rates you heard about the opioid
epidemic they actually wrote their paper
even before that became widely
recognized but it just amplifies the
point they're making and other measures
of social decay for instance children
living with their biological parents is
really diverged depending on whether
you're in the top or bottom income
quartile this is not just case indeed
miss moon is by by charles murray the
people who are imprisoned in jails had
skyrocketed so there are lots of drivers
of these trends and they're obviously
things that we should all be concerned
about and there are books and essays
written about it but for this audience I
think we're especially interested in
what is the role if any of technology
does it play a role in in these effects
and how could it play such a role why
would it even affect things like that
well some of my colleagues and I and
others have been doing research on this
for some time and I think this quote
from David Otter and David Doran
summarizes it pretty nicely they did a
terrific paper David's one of my
colleague David Otter is one of my
colleagues that at MIT and David Dorn's
over at it was over at Harvard when you
did this and I just read it the adoption
of computers substitutes for workers
performing routine tasks such as
bookkeeping clerical work and repetitive
production and monitoring activities
which are readily computerized because
they follow precise well-defined
procedures and so they showed this
empirically and if you look at the data
it's it's very striking you can see that
there's been a great deal of falling
demand for these categories of routine
work so the the dark line that's steeply
falling there are these clerical types
of jobs sales jobs the roots
Kien work and as you can see they grew a
bit in the 80s and flat through the 90s
and then they started really falling
quite a bit in the 2000s I mean while
professional work service work has
continued to grow but it's not the same
people in those different categories so
you have more demand for one kind of
Labor and less demand for other kinds of
labor and that shows up not only
unemployment but in wages and ultimately
in in the labor market participation and
apparently in things like the social
indicators that I showed you earlier my
first book that really looked at this
with Andrew McAfee tried to understand
it much more carefully and we really
identified three trends which I'm going
to dive into a little bit more closely
the first was this idea that some skill
groups people would say college
education versus high school education
were disproportionately favored a second
related trend is but distinct is that
superstars people who are at the very
top the top one percent the top 0.01%
the point zero zero one percent in
different professions we're pulling away
and the returns at the very top of the
income distribution we're increasingly
shaped like a Pareto or power-law
distribution as opposed to a log normal
distribution and as you may know those
kinds of distributions can have very fat
tails and the payoff if you're in that
end of the distribution has been getting
much much higher than it used to be you
can now if you have a good idea you can
reach you know a million or even a
billion people in a way that you
couldn't have twenty or thirty years ago
and then last but not least there's also
seems to be a shift in the share of GDP
going to owners of capital as opposed to
providers of labour so if you own a
factory if you're an investor the stock
market or directly in businesses our own
equipment even if you own land you've
done very well whereas if you mainly
sell your labor your time those wage
have been relatively flat and that's
been a shift I'll show you more data on
all of this so we wrote about this and
as I said this has really become much
more of a consensus among economists Tom
Mitchell and I chaired a commission for
the National Academy of Sciences
engineering and medicine that we
published about a year ago now and one
of our key conclusions was that the case
the technological advances we're
contributing wage inequality was quite
strong and the report goes into much
more detail about that but this was a a
very diverse multidisciplinary group
that had economists computer scientists
sociologists a lot of other people
looking at at a broad set of data and
and frankly if we spent a lot of time
you know debating and coming to some
common understanding because we came
from a lot of different disciplinary
backgrounds Larry Summers who used to be
president of Harvard he was the
Secretary of Treasury National Economic
Council council under Obama and also
under Clinton you know he puts it I
think very nicely every almost every
economist who studied this question
believes that technology is a greater
impact in a way structure than
international trade so certainly
globalization has been part of the issue
but it's that the role of Technology has
been more important my colleagues their
own Acemoglu and Pascal Restrepo Pascal
is now at BU
went more specific into some empirical
work looking at where robots were
purchased and set up throughout the
United States they had a way of seeing
when it was exogenous and their estimate
was that you could see a reduction in
the wages of the human workers there of
just under 1% so that was quite
significant Angus Deaton the Nobel Prize
winner I mention a little bit earlier
come weighs in similarly so does Larry
Katz Larry Katz is maybe the you know
best labor economist of our generation
editor of the one of the main journals
in the field he's a professor at Harvard
and you know he puts it very clearly to
that that long automation is what's
driving all these trends it's not even
close so let me explain a little bit
about how that happens and why that is
happy
and the key concept is something called
biased technical change I don't mean
biased like it's unfair or anything I
just mean that biased in the sense that
it doesn't affect the whole economy
exactly evenly the simplest models of
economic growth by people like Bob Solow
who also got a Nobel Prize basically
took the production function of the
economy and put a multiplier in front of
it and said technology just makes
everything grow faster and he got you
know he did a lot of work on that and
that's a good starting point but it's
not entirely realistic I actually just
say it was not a bad model of the
economy for much of the past couple of
hundred years but it's not as good a
model for the past 20 or 30 years
because now that technology multiplier
doesn't effect all the different inputs
evenly instead it effects some more than
others and that that's the sense that
it's biased so let me give you three
particular biases that have been
apparent empirically in recent
technology the first one is this
difference between the effect on high
skilled workers versus low and mid
skilled workers you know so if you go
into I don't know a fast food place or
lots of other places you'll see
technologies being implemented but every
worker in that shop is not evenly
affected the manager is being affected
differently than the clerical workers or
the the counter helped here's one
example of a technology but there's many
others for whatever reason recent
technologies have disproportionately
automated people with high school
education Zoar middle school clarity of
clerical work and you know I can show
you a picture but let me show you the
data
here's worked by Douro NASA mogul who I
mentioned earlier and David autor who I
actually also mentioned earlier and I
think this is quite striking if any of
you guys have kids or cousins who are
thinking about going to college or
graduate school you could show them this
chart so if you look at the early part
of the period there in the 60s it was a
bit of a rising tide that lifts all
boats if you you know had lots of
education you your income grew rapidly
but even if you were a high school
dropout your wages were going up they're
all normalized to start at the same
point in 1963 so those are the good
times then the oil shock hit there a
bunch of you know
setbacks in the 70s and everybody kind
of took a bit of a hit but since then
you've seen this fanning out the people
at the top of the educational
distribution have resumed income growth
and so I'm sure the people in this room
are almost all are probably all on that
blue line at the top so good for you I'm
good for me and good for us I guess
college graduates you know okay but not
so great especially the past decades
been kind of flat but then you look at
the bottom three lines and they're
pretty pretty discouraging and this is
all demographically adjusted so this is
not a shift you know from men to women
or races or whatever this is this is
demographically adjusted and they have
similar charts for other demographic
groups that this one particular one
looks at at male workers but look at the
paper for all the other groups they look
kind of similar just so you can
calibrate this you know the average
person the economy is not like the
average person in this room the average
person in the US economy and for that
matter Canada or Europe is around where
that green line is some college most
Americans have not graduated from
college more than half of them have less
education than that so that's the kind
of effect they're looking at those
bottom three lines and you can imagine
that's not such good news for them
compared to what happened in the early
part of the 20th century well that's the
first kind of bicycle' change economists
call that skill-biased technical change
and there's a big literature on it the
second one is this shift that I alluded
to before between capital and labor so
you know our friend Travis has put that
nicely when there's no other dude in the
car the cost of taking uber anywhere
becomes cheaper than owning a vehicle
that's great news for the customer
that's great news for shareholders and
capital owners it's not such great news
for people who used to make a living
doing that particular kind of labor they
need to find something new to do to
maintain their income or maybe hopefully
increase it by doing something else we
don't see a lot of self-driving cars out
there there's been huge investment and
as far as I know no driver has been
replaced by a self-driving car yet but
we are seeing it
in what and I suspect we will see it you
guys know better than I but but we have
already started seeing this capital
substitution kicking in to a big extent
in other areas one of the then you can
see this in this chart here if you look
at the blue line that is the share of
GDP the share of all of America's income
that goes to laborers and the light
green line is the share of corporate
profits and one of the actually
surprising things you learn in
introductory economics this something is
called a kaldorf Act which is for most
of the past 200 years those lines kind
of bounced around but they didn't really
move that much the share of GDP that
went to labour was pretty stable for
most of the past couple hundred years
but now they have to revise those
textbooks because it's not true anymore
starting again about I don't know 20
years ago the late 90s the share going
to labor has started to really plummet
and the share going to capital has
started going up so the Kaldor fact is
it was called is no longer true about
stable shares of Labor so if you are
someone who primarily makes your income
by selling your labor you're getting a
smaller share of the pie compared to
previously now you may wonder is this is
this us only up many of my stats are
from the united states but in the book
and the articles we go in more detail
just to quickly show you it's actually a
worldwide phenomenon you're seeing
similar things both on the skill-biased
technical change also on the capital
bias technical change in the US Japan
China Germany in fact of the big oacd
countries of that I think it's 23 of
them 22 of the tall but one of them have
had a decline in the capital share I
started its client in the labor share
and a growth in a capital share and then
the last kind of buys technical change
is this shift towards superstars if you
happen to be at the very pinnacle of
your profession if you are a superstar
machine learning expert or if you're a
superstar singer if you're a superstar
this is Scott cook he's a billionaire
who invented TurboTax and developed it
that there are opportunities to make way
more money than you ever could have
before so there are more millionaires
more billionaires than ever in history
and again there are a number of reasons
for this but one of the big reasons is
technology lets you scale if you can
codify your ideas into a digital form
you can reach a lot more people and even
if you only make a few dollars off of
each one of them that can be a lot of
money and here's the data on that you
all heard about the 1% you know the 1%
have their own 1% and that is the point
o 1% and if you look at that you can see
that the share of income going to the
point o 1% is at a record high the only
time it was even close was right before
the Great Depression if that's any
consolation
so but and by the way it's very fractal
we have a paper where we look at all the
different percentiles and each subgroup
above the others has gotten a bigger
share so it's sort of a parade 'el or
fractal thing the 0.01% is getting more
of the 1% the 0.001 percent is getting a
bigger share of the point oh one percent
and so on so that's the power law I was
describing to you before now this is all
from really what I would call the first
wave of the computer revolution which
kind of backwards looking this is what
the data say and as things turn out we
only have data from the past we don't
allow about data from the future so but
this you may wonder is this what's what
what's going to be the future as well
because this was really based on
codifying knowledge I mean coding has
historically meant taking something you
know and putting it into a codified form
and once you codify it you can digitize
it and once you digitize it you can
replicate it and that's been the engine
of a lot of what we've been seeing so
far it's created trillions of dollars
worth of value and trillions of dollars
worth of redistribution of value from
some people to other people it's because
of these economics of high fixed costs
and low marginal cost you a lot of work
to make that first copy of TurboTax or
that first record album song and then
you can replicate it very very cheaply
but there are limits to that and one of
the limits is what we call polanyi's
paradox he was a philosopher
who presciently said we know more than
we can tell so I know how to recognize
my mother's face this is my mother and I
can recognize it very easily I would
have a hard time writing some some C
code about how far apart her eyes are or
you know where her ears are or whatever
and historically this was an example of
something that machines that humans
couldn't express in words I couldn't
describe very well how to recognize my
mother out of a thousand people and
therefore you couldn't codify it but of
course you know that that's no longer
true because we no longer write code the
old way we now have machines that learn
and we've made huge progress in things
like computer vision here's some data
from the AI index a group that I work
with on the image net challenge and you
can see the blue line there of the
tremendous progress will you guys know
this and in speech recognition and in
robots and in games and reasoning I have
zero doubt that there's going to be some
announcements of more breakthroughs you
know over the next couple of days and
what's key to all of these is machine
learning and this is a different
paradigm this is a paradigm where
instead of us coding and telling step by
step what the Machine does we give it
examples in the machine learns on its
own and this has overcome polanyi's
paradox we now can recognize faces we
now can learn how to ride a bike or do
many other things that we can't express
in words but as long as we can provide a
training set the machine can figure it
out on their own so what's gonna be the
effect of that going forward is it the
same as what we saw before
well one report I worked on that you
know which I'm now I'm not sure I agree
with anymore is that the economic
effects of AI and cardema groups may be
analogous or will be analogous it says
to the effects of automation on
manufacturing jobs so maybe we just
extend what I just all those charts I
just showed you but that's a guess
that's not for sure to really know we
need to think about what kinds of jobs
will be affected by these new
technologies versus the old ones and to
do that we need to assess the
suitability for machine learning of
different kinds of tasks and as I said
we're very far from artificial general
intelligence but there
are certain tasks where machine learning
is human or superhuman I just showed you
some charts of that so what Tom Mitchell
and I said about doing was figuring out
what are those tasks and where are they
the economy so we made a questionnaire a
rubric with 23 questions to tell you
whether a particular task was likely to
be a good fit for machine learning or
not and I don't think we did a perfect
job but I think anyone in this room
could probably have a somewhat of a
guess as to whether a task is likely to
be suitable for machine learning or not
we went and vetted this with many of our
many experts in the field and we came up
with a questionnaire that we thought was
pretty confident of and then we took
that questionnaire and we applied it to
a big data set called Annette the US
government conveniently has divided the
entire economy into nine hundred and
sixty four occupations like bus driver
professor radiologist I sadly there's
not one called machine learning
researcher not yet but maybe there will
be in a future version and for each of
those 964 occupations they describe a
set of tasks that you must do most
occupations have about 20 to 30 tasks
this is what a bus driver does this is
what a radiologist does and so we
combined our rubric with those tasks we
basically applied each of our 23
questions to each of the tasks and got a
assessment of how many of those tasks in
the economy might be suitable for
machine learning and we wrote this up in
this article in this journal in science
and you can get a pre copy on my website
if you don't go through the paywall and
you know they're a bunch of questions I
won't go through all 23 questions here's
one of them you know you guys could
guess that if you have data then it
makes a lot easier than if you don't
have data and then we applied it to jobs
so this is radiologists many people
think of radiologists is something that
might be affected
according to Oh net there are 27
distinct things that our radiologists
much do and they kind of conflate
radiologists with radiation medicine
here number four is interpret images
using computer aided detection of
diagnosis ISM thats what we kind of
think of as something that vision
systems will be able to do a lot for but
look at these other ones develop
treatment plans
and interact with your your colleagues
and talk to the patient those are not
things that machine learning is very
good at and this was actually quite
common we found that when you look at
all the tasks of a particular equation
some of them were suitable for machine
learning but many others were not so
there was no case where machine learning
just ran the table and was able to do
the whole set and for that matter there
was virtually no occupation where
machine learning didn't make at least
some dent in it that's radiologists
here's truck drivers similarly you may
get self-driving trucks but what about
wrapping up and securing the goods with
pads packing paper etc not something
robots can do as far as I know right now
now you can model this and I'm looking
I'm seeing them a little bit out of time
and with a little bit of work you can
come up with how different occupations
are affected so are there any massage
therapists in the room nope okay well
you guys would have been in a very good
shape they're the least likely to be
automated in our our analysis and you
can get the whole list in that in that
article I'll show you a scatter plot so
you get a little bit of a feel for the
data the striking thing about that this
scatter plot actually I think this house
even it is the x-axis is wages and what
you see if you rank every occupation the
US economy from the one that has the
lowest wages to the highest wages and
then the vertical axis is how suitable
it is for machine learning it's pretty
flat the ones that are suitable for
machine learning some of them are very
low paid like concierge is and some of
them are higher paid like parts of
radiology and many of them are in the
middle so unlike earlier waves it
doesn't seem to be just affecting the
low end it's affecting a whole spectrum
so my quick takeaway from that is we
should not blindly extrapolate from the
past this is a different technology
that's going to affect different groups
of people some fun things you can do
with it you can look at which parts of
the USA geography are most affected you
can do it by subgroups we asked about
image data we asked about text data we
asked about speech data and they have
different effects and so now we're
beginning to get a map of where when you
guys make a breakthrough in voice
recognition systems
types of jobs which parts the country
will be most affected let me skip
through this a little bit well I just
very quickly show you you can more
interesting than geography is actually
grouping them in a in a space of tasks
that there are some types of jobs that
just cluster together you know for
instance clerical workers in whatever
industry whatever geography are very
similar to each other they have a lot of
common tasks so are medical
professionals and as it turns out that
the clerical workers wherever they are
whatever industry tend to have high
suitability for machine learning and the
medical professionals not so much so let
me wrap up before I go to questions I
had want to save a few minutes for Q&amp;amp;A
from the audience with some comments
about what we should do so one thing we
can do is change our policies and policy
makers have a whole bunch of policies
one of my favorite is something called
the Earned Income Tax Credit in the
interest of time I won't describe it in
detail but it's in my my books and
articles but there are lots of others
universal basic income minimum wages
cetera
and we need to think about these all
these parameters we have it is
absolutely not true that the effects of
Technology are externally driven it
really depends on how they interact with
the policies and we happen to have a
particular economic set of policies that
gives two one rise one equal nur but
that's ultimately a choice but it's not
just policy makers it's also the private
sector that can do a lot of things
depending on what kinds of business
models you implement you can have more
widely shared prosperity of you can have
more concentrated wealth and inspired by
the DARPA Grand Challenge that inspired
some new technologies at MIT we've
launched something called the inclusive
Innovation Challenge where we are
encouraging entrepreneurs to come up
with ways of using these technologies
that create more broadly shared
prosperity we're giving out a million
dollars to the winners of that and we
now have contests running in Detroit in
Latin America in Europe in Asia and
Africa and they're all going to the
winners in each of those sub those
competitions will then come to Cambridge
Massachusetts
for the grand finale so we've inspired
hundreds of entrepreneurs to be working
on using technology regardless of what
the policy makers do
to direct change towards more shared
prosperity and let me just wrap up
before we go to questions with some
ideas about what you can do in this room
because I don't think you should just
sit back and leave it to the
entrepreneurs and the policy makers I
think technologists can play a big role
one thing you can do is think about how
your technologies are being used either
to replace humans or to augment humans
those are not the same thing you can
enhance human capabilities and make them
more valuable as workers and many
technologies do that or you can replace
humans and make them less valuable it's
very tempting I think to think of a
human job as the benchmark and think how
can I automate that I think that's much
too narrower perspective hey I don't
think you're being creative enough about
because machines have so many
capabilities they can do things in the
electromagnetic spectrum things that
humans can't even look at that you can
take advantage of there's many other
things machines can do the humans can't
do but be the second reason is that if
you only focus on replacing and doing
what a human can do today you're going
to inevitably devalue human wages and
labor whereas if you create some new
capabilities there's a good chance
you'll make human labor more valuable
either one of them either approach can
create wealth but that's the way when
you compliment humans instead of
substituting your wealth is more likely
to be widely shared so if that's one of
your values you should think about that
so why don't you go sometime at lunch or
dinner the next couple of days meet a
colleague and brainstorm three things
that your AI systems could potentially
do that no human could do not to replace
a human not to achieve human-level AI
but to do something entirely different
and then circle the best of those ideas
and work on that with your team or your
lab and by the way don't throw away the
other two third ideas go ahead and give
them to somebody else to work on those
so let me take your your questions and
comments now I want to wrap up on that
point that that we have a lot of ability
steer technical change that the future
is not predetermined and that if
policymakers if entrepreneurs if
technologies make a conscious effort to
create more shared prosperity I believe
it is entirely possible over the next
ten years we are going to have more
powerful technologies and we've ever
seen on the planet before we're going to
have more wealth than we've ever had
before but we're also going to have
tremendous disruption and as a result
depending on our choices
the next ten years could be the best ten
years we've ever seen on this planet or
they could be some of the worst ten
years and that is not something that
technology will decide for us that is
something that we will decide thank you
very much
so I believe there are some microphones
oh here we are there so if you want to
raise your hand I'd be happy to take a
couple of questions so there's one over
there
one over here so that case this one's
closest so let's go that one first how
about over in this side go ahead yeah
you got a mic go ahead okay hi thanks
for a very interesting perspective
I was wondering there was it was quite
us-centric for most of the metric yep
and us is not to say the best example of
like social net and everything so how
does these plots look like in say Sweden
Finland or odd right trees and what can
we learn from that to do better things
here that's a great question and so
there isn't as much widespread data from
every country but there is data you know
from many of them and if you look at
Sweden Canada Germany Japan China in
every one of those countries you have
seen growing inequality growing wage
disparities growing shift from labor to
capital all the trends that I showed you
however they start at different bases
Sweden started off much more equal and
even though it's become more unequal
it's still more equal than the United
States is so they've both they started
in different starting points but the
trends are similar but some of them have
been steeper than others and sweetened
it has not actually known Sweden let me
get that right up some of them is
steeper than others I don't want to say
off the top which ones were steeper but
they're obviously different slopes and
we can learn from that which ones maybe
have policies that have different
effects and they have different starting
points as well that also suggests that
social decisions have a big part of the
impact but so the two takeaways I have
from that is that there's some kind of
widespread trend over the past couple of
decades that's affecting most advanced
countries but they're having different
implementations a great goal from for
economists right now is to study which
of those policies have a better effect
and I went very quickly through the
policy menu but education is when I put
near the top earned income tax
a flexible safety net forces Denmark has
something they called flex security
where they have a quite generous safety
net but they also make it very easy for
entrepreneurs to hire and fire people
and have a dynamic economy that tries
new ideas if somebody gets laid off they
still get their health insurance and
their income support and so forth
so there in a way they get the best of
both worlds the dynamism you need to
embrace new technologies and to update
your economy but also though cushions
that also I think most of us care about
that's a value decision so other side
over here as we take another question I
ask me the next speaker to come up front
and study setup hi thanks for a great
talk I was curious about the second
point you made about the shift from
capital to labor like people or the
labor labor capital you know the capital
people's labor not being valuable and on
none of those graphs I think did it ever
go like in the other direction do you
have any thoughts about what concrete
things could be done to reverse the
shift yes boys labor yeah so labor is a
very big category and if you subdivide
it there are certain types of labor a
machine learning experts for instance
that have had you know done quite well
CEOs have done well lots of kinds of
rockstars
you know in the both figurative and
literal sense have done well if you call
those labourers but the general group of
them have done worse the the one of the
things that that most economists would
still support although it's not
Universal is is reinventing education
and that means less education that's
focused on rote repetitive learning and
more on how we can be creative the good
news is as machines automate more of the
repetitive tasks honestly I think most
of us find those kind of boring there's
an increasing need for creative work
there's also increasing need for
interpersonal skills you know the the
hands that I had holding each other I
think a lot of people wouldn't get the
same comfort from a robot hand as from a
human hand
and so there's we're wired to care about
other people to be persuaded
by them to listen to them and so those
kinds of professions are things that we
can do more and to encourage education
to boost interpersonal skills and
creative skills and those are areas
where education we're sorry we're late
come has been going up relative to the
repetitive clerical tasks I think that
as I said early on in my talk the big
challenge is not that work is
disappearing but that there's a whole
bunch of tasks that only humans can do
and we need to shift our skillset into
those and then labor income is likely to
go up for those categories but but it
may also need things like the Earned
Income Tax Credit and other ways with
reporting one last point on that is our
our whole tax system right now is
actually very skewed it heavily puts its
thumb on the scale against labor and for
capital if you're an entrepreneur who is
a million dollar or billion dollar idea
or two ideas one of which uses a lot of
labor and one of which uses no labor
your enterprise will pay a lot more
taxes if you use a lot of labor
so essence we're penalizing the
entrepreneur who uses a lot of labor and
giving them more of a free ride if they
don't use labor is that a smart policy I
don't think so I think arguably we
should be doing the opposite and
encouraging people who find ways of
getting other lots of other humans
involved in the game so there's a set of
policies and I just want to say I don't
we don't have all the answers but you're
asking the right question and I think we
have at least some some ideas that we
could explore them do we have time for
one more quick question oh great we'll
take the time all right right up here
okay higher thank you for a very
interesting talk
you didn't mention interest rates during
a presentation how would you go about
disambiguating the impact of improved
technology and the structural decrease
in interest rates we've seen since the
early 1980s this is one of the biggest
mysteries that economists are honestly
extremely puzzled about and when a group
of us get together we all starts talking
to each other what do you think is going
on interest rates because it's been this
long secular trend I have a paper coming
out that ties it to AI because for me I
think of everything is how it could be
relate to AI
and it has to do with the way that
technology can substitute can can not
only you know substitute for labour and
create more labor but also capital if
you think about its software odd you
know is is is a kind of capital and you
can replicate so in a way many of our
investments are now much much cheaper
than it used to be software you can
scale very rapidly and if you can
through software create new goods that
used to require physical capital this in
essence is adding to our capital stock
at a very low way and one of the effects
in our model is that this leads to
falling interest rates and a Moore's I
showed you this division between capital
and labor that's the way almost all
comments have been thinking about it we
in our model now think of three groups
capital labor and this third factor
intangible something and in our model
vanilla capital and vanilla labor both
lose at the expense of this third factor
the fact that it can create amazing
software and amazing creativity so if
all you have to offer the economy is you
know ordinary labor skills you're not in
good shape if all you have is just
ordinary capital and say hey I want to
invest in your startup you don't get
extraordinary returns but if you have
that special sauce that is creating the
new value then you do very very well and
in our model both interest rates and
wages go down and the returns go way up
to this third factor so it's a it's a
more complicated model but it's
something to be frank I don't think
there's a consensus around the stuff I
showed you is something that I think
there's a pretty broad consensus around
in terms of what's happened so far and
the new work on what's happening with
machine learning but let me just I know
right I'm here so let me just leave you
with with a really important closing
point which is that technology does not
decide what happens to the income
distribution we decide we technologists
we policymakers we entrepreneurs we're
the ones who decide how these things
work out it's very much something that
is a choice now and I want you to be
more conscious of the role you play in
those choices both
your work and as citizens of your
countries and of the world thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
