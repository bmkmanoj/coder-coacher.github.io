forgave talking about which is if we had
a quantum computer what would we do with
it and I started this I started a
theorist a while ago and when I did
working on theory with a with a fun
topic that was very far away from what
experimentalist were doing and we're
entering an exciting time when theory
and experiments are getting a lot closer
and so before we used to focus on what
could we do with an asymptotically large
quantum computer now we're starting to
think about what can we do with the
quantum computers we will have in the
next in the next few years
see before you go on I want to thank
Emanuel and Daniela for organizing this
and and for inviting me and also also
Christa so that's been a great pleasure
to be here and I've enjoyed it a lot and
I am going to tell you about about this
this area of why we're studying you know
what we're looking for in in quantum
algorithms and I want to point out a few
things about the motivation I think
maybe are a little bit obvious that
computers have great economic and social
value we get a lot out of them and we've
sort of taken for granted this Moore's
law for a long time and we know it has
to pretty soon end the exact details of
the end are a little bit fuzzy but we
know that they at some point before your
transistor is smaller than a hydrogen
atom it's going to end and and that
point is coming pretty soon so on a
practical level we'd like to know what
we can get out of these devices in the
long run we want to know how valuable
they'll be and in the near term we want
to motivate a building large quantum
computers so we want to be able to do
something useful or at least a
demonstration of something interesting
with a 50 to 100 qubit quantum computer
but there's a more basic reason at least
that got me into the field which is
quantum computing tells us a little bit
about the nature of information and
computing these are our topics that seem
like they're maybe the domain of logic
or philosophy you know information you
don't doesn't seem like she needs you
should need to know physics to know what
information is or computing means you're
manipulating symbols you're manipulating
ideas mathematical propositions again
that seems like a purely abstract idea
you don't need contact with experimental
physics - it's actually inform what that
is and so when quantum mechanics tells
us things like the uncertainty principle
that you cannot know the more you know
about this thing the less you can know
about this other thing or entanglement
that the hole is is more than just the
sum of its parts
that's a real radical in my view
departure from our common sense notion
of information and people have discussed
it philosophically for a long time what
quantum computing tries to do is discuss
it operationally to say with this wacky
alternate form of information what can
we do with it and and I think what
studying the examples of what we can do
with it are one way of getting a handle
on what it is what it means to be to be
quantum information so in my talk I'm
going to focus on on what we can do in a
concrete way but in the process I hope
to chip away at this larger question of
what does it mean to be for information
to be quantum so I say quantum of course
by contrast with classical which which
Christi did a nice introduction of and
the idea of a classical bit is something
that can be to states and so when you
put together n of them
there can be two to the N states and the
crucial idea of computing is to abstract
away from the physical realization of
that bit could be Ram could be a hard
drive could be beat on an abacus we
heard yesterday that it could be DNA the
principles of computing are independent
of that and until quantum computing all
these different forms of computing were
in a sense equivalent to each other so
we heard that if you humans that know
different languages think about things
in different ways computers do not one
language can can simulate another
language until quantum computing all the
different forms of computing were
equivalent and quantum computers are a
form of computer that's different but
again we can abstract away from the
hardware fundamental so nuclear spin
photon polarization the sighted states
of an ion etc all of these are qubit can
be can be made into qubits and then once
you have once you've done that you can
just reason about the qubit without
needing to know a separate theory of
quantum computing for
photons and for topological excitations
so the same kind of idea helped us build
quantum computers and it's interesting
that this only really came about once
classical computers had had come into
society I mean there's no reason after
we learned the basics of quantum
mechanics in the 30s we couldn't have
come up with this but if somehow the
technology of computers that really
prompted it and the promise comes from
the fact that one qubit is two
dimensions and n qubits has to be
represented Meters represent by a two
dimensional vector and qubits are
represented by a two to the n
dimensional vector and so this is sort
of the fundamental exponential
difference between what a quantum state
can do and and what a classical computer
can do this is why vitamin observed that
if you want to simulate an odd a quantum
object with n parts it takes a classical
computer and effort exponential and that
number of parts but somehow a rock can
simulate itself and so you know what is
the rock doing that our super computers
can't
well it's evolving according to the laws
of quantum mechanics and so if we can
make a computer that did the same thing
then we can maybe capture that benefit
and what does it mean to evolve
according to laws of quantum mechanics
there's one key equation which is the
Schrodinger equation it's a differential
equation says the way that the state of
all is over time is according to this
equation which is the state gets
multiplied by a giant matrix which is
called a Hamiltonian and that is really
the one law that governs quantum
mechanics and this tells you how this
giant two to the N dimensional vector
evolved in time and it's not so hard to
go from this to developing quantum gates
like the ones that that Krista talked
about and before I go on I want to say
one thing about about this apparent
advantage of quantum computing it looks
like the exponential size of these
vectors is what gives it its power but I
want to argue today that things are a
little bit more subtle than that
because we've actually seen
exponentially large vectors in another
setting in computing so if you have a
normal computer that can flip random
coins say now I'm looking at what's on
the pennies but you can have computer
with random bits whatever they are can
the state of that computer if it's an N
bit
computer the state of it is a
probability distribution over all the
two to the N possible states of that
computer so that probability
distribution is a vector of length 2 to
the N and so again you can access
exponentially large vectors without
needing to you know figure out how a
nanowire works now this is not just a
theoretical idea this is widely used in
practice so if you want to estimate a
high dimensional integral if you naively
discretize your space the number of
points will be exponential and so the
way we estimate it is with sampling we
had this exponentially large space and
we sample points in it and so with
randomness we can speed up this
calculation a lot and crista mentioned
ENIAC there was a period when ENIAC was
shut down and moved to its final
location was offline for almost a year
and Fermi that's the physicist other
than Fineman got impatient and he wanted
to do a neutron scattering experiment I
think he was trying to build one of the
Horsemen of the Apocalypse
and so what he did built was something
called the Fermi AK which is a
mechanical trolley and the way you
simulate and it has you rolled dice to
see how far it goes you have a switch
that flips between fast and slow
neutrons then you rotate at random here
you plot its progress and this is a way
of simulating neutron scattering at
least in two dimensional bomb geometry
this only worked on paper and this was a
Monte Carlo landed by simulation he did
sum over all of the large possible waves
of neutron scattering he just sampled
from them them randomly and so this is
the principle behind a lot of successful
randomized computation so I will argue
that it's not just the exponential size
but there's something more that quantum
computers have beyond just the
exponentially large vectors that give
them their power
so I'll exhibit this with a few examples
so one example of what quantum computers
can do that to me is pretty striking
given how little information that seems
to have is unstructured search if you
have a function f and the output let's
just be simple the output of the
function that's always 0 or 1 you'd like
to find some input where the output is
equal to 1 so
what do you do you evaluate the function
on some input let's say zero you get the
output 0 you output on one you get
output 0 you output it on to output 0
you think well maybe I'll jump around
you output on 17 you get the answer 0
yup later on 132 the answer is 0 and you
you're getting no information as soon as
you get any information you've solved
the problem if you need to find a 1
you're already done until then you get
nothing and so you basically if you have
n inputs you're gonna need time that
scales with em and it seems like a
quantum computer has very little to sink
its hooks into here but in 96 love
Grover showed that you could do it in
time the scales with root n this is not
an exponential speed-up but I think it's
still remarkable given how little
information the quantum computer seems
to have to work with and try to give
some intuition for why this is true if
you want to go from quantum amplitudes
to classical probabilities though the
formula is that you take the absolute
value and square them so when so quantum
amplitude is still a classical
probability distribution that uniform
would be 1 over N and each entry a
quantum state that's a uniform
superposition would be 1 over square
root of N and so it's this gap between
amplitudes and probabilities that
accounts for this square root and we see
the same thing with light for example so
the amount of power in a beam of light
goes like the square of the amplitude or
if you have something that's oscillating
the amount of energy and that
oscillation is the square of how far the
pendulum swings so this is gives you
some idea of why quantum mechanics could
could lead to advantage and in fact this
similar idea applies to many
unstructured or semi-structured problems
if you want to maximize the function you
want to find a collision of two inputs
leads are the same thing if you want to
know who's going to win a game like
chess by searching a game tree all these
things quantum computers can get a
similar kind of polynomial advantage
Krista mentioned that there is an
exponential advantage for the problem of
factoring due to Shor's algorithm I'll
mention one further thing which is that
it breaks all of the other public key
cryptosystems currently in use and I
think this is a big motivation for
studying quantum computing obviously
this is going to be a big pain maybe not
a horseman of the Apocalypse but it's
gonna make your cell phone battery
bigger as we switch to two new crypto
systems
but these new crypto systems that are
hopefully quantum resistant the only
reason we think the quantum resistance
is that people haven't come up with
quantum algorithms yet but factoring is
something that we have studied since the
time of Euclid and quantum algorithms
for lattice cryptosystems a very very
small number of people and probably
we're not very intellectually diverse or
that bright have thought about and so to
gain more confidence in whether these
new crypto systems are going to be
secure I think it's pretty urgent that
we investigate quantum algorithms before
we start rolling out the next version of
credit card I mentioned one other
quantum algorithm which is to solve a
large linear system of equations so a
equals B a is a giant matrix B is a
giant vector and you want to find X how
long did it take so classically your
runtime for sure is going to scale with
n the dimension of the vector because
you just have to output at numbers
there's no way to get around that
quantum Li you can store and amplitudes
in a state of log n qubits so it's
possible you could do this much faster
and we can show that in some conditions
so for some well-behaved matrices you
can do this and in in some cases you can
get a exponential quantum advantage here
and this is city seen application since
then to solving differential equations
machine learning all the things that we
use linear systems of equations for and
as Christa said the applications here
are kind of in some ways still
speculative we have them in theory but
to actually apply them to a practical
problem it's something that people are
still working on so this is what we can
do in theory so what can we do in
practice and here we there are two main
approaches to quantum computing so you
heard about a very intriguing strategy
that Sara was talking about is using
topological degrees if we're gonna
protect the qubit and I would say this
belongs to the conventional approach to
quantum computing which is to build not
more qubits right away but to get one or
two clean qubit so if you've heard about
progress in quantum computing and you
heard we had five cubits a decade ago
you know why don't we have more today
it's because researchers are not trying
to build more qubits they're trying to
make our qubits more reliable and so
this plot is the ratio of the operations
per error so how many quantum gates can
you do per lifetime of a qubit and this
has been steadily increasing over the
year this is for superconductors but
similar plots apply to other
architectures and the reason why people
focus on this is if you can do ten
operation if this number is ten you can
do ten operations before your qubit
decohere and if the number is 100 you
can do 100 operations before your qubit
d coheres but at a certain threshold
depends on your architecture maybe a
thousand or 10,000 you can do an
unlimited number of operations and
that's because you can correct errors
faster than they accumulate this is
called the threshold for fault-tolerant
quantum computing and current
experiments have just started to reach
this threshold and so now the next step
will be to either get well above it and
or to scale these up and so there are
many groups at our conference they'll
have 50 qubit quantum computers in the
next in the last few years and I've
listened here only companies there are
many universities well but I think
what's encouraging that there are big
companies and startup companies is that
you know it's easy for me to predict
that we'll have quantum computers soon
but there are people who've actually bet
their own money on the fact that
there'll be a quantum computer yielding
a return for them in the next five to
ten years and so you should probably
trust that more than predictions of
academics like me so I find this pretty
encouraging there's another approach
which you may have heard of which is
from the company d-wave which says let's
not wait for things to be clean let's
just throw down a bunch of noisy qubits
and see what they do and well I'm
skeptical of this approach I have to
admit that it's it's bold and it's
generating surprises you know I don't
know what this is going to do a lot of
quantum computing experiments at the end
of the experiment all you know is that
the Schrodinger equation is true and
that the experimentalists are very
impressive at what they're doing but
with d-wave I really don't know what
these thousand noisy qubits are going to
do I don't think they're going to solve
hard problems but you know I can't prove
that and so part of what I'll tell you
about is is work where I've attempted to
put my money where my
this and I guess they're not only noisy
but they they run only one particular
algorithm so I'll tell you in a minute
up about about what that algorithm is
and what that algorithm is and also I
think what a lot of the ideas are for
what we'll do with near-term quantum
computers involve
commoner problems of combinatorial
optimization and combinatorial really
just means many variables so you want to
optimize some function of many variables
let's just say these are all bits but it
doesn't really matter and it's let's say
the function is the sum of terms each
involving a few variables so this is
super general encompasses almost
anything you can think of protein
folding finding the best model
explaining some observed data if you
want to have a math proof with the
fewest errors and actually you can see
from these applications that in some
cases an approximate answer is okay and
in some like the math group you really
it wouldn't be impressive if I gave you
a proof of the Riemann hypothesis with
only three errors you know you probably
you probably wouldn't find that
convincing but another is approximate
answers are just fine this is a very
general problem since it's very general
it's very hard in general there can be
exponentially many local minima and it's
np-complete which means that it's you
know even if you look at one particular
problem and you think this problem might
be easy
you can often show there's equivalent to
all the other hard problems that other
people have have been stumped by so
these problems in general can be quite
hard and what I'll talk about in the
rest of the talk are three different
approaches to solving them so one
classical or rather the classical
approaches and some of the new quantum
approaches to try to solve these these
hard Conor toriel optimization problems
okay so the classical approach is the
one of and and let me just say I have to
tell you about the classical approaches
because we already have classical
computers right so the value proposition
of quantum computers has to be that are
better than classical computers so
anytime you ever talk about a quantum
algorithm you have to say here's
something which classical computers get
stuck at and we have to and we can go
beyond that so we have to always first
talk about what classical computers do
one approach which is I think a very
nice and and general one is just local
search
you want to minimize some function you
just pick some point somehow X and then
you look at the neighbors of X you know
try to flip one bit or move a little bit
in your space and if it's better go with
the the neighbor if it's not better then
don't in try a different neighbor and
eventually you'll stop because you reach
a local minimum and no direction leads
to an improvement and the problem of
course some functions have a lot of
local minima and sometimes you just get
stuck very quickly and you're very far
from the global optimum so it's a good
first attempt but it's not great and to
get around the local minima I'll
describe two different methods so
there's one that's classical that's
based on adding entropy to say well
let's add some noise into this let's
bounce around randomly so let's use
randomness and then the quantum approach
is to use superposition so a quantum
state is this you know this giant vector
which you can think of as there's some
amplitude in all these different bit
strings and that's called a
superposition over these bit strings
maybe we can encourage the quantum state
to not concentrate on one bit string but
to spread out over many of them so
that's sort of a quantum approach it's
analogous to the classical randomized
one so what's the randomized one one of
the leading approaches if simulated
annealing and what the idea here is we
interpret this function which we want to
minimize as an energy and we add a
temperature parameter and the way that
energy and temperature interact is the
system would prefer to be in a lower
energy state and the temperature tells
us how much it prefers that if the
temperature is very low it strongly
prefers to be in a low energy state the
temperature is very high it doesn't
really care all the states can be
equally likely or almost equally likely
and it's easy to sample from a high
temperature state and so you can do that
and then you can design a process which
will eventually converge at each
temperature and you gradually in
annealing you gradually lower the
temperature and hope that you don't get
stuck and so this is rock candy which
you make by slowly lowering the
temperature of some sugar dissolved in
water and this will hopefully find its
lowest energy state which is the crystal
configuration and so we use this all the
time and practice to get systems to find
their their low energy states and then
computers it it often works pretty well
okay so that's what classical computers
do
compared what quantum computers do and I
have to apologize so yesterday we we saw
some grisly images and today I'm going
to show you some things you may not want
to see so if you're a if you're a
surgeon you should look down for the
next 45 seconds and so okay so I want to
I've been just talking about the
Hamiltonian in a as this giant matrix I
want to talk about how to translate that
into physics so it's a giant matrix it
has eigenvectors and these correspond to
quantum states these are vectors and so
quantum states are giant vectors has
eigenvalues these are real numbers they
correspond to energies of those states
which which Cera gate talked about we're
often interested in the lowest energy so
like for an atom at room temperature
it'll probably be in its lowest energy
state that's called the ground state and
now Schrodinger's equation you can
interpret you say oh the it oscillates
with a frequency corresponding to the
energy so this is why in quantum
mechanics who say energies are the same
as frequencies so every state every
eigenstate is picking up a phase at a
rate given by it its energy and so if
you have two states with different
energies then they pick up phases at
different rates and in some cases that
can suppress transitions between them
and so this is the idea of the adiabatic
algorithm so the adiabatic algorithm you
start with some initial Hamiltonian and
you slowly adapt it slowly modify it to
a final Hamiltonian and you start in the
ground state of the initial Hamiltonian
and the idea is this is something that's
easy to repair and simple and you hope
that and you set it up so that the
ground state of the final Hamiltonian
corresponds to the solution of your
problem so the minimum of your function
or whatever your desired output is and
the adiabatic theorem says that if you
change your Hamiltonian slowly enough
and you start in the ground state then
you will roughly stay in the ground
state of the final system classically
it's you know an example is if you're
swinging a pendulum and you move a quick
and you jerked it then it'll mess up the
pendulums oscillations but if you move
the if you carry the pendulum very
slowly then it will it will preserve it
its oscillations and the technical
condition for one this is possible
depends on the
the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonians
along the way but it's you know in many
cases it's possible so what does it have
to do with with combinatorial
optimization so what we'll do is we'll
start with the Hamiltonian which is like
a magnetic field pointing in the
horizontal direction and so if you have
little spins that are met little magnets
then they all want to the ground state
is they all align with that field and
you end with a complicated Hamiltonian
had some interactions that represent the
function that you want to minimize and
so the minimum energy configuration of
that so the ground state of the minimum
energy of that it's going to be some
pattern of ups and downs that correspond
to the minimum of your function okay so
if this is if this works if this
condition about the eigenvalue gap which
is just quite hard to check if that if
that is satisfied then you can evolve
from this initial state which is all
spins to the right to this final state
which encodes the solution to your
problem so this is a okay so this is the
idea of a be common soil observation by
adiabatic evolution and in some ways
it's like simulated annealing in that
you are trying at every point to find
the lowest energy state and this
represents some kind of compromise
between these two different terms the
final term wants you just to get the
lowest energy but this first term
doesn't want your spins to point up or
down it wants them to point to the right
which is like a superposition of up and
down and so compromising between these
two terms means your state is trying to
compromise between zeroing in on the
lowest energy and spreading its
amplitude out over many different
configurations just like similar to
kneeling you're trying to compromise
between lowering the energy and bouncing
around you know increasing your entropy
bouncing around between many different
configurations so they're similar but do
they perform the same way and there's
some evidence from physics that they
don't so in the Sun nuclear reactions
wouldn't happen if we just had classical
physics the reason why they happen is
because the wave functions of the of the
particles in the Sun are quantum
mechanically kind of smeared out and the
only way they can get close enough they
can overcome their repulsion and get
close enough perfusion is with quantum
tunneling which means that there's
wavefunctions can can penetrate through
this is a potential energy barrier so
they can get to this this lowest energy
configuration when they're when they're
right next to each other and this was
actually this settled a big scientific
debate people from evolution thought the
earth should be hundreds of millions of
years old or older but if you look at
the Sun and you didn't know about
tunneling there was no way it could be
older than tens of thousands of years so
it was a big big paradox which was which
was only resolved with with quantum
mechanical tunneling so if natural
systems can find their minimum width
with tunneling can we do this with the
adiabatic algorithm so you can show it
I'll show you a toy example of this this
works in in more realistic problems but
you can cook up a toy example where you
can see this so if your potential your
the function trying to minimize looks
like this and there's some giant local
minimum here
then under some circumstances the
adiabatic algorithm can tunnel through
this and in fact you can show so here's
another example of this potential for
some sizes of the potential the barrier
at the area under this this barrier is
not too large the adiabatic algorithm
and I've simulated this in the top part
here will tunnel through it whereas in
this middle part I've shown the
probability distributions persimmon
annealing and you see it gets stuck so
here's where the barrier is the
probability just piles up and it gets
more and more probability being right
next to the barrier but it refuses to
step onto the barrier so it's I'll take
an exponentially amount of time to go
through the barrier
whereas adiabatic can get through it
because of quantum mechanical tunneling
so this is is pretty exciting and d-wave
if use it as selling their quanta
computers based on this idea this is
from their marketing slide from their
website says classical algorithms can
only walk over the landscape Quan Peters
can tunnel to find the lowest point and
d-wave gets this to work and so in the
very first talk of this conference we
heard that that people don't want to
hear about negative result fish want to
hear about positive result so I hope you
don't mind that I'm going to tell you an
egg ative results that things are not
quite as good as this sounds
and the reason is if you look at the
Hamiltonian here it turns out when you
write it down all the off diagonals are
non positive which okay why is that
matter physicists call this sign problem
free or also stochastic which is like
stochastic but we just like to put
queues and everything though it's still
plastic and what that means is that it's
not hard to show that the ground state
has only non-negative entries but
quantum states in general can have
complex numbers for entries what does it
mean that they only have non-negative
entries it means that the interference
that we would normally expect cannot
occur so normally we have constructive
and destructive interference destructive
interference requires you know you
interfere a positive with a negative
amplitude but if all the amplitudes are
not negative you're not going to get
that and so one implication of this is
that we can map our quantum Hamiltonian
on to an equivalent classical system
whose called this procedure is called
quantum Monte Carlo despite the name
it's not a quantum algorithm with the
classical algorithm as invented in the
70s before before quantum computers were
around and one result with my former
student Elizabeth crossing is that when
the adiabatic algorithm can quickly
tunnel through so can quantum Monte
Carlo which I emphasize in the classical
algorithm so the idea if quantum Monte
Carlo represents your quantum state by
this rectangle of a bit and if you look
at each row so here I've plotted the
weight of each row and here this dashed
blue line of the barrier the evolution
of quantum Monte Carlo there's some kind
of path that evolves over time and this
path so similar annealing would get
stuck because to step on this barrier
would be exponentially forbidden but if
you have a path which is wiggling around
the whole path doesn't have to sit on
the barrier all at once little pieces of
it can go through and so it doesn't feel
the barrier as much it's kind of like
the way the quantum state is smeared out
with superposition and doesn't feel the
the barrier as much the quantum Monte
Carlo can take advantage of this as well
so here's all three the three things and
actually I was told to have not too many
acronym
so let me replace that so this is
simulated annealing with the first
algorithm - what are we done we started
with a classical algorithm simulated
annealing fails we made a quantum
version quantum adiabatic optimization
succeed right it gets through the
barrier then we said actually you can
simulate this with a classical algorithm
quantum Monte Carlo which which now
succeed so what seemed to be a promising
quantum speed-up now does not look so so
promising so I said I'll talk about what
can we do with the quantum computer this
is something which so far is maybe not
looking like a promising use of
near-term kuan computers and so yeah I
think it was interesting to see and it
if not does that totally rule out
adiabatic optimization there may be
other things we can do but it suggests
that tunneling is not going to be one of
those application now I didn't enter
this field to only find negative things
about quantum computing so you know
what's something good that we can do
with them and the last thing we'll talk
about our variational algorithms and
this goal of quantum supremacy which is
means doing something out of quantum
computer that you cannot do on a
classical computer sort of a milestone
that even if it's not directly useful
would give motivation for building
larger quantum computers and there's one
nice class of variational quantum
algorithms which does the following you
want to try to find the minimum of your
function and so before I said one way we
could do it is to adiabatic Li
interpolate the Hamiltonian so that can
sometimes to be simulated but here's a
very simple variant instead of
interpolating just try one Hamiltonian
the magnetic field to the right then do
the other one the complicated
interactions then try the other one for
a bit and then go bounce back and forth
a few times and do this not too many
times let's say five or ten times and
then search over the values of these
times so try if you know do a local
search try and improve improve these
times so this is a very simple quantum
algorithm for optimization problems or
for doing things like Christy was
talking about of trying to find the
ground state of some physical system you
can use it for that as well and you
might ask this is so simple can
you simulate it with a classical
computer so fiber a randomized computer
take some random bits does some
processing spits out a sample can you
simulate it and you can prove that you
can't subject to some assumptions in
complexity theory the outputs of the
quantum algorithm even though it's quite
simple even if you just do t1 and then
t2 and then stop so you just do a very
short run of it it's hard to simulate
classically so this is I think a very
promising video because it takes very
short amount of time on a quantum
computer ok so let me let me close by
saying quantum computers are a
technology that has some promise but I
don't know fully what they're why they
work and why they achieve their benefits
it's sort of like you know one's a kid
carburetors were an example of such a
technology this is Calvin's dad why they
work he says I can't tell you
Calvin Ghetts is why not if dad says
it's a secret and Calvin says no what is
it you just don't know and so that's you
know for quantum computers why why do
they get their advantage you know I'd
like to tell you it's a secret but I
have to admit I I don't really know
so I do know what I've hoped to convince
you with it the exponentially large
dimension is not enough you need
interference as well and with these
variational algorithms even though
they're very short they do have minus
signs in their amplitudes so you get
interference and I think it's a
fascinating question to keep on trying
to dig into what can they do better than
classical computers and what can't they
and in the process what can we learn
about the nature of quantum information
and and what quantum mechanics means for
information computing okay thanks for
