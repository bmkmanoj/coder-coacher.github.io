January and by February there's a
smaller faster less expensive one out
there sure things move fast but
according to my next guest you ain't
seen nothing yet joining us via
satellite from Boston say welcome to
author inventor and futurist Raymond
Kurzweil hey thanks for being on the
screensaver
glad to be here now in your book the age
of spiritual machines you make many
startling really mind-blowing
predictions about the future the machine
and the effect that that future will
have on humanity but before we talk
about that future we really have to
understand how the past has caused you
to formulate your predictions and maybe
the best way to do that is within the
framework of the notion of exponential
growth what is exponential growth
well the stems of my interest in being
an inventor because I wanted to see
where technology was headed and I began
to develop mathematical models of how
technology evolves and exponential
growth and the power of computers is
well known we call it Moore's law but
turns out that Moore's law is really
just one of the paradigms it's really
the fifth one we've been growing
computers exponentially for a hundred
years the same exponential growth
actually double exponential growth
occurs in many other fields
communications our understanding of the
brain genomic science with miniaturizing
technology at an exponential rate many
different aspects of technology are
expanding their powers exponentially so
essentially what it means is progression
just keeps getting faster and faster and
faster as technology gets more powerful
right but it's not linear it means that
we're essentially doubling the power of
these technologies every so often now in
computers is actually every year we're
doubling the power of computation so I'm
going to continue when one pattern runs
out of steam like integrated circuits we
go to another paradigm will replace
flight integrated circuits with
three-dimensional circuits that's the
next method that will keep exponential
growth going for computers so let's
apply exponential growth to the future
what will computers be like in say 10
years from now 2010 or so well in 10
years because of the miniaturization
they're going to disappear we won't be
carrying around rectangular objects or
even spherical objects they'll be
embedded in our clothes
images will be written directly to our
retina from our glasses and contact
lenses will have extremely high
bandwidth connection to DNA at all times
so for example we'll be able to enter
virtual reality environments about
evolving the visual and auditory sense
so you can actually feel like you're
with someone and look around them just
by actually seeing their image directly
written to your retina and you'll
actually it'll actually feel like you're
in that environment displays will be
replaced by virtual images at Harbor and
air and will be encountering a lot of
embedded intelligence so everyday
objects of walls or clothing or
eyeglasses will all be embedded with
computation and then we move up to say
2020 and you say that for $1000 in
today's money
you could get a computer that it has the
computational power of the human brain
when you say the computational power of
the human brain I mean computers right
now a computer can beat Kasparov in
chess but this is this is
all-encompassing
computers can beat us at narrow tasks
playing chess guiding a cruise missile
making medical diagnoses making
financial investment decisions but they
don't have yet the subtlety and
suppleness of human intelligence and
there's two requirements what is the
hardware capacity and a conservatively
high estimate of 20 million billion
calculations per second which is at the
upper end of the range of estimates will
be achieved by $1,000 of computation by
2020 but that's just the hardware the
more salient issue is the software the
knowledge and the organization of those
resources and that's going to take us
longer to about 2030 before we finish
actually reverse engineering
understanding the principles of
operation of how the human brain works
and then re implementing those methods
in these very powerful future computers
and you say that by 2030 we're talking
about computers for a thousand bucks
that have a thousand times the
computational power of the human brain
and people start to discuss the legal
rights of computers tell me about that
well it does not go very sharp
distinction between biological human and
non-biological machine computer
intelligence we're going to be placing
intelligent machines in our own brains
now we're doing that today with people
who have disability
like I have a deaf friend who has a
cochlear implant interfaces directly
with his neural circuits there's a new
implant for Parkinson's patients that
actually replaces the cells that are
destroyed by that disease 30 years from
now it's not just going to be people
with severe disabilities that use this
technology we'll be introducing
intelligent machines through the
bloodstream without surgery they'll make
their way into the brain and actually
augment our biological intelligence so
if you encounter someone in 2030 2035
they're really a hybrid of biological
and non-biological intelligence now
because by non-biological intelligence
grows exponentially over time as we
talked about before ultimately most of
the computation in in our brains even of
a biological human will be
non-biological so it's not going to be a
sharp distinction of machines on the
right side of the room humans on the
left is going to be a whole continuum
between the two and if people don't
start to put these implants within
themselves are they going to be able to
keep up are they going to be able to
have meaningful existences in society
will there be a massive split a grand
neo-luddite movement that they'll be
able to have the same medical
experiences they have now but there'll
be a whole level of dialogue that they
won't be able to participate in
particularly as we go out to say 2040
when we're talking about machines being
millions or billions of times more
powerful than human intelligence you
really will need to take advantage of
this technology to keep up with the
explosive expansion of human knowledge
and the dialogue that will take place
you know this all sounds like you know
the stuff of science fiction it would be
easy to dismiss it as if science fiction
it's crazy but you certainly have the
pedigree to back this up the predictions
that you made throughout the 80s and
more let's come to pass in the 90s and
you develop such things as Kurzweil
music systems well let's talk a little
bit about art and music in the future
because you're interested in that you've
done the music there you are there with
Stevie Wonder
you've also built a cybernetic poet how
its art and performance going to change
as these computers get more and more
advanced well we're already using
computers as very powerful tools to help
us create our time predicted Maties that
by the end of the century most
commercial music would be created by
computer
is an electronic synthesizers and that's
true today and we're already beginning
to actually jam with computers and have
computers generate a walking bass line
or appropriate rhythmic accompaniment so
we're creating music by collaborating
with the intelligence of our machines
and there are some examples where
computers can be creative we have a
cybernetic poet an artist on one of our
websites that actually is creative that
represents the knowledge about or poetry
of humans but these systems can be
creative on their own without further
assistance when we go out to the point
where really machines can encompass the
full range of human intelligence will
leave fully reverse-engineered the brain
and we have machines that have the same
suppleness and subtlety of human
intelligence
they'll be artists with their own
reputation and creating art music and
new forms of creativity for example
designing new virtual reality
environments and networks so just just
to wrap up here are you optimistic about
this future a future where machines are
going to have greater thinking capacity
than humans will the machines take over
like in so many dystopian novels and
movies or no if you combine all these
revolutions the ones we've been talking
about with computers and intelligence
nanotechnology the ability to create and
the entity atom by atom to the
breakthroughs that are coming in
biotechnology will have the means of
overcoming disease greatly extending
longevity overcoming poverty all
presumably positive things but there is
a downside technology is a double-edged
sword it empowers both our creative and
destructive sides and this I think we're
really afraid of is the duality of human
nature the fact that these technologies
can be applied for our human goals some
of which are destructive so we're going
to have to actually build in
technological immune systems be very
concerned with the misuse of these
technologies just as we are today we've
seen that with September 11th that
technology and those weren't the most
recent technologies can be abused for
destructive purposes we're gonna have to
be very mindful of that yeah hey thanks
so much for joining us around the
screensavers Raymond
I'm great at logic my pleasure all right
and be sure that you check out his
