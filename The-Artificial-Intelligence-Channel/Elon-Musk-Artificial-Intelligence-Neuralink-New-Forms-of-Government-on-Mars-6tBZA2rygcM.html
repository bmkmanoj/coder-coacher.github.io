one of the things you spend an awful lot
of time thinking about I know is
artificial intelligence it's something
that you and I have a shared interest
that it's something that our audience is
interested in as well the question here
is a lot of experts in AI don't share
the same level of concern did you do
about the day traffic rules what what's
his last words what's what specifically
do you believe that they don't well the
biggest issue I see with so-called AI
experts is that they they think they
know more than they do and they think
they're smarter than they actually are
in general we are all much smarter than
we think we are much less smart dumber
than we think you are by a lot so this
is this tends to play plague smart
people that you just can't that they
define themselves by their intelligence
and they they don't like the idea that a
machine can be way smarter than them so
they discount the idea which is
fundamentally flawed that's the wishful
thinking situation I'm really quite
close to I'm very close to the cutting
edge in AI and it scares the hell out of
me
it's capable of vastly more than almost
anyone knows and the rate of improvement
is exponential you can see that some
things like alphago which went from in
the span of maybe six to nine months it
went from being unable to beat even a
reasonably good go player so then
beating the European world champion who
was ranked 600 then beating Lisa doll
for five what would be in a world
champion for many years then beating the
current world champion then beating
everyone while playing simultaneously
then then there was alpha zero which
crushed alphago 100 to 0 and alpha zero
just learnt by playing itself and it can
play basically any game that you put the
rules in for if you whatever rules you
give it
it literally read the rules play the
game every superhuman for any game
nobody expected that great of
improvement to guess those so those same
experts who think AI is not progressing
at the rate that I'm saying I think
you'll find that their predictions for
things like go and and other and other
AI advancements have therefore their
batting average is quite weak it's not
good that we'll see this also with was
self-driving i I think probably by
anammox year the self-driving will be
well encompass essentially all modes
driving and be at least a hundred to two
hundred percent safer than a person by
the end of next year we're talking maybe
eighteen months from now and it's a
third study on on Tesla's autopilot
version one which is relatively
primitive and found that it was a forty
five percent reduction in highway
accidents and that's despite what a
pilot one being just version one version
two I think will be at least two or
three times better that's the current
version that's running right now so the
rate of improvement is really dramatic
we have to figure out some way to ensure
that the advent of digital super
intelligence is one which is semiotics
with humanity I think that's the single
biggest existential crisis that we face
and the most pressing one and how do we
do that I mean if we take it that it's
inevitable at this point that some
version of AI is coming down the line
how do we how do we steer through them
well I'm not normally an advocate of
regulation and oversight I mean I think
it's once you generally go inside
minimizing those things but this is a
case where you have a very serious
danger to the public and it's therefore
there needs to be a public body that has
insight and then oversight on to confirm
that everyone is developing AI safely
this is extremely important I think a
danger of AI is much greater than the
danger of nuclear warheads landlocked
and nobody would suggest that we allow
anyone to just blow up nuclear warheads
if they want that would be insane and
mark my words
AI is far more dangerous than nukes far
so why do we have no regulatory
oversight this is insane
what question you've been asking for a
long time I think it's a question that's
come to the forefront over the last year
where you begin to realize that it
doesn't necessarily I think if we've all
been focused in on the idea of
artificial superintelligence right which
is clearly a danger but maybe you know a
little further out what's happened over
the last years you've seen artificial
what I've been calling artificial
stupidity talking about you know
algorithmic manipulation of social media
like we're in it now it's starting it's
starting to happen how do we how do we
is it
what's the intervention at this point so
I'm not really all that worried about
the short-term stuff things that are
other like narrow AI is not a species
level risk it will it will result in
dislocation in lost jobs and you know
that sort of better weaponry and that
kind of thing but it is not a
fundamental species level risk whereas
digital super intelligence is so it's
really all about laying the groundwork
to make sure that if if humanity
collectively your science that creating
digital super intelligence is the right
move then we should do so very very
carefully very very carefully this is
the most important thing that we could
possibly do
building on that other other than AI and
the the other issues that you're you're
tackling transportation energy
production aerospace what issues should
our next generation of leaders be
focused on solving what else is coming
down the line well I mean there there
are other things that are on a longer
time scale the obviously the things that
I believe in like extending life beyond
Earth making life multiplanetary but I'm
a big believer in a sort of Asimov's
Foundation series or the principle that
you you really want to you know I
recommend reading the foundation series
but it's like if you if you know that
there's a there's likely to be you know
you don't know but there's likely to be
another Dark Ages which it seems my
guess is the father will be at some
point I'm not on a predicting that we're
about to enter a Dark Ages but that
there's some probability that we will
particularly if there's a third world
war then we wanna make sure that there's
enough of us of a seed of human
civilization somewhere else to bring
civilization back and perhaps shorten
the length of the dark ages I think
that's why it's um it's important to get
a self-sustaining base ideally on Mars
because Mars is far enough away from
Earth that occur that a warrant earth
the Mars base might survive is more
likely to survive than a moon base but I
think a moon base and a Mars base that
that could perhaps help regenerate life
back here on earth it would be really
important and to get that done before a
possible World War 3 you know last
century we had two massive world wars
three if you count the Cold War I think
it's unlikely that we'll never have
another world war again the parlor will
be at some point or if we have another
one it'll be the last you
Madhvi radioactive rubble yeah so again
I'm not predicting this seems like well
if you say given enough time will it be
most likely given enough time this is
this is this is has been our pattern in
the past yeah so like we really believe
in the zeroth law of Asimov zeroth law
you're gonna take the set of actions
most likely to support the humanity of
the future but I think that
sustainability is also obviously really
important
that's tautological if it's not
sustainable its unsustainable yeah how
close are we to solving that problem
well I think that the core technologies
are are there with the wind solar with
with batteries the the fundamental
problem is that there's an unprecedented
the cost of of co2 the market economics
works very well if things are priced
correctly but when there's when things
are not priced correctly and something
that has has a real cost has zero cost
then that's where you get distortions in
the market that inhibit the progress of
of other technologies so essentially
anything that that produces carbon it
will push push carbon into the
atmosphere which includes rockets by the
way so I'm not excluding rockets from
this there has to be a price and that
you start off with a low price but then
that price and and then depending upon
whether that price has any effect on the
past a million possibility of co2 in the
atmosphere you can adjust that price up
or down but in the absence of a price we
sort of pretend that digging trillions
of tons of fossil fuels from deep under
the earth and putting it into the
atmosphere pretending that that had that
that that has no probability of a bad
outcome and the entire scientific
community is saying obviously it has
it's gonna have a bad
obviously you just you're changing the
chemical constituency the atmosphere so
so it's really up to people and
governments to put to put a price on on
carbon and and then automatically the
right thing happens it's really
straightforward what do we do with the
carbon surrender I actually think we can
manage with the current carbon level or
even a little bit higher it's and this
is gonna sound sound like I'm
backtracking but there's actually an
argument that more carbon in the
atmosphere is is actually good but up to
a point so we might actually arguably
have been a little carbon starved if you
go back 200 years ago and say okay well
Furies go like you had like two hundred
eight hundred ninety parts per million
of carbon we're probably a little cough
and stuff now we're about four hundred
just passed four hundred mark I think
somewhere in the 400s probably okay we'd
have to worry about sequestering carbon
or anything like that but not if those
momentum keeps going and we stopped
going up to six hundred eight hundred a
thousand fifteen hundred that's where
things get really squirrelly and the
sheer momentum of the world's energy
infrastructure is leading us in that
direction so it's just very important
that the the public and the governor's
push to ensure the correct price of
carbon is paid so that that will be the
thing that matters yeah our audience is
very interested in knowing how many
hours of sleep you got last night I
don't know about six five or six I think
all right I feel like we know part of
the answer this cuz you were trapped in
west wall for a while
but but how do I mean on a regular day
for you or you are you are you sleepy
you're not sleeping a lot
right well geez do I look that bad huh
you look great okay just imagine with
the amount of responsibilities we think
about you know with what you've got
going on do these problems still keep
you up at night or do you think we're on
our way to solving well right now the
only things that are really stressing me
out in a big way are AI obviously that's
like boys there and and I'm working
really hard on Tesla Model 3 production
and we're making good progress but it's
usually hard work but those are the two
most restful things my life right now
yeah our audience really wants to know
we hope the world will look like four
children born today when they're your
age wins right what do you hope for the
world to look like what's the best-case
scenario say we solve these problems
what's that world look like
let's see I think the a good picture
would look like you know we're really
substantially transferred to sustainable
generation and consumption of
electricity so that the the co2 risk and
the ocean rising risk is mitigated and
we're not looking at like you know
having Florida and it's sort of large
portions the world underwater that'd be
great that not but to have addressed
that risk that'll be there you know was
for us to have a base on the moon
face a mirage big out there exploring
the solar system so welding industry on
it essentially having you know
civilization to go out there and and
have you such that anyone can go the
Moon or Mars or this whole system if
they want making it really affordable I
do think it's important that this
competition of their multiple companies
doing this not just a sex and and
a I risk is that I guess it's the sort
of a benign AI and they were able to
achieve a symbiosis with that AI ideally
the AI there's somebody who came over
his name but had a good a suggestion for
what the optimization of the AI should
be
what's its utility function you have to
be careful about this because you say
maximize happiness and the AG concludes
that happiness is function of dopamine
and serotonin so she captures all humans
and jacks your brain with large amounts
of dopamine serotonin like ok so he
meant it sounds pretty good though I
love it well I like the definition of
like the I should try to maximize the
freedom of action of you of humanity
maximize the freedom of action maximize
freedom essentially I like that
definition but we do want to close
coupling between collective human
intelligence and digital intelligence
and a neural link is trying to help in
that regard by creating a an interface
between a high bandwidth interface
between AI and your and human brain
there were already we're already a
sidewalk in the sense that your phone
and your computer a kind of extension of
you just low bandwidth input-output
exactly it's just low bandwidth
particularly output I mean two thumbs
basically so how do we solve that
problem
giver the bandwidth it's a bandwidth
issue but we've all we've also come to
it now we're all we're all cyborgs we're
just low efficiency cyborgs so how do we
how do we make it better I think we've
gotta both a we've got apples in her
face like we didn't evolve to have a
communications Jack you know some so
there's gotta be essentially vast
numbers of of tiny electrodes that are
able to read right from your brain of
course you know security is pretty
important in the situation say the least
obviously saying I'm not coming with I'm
keeping my brain air-gapped yeah well I
think a lot of people will choose to do
that but it's a bit like Ian banks is in
your lace but not made it but in the
case of your lace it sort of felt that's
there from when you're born or it's sort
of it's not a it's working so tobacco
yeah kind of a backup this would be this
there's a digital extension of you that
is an AI the AI extension of you a
tertiary layer of intelligence so you've
got your limbic system your cortex and
and the tertiary which is the digital AI
extension of you and that high bandwidth
connection is what achieves the tights
and biases I think that's the best
outcome I I hope so if you know he's got
better ideas and pull up to here and you
talking about another project that
you're working on that her audience
wants to know a little bit more about
Starling oh can you tell us anything
doing Skynet hopefully not Skynet its
Internet in the sky
well we we don't talk that much about
StarLink but essentially it's intended
to provide low latency high bandwidth
internet connectivity throughout the
world that actually will not be enough
cognitive processing car onboard the
satellite system to to in any way be a
Skynet thing like it's the digital AI
requires a lot of super intelligence
requires lot of big servers on the
ground to power intensity but this is
attempt to be to provide people with who
don't have any internet connectivity
with Internet connectivity and it's very
good for sparse and responsive operated
in moderate moderate least boss equated
populated areas and forgiving people in
cities a choice of a in your low-cost
choice of internet access but I do think
it's gonna be important the stalling
system will be important in providing
the funding necessary for SpaceX to
develop interplanetary spacecraft and at
the same time yeah helping people who
have even though or super expensive
connectivity and giving people in urban
areas more of a competitive choice very
cool I have to ask you because it's the
number one question just going back to
Mars what kind of government do you
envision for the first Martian colony
and what's your and what's your title
yeah yeah exactly
Emperor oh God Emperor I don't know
it might be too much
if you were to watch my jokes yeah not
everyone gets irony you know I remember
so I think the I think most likely the
the form of government on Mars would be
somewhat of a direct democracy where you
vote on issues where people vote
directly on issues instead of going
through representative government in in
when the United States was formed
representative government was the only
thing that was logistically feasible
because people there's no way it was all
your people to communicate instantly a
lot of people's didn't even have really
access to mail boxes well there wasn't
even the post office was very primitive
a lot of people couldn't write so you
had to have some form of representative
democracy or things just wouldn't work
at all but I think I'm most likely it's
gonna be people at everyone votes on
every issue and that's how it goes
a few things I'd recommend which is keep
Lois shirt
long Lois it's like that's that's
something suspicious is going on if
there's long Bowl you know if you if the
size of law exceeds the word count of
Lord of the Rings which it does
amazingly then it's like something's
wrong so there should be a limit to the
size of the law that I should be able to
digest it like how come you can read the
Constitution and all of the amendments
like you can read those and maybe an
hour and and we haven't so much of a
civilization by that and yet modern law
is this obtuse super boring tome that's
indecipherable to almost anyone so I
think direct democracy lowers lows that
are comprehensible I think having some
kind of hysteresis on like it should be
easier to remove a law than create one
because things just get to inertia you
have to have something that's gonna
combination so probably I don't want the
right number of you maybe it's like
60/40 maybe you don't quite a 60% to get
a law in place but any number above 40%
can remove a little otherwise things
that you just get lowers just accumulate
over time they cure their time and it's
sort of like Gulliver where you just get
trapped by all these tiny strings and
can't move
you get hardening of the arteries of
civilization with law with rules and
rules rules rules so it should be just
easier to get rid of rule then let's put
one in maybe it should even have like a
some kind of sunset clause so that they
just automatically expire unless there's
enough of an impetus to keep them around
I know I know there's an affirmative
which is I'm interested in hearing a
little bit more about the very early
days with tassel on how it came together
brother Kimble is here so we bring him
out
you guys could talk a little bit about
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
