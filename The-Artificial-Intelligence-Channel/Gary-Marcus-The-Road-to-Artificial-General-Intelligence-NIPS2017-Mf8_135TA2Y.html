okay so ability to introduce yeah
remarketing and what are you formerly
from geometric intelligence thank you
all the sessions called kinds of
intelligence and decide to be main part
adopts at least introduce a little bit I
should say with almost everything that
Josh said we didn't say it to the panel
parts that we don't agree on this talk
is really going to be applied to things
I rewrote my entire clock this morning
and in every slide that I wrote I
thought the chats paper was so cold that
if deserve to reply and haven't seen him
even gifts and stuff that wasn't a
perfect positional play and so forth I'm
even more a fan of that paper but I
still think there's some other things
that we need to talk about I'm gonna
dedicate this talk to the memory and
Jerry builder I don't know how many
people in this room before all showed he
was I think one of the best philosophers
of mind of the 20th century you should
know about his book the modularity of
mind which introduced a hypothesis it's
kind of in the opposite extreme event
and declare anything people like to know
his arguments whether or not he had
another book on the language of thought
which is I think even more influential
and what I haven't safe today basically
what he argued in that book is that we
have something like a first order logic
built into the head and that allows us
to do a whole bunch of other things it
was a strong beam of this claim about
the expressive power of something called
entities I'm not going to defend
everything the coder said but I'm going
to
it's the durian perspective yeah do that
I think is a little bit of sense
decreased because everything that we've
seen in recent AI research suggests it
was wrong but we don't need a whole lot
of in a structured workout for working
together he sucks
kind of the the frosted things but then
once is palpable we have seen Gary
Marcus caveat see America for example
nonetheless even though the popular
position and music looks kind of crazy I
think it's still roughly right so look
never was given by Dennis just an hour
ago
this includes it's wonderful series of
papers but we'll call that a star so
that's the original go over the most
recent one that there's applied two
checks as well and the one that kind of
bothered which is the one in between
which is a nature paper a month ago
which is the fourth major paper coming
out of divine if you keep track and
without any of us paper was the title
and the abstract in a way that was
framed not the result was that
possibility between even more brilliant
results of one layer so the titles of
mastering the game ago without his
knowledge and I'm not sure that that's
actually what's up the place and this on
this slide and quote 0na logic and
kumusta put the quote marks around my
benefit but he never explained see him
he never explained the man surprised by
the quote zero but I think it's not
quite zero and I think that
understanding complete zero knowledge at
quote zero knowledge is pretty important
to understanding
towards Asiana that's kind of talks
about so conditioning can be viewed as
basically a three plays function where
the function is from indeed algorithms
and Inc knowledge and experience to
whatever it is that you got a cognition
defined as shown very convincingly as
possible moves came outstanding
cognitive performance in some domains
with values attained approach zero I
don't think it's literally zero except
for the folder the question today is is
that an observation true for cognition
in general that's what I don't
understand so how it's not really zero
the most important thing Alison Kosik is
that my brother's research is built-in
and I don't see how you can consider to
know in the knowledge we build in Monte
Carlo tree search which people have
realized the last 10 15 20 years is
essential for playing games of this sort
so whose human knowledge of when is it I
mean I don't think there was a kind of
exhaustive parallel search of all
possible miles it just happened to come
out at Monte Carlo tree search where did
though at least in principle you could
imagine that given in still eliminate a
lot of I mean any structure on that one
might imagine and that piece on top fish
listening all of the algorithms that are
in all they acknowledge they're the
devil's presented is very compelling
about under the glottis up but if you
want to win out the Monte Carlo tree
search it starts with the ability to
represent trees and that's actually what
those of us in the other side of the
spectrum
they've been arguing them about most
bitterly for very long time is if you
need to have trees in urinate on them
era in order to do cognition so Chomsky
made that argument over a better a
battery I think that our
so you have innate stuff in alphago of
the zero sector including all the echo
parameters that are a result of a long
search including Monte Carlo tree search
if you read the paper not even you might
think oh it's just reinforcement
learning and that is where everything
come from but they've not actually shown
it reinforcement learning including
cells the rod research level on
cartilage research with the right kind
of properties were that many of the
specifics of the architecture that
company convolution if you want to react
support that would be very impressive
it's not actually when I might have used
to greatly reduce the amount of the name
specific knowledge just over the last
year that they require X on the leg
where all of these kinds of things that
look like taxed in the first initiative
things like how many stones there any
liberties particular stone happen with
some symbolic propagation algorithm off
stages to bring out all this up it was
no learning involved there was just
built in it was a little bit dearly Josh
and I are interested in the southeast
weakness hypotheses about might make you
have a notion of a college-educated but
nobody makes me happy neatly the number
of liberties of the stone has and ago
opposition right I mean it's only 3,000
years of goals which was a long time not
enough to have it all back so that was a
bit of an embarrassment it can and very
successfully then it's got his troops to
reduce that move that is home
we should pay attention to look left so
and shacking compared to other endeavors
by deep mind about how their pain is
endeavors so the only innate knowledge
now is the game rules in the neat trick
representational formats there's no any
you know open it knowledge so many
tactics like a knife or something I got
I slide and so forth but so the game
rules and the representational cornets
are again in that kind of funky makes up
that we don't think you're involved so
there's an innate claim forecasting with
respect to this model I mean you might
think well of course everybody needs to
do that but they didn't need to do that
to be sorry basis and it's worth the
kind of comparing to be fair game system
the inputs with pixels we haven't seen
alphago or elevated any of these
additions actually playing adjusted
pixels which I think would be more
impressive demonstration of the way that
these are made even girls okay I want to
at this point it domain specificity and
the nakedness
often travel together but they're not
the same thing so you can have things
that are engaged and domain specific you
have these their domain specific to not
any foreign embassy chances domain
specific that nobody thinks that
something may rely on with some innate
requisites about visualization
complication but it's not a day that the
teller reflex is completely
domain-specific it's entirely made these
recognitions mostly domain-specific when
you can adapt its recognized cars
they're all kinds of possibilities we
have to be careful about are we arguing
about the no specificity or uniqueness
so now the zero occupies a particular
point in the space of an anus and domain
specificity which is you've got a neat
machinery for reinforcement learning
amount of Carlo tree search that's a
complication he's an angel iron rules
and representational schemes and urban
specific suggests where you go and you
have the self play and
which is how I think of the like Russian
chess academy so that's also kind of
sitting off stage but then there's no
need knowledge about specific position
stockfish and then was displayed
beautifully as I had this slide it's
much more complex innate structure much
more knowledge about about more
decisions there are different positions
in a space that you can imagine a
possible architectures is really a
community dimensional space alpha 0 is
much cleaner it plays much better that's
an empirical discovery that's pretty
interesting it's an open question as I'm
saying about whether the rules and
domain-specific representation schemes
would be eliminated as they were today
sorry Davis's could you really do of the
pixels so there's no results here's a
scientific result which is that in the
regime of perfect information war games
which is what we now know this object
will work on provided that experience is
essentially unlimited you can be
successful where paint constitutes only
rules and word representations of in
structure by even programmers and
essentially nothing else on the
knowledge from and then you have a a
just equals reinforcement learning by
the public research and empirically
derived by programmers so it's pretty
far to the left end of the spectrum of
how much you need stuff you have in that
regime the question is what if you move
from knackers you can do these with an
energy click that all the speeds of AI
problems are just like these that we
could use exactly the same solution for
everything we need to do in AI and then
we've done some of the media has
reported to have those 0 getting
confused on them I was here as if that
might be the case that would certainly
did not so the key question as I said
with us is holding more broadly for
general color so that raises the
question what we mean by intelligence so
I'm gonna quote from Dennis's co-founder
Shanklin wanted to negative initials we
could use intelligence is a property of
an agent interacts with its environment
so it's the successfully chief
Gold across a wide range of environments
another thing is goho is not the same
thing as like Sogo is
perfect information about the fourth
stage it can be simulated perfectly was
unlimited data all the matters of
support state life is not like that like
shares of complexity but it's imperfect
information can't be simulated perfectly
this modest amount of data per test
essentially anything pneumatic which is
something that motor actually talked
about it ended much better defined
people always think that book is being
about modules but the cramping chapter
that was about applying an isotropic
knowledge which basically anything
influence angel in Santa Claus so some
hallmarks of even like a GI or the
ability to Asperger's being somewhat
call was to learn from verbal
explanation to learn from a relatively
small numbers example Samus touched on
some of these the ability to work with
imperfect information and complete
information to work on a lot of
information on apply in all the waiters
Ernie a design has grasped its in terms
of common sense knowledge so for example
if you are a robot sitting on a tree
with a chainsaw you should try to make
sure you're on the right side of the
dream not the bottom side of the tree be
great you don't want to learn that
through maybe trouser reinforcement
learning an example that we didn't
actually have any papers by a spider in
a closed container and shake it up is
quite ready to be able to get out and
you can do that then what we need to do
all this attention no anywhere every
molecule in the container is easy to do
that whole bunch of containers that
you've never seen before that haven't
had to change some rope in another knot
and you can easily make these kind of
inferences and you can figure out that
this higher will escape from the right
below center etc I think showing this
weird thing turns out something called a
downer Peter or something like that and
once I should be one of them you kind of
get to dinner like the other that little
data I can show you another one that's a
lot of their ways
there's lots of places that if we would
actually like have a Jackson wanted us
to grow buffs right I'll look robots to
put the despite or any container right
like it's putting a container that is
solid it not otherwise the also that
relates it to your mind some of the
doctors that benefit in science there's
lots of place complex real-world
problems
maybe we'll be driving conversational
interface all kinds of things where the
great if we could do some of these kinds
of things that you know generate
evidence to do we don't know whether
those can be mastered by itself playing
the segment they're just a few very
quick examples so we would like a is
better leave understanding gene
transcription ball has medical reasons
we would like least those are also doing
our science we really love the idea to
help us to figure out how the brain
actually works cuz the circuitry is way
too complicated
training individual scientists so I
understand we would like to understand
you know one synapse of their hundreds
of proteins and individual synapse
Terry and I think that that's really
important to neural computation we don't
exactly out I mean we can't figure out
because our brains know that's the very
wealthy fencer so fine during anyways
not big enough to put all that stuff
together so I love it and then there's I
don't know retro you can see if this is
a map of human facts that was nude
anatomic lavender moon and the semantics
never but the connections between them
it's already have a date that it was
being in November you have an
opportunity
that means you got a few the questions
would be - hurry up working to transfer
other talents so so far as far as I know
output zero and its predecessors haven't
been tested on things like pain to the
perfect information means and we see
only if it was pixels like in the apart
work open-ended real-world past
knowledge integration any sort of
transfer evenings like a word of a
different size and you also don't know
who is what comments that other wasn't
all save you so if I teach you chats
will that help me to show these far as I
know none of this has been tested as an
aside if there are successes or some
other pathways almost about them they're
great we play around this is obviously
alright here's some suggested that
there's a why I'm skeptical so the first
is the hell Vizier of nearest proxies
has struggled with travel so nearest
Roxy that we talk about of course if you
are anxious and there's also the deep
reinforcement learning system properties
at geometric you know supervise the team
to put together some tests of how robust
so the learning was so we built our own
three into a game we've applied a
proceed which team I developed to it and
it looks like while we can learn to
navigate international world and then we
just played many games of the new the
pylons around
suddenly a three seems a lot worse
be sure to publish that but we didn't we
were busy but by various means all this
essentially the same thing this year
they did much better than we did much
more versatile they said like if you
just change this no she only one L me
and it space invaders where you move
where it was coming through
if you move where athleticism rates down
and Peter appeal in Goodfellas mothers
had a paper on if you know careful ease
being various birthday earlier this year
in which they showed all kinds of
adversarial attacks the subatomic robust
it's not really representing where
positives are where the guidelines are
things like that second thing is the
defense efforts to learn more
complicated open-ended positive language
from 3d worlds and not the newbies
expressive as their efforts to learn or
game sustaining 700 person for whatever
they have that deep I'm working on these
kinds of things so and 3d worlds in it
and you have a reinforcement learning
kind of similar conceptually similar
effect models find blue out there and
you get some results like assists of
those learn the training side but if you
look at their x-axis it's the hundreds
of atoms really into training episodes
and we're having development literature
causes kids can learn the meaning of a
word is part of the meaning work in one
try so there's no playing there that's
better than this is nowhere curiously
humans even publish this is a
neighborhood somebody who spoke about it
and my new and screenshots you can see
they're kind of I was sitting inside
Detailers are not recorded a neighbor
shown that on occasion which is examples
of it they was worried about this isn't
good doing it all so you got some poor
silence an applicant and his men do it
at all
I was just meeting Peter boss yesterday
it was a he's got company eating this
great slide in any pension but all of
these kind of conceptually different
things in libraries they're sort of at
the level of negation and we don't have
a solution in machine learning domain as
it were any of them yet
the third is did he find us not alone in
these struggles and they're not trying
to pick on he might be doing some of the
best work in the field but it's true
even field in general that we look at
open-ended problems no networks and
breakdowns dramatic ways so here's
actually very examples people from
elsewhere in Google it looks great on
some of the examples so you you feed in
the picture and out from the model
caption we're definitely playing frisbee
you're a person right now motorcycle on
a dirt road looking into the long things
look really bad so this one makes me
think of Oliver Saxon is the parking
some of the stickers that the system
system refrigerator philosophize and
always tell me these are like Cayman
optical illusions I keep it like
communities if one just came out of MIT
get a 3d printed turtle it is
misidentified as rightful or anybody
who's working about worrying about
autonomous weapons
they just still take me very very
worried about people earning power and
five times so well even regime a perfect
information
organs can we have a stunning result but
my speculation is immoral than any
worlds of the sector read more open and
and gross the amount of machinery and
the amount of innate machinery a plus K
is going to go on there's no way for it
to go down and it's going to need to go
up in order to account what kind of
phenomenon the Joshua women talking
about so what of any structure might be
need without tonight both huge fans of
the spell feeders here's one line or a
favored permission 1994 if children that
would be needed the ability to perceive
object person sets in places and they
can use their perceptual experience to
learn about the properties and behaviors
and subjectivities and then she makes it
learning ability argument like Chomsky
makes for language basically saying if
you don't start with those things you're
not going to be able to learn the right
thing you're not going to pick out the
right things and I think the failures of
a 3 C and D Q then to generalize to
pylons in different places or panels and
it replaces because we don't know what
objects are so they don't have the right
basis that I make the right
generalizations
this is a slide from the debate that I
hadn't done with moon as you can see it
kind of URL slash markets today about a
month ago and I made a claim that the
ten days or so on the right here in this
slide were minimal nations I don't want
to say it's exactly but rather than the
minimal basis in a basis at which we
might actually build a chai machines on
discredit in and say yeah maybe a seven
and kind of like a real virgin ad but
every press write game on being the
closest without going over piece I
didn't think any of them are necks it
was clear there
including translation invariance which
which is sort of centered over here but
which is developed by DNA can get this
thing running this place is basically
the you know the kinds of things that
selfie talks about or sampler the kind
of names disability talks about like
representations of objects spatial
temporal capability and the things that
I already poured my 2001 book it was
inspired apart by voters language
applaud where I argued it needy things
I've structured out with your a
representations operations over
variables take both in distinctions I
will talk about those in more detail and
the talk that I gave on Saturday so this
is a possible list of anything curiously
make a match roughly with my
collaborator I mean even figured that we
needed to do some common sense reasoning
about containers I know that the conjure
this moment can be today I live a couple
months ago so the important thing is
that there were lots of logical process
issues is the way to be drought a bit
you know that we're trying to stay
stimulation history or rigid objects and
so forth it kind of diverges on what we
really need I think the systematic
thoughtful analyses of how to integrate
innate machinery earth machine learn the
most logical example I know this is
actually from my own so in an early day
for programming whom he compared by a
different visual systems the one on the
top was is disabled to their perceptron
there was multi-layer perceptron and I
Canada's exercise he lacks convolutional
networks which of course we all use all
the time now community and the result
they found was that in ordinance
structure the system work better in
surroundings so more in a structured
empirically made the system work better
yes you can do the thing that you find
is doing a backwards
trying to get rid of apartment we don't
need but that doesn't mean you shouldn't
still be looking for some so you could
actually so I'm gonna happen to have
hold on I guess you could look at what
what he finds doesn't say well this is
actually evidence that what we really
need is my department research and
that's the first thing on our list of
any structure that we needed maybe we
need some more - turns out we don't need
to you need to know about my computer
sort of context we can sort of try to
work both crazy into drafting structure
he's actually making a lot of the
natives in every neural network so
coming laters when you build a neural
network that's an eight commitment how
many what types of things have any units
whether or not to have money problems
research what they output activity
function should be able to get it should
stand or in though as I pointed out
that's very different and now so those
systems that it is in a parking systems
there's teacher design even more
complicated out to zero amenities in the
Atari game system there's actually lots
of any choices that either the jobs from
thinking that we should be looking at
cognitive development as I suggested
we're together instead of just do we
doing the bottom up from what we just
can we manipulate
which reminds me of this xkcd cartoon
you probably all saw recently somebody
says this is your machine learning
system the other guy says get yeah it's
poor in the data this big pile of linear
algebra again collecting answers on the
other side and the first person said
what if the answers are wrong and the
second says well you just stir on the
bottom so there they started looking
right well they're stirring the pile up
he's playing around mostly with the
stuff over here but the other option
user my picks over here is to try and
think about the representations and
primitives that might be built into the
lines of small children and rose
Allison's pushing the same direction
but if maybe we should be looking at the
representations of primitives that are
built in about objects agents and so
forth it's not so the glues I have a 3-1
lesson of keybinds research program
because they are elementary structure
plus minimal knowledge works a means of
perfect information
but as near as I can surmise that's not
gonna get us though aggi the second
lesson from the research program is even
against the perfect information
summoning structure is still in the
sensible like representation trees and
the Monte Carlo tree search that
operates circle I think that means maybe
more Indian structure my American
studies and others offer some
suggestions about where it was I think
the lesson from you now is original work
we get rid of stuff that's completely so
we can build more neat structure if you
want to but I should have said there
about the toughest it's a really
beautiful way a conclusion is really
beautiful way of building with vision
scientists is doing all along what we
need which is a tional variance so you
have an idea from cognition which is
mapped onto a way of representing things
you need a neural network right on I
think we need more work like that to say
how do you represent if you're gonna
stick with the neural network or how do
you represent an object reason over the
spatial temporal continuity over that I
think whether or not we're going to get
to eg I may depend on whether we have
the will to build in enemies even
stronger than we had this debate and I
say that I did it he texted us and said
I did a Google search or nativism in AI
you got a did you mean error I think
that's
feels I mean I've been thinking that
much about whether there should be any
stuff because there's such a strong bias
in the direction that dennis is pushing
today to try to factor it all that and
I'm not sure that's the right way to go
so what kinds of intelligence do we need
for eg our to be the sort of
intelligence inflexibly my calming stays
agents causes objects and so forth and
for that we may be the types of things I
was advocating - 2001 book the algebraic
mind she was an operation there were
very well structured representations
distinction distinctions between types
and coatings and so I don't think the
success on bow or chest shows otherwise
at all one last thing life is not a kind
of competition actually almost everybody
in the know the kind of competition is
well it's great if you can have a
prepackaged dataset which you cannot
English without puts in large things
that's a reasonable expectation that the
testing that are drawn from the same
distribution training in it and
everything you need is encapsulated in
that directory that you can download
from town I don't like things like that
at all like is the training set nothing
is neatly packaged there's no guarantee
of your next challenge is going to be
the same as yesterday's challenge you
don't want to just be digging the
existing fast one no they are reusable
skills and knowledge that can apply the
novel challenges so that less right
moreover that young people is here that
are here I would say it fits the
challenge of reducibility of how I get
stuff that I know here to be used
anywhere else is the real challenge that
the field should be focusing on and
