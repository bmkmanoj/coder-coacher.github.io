because they were just on that last
panel or the opening panel I believe it
was north one just before here actually
and in SpaceX has an initiative in a
whole bunch people are coming out of the
woodwork wanting to put up these large
constellations of satellites to provide
broadband to everyone I think this is a
really huge business opportunity it will
be probably one of the biggest economic
booms from the space industry over the
next ten years in other words the thing
it'll make the most economic impact on
the most people bringing four billion
people online for the first time and
becoming part of the global economy is
perhaps unprecedented in human history
and so we are applauding as loudly as we
can every initiative in this regard have
more net neutral pipes to the to the
home business and everywhere in between
just last week I took some photos of the
latest one web ground terminal and model
of their satellite which is very
different than it used to be when they
were over over at Google and and that's
one of the contenders as you heard that
just raised a bunch of money from
Softbank we can talk in Q&amp;amp;A why that's
technical technologically different from
Teledesic and other predecessors that
had some trouble one the last example
beforehand is jumping out of the
business side I've also been a supporter
b612 over the years and this is a
non-profit I encourage all of you to
check them out started by rusty
Schweickart know of Apollo 9 and ed Lowe
who's flown many times to shuttle and
Soyuz and the idea there is that you put
a satellite in a Venus like orbit
looking out and for an all-in cost of
about 400 million dollars this is the
old product but that's what caught my
attention for four hundred million
dollars all in costs for launch
operations satellite and everything you
could detect all possible threats to
extinguish life on Earth or even
city-sized sort of planet busting or
city busting kinds of asteroids with a
forward-looking 50 200 year trajectory
modeling the end body problem space
become a computational possibility that
if you have you know three points in a
line you can now predict the orbital
dynamics that far out so that you could
do this incredible thing and we should
do that for less than the cost of a new
wing on the Asian Art Museum in San
Francisco you could protect all the
artifacts was sort of my thought back
then the update in the last few months
though that's fascinating is I've been
relentlessly fixated on the sensor cost
was the cryo cooled IR sensor really
seems strange that it needs to be so
expensive so even though it's 400
million big chunk of the costs almost
half the cost of the satellite was a
sensor and sure enough after a bit more
software development a bit more in
more computational load into the
satellite sure enough a cluster of small
SATs as many as few as eight could do
almost as good a job at 100 the cost and
this is some partially published work
and they'll be doing more work in this
area and do some actual flight tests as
well but it just is a great example of
the small set revolution off-the-shelf
components moving into the satellite
computational elements or storage of
data sets that you otherwise couldn't in
this case it's a synthetic tracking that
they put in satellite and being able to
do things that just weren't possible
before was in mode in many industries
you don't find hundred X's you know
entrepreneurs dream of a 10x they often
don't achieve that they rarely even
claim they're gonna make 100x and you'll
see this everywhere in the small set
industry that the march from the
mainframe classic machines down to the
little mobile or laptop size computers
if you will in space is really what it's
all about some people had the foresight
to know this many years ago today it's
blindingly obvious that the future
belongs to the small the nimble the
agile and the commercial off-the-shelf
so with that let me end and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
