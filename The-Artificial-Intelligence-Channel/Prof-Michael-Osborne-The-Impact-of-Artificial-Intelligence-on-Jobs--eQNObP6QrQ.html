today is maybe a bit of a departure from
the kind of things you've been hearing
about this week and the topic is the
future of employment and in particular
how technological advances notably those
with a machine learning robotics are
likely to affect the future of work so
this is often portrayed in the media as
being about robots stealing jobs perhaps
you've seen headlines along those sort
of lines and I don't know about you but
sometimes in reading those kind of
pieces particularly when it's you know
pretty late at night and my code is
still not working as well as I'd like
and I know that if I were to change one
initialization parameter just a teensy
bit it would work even worse I can't
help but think that you know this hype
over algorithms actually taking people's
jobs is a little bit overdone maybe
you've had that impression as well so to
answer that kind of criticism I thought
I might start out with a plot from one
of my favorite studies of all time which
was of a cohort of judges tasked with
awarding parole so the y-axis of this
plot is the fraction of times that the
judges did award parole to parole
seekers as a function of on the x-axis
the ordinal position during the day so
you can see that they start out the day
fairly generously inclined only for that
to wear off their perked up by their
morning coffee only for that to last
only fairly temporarily lunch is another
boost but that lasts you know only a
very short period of time before the
rest of the afternoon is more or less a
complete write-off so the first thing I
want to say about this is that in
today's proceedings were somewhere about
here so really I've got no excuse
whatsoever if you're not you know
positively inclined in judging my talk
but the other more serious point is that
you know humans aren't perfect right
human decision-making is corrupted by
all these kinds of heuristics and biases
and so even though the algorithms we
develop might not be perfect either they
might still be better in some respects
and you know certainly that they're not
going to be affected by you know how
long
since the lunch break so with that sort
of motivation in mind I thought I'd just
roll through a few examples of where
we're already seeing technology
impacting on the world of work and well
actually even before that to that story
I've got this little exercise I'd like
you to undertake so just take a moment
and think about what it would take for
an algorithm to automate your job or you
know if you're not currently in
employment automate any job which you're
particularly well-informed about so
having spent a couple of moments on that
now what I'd like you to do is to turn
to the person to either your left or
right hopefully can organize this into
the centralized way and try and convince
them that their job is automatable given
you know technology that's currently
about what's then spent a few minutes
doing that sorry to stop what I'm sure
is a really interesting discussion but
um could I now just get a bit of a poll
of the audience so could you please
raise your hand if you were convinced by
your partner that your job could be
automated was there anyone few people
that's pretty good
that's pretty good okay well AB thanks
very much for that and now what I
thought it might move on to is just
where I see as I said technology already
kind of encroaching upon the world of
work so the first fear I thought I might
speak about is kind of retail and sales
jobs and you know obviously there's been
a huge boom in online retail in the last
decade in a bit
driven by Ford for example Amazon and of
course machine learning has been at the
heart of a lot of that in making so you
know product recommendations that are
superior to humans simply by virtue of
having access to a much larger larger
set of data than any individual human
salesperson ever would at the top right
of the slide there I've got a Zio's
tablet I'm not sure if you've used one
of these things but what they can do is
essentially replace some of the tasks of
a waiter or waitress in a restaurant by
automating the taking of orders taking
of payments and even potentially doing
some of that recommendation right I mean
they can by having you sign in learn
your preferences and recommend meals to
you that they think they might like that
you might like and the interesting thing
actually with those kind of tablets
is that in you know allowing you to
order say a triple chocolate sundae for
dessert without actually forcing you to
interact with another human being some
restaurants have seen dessert orders go
by up by as much as 20% when the his
technologies are introduced so that's
another way in which these technologies
can improve upon the human level of
performance and on the top left of the
slide here I've got the more recent
example of Amazon goes so I haven't been
to this store perhaps some of you have
but it's a kind of convenience store in
Seattle which is attempting to do away
with checkout assistance altogether by
tracking what you do in the store with
data from your phone using computer
vision algorithms on from cameras
deployed in the store so you can be
automatically billed for whatever it is
you pick out just as he waits at the
store so if that technology proves
itself it's difficult to see it not
affecting you know employment in retail
worldwide but it's not just kind of
lower skilled occupations than being
affected I thought I might speak a
little bit about more traditional
white-collar occupations that are being
affected by technology a lot of people
speak about lawyers being affected by
technology and I think that is very much
happening so in particular in places
like can not trial lawyer work you know
not standing up in front of a court but
anywhere that really just requires a
lawyer to dig through files for instance
like for example a paralegal might do
like a contract lawyer or patent lawyer
might do we are already seeing
algorithms put to those kind of purposes
and then there was this article in The
New York Times a few years ago in which
someone was bemoaning the fact that he
can no longer bill out people to do
document review just because the
algorithms have got so good at doing it
in their place more broadly speaking
their algorithms that are used to write
contracts now there are firms like
contract Express of course a lot of
preparing most contracts is routine that
is absolutely something can be order
that can be automated and they're even
more sophisticated ends of lawyering
work that is beginning to be automated
so that alan ovary which is this big
international law firm is using a
service that
apparently tactic quite complex
multi-jurisdictional legal questions by
you know digging through and prior
examples of such legal questions that's
encoded and documents that the
algorithms can read so something that
perhaps been even more impactful in the
last few years is what's known as
robotic process automation not sure if
this is something that's crossed your
radar but really what RPA is it's come
to be known as doing sounds trivial
which is like so there's a lot of
clerical work that requires not much
more than like opening a file in Excel
copying the data into some other
proprietary bit of software literally
copying and pasting data from one
application to another and RPA is kind
of about learning to do that
automatically so there are these
software bots that will observe how a
worker does this task and over time
automate it so firms like automation
anywhere dynamics blue prism have for
some clients automated as much as 35% of
this kind of work and the firms that
have been affected very much see these
bots as alternatives to workers so some
firms you know different names like poly
I think in one instance and are actually
seeing them as a replacement for some of
the human workers that they're
previously used my next example is
accounting and auditing another
traditional white-collar occupation in
some cases relatively well-paid again
one to which algorithms have been very
heavily targeted in the last few years
so 48 million Americans in 2014
used services like TurboTax to prepare
the tax returns you can understand why
it's not a particularly pleasant thing
to have to do and accountants are
expensive there are the services like
cash flow which automating the
processing of receipts and invoices
again something that's routine and able
to be done by algorithms more
interesting to me things like PwC's halo
4 journals which is an attempt to
automate some of the work that an
auditor would do so when you think about
the limitations on a human auditor
really they're only ever going to be
able to process a small sample a mini
batch if you like of a company's
financial data whereas an algorithm is
under no such limitations so these
services like halo for journals are
actually thinking about what can be done
by looking at not just all the data for
a company but all the data in real time
right so no longer is the order
potentially once a year or once a
refugee a kind of thing this could be
actually be deployed in real time to
flag up any anomalies as they're
happening so the appropriate action can
be taken in response all right so my
next example is perhaps familiar to most
of you it's the rise of self-driving
vehicles or Thomas vehicles so when
people think about this
affecting the world of work I think most
people think about you know for instance
ubers deployment of self-driving taxis
of course these self-driving taxis today
still have a human in the car as well
and perhaps that is coming but to me
that's a little bit further down the
road where I see these algorithms having
real impact in the March shorter term
are in places where there's a lot more
structure to the type of task that's
required so for instance in my native
state of Western Australia today we've
got these big open cut iron ore mines in
the northwest which having worked there
myself fairly unpleasant places to work
they're hot they're dust either very far
from civilization and historically you
would have to pay a human driver
something like 180,000 Australian
dollars to go and work there so the
economic incentive for the big miners
Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton was enormous
to try and automate that kind of work
and in fact they've done it basically so
now in the Pilbara region alone they're
150 of these self-driving trucks and not
just are they automating the work that a
human driver would do that the fact that
these trucks have now have had to be
equipped with in a wide variety of
different senses they're recording their
environment to a much greater degree
than has ever been
in the past means that they're
delivering all kinds of advantages to
these miners far beyond what a human
driver would have done so because
they're recording in much greater detail
the amount of iron ore that's being
picked up you know they're recording
details of failures of different
components of the track that can begin
to optimize the production in a way that
was never possible in the past and the
final example on slide here is that of
the automation of the delivery of meals
and medicines around hospitals so again
this is the task that is really quite
structured so and I didn't really get on
to it but in a mine of course you know
we were really worried about other
traffic on the road you know you can
control the number of trucks that are
going around there aren't stoplights to
worry about you can make sure that there
aren't many humans in the way all that
kind of thing and inside places like
hospitals like warehouses like airports
there's even more structure than
lighting is uniform the flooring is
uniform you can put little tags on the
floors you can put lines on the floors
as I think they do in these hospitals to
tell the little robot exactly where it
needs to go so with all that structure
of course the task becomes a lot easier
to automate and yet nonetheless these
robots really are automating work that
humans were previously required to do
and at least in a UK context so the NHS
the National Health Service in the UK is
under enormous cost pressures and these
kinds of technologies and replacing and
you know hospital Porter's are
absolutely set to suit appointment in
the near future just picking up on that
other places in the NHS where you're
going to see automation in the near
future of things like pharmacy work so
of course it's very easy for an
algorithm to take a prescription slip
and pull out the right medicine that
again is some where we're going to see
automation in the very near future so a
point I made there but didn't really
dwell on was the fact that whenever we
deploy self-driving vehicles autonomous
vehicle technologies when we put all
these sensors and cameras and other
things on
it's not just the automation of human
work we get data from them that allows
better things to happen so I've got a
slide on that as well so when these
vehicles become ubiquitous on our
streets for instance who knows what the
kind of ancillary benefits might be so
certainly there will be advantages for
mapping certainly there'll be advances
advantages for insurance in a you know
ensuring that when the vehicle gets into
an accident there's this really quite
detailed record of exactly what happened
similarly for law enforcement it could
be these vehicles are capturing on
camera
things that law enforcement can use to
track down the appropriate mister I
mentioned the mine example before and
the picture on the slide is from the
Chelyabinsk meteor right from 2013 does
anyone remember this maybe a few people
do a really enthusiastic arm over here
thanks very much so and if you remember
this it's probably because you saw these
kind of amazing images right of a
meteorite striking the ground somewhere
in remote Russia and you might have
stopped to wonder why we had these
images right it's not like Russia is
necessarily deployed this Russia wide
network of cameras to try and capture
every extrasolar body that strikes the
ground instead the reason we have these
images is because there's been this kind
of breakdown in trust amongst Russian
drivers such that it's become common
place to put these dashboard cameras on
their vehicles so if they do get into an
accident they've got footage to back up
their side of the argument so of course
that's good for them but it also means
there are these kind of side benefits
for us as a community or the scientific
community in particular and giving us
these remarkable images of you know this
scientific phenomena ok so you might be
wondering at this point perhaps you've
got on to discussing earlier well if
algorithms and robots so great if they
can dig through documents and drive
vehicles what if humans actually any
good for so and one of the components of
our own work on this topic is the
identification of
we call bottlenecks to automation so we
try to identify the things that are most
difficult to automate in the foreseeable
future and just to be absolutely clear
we're not saying that any of these
bottlenecks are in any sense fundamental
we're not saying that there is any
reason to expect that these things won't
be automated given sufficient time we're
just trying to point to the things that
at least over horizon of 10 to 20 years
at least likely to be replaced by an
algorithmic intelligence so the two
things I've got on the slide creativity
and social intelligence and so to me in
a way these two things they're more
similar than different and the way I
kind of bring them together is to say
that in creativity and social
intelligence humans have perhaps the
deepest reservoirs of tacit knowledge
and by tacit knowledge I mean now we
know how to do things without
necessarily being able to say how right
it's this kind of knowledge that somehow
ingrained in our gray matter but is not
necessarily easy for us to make explicit
in such a way that we could actually
write it you know in a bit of code so
let's take each of them in turn
creativity at least to me requires the
combination of you know things from
vastly different areas of our experience
right so an architect for instance might
be inspired by a nature documentary that
they saw the night before and I think to
really make those big leaps and
innovation in originality and creativity
you need that ability to combine very
different things and really that
requires a data set that is the whole of
human experience which I don't think
we're anywhere near to replicating so
that's the first thing that I do think
is difficult about creativity that kind
of combinatorial element the second
thing I think is still quite difficult
is to make explicit what the human
utility function actually is so
certainly it's possible to have an
algorithm churn out an endless sequence
of songs or paintings within a
particularly narrowly defined
but I still think it's going to be
difficult to distinguish the songs or
paintings whatever else that are truly
you know groundbreaking from that that
is kind of ho-hum the sort of drag I
don't think we have this really good
characterization of what it is that
humans truly value just yet
on social intelligence I think it's more
or less the same story again to
distinguish what is possible from what's
not yes of course we have chatbots but I
think we're a long way away from kind of
higher level human social functioning
and here I'm thinking about things like
negotiation or persuasion or mentoring
right these are all things that humans
can do but not things that those same
humans can necessarily make explicit in
such a way that it could be automated so
again I think while we'll see the
state-of-the-art advance towards some of
these ends I think there are still going
to be jobs for people who bring these
kinds of skills to their work so
managers are one example and don't think
we're necessarily going to see the
automation of a lot of management work
for the foreseeable future
so the third bottleneck the final
bottleneck that we identified was
autonomous manipulation so you know this
is maybe the least fundamental of those
three bottlenecks but I think it's still
probably true that you know the robots
that we have today are still relatively
poor at replacing human fingers and
human eyes I mean we're making progress
but the state of the art really relies
on a lot of structure being baked into
the task that's required to be done so
the places where we do see automation
for example in where has this an example
that I mentioned before
so of course key robotics was brought up
by Amazon to automate some of its
warehousing work but keep in mind what
it isn't isn't doing it's moving big
boxes around these warehouses but of
course it's got an excellent means of
working out where it is in the warehouse
it's got a uniform floor beneath it
uniform lighting above it it doesn't
have to worry too much about unlikely
objects entering its
it's path so in these warehouses of
course they still require human Pickers
to do the more delicate operations of
actually taking boxes off the shelf and
the you know robots are a long way away
from being able to manipulate the
objects themselves that go into those
boxes so I'm not saying that that's
absolutely never going to happen within
the warehouse you know there is still
sufficient structure that we might see
robots able to do some of those tasks in
the near future but I think we're a long
way away from things like the robotic
house cleaner so you know there are
pictures like this one from the 1950s of
people saying that there would be a
robot available any day now who could
clean your house for you and so I think
people's intuition there was that um you
know housecleaning was a kind of menial
task it was something that should be
able to be automated but when you break
down what is actually required to clean
a house you can understand why it is
that so little progress has been made
towards it so I've been harping on this
structure topic and if question from
whatsit well I mean I'm not a roboticist
maybe some of you know more than I do in
this but I mean well so my post is
funded by Dyson Dyson do a lot of work
on robotics for house cleaning and even
there without you know kind of
disclosing anything that I shouldn't
it's fair to say that this is not going
to happen they're you know very near
future yeah I guess for something that
is truly able to clean a house to the
extent that a human cleaner can do to me
that feels more like 20 or more right
and maybe your opinions differ a bit
that seems very very difficult to me and
speak to what the difficulties are I
don't know what your home's like but
I've got a one-year-old at home and our
floor is strewn with a variety of very
unlikely objects at more or less all
times of the day it's very difficult for
a robot to navigate that kind of floor
and if you think about the type of
cleaning tasks that are acquired so in a
house human cleaner can distinguish a
dirty plate which is required to be
cleaned from
hot plant which contains dirt but is not
to be cleaned
that's quite subtle right I mean that's
something that while we take for granted
would have to be hard-coded or learnt by
an algorithm in a way that I don't think
is possible with the state yard so yeah
I think that's still some way away okay
so now on to some of our own work on
this topic so of course being a machine
learning person what I was thinking is
well maybe we can use the machine
learning algorithm to tell us what
machine learning algorithms are likely
to be able to do so back in 2013 I
started a collaboration with an
economist in Augsburg Iran told us about
told me about this some fantastic
dataset that's available for the u.s.
called own it so own it makes available
120 detailed descriptions of skill
requirements for around 900 different
occupations and the only only use 700
but that's neither here nor there so to
give you some example of the type of
data books available these are the level
of occupations that we have so
accountants and auditors are one tax
preparers or another and for each of
those occupations we have those 120
numbers a vector of 120 lengths each
element is between 0 and 100 and tells
us about the requirement for things like
persuasion or originality social
perceptiveness finance and we thought
that these things were exactly the kind
of features that might be predictive of
a job susceptibility to automation so to
be absolutely clear about what our
research question was we were trying to
predict whether or not a job was
automatable at least not even more
precisely most or all of its tasks were
automatable
by the year 2030 so what that is not
saying is that this job will be
automated of course that question
requires you to think about all the
other things that are going on in the
economy you know demographic changes
changes in the patterns of trade the
relative cost of algorithm and human all
that stuff we were just thinking about
what is the technological scope of
automation of
just to be absolutely clear and done so
the way we proceeded was to hold a
workshop in Oxford bringing together
robotics and machine learning people who
labeled 70 of these occupations as being
either automatable or not according to
that definition and then we used a
Gaussian process classifier because
that's high role to predict the
probability of automation for all
occupations including those in the
training set right because we wanted to
ensure that we weren't just slavishly
following labels that were provided we
wanted to correct in some cases that
mistaken beliefs of some of the experts
given what was observed more broadly
okay so now on to my first quiz of today
so what I'd like you to guess is what
our numbers produced for the automate
ability of insurance underwriters
in the US and you've got four options
you know is the question clear right
someone who decides how much to charge a
particular customer for their particular
you know the premium to be assigned to a
particular customer to their insurance
or whether or not to you know give them
insurance at all okay so have a think
about that
let's have hands in the air on three
three two one hands up in the air please
okay so most people are not very
optimistic about the prospects for
insurance underwriters and our algorithm
absolutely agreed with you so the
probability it gave was 99 percent and
what I thought I might just show is the
historical data for employment for this
particular occupation in the US so the
x-axis is time from 1985 to 2015 the
y-axis has two bits to it the red is the
share of employment in the u.s. that is
the fraction of workers in this
occupation the blue dotted curve is the
absolute numbers of workers in this
occupation the size of the pie in the
has undergone sustained growth that is
there are more people in the US and
there are more people working so you
kind of expect the blue curve to
continue to go up the red curve gives
the kind of relative magnitude so what
we're seeing here is that actually there
hasn't been big job growth in insurance
underwriters but at the same time there
hasn't been a big shock perceivable in
the data yet but to me this is kind of
evidence of you know Archer for defense
for our chosen methodology so one thing
we've also done is to just take these
numbers and extrapolate
predict out the year 2030 what the
employment numbers where for all these
different occupations but to me that
kind of misses the really interesting
things right like we haven't necessarily
seen the impact of autonomous vehicle
technology and the employment numbers
just yet but we're pretty sure it's
gonna come so to me that's you know
argument for why we took the approach we
did better anyway next Queens and what
is the probability of automatic ability
for mechanical engineers in the US so
hopefully everyone knows what a
mechanical engineer does okay maybe a
bit more debate here let's give it a
couple seconds to contemplate
all right hands in the air on three two
one up in the air please that's quite
interesting so there's a bit of
disagreement here so some people are
saying threes and fours others are
saying ones and twos and okay so the
answer according to our algorithm is
actually one which is interesting so
we'll come to why that is maybe a little
out of it and one argument for why
Mechanical Engineers got quite a low
score just a sec sorry is that for this
occupation the originality score was
quite high and our algorithm learnt that
originality was actually quite
protective of a jobs automate ability
you know that was the one of most
important features for prediction and
question of the bat yeah yeah yeah
excellent question so the question was
are we asking about automating you know
I guess the median mechanical engineer
or the potential mechanical engineer
like all the things that a mechanical
engineer could potentially do it's the
former so we're working on you know the
Bureau of Labor Statistics data from the
US the o-net variables that I showed you
averages across the cohort of
respondents in a survey and that kind of
thing so that's what we're targeting the
median will mean kind of worker which I
could be more precise question is purely
physical jobs that are really purely
cognitive or the ones that most likely
be on
and everything sort of in between our is
leastly likely to be automated so if you
were to do say a dimensionality
reduction on these 30 attributes would
you get something that sort of time
those are the principal components
actually not because I mean we have done
that I mean oh I don't think that's
totally unintuitive but actually having
done kind of feature selection and
dimensionality reduction on this data
the features that come out of most as
most important first and foremost far
and away originality which kind of
chimes without you know prior
expectations of what should be important
that's a kind of a kind of advanced
cognitive skill if you like but the the
skill that was most complimentary to
that was actually assisting in caring
for others rather than anything physical
so there are there are physical skills
in the island data set there are things
like finger dexterity and manual
dexterity that you thought you might be
protective you know if it was really
difficult to automate you know
manipulations sort of tasks but they
didn't seem very helpful in this
particular exercise of course we have to
recognize the limitations of the work
we've done so this was the training set
was one workshop of people in Oxford and
I can say that the labels they gave us
for self consistent that is we
subdivided the training set and you know
got a reasonable and you know trained
test widths we've got a reasonable more
AUC but they could be self consistently
wrong I'll come on to why I don't think
that's necessarily true later but yeah I
mean I that's not to say these other
hypotheses are necessarily wrong either
I think there is something to that
interaction between you know kind of
physical tasks and mental tasks that's
quite difficult
results human players right now yeah so
I think that's absolutely true
but I guess my definition of creativity
requires no sustained innovation in
making multiple big leaves and also it
requires being able to work in follow
structure domains than alphago was so
you know creativity for alphago it was
in the context of selecting which
position on a board to place a stone so
it's a discrete action space you know
exactly what the actions are we've got a
world of flying metric of success you
know whether you win or lose the game
and also you've got quite a big dataset
in fact you can generate more training
data by playing the algorithm against
itself I think that's quite different
from the kind of things that human
workers are paid to do along the lines
of creativity so you know in the work
that we do writers in designing new
algorithms I'm a little skeptical that
we're going to see algorithms that can
automate the entire work of machine
learning scientist any time soon
and skeptical even that algorithms can
necessarily replace all the work that
you know with journalists is despite the
advances that we've made in roadway
journalism and some of the routine stuff
can be done but the thought pieces you
know that real understanding of human
society and culture I think is a long
way away so you know as I say that there
is this spectrum of what is possible
certainly some algorithmic creativity is
possible wherever you have that large
training set wherever you have this
structuring the task where I don't see
creativity immediately being automated
in less structured and less well-defined
tasks and question
yeah so the the question was about the
extent to which some of the resistance
to automation might be due to the
inability of current state-of-the-art
algorithms to provide verification and
certification of how they arrived at a
decision and I think that's a hugely
important topic actually and that's
something that I think you know the
machine learning community could
actually do more towards if we actually
want to put these algorithms to real
work all that said I think we do find
ways of getting around those kinds of
limitations in some places and you know
it's not clear at least to me when that
is an important consideration and when
it's not so in you know piloting an
aeroplane for instance it's a hugely
important consideration despite the
aptitude of algorithms for that task
they haven't been deployed because we
seem to demand this level of safety and
security that's perhaps even greater
than what a human pilot could actually
provide as in the example of Air France
disasters where the human pilot was
ultimately to blame in other cases we
don't seem to care so much about the
algorithm meeting all the requirements
of a human decision-maker so sales is
one example I guess even in making
medical decisions you know some of these
things are being put into practice now
despite not being as interruptible as a
human decision maker so it's a fusion
the important topic I don't claim to
understand it fully where that will and
won't prove a bottleneck to actually
introducing automation but I absolutely
agree something as a machine learning
community we should be focusing on
developing okay so and
back to mechanical engineers if there
are no further questions so um here's
the employment trend for mechanical
engineers just to round that out okay so
now on to a longer list of different
occupations that we considered so that
table care has three columns the
occupation is in the first the middle
column are the labels from the training
set for a selected number of occupations
one means that it was labeled as being
automatable zero means it was labeled as
being non relatable and me and you can
see on the basis of those labels the
algorithm gave out numbers that seemed
relatively in line with intuition so the
algorithm said that data entry cares
were highly automated ball as we're tax
preparers interestingly umpires and
referees were highly automated and when
you think about it I mean a lot of that
is really routine decision making and I
know in my favorite sport of cricket
there's been a lot of introduction of
technology and making decisions then if
we look at the occupations that are non
relatable we see examples like
choreographers lawyers here to be clear
this is the kind of trial where there
are other occupations that correspond
more to that little assistant paralegals
sort of work and they do indeed come out
as more automatable financial analysts
as somewhere in the middle but I wanted
to flag up some surprises that came out
of this analysis so one such surprise
was waiters and waitresses so in the
workshop participants labeled it as
being non automatable and what we were
thinking about there was the no extent
to which waiter or waitress must sort of
try to persuade the customer to buy a
slightly bigger meal or slightly more
expensive wine and that kind of
requirement for small talk all that kind
of thing but actually of course as I
showed at the beginning of the talk that
actually have now been some technologies
put to those sort of an the CEOs tablet
is indeed replacing some of the tasks of
the waiter or waitress so you know these
labels were produced in 2013
since then perhaps the predictions of
the algorithm have been borne out to
some degree another example I wanted to
flag out was that
so my co-author as I mentioned Cal Frey
is an economist and he was quite keen
that economists were in the training set
as an example of a non erodible
occupation as you can see the
probability the algorithm came up with
was pretty close to 5050
so I'll leave it to your own judgement
there yeah okay um all right so now on
to slicing and dicing the results that
came out a number of different ways to
me probably the most alarming finding of
our work was the following so what we
set out to do was to link the
probability of automate ability to two
different measures of skill so the
probability of automate ability on
either of these plots is on the x-axis
on the top y-axis we've got the fraction
of workers in an occupation you have at
least a bachelor's degree so the higher
up the y-axis the better educated and
occupation is on average on the bottom
y-axis we've got the average median wage
in an occupation and what you can see is
that there's a in other case a
relatively clear negative trend so
simply put the more skilled and
occupation is the less likely they are
to be automated according to our
analysis so I mentioned that was
alarming and to me it's alarming because
you know this kind of ties into other
developments we've seen in the
exacerbation of inequality across the
developed world so what this threatens
is that as these technologies start to
take root take root in the economy the
people who will be replaced or exactly
those workers whose skills are perhaps
not up to the task of finding new work
whatever it is that's created given that
our expectations are that new workers I
could be more high skilled and I'll
speak to that new working same but um
this was the kind of headline figure
that attracted most attention from our
work so I'm to interpret this plot again
the probability of automate ability is
on the x-axis so that further to the
right the more automatable you are the
y-axis
is employment meaning the number of jobs
and so what we've done is take the
entirety of US employment all the jobs
in the US and turned it into if you like
a lasagna stratified in two layers by
the sector of employment which the
different colors everything from
management to transportation and then
we've kind of squished the lasagna apps
according to its probability of
computerization so I'm yeah if you like
the total area under this pot is total
employment in the u.s. if that helps so
you know take a moment to inspect the
plot and see and see which kind of
figures sorry which kind of occupations
most likely to see themselves under
threat from automation those that seem
to be most at risk fall into for
instance transportation material moving
occupations so you know those autonomous
vehicles technologies might have impact
there so I know there are 700,000
workers in the u.s. today in what's
known as the industrial truck and
tractor operator occupation so that's
not necessarily intercity driving this
is people who for instance drive
forklifts so these are really quite
structured occupations that are likely
to you know relatively imminently come
under threat from autonomous vehicle
technologies and we also see production
occupations
that's manufacturing work coming under
threat that's not very surprising offer
some administrative support that kind of
routine clerical work that I was talking
about robotic robotic process of motion
automating also sales occupations and
service occupations so that's service
pink stripe is a little bit alarming
because actually one of the most
sustained engines of job growth in the
last decade or so has been in the
service sector so if that goes away
there could be some them fairly
unpleasant consequences on the left hand
side of the pods we see the occupations
that are least likely to be automated so
this includes management occupations
Computer Engineering and science
occupations education legal
health care it's all of these
occupations I would argue to at least
one some degree have one or more of
those bottlenecks that I mentioned
before but then kind of headline figure
here that most people focused on was the
fact that 47 percent of current US
employment was a high risk of automate
ability over this 20-year horizon which
is a you know a reasonable chunk but um
I thought it might be interesting to
then reproduce that analysis for a range
of different countries so we did it for
a few different countries ourselves we
did it for the UK we did it for Japan
and then other authors have taken the
approach and run with it reproduced it
for more or less every country in the
world at this point including a range of
developing nations
so my next quiz asks you to predict
which of these four developing nations
has the highest fraction of its current
workforce at high risk of automate
ability so this may be a tougher
question take a couple minutes to
consider interesting please do discuss
with your neighbors if you would like I
mean
okay everyone okay I can see some of you
are eager to have their opinions known
so maybe you could have a first stab at
this on accounts of three players hands
in the air with the option that you
think is correct let's get a survey of
the audience three two one hands in the
air okay so I'm seeing a few fours some
twos someone's there's fair amount of
divergence in the audience so according
to our analysis in fact the correct
answer was three Ethiopia right so to
dig into that a little bit it might be
difficult to see but obviously you'll
get access to these slides later and
this is the list of all countries that
was considered all developing nations on
the x-axis this is the fraction of
workers in that country that are high
risk of automate ability Ethiopia sits
right over to the right there the reason
for that is basically that 90% of
Ethiopian workers still work in
agriculture so you know these are
occupations that in the developed world
have already been automated right you
know there was this agricultural
revolution in the 20th century which
I'll turn to in a bit
which basically eliminated all those
jobs in the US and the UK Ethiopia is
just not yet caught up so if that
technology is really put to work you
know a lot of those jobs will come under
threat and returning to that theme of
you know the exacerbation that is
potentially of inequality that seems to
hold up even at a cross national level
as well so what we've got here on the
x-axis is the fraction of a country's
employment which is at high risk and on
the y-axis the 2014 GDP per capita in
USD for those different nations and you
can see a kind of negative trend there
so in fact Ethiopia sits right out to
the right it's a very poor country and
you know it seems to me that the poorest
countries are indeed those that are
potentially most affected by automation
so of course the the obvious rejoinder
to that is that well
you know you don't have to pay if you
open workers that much right so you know
will it actually make economic sense to
deploy a robot to do that job and it's a
good argument but what I would say is
that increasingly the kind of
technologies we're seeing are driven by
software and as we all know software has
essentially zero marginal cost that is
once you've written the software once
can be reproduced for almost nothing and
so I think as competitive market
pressures are brought to bear on these
kinds of problems we will see a lot of
software solutions that are placing work
delivered very very cheaply so I think a
lot of these occupations will be
automated even if the current workers
aren't paid that much maybe not those
Ethiopian farmers but in many other
occupations at least
ya know a fair point so the question was
about the other kind of infrastructure
costs associated with the delivering
service and I don't mean to minimize
those but at the same time those are
kind of coming down as well right with
cloud computing for instance also I
think there will be big firms that will
be able to pay these costs I mean some
of the occupations we're talking about
automating accountants and auditors for
instance are very highly paid it's easy
to imagine those infrastructure cost
being a very small fraction of the
current wage for some of the occupations
that are being replaced maybe maybe I
can maybe I was doing a little bit too
longbowmen talking about these
developing nation occupations thanks for
making the point okay so I mentioned
this kind of agricultural revolution
that played out throughout the 20th
century and just put some numbers on
exactly the scale of that phenomenon so
in the year 1900 40 percent of US
workers were engaged in agriculture
which dropped to actually less than 5%
sorry in fact a 2% by the end of the
20th century but nonetheless
didn't seem to be an enormous shock to
unemployment as a result so the
unemployment rate at the beginning of
the 20th century in the u.s. was about
5% at the end of the 20th century was
about 5% and you know a lot of people
look at the historical record and say
well actually historically we seem to
have been pretty good at coming up with
new uses for human labor even as
technology has automated away different
types of work so I guess one core
question is will these new technologies
threaten that historical pattern of
human labor outracing if you like the
advance of technology and I've got my
own answers to that but we'll come to so
this is a plot for the UK which took our
numbers of the automate ability of UK
occupations and then related it to what
had actually happened in those
occupations over the last 15 years more
precisely from the year 2000 to 2015 so
the probability of automate ability
again is on the x axis on the y axis
it's the change in employment and those
occupations and what we see is actually
that that historical story seems to have
been borne out to some degree so there
have been 3.5 million jobs created in
occupations though we identified as
being at low risk of automate ability
and only 800,000 jobs lost in
occupations that we identified as being
at high risk of what an ability so
adding those two numbers together you
see actually there has been net job
growth in the UK so I think you know
there will potentially continue to be
such job growth but again I think the
risk here is not one of mass joblessness
but of that exacerbation of inequality
because it is exactly those occupations
that we identified as being in high risk
which as I said was kind of linked to
low skill that have seen job losses even
over the last 15 years without the full
force half
writings to give one example having been
you know brought to the labor market
second question yeah absolutely true I
don't think it is because we haven't got
that much well we haven't had a lot of
success in increasing education levels
in the developed world so so the
fraction of the population that's got a
tertiary education is kind of flatlined
for last decades about 50% oh sorry
that's high school education similar for
tertiary ed that's sorry I'm getting my
facts mixed up that is for tertiary
education about 50% similar for high
school education at about 90% and
despite all the money that's been thrown
into tertiary education thrown into high
school education
we don't seem to have been able to lift
up the bottom end of the distribution to
higher degrees of skill I'm relatively
skeptical of our ability to continue to
realize much societal benefits from
rescaling in education I don't see
necessarily at being a total and cause
to abandon I think we do want to think
about education but I don't think it's
the silver bullet solution either so
maybe some of that's in this data but I
don't think it's a big component I think
the biggest component actually is in the
UK's case immigration more than anything
else with high school workers moving to
occupy and particularly professional
occupations I moved to the UK to occupy
a professional occupation for instance I
think that's a large part of what their
data shows
yeah absolutely the UK is different from
North America of course yeah that's a
whole nother topic I mean I I haven't
dug into this data in particular to be
able to give you the the in-depth answer
I would like I guess my major point is
just that that upskilling I think it's
dangerous to focus too much on that
upscaling basically as a solution to the
problems that automation poses because
even with the best education system in
the world there are going to be some
people who are left behind right yeah
that is true this is beyond the 20th
century of course yeah and let me speak
to the new work topic which maybe will
give us some further answers to this so
the first and obviously there have been
new forms of work created and the first
thing to talk about is entirely new
types of occupations that have been
delivered in part by technological
change so I can see a few giggles this
is
linkedin's list of new occupations that
have been created it's a weird wonderful
list it includes iOS developers
alongside Zumba instructors data
scientists flipping over the slide we
also get Beachbody Coaches and
Service Specialists so I don't mean to
minimize this effect there will be
entirely new types of work that are very
difficult for us to predict today that
are created in fact by a technology but
one thing I would say is that even in
these occupations there hasn't yet been
enormous amounts of job growth so the
the job figures you can kind of see in
the slide they're not enormous right
these are not necessarily big employers
just yet and that's borne out in other
ways to slice what's going on in the US
over the last few decades so these are
some really quite interesting numbers
and they're produced by an Geoffrey Lynn
and my co-author Khafre so what these
numbers show is the fraction of the US
workforce that has engaged in new
industries by decade so in particularly
the first number 8.2 percent says that
eight to eight point two percent of
workers at the end of the 1980s were
employed in industries that didn't exist
at the beginning of the 1980s in the
1990s that figure dropped to four point
four percent so the new industries that
were created didn't seem to be as
helpful in generating job growth after
the 2000s that number has dropped to
just half of one percent and you might
think well the u.s. is a big in charge
in this place even in Silicon Valley
that number is 1.8 percent for the 2000s
so to me this speaks to the fact that
for all the hype about the tech industry
it's not a replacement for say General
Motors right the tech industry is not
generating jobs that are scale
sufficient to replace what has come
before it
so to give some numbers on that you know
whatsapp was bought out by Facebook at a
point which would have 55 employees its
valuation at that point was 19 billion
u.s. so there's a bit arbitrary a bit to
take
a company of similar valuation gap the
fashion retailer also worth about 19
billion u.s. has 137 thousand employees
so I'm a little bit skeptical that you
know these new industries these new
forms of work are going to be the
replacement to the woes here nonetheless
it's important to say just looking at
you know the number of jobs there's only
a partial metric of whether or not
things have gotten better or worse and
to that I think this is a really
important plot I'd like to show you the
fraction of people who are employed as
laundresses
in private US households in hundreds as
a function of time all the way from 1850
to the 1990s so you can see as the u.s.
got wealthier there was this big spike
in employment in long dresses
and then in 1910 there was a patent
granted for the very first electric
washing machine and then there was this
precipitous decline in employment for
long dresses so one way of looking at
that is to say oh it was a disaster
right these jobs were removed but Lord
you know being a laundress was not a
pleasant occupation and it required you
know dragging clothes out to the nearest
river or in other cases bringing water
into the home in order to wash clothes
by hand which was an enormous Lee you
know manually intensive and unpleasant
sort of task and once these technologies
truly were able to release long dresses
from their work and tied into a wide
variety of other technological
developments this was part of them that
what enabled women to enter the
workforce in the West right which it's
impossible to consider as anything but
an enormous boon to society as a whole
so you know I think there has to be some
caution in interpreting job numbers um
you know alone we do need to consider
their characteristics of a job as well
and what that means for the quality of
work and
impacts on the society at large so my
next slide is a plot from our world and
data if you haven't checked out our
world and data I would really encourage
you to do so it's a web publication
deployed by the history of New York
economic thinking in particular by Max
Rosa who's a colleague in the Oxford
Martin School in Oxford in fact he works
on the same floor as me so this is a
plot of the household income of
different strata in the u.s. population
distribution so the more blue an
occupation is the higher up it is in the
distribution of household income and the
more red it is the lower dips in that
distribution and the story you see here
pretty clearly is that household incomes
for the kind of lowest paid workers have
basically stagnated there was a bit of a
spike up in the late 1990s but since
then the story has been actually of
declining wages for the bottom part of
the distribution and you know even
looking further back it wasn't all that
much job goes through the 80s or early
90s either
so really the winners of the last four
decades have been the top income earners
right so it's the people who are already
earning the most to kind of realize the
value delivered by technological change
and the other developments in society
and returning to that historical
question about us always being able to
create new forms of work this this bears
up even if we kind of look way further
back in in history so this is another
amazing plot from our world and data
which considers the fraction of income
paid in the UK well in England and Wales
actually and I think only from 1918 the
United Kingdom but you know broadly the
same region the fraction of income
that's pay
to the top 5% of individuals so
obviously the higher out of that number
is the more unequal societies if you
like a larger fraction of the pie is
carved off by the most well-paid and
it's interesting because this data
captures the English Industrial
Revolution right which kicks off maybe
somewhere about here and keeps going
right into the 19th century so this was
a time of more or less unprecedented
technological change in which there were
enormous increases in productivity in
which new forms of work were being
created all over the place but
nonetheless the value that was delivered
from those technologies wasn't captured
by the workers themselves so actually
despite those enormous increases in
productivity the winners seem to be the
top 5% right this line is actually going
up so by some estimates it took
something like 70 years after the onset
of the Industrial Revolution for workers
in England to see any rise in real wages
at all so you know I think when people
say well you know we've always kind of
got through technological change in the
past you have to consider that it wasn't
always easy and it wasn't always to the
benefit of everyone so the only reason
we got through the English Industrial
Revolution was with quite seismic
structural and institutional change so
to give just one example there was a
band put on child labour that prevented
some of the more exploitative aspects of
that Industrial Revolution in the
agricultural revolution in the 20th
century the farm states in the US were
really the driving force between
Universal secondary education because of
course it was there and their children
effectively who were being put out of
work by the advances in technology and
they wanted to see you know increased
education to let them move into a new
kind of office work that was created so
I think we are probably going to need to
think about changes of that sort of
scale
to manage what I see is similar
magnitude changes in technology that are
ahead okay so just to conclude I thought
I'd have some actual maths you know this
is a machine of deep learning summer
school after all but my favorite type of
maths is you might have guessed
yesterday is decision theory so the
particular decision I want to consider
is that of a firm who is considering
whether or not to invest in automating a
particular occupation so the game they
play is well we can spend some money to
try and produce technology to automate
this occupation and then there's a coin
flip which is whether or not they do
actually succeed whether or not the
occupations automatable if they succeed
the reward is the total number of
workers in their occupation and times
the the wage the average wage in that
occupation so they kind of carve off
some fraction of the total wage bill for
that occupation if they succeed so I've
actually run those numbers for our
analysis and it may not come as a
surprise that accountants and auditors
were top of the list but um I think this
way of thinking also gives a useful
framework for predicting what's going to
happen in the future and this is my
final slide it's in some ways inspired
by Ryan evidence to my mind excellent
book the wealth of humans from last year
so what he points to is a trial lemma of
automation which is that if you consider
the characteristics of a job
looking ahead it's probably only going
to have two of three desirable
characteristics that is it could be
numerous there could be lots of workers
in that job it could be non automatable
and it could be well-paid but it's
probably not going to be all three so
the reasons that are you know kind of
obvious at least in this clinical sort
of analytical framing in that if there
is a job that is very well-paid
creates a lot of employment that is a
huge target right for anyone who is
trying to automate it so accountants and
auditors you know in some centers there
it's going to require a bit of work to
do but because the pie is so big because
there are so many people who do a high
paid occupation there are going to
people there going to be people who try
and automate that job at the same time
there could be jobs that are non
automatable and well-paid
so to photo myself in some of the
audience may be machine learning
scientists or Molson but they're
probably not gonna be that numerous
because you know these are jobs that are
sort of you know again maybe flattering
here the top end of the school
distribution according to that analysis
that I showed earlier so they're not
necessarily going to be big engines of
job growth like the tech sector is not
proved to be a big engine of job growth
and the final thing that we could see is
a whole load of jobs that are non
automatable but unnecessarily well-paid
and to me this is the story of the kind
of rise of the service sector so they're
probably going to continue to be people
like dog washers or you know gardeners
to take another example that are non
erodible but they're not necessarily
going to be well-paid and to me the
reason for that is that they require
things that are knowledge made well but
they require relatively commodity level
human skill so the kind of things that
to some degree most people can do
they're not necessarily going to be
well-paid as they're as a result so
that's the kind of gloomy scenario
nicely ahead and there are going to be
real challenges to inequality that
result from this and as I said earlier I
think the answers line coming out with
new institutional responses we are going
to have to rethink how we you know
distribute income perhaps how we're
doing education in order to tackle these
you know
quite profound changes thanks very much
for attention at this point I'm very
happy to take questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
