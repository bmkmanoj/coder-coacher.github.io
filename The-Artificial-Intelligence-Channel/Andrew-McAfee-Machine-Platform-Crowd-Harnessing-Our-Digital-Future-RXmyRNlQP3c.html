because we had this vague sense that
well that a lot of things were changing
that technology was changing the world
very rapidly and in particular it was
changing the business world in ways that
I didn't completely understand and I
wanted to learn more about so Erik and I
went out we hit the road we talked to
our favorite alpha geeks and tried to
internalize what they were telling us
compared that to lots of different
literature and lots of different things
that we kind of read and we believed and
and this book wound up being the result
of that I don't think I'm a great book
title originator though because as I was
thinking about it if I could do it again
I would not title the book machine
platform crowd I think there are two
problems with that one is it gives away
the contents of the book way way too
quickly so you don't really need to buy
it or read it anymore the other problem
is it's not quite punchy enough and
honestly if I could retitle the book
this I would call it um business advice
that I don't believe anymore and what I
mean by that I'm deadly serious
there is a set of guidance that we
business school people have been
teaching our students and trying to pass
on to the world that got built up over
the course of the industrial era and I
think it was pretty well aligned to that
industrial era as we move deeper and
deeper into this crazy technological
future I think the business PlayBook
that we're putting out is getting
misaligned is actually in some cases
turning into bad advice and becoming
quite counterproductive so I want to
talk about some business advice that's
kind of long-standing I think in some
cases pretty well-established and I
don't buy it nearly as much anymore and
I want to talk about it in three main
levels the first one is just the level
of getting stuff done executing all the
processes inside our organizations and
if I could summarize the current state
of guidance about this it's pretty
straightforward like clearly let the
machines do the arithmetic and the
record-keeping and handle the basic the
routine transactions but there are still
a huge amount of judgment calls that
need to happen inside organizations
that's where we need the human minds and
their experience and their intuition and
everything let the people make the
judgment calls give all the routine work
over to
machines and you see this over and over
again when you read bits books about
business all kinds of former CEOs write
books that they have some variation of
the title you know how I led from the
gut when I was young business school
faculty this was the book that we
learned how to teach from the idea is
that we're educating our students to
refine their judgment and then they're
just business book titles just say
judgment this is what we need to do is
we need to be good at this is what's
gonna separate winners from losers all
of these are examples of a style of
making important decisions and
predictions and calls about the future
that I see over and over again in the
business world called decision making by
hippo and does anyone know what this
acronym stands for this is my new
favorite business acronym it stands for
highest paid person's opinion and as
we've looked around it's honestly how a
lot of businesses make a lot of their
decisions these days and they're
typically in a hippo based decision
process it's kind of fascinating how it
plays out
there is an analysis team so there's
some team of geeks that crunches some
numbers and they kind of tee them up to
the hippo and the hippo takes all that
geeky analysis into account and then but
also applies their experience and their
judgment their gut and their wisdom and
their credentials and all the things
that got them to that hippo stage and
the hippo makes their tough judgement
call from the gut and the team salutes
and says thank you hippo and off they go
and do that stuff the hippo has a mortal
enemy inside the organization and the
mortal enemy of the hippo is the geek
and what I mean by this is somebody who
takes a very different approach to
making an important decision or making
an important call about the future or
the direction of the company they don't
second-guess the evidence they try to
tee up the analysis they try to do it as
crisply and honestly as possible and if
the results of it don't correspond to
their judgment they don't overrule the
analysis they don't overrule what the
evidence and the data are telling them
they go follow it and it's a
categorically different style than the
hippo based style of making a decision
which is analysis is valuable but
honestly we mean we're going to go with
what my gut says
the geek says I have a gut I have
judgment I have intuition like everybody
else I'm trying hard to let that stuff
not dominate to get that out of the way
and let the evidence in the day to speak
what's fascinating is that there's a ton
of research about what happens in a fair
head-to-head competition between a hippo
style of decision making and a geek
style of decision making this was a
paper that we came across when we were
writing the book this is an amazing
piece of research because this team
scoured the literature and they found
136 different peer-reviewed studies
published that would qualify as a fair
head-to-head competition between a geeky
style of making a decision follow the
evidence and a hippo style rely on the
the highest paid person's opinion the
alleged expert out there and these 136
studies were in areas that we should
care a great deal about these were
inconsequential areas what medical
condition does this patient have which
of these suppliers should our company
work with which of these students will
be successful in school these are pretty
important decisions the team was able to
break them down into three main
categories cases where the hippos were
clearly better higher decision quality
because they could measure that cases
where the geeky approach was clearly
better and a toss-up category in the
middle or is like a statistical tie when
I read the paper I was pretty blown away
to learn that 48 percent of the time the
hippos were doing no better than the
geeks this judgment this expertise the
gut that the hippos had built up over
time was adding no value over purely
following what the evidence was telling
people that was amazing more amazing me
by far 46 percent of the time the hippos
were subtracting value they were
arriving at worse decisions or
predictions or tough calls then purely
following what the evidence would take
you and taking a very geeky approach
that left the hippos batting about 0.059
over the course of this season which is
what I desperately hope the Yankees bat
for the remainder of the 2017 season in
my world like Yankee and hippo or almost
parallel words and we need to not do
that
so my conclusion from all of this I read
research like this and I wonder why
hippos are thrive and they're still so
fat inside organizations part of our
mission should be to make the hippo an
endangered species the one thing I want
to point out all 136 studies here we're
done in the era of small data it is
remarkable how little data you need to
be able to do better than the hippo at
the hippos alleged area of expertise we
are not in the era of small data anymore
we're in the era of over crazy firehose
of data on all these different things
that we'd like to make decisions about
and our toolkit for analyzing that data
has gone from pretty good to
astonishingly good basically in the past
five years and this is the way that I
understand this surge that we're seeing
in artificial intelligence and machine
learning these these phrases that we
keep hearing these are about using
massive amounts of data to make really
really good decisions and really really
good judgments even in very very
difficult circumstances and in areas
where up until now we've had to rely on
human beings who've had to rely on
hippos I just don't think that's true
anymore my best example of that how many
of us are aware that the world's best
player of the old Asian strategy game of
Go is no longer a human being it's a
piece of technology how many of us have
we heard that news gesticulate wildly so
I can see alright a few of us have I
need to explain this a little bit go is
a 3,000 year old strategy game played
primarily in East Asia and if you play
go if you know anybody that plays go
they are strategy snobs and they think
that chess is basically like tiddlywinks
if you play go go is a much more
difficult much more subtle game in
almost every sense of the word here's
the really important thing computers
have been terrible at playing go
laughably bad a couple years ago no
computer program could stand up to a
decent amateur player let alone a
professional go player this is
categorically different than chess where
for 20 years now since 1997 the world's
best chess player has been a piece of
technology
since 97 the gap between digital
performance and human performance in
chess has only gotten bigger and that
gap now is so big that they asked a
human Grandmaster a little while back
how he would prepare for a match against
a computer in chess and he said I'd
bring a hammer go was night and day
different computers were laughably bad
at playing go up until out of the blue
last spring this machine learning system
called alphago developed by a company
called deep mind
sat down with a south korean guy named
Lisa doll and cleaned his clock four
games to one in a five-game match this
was completely weird
it was completely unanticipated the
right way to think about Lisa doll he's
kind of like he's the David Ortiz the
LeBron James of the game of Go just this
weird talent that comes along once in a
generation he got beat handily by this
piece of technology in a domain where up
until very recently technologies had
been not making any inroads at all
really bad against top-level humans so
that was weird enough I think there's a
story behind the story that I actually
learned after we finished the book that
makes me think we're even deeper into
this territory where the geeks and their
tools are doing amazing things and I
want to tell you that story to do that I
need to give you a tiny little bit of go
strategy go is like chess and that there
are classic openings and you study these
openings when you're learning to play
the game well if you grab a go textbook
you see lots of diagrams like this
because it shows smart opening moves
early moves in the game of Go and it's
easy to explain you'll notice all of
these early stones are either on the one
two three third row in or the one two
three four the fourth row in from the
edge if you place your early stones on
the third row in what you're essentially
signaling is I'm playing for the
periphery I think this game will be won
and lost around the edges of the board I
think I can beat you there I'm playing
for the periphery if you place your
stones on the fourth row in your
signaling I'm playing for that big open
heartland of the board I can beat you
there I think I'm better than you I want
the game to unfold there if you make any
other move
early on in the game of go what you are
signaling is I am NOT a very good go
player and your teacher will slap your
wrist and you'll get sent back to school
on you that you just don't do that early
on I'm about to show you one of the
craziest things that happened in the
match between alphago and Lisa doll you
can find screen grabs of this very
easily all over the internet because
move 37 in the second game of the match
shook the world of go to its foundations
you think I'm kidding I'm actually not
kidding about that I mean look for
yourself you can see the craziness right
this is just this is nutty territory
that we're in let me explain a little
bit alphago is playing black in this
case and it's early in the game and
alphago is making the 30s is placing the
37th stone of the game and this is what
it does it places that stone on the one
two three four fifth row in in kind of
the middle of nowhere on the board and
I'm not kidding you can go find internet
commentary about this move in any
language that you want to listen to and
you'll hear the commentators freaked out
because this makes no sense you don't
play the game of gold like this so
they're scratching their heads is there
a bug in the program all My heavens what
happened alphago ken went on and won
that game and what we think we don't
know for sure what we think is alphago
is actually able to look far enough
ahead in that game and realize there
were a lot of possible futures for which
that stone placed in that very strange
part of the board was actually going to
be important and actually contribute to
victory this is beyond what top level
human goal players are typically able to
do I don't think this is the only domain
where this is going to be the case we
need to keep in mind people have been
playing go and studying it intently for
3,000 years and we've built up this body
of knowledge and wisdom and lore about
how to play this game that book is being
torn up and rewritten by technological
progress very quickly I think about
these other domains that we've been
studying very intently and where
performance is really important
investing genetics
nanotechnology millech
science materials all these really
really complicated things where our
human knowledge and our progress has
taken us up to this level I think what
we're gonna learn because of machine
learning and other new technologies is
how much room there is left on top of
that to perform at a much higher level
we're seeing that in the game of Go I
think we're gonna see it over and over
my conclusion and the way we're
rewriting the business PlayBook simply
machines now are demonstrating excellent
judgment and I think they're gonna
continue to get better at that at the
level of the company when I think about
what my fellow business school faculty
and I have been trying to teach
companies for 20 or 25 years we sound
like personal trainers because we just
keep telling companies to strengthen
their core just keep working on their
core you can go find all kinds of
articles in Harvard Business Review
about the core competence the core
capability the core product core of your
corporation and the advice is pretty
simple there's a small set of things
that you do that realize value and lead
you to success in your market places get
really good at those things the rest of
the peripheral get rid of it outsource
it whatever at the core you had better
build up your course which the strongest
core out there and that's how you're
gonna realize advantage I don't think
the core this idea of a core is now
worthless but what is wild is what
happens not when you strengthen your
core but when you reach out to the crowd
and buy the crowd here I honestly just
mean the billions of random weirdo
strangers available via the internet
these days because when you can tap into
the energy and the knowledge and the
tenacity and the wisdom of the crowd
some crazy things happen I want to give
you my favorite example of that this was
a great study that my buddy Karim
Lakhani who teaches at Harvard Business
School did a while back he worked with
the National Institutes of Health to try
to see if we could improve the
sequencing of the genomes of human white
blood cells the National Institutes of
Health I would call right in the core of
the American medical establishment and
they had a baseline method for doing
this that worked at about 4 and 1/2
hours and was something like 72 percent
accurate is that good is that bad
can we do better but hard to say how do
we know how good this is there is a
researcher here at Harvard Medical
School who improved pretty substantially
in that performance so they got the time
down from four hours to one hour got the
accuracy up above 75% all right that's
not an incremental improvement that's
pretty big the question was can we do
even better than that and Kareem worked
with an organization called top coder
that assembles a crowd of gigs and gets
them working on really tough problems
and he posed this problem to that crowd
in a two-week competition gave them a
benchmark to shoot for our game a bunch
of data to work with and said see how
much better you can do in two weeks this
is what the crowd came up with so every
one of those circles is a solution
submitted by somebody out there in the
crowd and you notice a lot of them are
less accurate than the baseline
performance of the core that's not as
interesting every one of those red
circles is really really interesting
because it is simultaneously that
solution is simultaneously faster and
more accurate than anything that the
Corps had been able to come up with the
absolute best circles up they're the
ones farthest up and to the left they
are doing their work in about 10 seconds
as opposed to four hours
that's a thousandfold improvement and
they're up at about 80% accuracy which
appeared to be about as accurate as you
could expect that performance boost is
unbelievable and I when I read this
study I literally I had trouble
believing that I called up Korean was a
friend of mine I said hey man um are you
cherry picking is just the craziest
result you've ever seen he said it's
about average
I said come on he said look I do this
for a living I set up crowd based
competitions against benchmark
performance from the core I've done this
hundreds of times if I don't see quantum
improvement from someone out there in
the crowd I think I've done my work
incorrectly I expect to see this vault
this magnitude this type of improvement
if you can key up a problem for the
crowd to work on a cream and his
colleagues interviewed all those red
circles and they want to know who these
people were
they were primarily young a lot of them
were still students none of them
said they came from life sciences there
was not one computational biologist
among them there was not one geneticist
among them these were geeks from very
very far away disciplines who just
happened to have the right toolkit the
right expertise there were the right
tools to tackle this exact problem and
it just brings up that wonderful quote
from Eric Raymond who's an open source
software advocate he says look with
enough eyeballs all bugs are shallow and
what we're learning is how how truthful
that is how accurate that is and how
much performance boost you get when you
can tee up your problems and get the
crowd to work on them this contest
lasted two weeks the total prize money
offered was $6,000 for this that is
rounding error the National Institutes
of Health spends that on paper clips
every week you get this level of
performance boost from the crowd so
we're starting to see organizations buy
this idea by deeply into this idea of
the wisdom of the crowd and set up some
really interesting new kinds of company
of the rockstars of the investment world
for a while now have been quantitative
hedge funds these companies that just do
algorithmic trading huge volumes of
trades huge volumes of data
super super geeky work the best of them
make just their returns have been
unbelievably large and consistent over
the years
Bloomberg called one of them the the
medallion fund inside Renaissance called
it the greatest money-making machine the
capitalist business world had ever seen
these are rock stars in the investment
world there's a company founded here in
Boston called quant opium that's trying
to do something I find fascinating
they're trying to set up a crowd-sourced
quantitative hedge fund to find the
equivalents of those red circles in the
world of algorithmic quantitative
training and we interviewed the founder
one of the founders of the company and
he had a really interesting thought
experiment he said I've been a
programmer for some of these quanta Jan
Daz far as I could tell they employed in
total about 5,000 quant traders that was
a total population of Quon traders
inside these hedge funds and so he said
I asked myself what are the chances
given what we know about the wisdom of
the crowd
and how disbursed talent actually is
what are the chances those are actually
the 5000 best quant traders out there in
the world and he said when you ask the
question that way the answer is pretty
obvious the answer is it's extremely
unlikely that the Renaissance India Shah
on to Sigma have find the 5000 best
people in the world at this task and
they're all working at those companies
currently John Fawcett who founded
quanto peon said I don't believe that
for a minute I'm gonna set up a company
it's gonna find out who the actual best
people are out there in the world and
then I'm not gonna say be my employee
give me your intellectual property move
to Boston and work in my office none of
that just upload your algorithms if they
work we'll give you capital if they work
really well we'll give you more capital
if they keep working you'll keep getting
capital you can keep some of yourself
and you can participate in this world of
quantitating this way they haven't
launched their fund yet we don't know
how it's doing I don't know if this
exact experiment is gonna succeed or not
but it is fascinating and in the future
I think we're gonna see a lot more
organizations a lot more companies that
instead of trying so hard to build up
this core what they're gonna do from the
start is try to activate reach out get
the energy of a crowd bring them to work
on a tough problem and try and work with
the crowd to harvest and share the good
stuff that results stay tuned so my
conclusion instead of strength in your
court the crowd is surprisingly wise
over and over and over the last piece of
business advice that I want to talk
about is one that I've walked around
believing from my whole career something
that our colleagues at McKinsey say very
clearly is that there is no substitute
for knowing an industry inside and out
of course I believe that you got to be
good at retail in order to succeed at
retail you better be good at consumer
packaged goods or real estate or biology
or men whatever because industries
differ from each other and you need to
know their idiosyncrasies their rules
their peculiarities if you're going to
go succeed in that industry so for
example the classic business advice is
that industry structure is really
important in determining successful
business models and you better know that
structure if you're going to succeed in
an Indus
the global industries for smartphones
for urban transportation and for group
exercise are very very different from
each other
and the same kind of business model is
not going to work across such different
industries that's the old advice I don't
believe it very much anymore because
over in each of these industries and
many others we see something really
interesting happening which is a digital
platform oops I'm sorry could we back up
one a digital platform coming in whoops
I'm sorry now I'm confused that's just
doing this that's just trying to sit in
the middle of an industry create a
digital platform that creates and then
interconnects a bunch of buyers and a
bunch of sellers in the worldwide
smartphone industry all the sellers
aren't just selling devices they're
selling apps and we all get to tap into
that thanks to the iPhone ecosystem or
the Android ecosystem that we've chosen
to participate in that unlocks a huge
amount of value for all of us who owned
a phone the fact that all of us own a
phone unlocks a huge amount of potential
value for all the app creators out there
and when you can do this this really
interesting virtual cycle kicks in and
the platform gets to create and capture
a lot of the value that's generated now
it in the world in the global smartphone
industry it is not the case that Apple
makes all the profits that's not what's
going on
apparently what's going on is that Apple
makes more than all of the profits in
the global smartphone industry this is
an analysis that we came across when
we're writing the book according to this
analysis Apple makes 103 percent of all
the profits in the global smartphone
device industry despite having something
like less than 20% market share
apparently Samsung makes about 1% of the
profits all other players combined
combined to lose 4 percent of the total
profits in there this is a dog industry
this is a huge global fast-growing young
industry it is a dog for everybody
except the platform operators Apple and
Google inside this industry I I've been
studying the business world enough and
you know that if you spend enough time
you become a little bit cynical
right so one thing that I'm used to
seeing is companies talking about their
amazing corporate culture to cover up
their shoddy financial performance you
see that fairly often in the second
industry that I put up there global
transportation the platform that's
changing that industry is doing
something very new and something that I
haven't seen a lot before they're
talking about their amazing financial
performance to detract attention from
their deeply terrible corporate culture
this is what this is where Oberer is
these days they've created this this
messed up this deeply messed up
corporate culture that all their
executives been fired of it what people
are suing them it was a toxic culture
for women's shame on them they created
this lousy company that is dominating
the urban transportation completely
reshaping the urban transportation
industry in less than a decade simply by
building the effective platform that
connects people that want to ride with
people that have a car to offer a ride
massively transformative but my takeaway
from this is not it's okay to build
toxic corporate culture it's a terrible
take away instead what what we're
learning I think from uber is that if
you get the economics and the technology
right you can be forgiven a lot of other
sins for a long time now you still
should not commit those sins that shame
on them but man if you get there if you
get the tech and the economics right
meant lots of good things can happen to
you the last industry that I put up
there was group exercise and when I
started writing the book if anyone had
asked me what's the last industry that
will be transformed by anything digital
I might have said group exercise there's
just something you go to a room workout
you yoga do Tai Chi duplicate a soul
cycle go do that I don't see a lot of
digital there are there any class past
members in the room yes there are I know
in this room there a class plasma oh
this is a way to identify urban
professionals who like to work out like
some variety class pass is a platform
that owns no physical assets that makes
it really interesting proposition what
they say to all of us is look join with
us don't join a gym and on Monday you
can go to spinning on Tuesday you can do
bootcamp take Wednesday off because
you're tired
on Thursday go to yoga at different
studios all over town
we'll give you a space in the class
you'll know what the ratings are you can
sign up online don't worry about paying
it's super easy to the studios classpath
says something really interesting they
say look you know the classes that
you're offering and at least some of
them you've got some empty seats for
every class we will fill them up we'll
fill them up with our members and you
should be willing and we'll pay you for
every member that we that you let into
your class we're gonna pay you a
discounted rate we're not gonna pay you
full fare but you should be willing to
do that to take that deal because some
revenue is better than no revenue for
all those empty seats a lot of studios
are saying you know what that makes a
lot of sense and class passes creating
this really interesting virtuous cycle
between people who want more variety in
their workouts and Studios who have
spare capacity to offer turns out
there's a lot of entities on both side
of that transaction so building a
successful platform is hard and we talk
to the platform builders they stressed
how obsessively you have to work on it
how you've got to get the algorithms
right the user interface right this is
not easy to do but if you can do it a
world of advantages open up the one that
economists love to talk about just
network effects there are more buyers
because all the sellers are there there
are more sellers because all the buyers
are there awesome if you can kick that
in the benefits don't stop there though
if you are the platform operator you
control the user experience in the user
interface I can't tell you the last
maker model of the last five overs that
I hopped into it's irrelevant to me in
fact the language that I just used is
interesting I took an uber that is the
defining characteristic for me you're
also controlling who's in who's out what
are the rules you're curating membership
and you can be as loose or as strict as
you want
you are also letting people tell you
what they want Steve Jobs could not have
identified the hundreds of thousands of
apps out there even a business mind that
good had no idea what people actually
want great let the crowd tell you what
people want sit in the middle control
the rules if you can do all of that you
suddenly have access to this toolkit of
insights from disciplines like
operations research and behavioral
economics that will let you do things
like dynamic pricing like matching
supply and demand on a constant ongoing
basis finding
best match for everybody who's involved
and then finally you can build trust
into transactions that were not
happening because there was not trust
before if somebody had told me just a
decade ago that there would be a large
global fast growing really successful
company with the following proposition
to everybody why don't you go sleep in a
stranger's bedroom halfway around the
world well you got me to what this is
ludicrous this is a great way to have
something very very bad happen to you on
either side of that transaction whether
you're the person in the guest bedroom
or the host of that house this is a
terrible idea
except Airbnb is out there now we talked
to Reid Hoffman who was a legendary
entrepreneur and investor in Silicon
Valley he was an early investor in
Airbnb he heard them talk about their
company in 2007 2008 and Reid wanted to
invest in it he had to take the deal to
his colleagues in his venture capital
firm and he said I had a colleague at
the time who's one of the legends of the
industry this person just made so many
amazing calls it was a giant and he
looked at me when I was talking about
Airbnb and he said hey Reid in our
industry everybody has one catastrophic
failure here's your's
and that trust problem just seemed
insurmountable except that it's not and
what's crazy is these these lightweight
mechanisms like a reputation like a
rating system like this host got 4.8 all
these comments said they were awesome
and this guest seems to not leave behind
you know overflowing trash cans and
things like that that's enough to let
this commerce flourish around the world
so we actually are in very new territory
I now believe that platform economics
determines successful business models
much more than industry structure is so
I want to wrap up you've we've all had a
long day but I want to wrap up just with
three summaries three kind of
distillation of the updated business
advice that Eric and I are trying to put
out there in the world the first one is
that the right the smart division of
labor between minds and machines is
shifting very rapidly
especially thanks to these recent
advances like machine learn
in general that balance is shifting
toward the machines and the stuff that
we used to have to rely on hippos for we
don't have to rely on them for that
anymore the second thing is that a
conservative way to say it is that the
crowd is often more capable than the
core I think that's too conservative I
think the crowd is usually maybe not
always the crowd is usually more capable
than the core and then finally value
creation and value capture are moving
very quickly from a product from a
product centric view of the world to a
platform centered view in the world if
you are stuck in the older mode of
overvaluing Minds overvaluing products
and concentrating too heavily on the
core I think competition is going to be
very unkind to you going forward because
I see a lot of machine forward platform
forward crowd forward innovators and
entrepreneurs and business models out
there that I think are going to be the
dominant ones in this next chapter of
business history let me stop there thank
you very much for having me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
