today killer robots let me set the scene
for a clip were about to play for you
it shows a young man roaming the stage
dressed smart casual but he's not
demonstrating the latest SmartWatch for
tablet instead he has a small device
that looks like a drone laying in his
hand it's not a drone it's an autonomous
weapon it has cameras and sensors and
just like your phones and social media
apps it does facial recognition inside
here is 3 grams of sheep explosive
this is how it works
did you see that that little bag is
enough to penetrate the skull and
destroy the contents they used to say
guns don't kill people people do well
people don't they get emotional disobey
orders aim high
let's watch the weapons make the
decisions now trust me these were all
bad guys selling an autonomous weapon
and AI killer drone using facial
recognition to find its victims then
opening fire it's a fake
by the way a video put together by a UC
Berkeley professor named Stuart Russell
who went to Geneva in November to show
that video to United Nations delegates
attending a conference about AI and
about killer robots autonomous weapons
one of the things that sets Montreal
apart in the AI world one of the things
that's made the city such a draw for
research in for new labs as well is that
there is a focus on ethics and
collaboration and part of that means
looking the obvious military uses of AI
squarely in the face next week next week
rather here in Montreal there will be a
two-day conference it's themed AI on a
social mission Joshua Ben geo is the
keynote speaker at that conference he's
a computer science and operations
research professor at University Dom oh
yeah and he's the scientific director of
miele that's the mantra Institute of
learning algorithms he's really also the
name that keeps coming up when people
talk about the rise of artificial
intelligence research and development in
the city and we'll talk to him about
that as well
yoshua bengio is live in the daybreak
studio professor good morning thank you
for coming in hi good morning it's nice
to meet you killer robots the threat is
real yes and people can underestimate
the the speed at which we can take the
current science and do the engineering
to build those those drones maybe not as
impressive is what we see in that video
but certainly something reachable within
just a few years and so it's really
important
that governments around the world take
steps to ban these kinds of weapons just
as we've banned
nuclear weapons and camping chemical
weapons and landmines for example yet
isn't it likely that it's the
government's that are developing them
yes
some governments yeah the United States
China Russia I have no inside
information but but but let me give you
a counter example to this land mines so
the US and other major countries haven't
signed it already but because there's an
international ban because most countries
in the world have decided to make this
illegal companies in the US have stopped
building land mines because there's
there's a stigma associated to building
those things that everybody around the
world says are immoral but if the if the
Chinese are developing as really they're
trying to can you really ask the
Americans not to just even in
self-defense even if they weren't going
to be the ones that use it first that's
very different so I think we could have
machines that helped us fight groans so
that that's there are different from
developing machines that are gonna be
going and killing people and taking the
decisions to kill that's that's the
crucial thing right it's not that you
know there shouldn't be any weapon I
mean ideally in a world of peace there
will be no weapons but but if if there
are dangers like this we we do need to
protect ourselves but we do need to do
it in a way that doesn't endanger the
general population yeah I just if before
we move on from this could you explain a
little bit more clearly what we mean by
an autonomous weapon a weapon making the
decisions to kill right so imagine a
drone that can find a particular person
because they can recognize their face
from far using image recognition and
then and then target that person get
closer to it and and just you know shoot
and kill and all of that without a human
in the loop saying oh yes this is the
right person and and given the current
context where this is happening this is
really what what some confident has
decided approved dewy I don't approve of
anything even though human doing this
but not having a human means in the loop
means that the more
questions around killing are you know in
the hands of some algorithm which
currently is not able to have a moral
judgment there are other ethical
concerns too artificial intelligence
which you're looking at as well
psychological manipulation artificial
intelligence really does act in the
commercial world or could act even more
aggressively in the future that's right
so right now a big reason for the
success of large companies like Google
and Facebook is that they sell
advertising and they're using AI more
and more to make their advertising
better targeted in other words they the
machines learn by observing people you
know observing you and entering each of
us individually given your particulars
how you know what message should I send
you so that you change your mind about
something and and buy this product so
when it's about buying products maybe
people wouldn't mind too much although
at some point we could feel a little bit
bad about being manipulated but imagine
that it's about changing your mind
regarding politics so political
advertising as we've seen recently with
the u.s. a lot of us and and and others
yes and there is also the concern of an
increased an increasingly potent
surveillance state that's right the same
technology that can recognize your face
to kill you with a killer robot can also
just monitor you track you so imagine a
country where there cameras everywhere
and it's it's quite you know something
that likely to come that's very 1984 I
need right extra big brother
exactly so so that's dangerous for
democracy as well because it would give
too much power to a government that
would be authoritarian so what is the
main message you want to get across when
you are the keynote speaker at the AI
social mission conference so so that's I
would say more on the positive side
because AI could be misused but it
caalso be an amazing
force for good and progress and and not
only used by my companies to develop new
products and services which i think is
super important especially for our
economy but to help people maybe in
education healthcare or humanitarian
applications social I mean people who
are in trouble and and and and who might
not get the help from companies because
if not might not be profitable but but
AI researchers from around the world
have an interest in in working for these
kinds of social good applications you
have worked on a declaration it's coming
out of university that Mallya called the
montreal declaration for a responsible
development of artificial intelligence
can you give us a capsule view of what
that is yes because of the kinds of
issues that we just discussed regarding
the potential misuse of AI it's it's
important that we lay down a few key
principles and this is what we're trying
to do in this declaration so we had a
first list of principles as well as
questions sometimes we don't have the
answers but it's important to ask the
question so that there's a discussion in
the general public the politicians and
that this discussion is not just
something happening within the group of
computer scientists who are developing
these things but it's the general
society that needs to think about these
questions so we we put out a first draft
of the Declaration basically which is
saying that AI should be used for good
and should not be misused and and all of
the things we know about ethics should
come into the decisions that companies
and governments and organizations look
at when when they're using their so what
one thing is original about this
declaration because there's been other
ones like the Asilomar AI declaration
last year is that we want the general
public to to give feedback to provide
you know their opinion to suggest new
formulations new principles or questions
that would like to put in this
declaration in here in Montreal there's
also a discussion group around
ethical issues is it fair to say that
the city is a center for looking
squarely in the face the ethical issues
in a way that maybe it's not being done
for instance in Silicon Valley yes there
is a spirit here in Montreal and I would
say in Canada in general of looking at
AI with a perspective that's not just
the technological one that's not just
the economic one but also includes the
ethical aspect and because of our values
I think this is not only the right thing
to do but it's also attracting
researchers and entrepreneurs who care
about these questions here in Canada so
the solution to all of this because it I
mean you want to talk in really
simplistic terms but a pessimist would
say you'll never keep the dark side down
altogether I mean they're going to be
people who for all sorts of reasons are
going to develop things that ethically
you're opposed to what's the most likely
way to counter that body and you've got
the declaration but what about in terms
of research well you know the research
is is very abstract it's about it's
almost like doing mathematics so it's
you you can't prevent research on
mathematics it's it's something very
generic and and it can be used it could
be used for anything right so what's
more important is to think about the
kinds of applications that researchers
or engineers and companies and so on are
focusing on and and also how these
products are deployed for example there
are techniques to deploy AI in such a
way that it would minimize what we call
discrimination that say against gender
or race and so on and so governments can
play a role in in making the use of a
I'm better aligned with our values are
you getting any pickup from government
any interests yes governments at all
levels that I've talked to actually
municipal provincial and federal are
interested in those questions and they
do care about those ethical aspects
because of course these are political
questions and they don't want to be
associated with decisions that are
purely
sort of the profit side of things here
we are at the beginning of 2018 when you
think back to this time last year would
you have predicted Facebook Google
Samsung Dallas Microsoft all coming to
Montreal in the past six months
no but I guess I was seeing it at coming
because I was in discussions with some
of those companies and still the the
growth of interest and investment in in
this field is amazing and it goes with
the growth of progress in in research in
the last few years and and you know
recently it keeps coming at an amazing
rate a lot of people point to you and
say that because there are such a
prominent artificial intelligence
researcher here who is committed to
Montreal then that makes other people
commit to Montreal instead of going off
to you know London York Toronto Silicon
Valley why are you so committed to to
Montreal well I've lived here for most
of my life and I have my my roots my
children my parents here my friends and
it also is a place where gaining the
values of the the city the culture are
better aligned with mine and I feel that
if if I had gone to the US it would have
been a little bit of a treason after all
that I received as a citizen here as a
student when I was younger
professor Benjie oh thanks for coming in
it's nice to meet you my pleasure
yoshua bengio is a professor at the
university de mayo and the scientific
director of the munch material institute
of learning algorithms and he'll be
keynote speaker at the social issues in
AI conference which runs the 25th 26 at
the Canadian Centre for architecture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
