so early I know it's not so easy I
certainly didn't find it all that easy
but thank you for coming I will be
telling you today about possibly the
single biggest disconnect in health and
it's it's quite a shockingly big
disconnect I'm not so you may be able to
tell that I'm not originally from this
country but I am NOT talking just about
the USA I'm talking about the entire
world there is a profound fundamental
conceptual disconnects that pervades our
health system and I'm going to be
telling you what it is and how we're
going to fix it in particular how we are
going to benefit from fixing it in the
sense of improving and indeed
maintaining our health in old age so let
me try that again ok so um I work on the
biology of aging I'm interested in doing
something about it and the reason I'm
interested in it is fundamentally
because aging is the single worst
problem facing humanity as of today and
when I say that what I mean is that it
causes more suffering than anything else
at the end of the day that's the way we
can determine and define how bad a
problem is and of course we have plenty
of other rather bad problems but let's
face it 110 thousand people die every
single day from the ill health
associated with old age a hundred and
ten thousand worldwide that's more than
2/3 about 70% of all deaths and of
course in the industrialized world it's
closer to 90% so that's pretty bad and
of course the real problem is all of the
disease and disability and decrepitude
and dependence and general misery that
precedes that and of course in most
cases that's a fairly extended period so
it's it's a pretty bad problem um and we
have to ask ourselves why have we been
so unsuccessful in actually doing
anything about it because let's face it
you know 200 years ago it wasn't that
kind of problem at all it was like we
know most of us would die
in fact more than one-third of babies
would die before the age of one even in
the wealthiest country in the world and
of course lots of people would die in
childbirth and so on and we fix that by
really Elementary simple measures like
you know figuring out the hygiene was a
good idea and you know vaccinations and
and really simple things even you know
just mosquito nets have saved them an
insane number of lives so we have to ask
ourselves why have the aspects of
age-related ill health been so much more
challenging for medicine and the answer
that most people would give is this of
course you're not supposed to be able to
read this slide it just emphasizes that
um there is rather a lot that goes wrong
with us during late life and these
things will go wrong at more or less the
same time which means of course that
they interact and exacerbate each other
it's a little bit of a scary business
and most people would say that this is
the fundamental problem that there is so
much that goes wrong that you know the
sheer complexity of the whole business
actually is overwhelming and that is
part of the problem but it's not the
main problem the main problem is the
disconnect that I told you I was going
to tell you about and the disconnect is
here if you ask people in what ways can
somebody get sick in other words if you
ask people for a taxonomy of sickness
then they will say something like this
they will say well there's infectious
diseases that's column one and then
there's genetic diseases for things that
a few of us inherit and that's gone too
and then there are the chronic
progressive diseases mainly associated
with old age con 3 Alzheimer's you know
most cancers atherosclerosis
osteoporosis macula generation all that
kind of stuff and then most people would
say - way out there in the stratosphere
there is this other fourth category of
sickness called aging itself which
consists of these rather nebulous
nonspecific things like frailty and you
know sarcopenia that's the loss of
muscle as we get older and immuno
senescence the decline in function of
the immune system that's the way that
most people would put it and it is
tragically wrong in one very important
respect and I will tell you why it's so
tragic most people would say this they
would say well because aging is this
kind of weird category out there that's
not disease it's kind of off-limits
for medicine that there's no way that we
could ever actually attack it or even
should attack it because it's natural
and universal and you know this is
completely different from the diseases
of Aging column three in the last slide
which are curable and you know
non-universal that's how people think
but it's nonsense this is what aging
actually is now I wanna spend a little
time on this slide because it's very
very important that you should get you
should understand what I'm saying
let's look at the middle sentence aging
is simply the accumulation of damage
self-inflicted damage in particular
damage that occurs and accumulates as an
intrinsic side effect of the normal
operation of the body of our metabolism
that's all that aging is it's the
accumulation of self-inflicted damage
and the body can tolerate a certain
amount of that damage and work perfectly
well that it's just set up to tolerate a
certain amount that's why people up to
the age of let's say 40 or 50 are
working pretty much as well as they did
when they were 20 or 30
it's simply no the nature of the way the
body is set up but here's the thing
everything I just told you about the
definition of aging could equally be
used as the definition of the aging of a
car or an aeroplane or any other
inanimate machine with moving parts in
other words the top sentence aging is a
consequence of physics aging is not an
emergent phenomenon of biology like you
know consciousness or stuff like that
aging is simply a phenomenon of physics
there is no fundamental difference
between the aging of a car and the aging
of you and me and that turns out to be a
really important thing to get into your
head because it tells us what to do
about it if we use biological
terminology then we can say this we can
say that metabolism which is of course
the network of processes that keep us
alive from one day to the next
causes damage throughout life even
starting before were born and that
damage is essentially harmless for a
long long time but eventually late in
life the damage reaches a level of
abundance that is pathogenic and we get
all the problems I mentioned earlier
those all the aging is and of course I
go
I've tried to depict him with these
arrows that have a slightly strange
shape is to separate metabolism from
pathology to try to weaken that link now
this is the way that we ought to be
thinking about the problem you will see
that this table looks rather like the
table I showed you earlier and in fact
if you look closely you will find that
all four of the columns are the same as
they were in the original version we
still have infectious diseases genetic
diseases diseases of old age and the
stuff on the left on the right sorry the
nonspecific things but the difference
between this version and the version I
showed you earlier is the location of
the big thick black line that big thick
black line is now between columns 2 &amp;amp; 3
rather than between columns 3 &amp;amp; 4 and
that turns out to be a fundamental
correction here's why it's so important
there are two reasons first reason is it
tells us that there is a huge disconnect
with regard to the way we are currently
addressing the things in column 3 we are
spending fabulous no I watering amounts
of money trying to deal with those
things but we're doing it under the
assumption that the things in column 3 a
rather like the things in column 1 in
other words that we can cure them you
know we can eliminate them from the body
in the way that we might eliminate an
infection which is completely obviously
complete nonsense because the things in
column 3 a side effect of being alive I
mean they are the result of the
accumulation of damage they are parts of
aging so it's insane to suppose that we
could actually address them by you know
by the same kind of means that we would
address an infection there's a second
thing however that the relocation of
that big black line tells us which is
that not only other things in column 3
completely different from the things in
column 1 but also they're not at all
different from the things in column 4
there is absolutely zero biological
distinction between the things in column
3 and the things in common for the only
distinction is semantics the things in
column 3 are the aspects of Aging that
we have chosen to give disease like
names
and the things in column forward the
ones that we had not that at all and
that turns out to be rather a useful
insight when it comes to figuring out
what to do about the things in column
three and indeed the things in column
four if you make that mistake if you put
that black are in the wrong place
this is what you end up doing geriatric
medicine geriatric medicine we may as
well define as attacking the pathologies
of old age directly in the same way that
we might attack an infection directly
trying to eliminate those pathologies
from the body you only need to spend
about a millisecond looking at this tiny
little diagram to understand how
completely brain-dead that is metabolism
is continuing to operate in old people
therefore the damage is continuing to
accumulate in old people therefore by
definition anything that attacks the
consequences of that damage the
pathologies is going to become
progressively less effective as the
patient gets older it's just completely
it's insane that we spend so much effort
on undoing this but that's what we do
now I am NOT the first person to point
this out though I may be doing it in
somewhat more strident language than
most people the thing is that for 100
years some people a few people have
actually noticed this and they've said
well okay there's only one thing that we
can actually do to keep people healthy
in old age and that is to intervene at
an earlier point in this chain of events
and that's where gerontology came from
the whole field of studying the biology
of Aging came from that insight at the
end of the day it's a reasonable insight
because let's face it if we look at the
rich living world we see a lot of
variation in the rate of Aging the rate
at which metabolism generates damage
different species age at very different
rates even within a species different
individuals age at slightly different
rates so the idea was well maybe if we
study this really hard we can figure out
what's going on we can actually
understand the nature of the creation of
damage well enough that we can develop
therapies which we could apply to clean
up a metabolism to slow down the rate at
which metabolism generates damage in the
first place if we can do that fantastic
we will be postponing the age at which
damage reaches this pathogenic level of
abundance unfortunately
the gerontology approach to attacking
aging has also been spectacularly
unsuccessful for a completely different
reason than the geriatrics approach
namely this metabolism is rather
complicated this is a simplified diagram
of a small subset of what we know about
how metabolism actually works and as you
can see it's a bit of a mess over who
write software or whoever written
software will immediately see that this
is the ultimate you know Kotak nightmare
of uncommented spaghetti code there's no
way in hell that we are ever going to be
able to tweak this system so as to stop
it from doing the thing we don't want it
to do ie the creation of damage without
at the same time having you know
unintended consequences that stop it
from doing the things we needed to do to
keep us alive not gonna happen so that's
a bit of a shame and in fact you know by
the nineteen seventies or so people who
were studying the biology of Aging had
more or less gone it come to that
conclusion and they more or less given
up they had come to this stage that you
know aging is bad for you you know they
were a bit like seismologists you know
people who sell us quakes they
understand that earthquakes are bad for
you but they don't have any actual
aspiration to doing anything about them
right you know you just kind of try to
get out of the way and it's the same
with gerontology in the seventies and
eighties and it kind of stayed like that
for a while because simple and really
pretty damned obvious third option that
escapes the problems of the geriatrics
approach and the problems of the
gerontology approach if we want to break
this link between metabolism and
pathology we do not need to break either
of the components the component
processes we do not need to stop damage
from generating pathology the way
geriatrician they're trying to do and we
also don't need to stop metabolism from
generating damage the way the
gerontologists originally tried to do
instead we can fix the damage we can
just go in and periodically repair this
damage eliminated from the body if we
could do that then we can leave
metabolism alone we can let metabolism
generate damage at the natural rate
which means of course that we don't need
to understand the tablet form any better
than we already do and moreover we don't
need to understand pathology either we
don't need to worry about
how complicated life is late in life
because the fact is we weren't let
damage accumulate to the level of
abundance that causes these pathologies
we will sit in that window of
opportunity where the body is set up to
tolerate a certain amount of damage
that's all we need to do the maintenance
approach sounds spectacularly simple
doesn't it and actually these beyond it
it is because the fact is we already do
that first simple non living machines
this car of course is more than 100
years old and the reason it's working
just as well as it was when it was built
rather than having fallen apart at the
age of 10 or 15 the way it was supposed
to it's simply because it has been owned
by crazy people who do a a spectacularly
large amount of maintenance on it a
comprehensive job of preventative
maintenance that simply removes the
damage before anything happens like the
doors falling off that's all it is
and because aging is a consequence of
physics and is fundamentally the same
thing in a car as it is in you and me we
should in principle be able to do
exactly the same thing in the human body
so the question is can we in fact do
exactly the sensing of the answer it
looks as though we can and I will
explain why in a minute
but first of all I just want to tell you
why you hadn't thought of this the
fundamental answer is because because
since the dawn of civilization we have
been terrified of aging we have all
known that aging is this utterly ghastly
thing that is going to happen to all of
us if we get away with life for long
enough and I'll get eaten by Target or
whatever and at the end of the day we
have to put it out of our minds and get
on with our miserably short lives and
you know make the best of it and not be
preoccupied by this terrible thing and
people have been saying since the dawn
of civilization oh I know how to fix
aging and they've always been wrong so
if you say someone like myself up here
saying that this time is good with me it
didn't actually happen clearly you don't
want to get your hopes up you don't want
to do that especially because you have
made your peace with aging so you end up
in a position where you make up these
stories that try to convince yourself
that aging is some kind of blessing in
disguise and this was perfectly rational
until people like myself started coming
along and
planning how we might actually bring
aging under medical control but now it's
a huge part of the problem it slows us
down it is the fundamental disconnect in
healthcare today now I've done a lot of
pontificating so far and I want to go
four minutes and 11 seconds last so I'd
better talk about some biology really
fact is that even though the maintenance
approach is vastly more rational and
more promising than either the
gerontology approach or the geriatrics
approach nevertheless it's still not
very easy because let's face it the body
is a really really complicated machine
and it accumulates a lot of different
types of damage and we've got to fix
them all just in the same way that a
mechanic has to fix all the types of
damage of a car in order to keep it on
the road and this is what we have to fix
it turns out that yes damage is
complicated but it's not nearly so
complicated as you might fear all of the
various types of damage that we have to
worry about these intermediates if you
like between metabolism and pathology
can be classified into just seven major
categories which are listed on the
left-hand side of this table things like
cell loss which is simply the phenomenon
of cells dying and not being
automatically replaced by the division
of other cells that's all that now that
cell loss and of course it causes
various aspects of aging like
Parkinson's disease because of the loss
of dopaminergic neurons and the repair
for that you all know well it is it stem
cell therapy that's exactly what stem
cell therapy is put cells in that have
been programmed to know what to do to
divide and differentiate into
replacements for the cells that the body
is not replacing on its own the reason
why Sens Research Foundation exists is
because the other six categories of
damage are not nearly so well understood
by society at large and there isn't
nearly as much workers needs to be going
on to actually develop the corresponding
therapies but the point is there are
corresponding therapies out there all of
the things I'm listening on the
right-hand side of this table are within
reach we have made very nice progress
I'm gonna be talking about in a minute
here we go this is some of the stuff
that that we've done over the past few
years really unlocking huge log jams
that have existed for more than a decade
in the research to actually develop
these repair therapies it's all
happening
I'll go back and show you this a little
bit this is a paper from four years ago
which is essentially a reinvention of
the ideas that I'm putting forward right
now and that I first published 15 years
ago um and this paper unlike they work
that I originally published is being
actually paid attention to this is now
becoming an extremely mainstream
Orthodox idea so it's not something that
you need to would think is some kind of
heresy anymore
furthermore the fact is this is about
longevity if you look me up in the media
you will find that I get called the
prophet of immortality and things like
that and this is rather distressing
because the fact is it's a distraction
it stops people from taking this work
seriously so I want you to know that
this is just straightforward
down-to-earth medical research we do not
work on immortality we don't even work
on a longevity we just work on health
and the fact is like any other type of
medicine it will other side effects
which is people will on average live
longer but that's a good thing right the
fact is this will actually cause people
to live a lot longer because of the
ubiquity of aging effective you know
people in their twenties and thirties
don't have much of a risk of death the
mortality rate in the 120s in the
Western world is about one in a thousand
or less which means that if we didn't
have any aging at all then people would
live 4-digit lifespans on average and
you know that's quite nice to think
about but it's also something you can
make lots of science fiction about and I
don't want you to be distracted by that
I want you simply to think about the
fact that this is health care and that
you don't want to get out so most and
indeed you don't want anyone else to get
Alzheimer's and the way to stop us from
getting out time is not to treat it as
an infectious disease but rather to
treat it as well it is namely a an
aspect of aging I'm going to close by
just pointing out that this is coming
soon maybe not for 20 years but the
widespread understanding that it is
coming is coming sooner than that a lot
sooner work in the laboratory over the
next few years I believe has a high
probability of being sufficiently
successful to get the expert community
in general on side with the
that we can in fact bring aging under
comprehensive medical control in the
foreseeable future and that's what you
guys need to be waiting for you need to
be watching out for the widespread
acknowledgment and anticipation that
these therapies are coming at the moment
it's still a relatively minority
attitudes at least in terms of what
people say in public people will not on
average be getting up on stage and
saying the kinds of things that I say
but in a few years they will be and
you'd better be ready I am going to
finish just by saying that if you want
to know more about the details about the
science on allowing this you should get
this book which I wrote several years
ago um
people keep saying please update it but
the fact is it doesn't need much
updating not because there's been only a
small amount of progress there's been
masses and masses of progress the reason
it doesn't need updating is because the
progress has been all pretty much
exactly what I said it was going to be
you know we now seriously I mean you
know 15 years ago there was a
seven-point plan there were seven types
of damage and seven corresponding
generic approaches to fixing it and it's
the same plan now that pan has stood the
test of time and that of course is
extremely good news it means that we
have a very good reason for confidence
that we are on the right lines here so
that is all I have to say thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
