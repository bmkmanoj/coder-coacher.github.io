were here at MIT in May and we had such
a nice talk about a range of topics in
computer science with our students I'm
so delighted to welcome you back and and
I was also here by the way for the IDE
inclusive innovation challenge that's
right
that's right which is a very big deal at
MIT is driving so I am very happy to to
welcome you today to talk about
artificial intelligence and jobs
so let's talk a I all right so I want to
start with a with a question about your
early days you were working on your PhD
thesis in the 70s and at some point you
came across the idea of AI I wonder if
you remember that moment well many
people were working on AI in the 1970s
and of course we should give credit to
MIT for inventing all this stuff so
thank you and it was at the time more
linguistics based and ultimately most of
the theories didn't pan out right for
one reason or other they got very
complicated that computers couldn't
support them but I was always interested
in it so so of course I think you've
changed your mind about what whether AI
was going to help us or or whether it
was not powerful enough to do much for
us I think I think what happens in life
is you know you have these experiences
and somehow they form your opinion about
something perhaps unfairly and so Larry
Page of course said studied AI when he
was in Stanford it was promoting various
REI projects and I was always very
skeptical so nevertheless we did a
series of initiatives and deep deep
learning came along which was clearly
beneficial to us in our ad system and
some of our vision work but it really
wasn't until the unsupervised learning
experience with YouTube where what we
did is we sort of set a cassette of
computers out to sort of see what they
would discover watching YouTube
and you know you would assume that when
you're busy discovering things you're
discovering something fundamental and
our system in an unsupervised way
discovered the most important thing that
you can discover on YouTube which is the
concept of a cat because there were so
many videos of cats on YouTube I wish I
could tell you that we have made a more
fundamental discovery we take our jobs
very seriously but you know the facts
are the facts in history will record
this as our failure but nevertheless
2012 that really kicked it off and that
team became the basis of what we have
now is a internally Google called Google
brain which is a very very large team
working on many of these technologies so
that's that's really such a great
project Google brain now I want to bring
you back to the topic of AI on jobs just
a few minutes back Moshe and I were
disagreeing about whether AI the kills
or does not kill jobs you have said that
that data does not support the idea of
AI as a huge job killer I wonder if what
the main data points you've looked at
work well first place every rain every
wave of technology has had this
conversation and I can remember this
occurring with mechanization in the
Midwest and so forth and so on if you
look today we support far more jobs here
in the United States with obviously
better economic growth than we had 20
years ago so the presumption is that
existing jobs are lost and the problem
is you can't then imagine the other jobs
that are created and Brinn Huff's and
and and and McAfee and others here have
made the argument very strongly that
remember AI is not replacing jobs it's
replacing tasks so if we sort of take
that as a framing let's think about
what's really gonna happen what's really
going to happen is we're gonna have a
jaw a surplus of jobs and not enough
people to fill them because they're
demographics
there's one thing that you all have not
solved here at MIT is declining
fertility of the world right and popular
you know we actually depend on people
and we've we've all grown up with
notion that the world was overpopulated
but in fact the inverse is probably
going to end up being true but for all
sorts of reasons it looks like the
number of jobs in aggregate that will be
empty will be increasing not decreasing
simplest way to see this and John was
mentioning this earlier into the peak
current estimate for population growth
in China peaks at 20 31 approximately
and then it because of the one-child
policy and other reasons begins to disc
wand decline the same is already true in
Japan and Korea in order to grow their
productivity they're going to have to
automate because that's the only way we
know of to get people to be more
productive we can't have them work
longer hours people are dying from
overwork in those countries so the
combination of all that says you're
going to have to increase automation
notice that these are the leading
companies countries excuse me that are
rushing to automate for the very reason
so on that topic what do you see is as
the role of companies and universities
in in thinking about the consequences of
technology as we develop the workers as
pairs between students well we spent a
lot of time on this as many other as
many other folks do that's what the
purpose of this conference is what I
would really like is for the inclusive
Innovation Challenge that MIT started to
be a global phenomena with hundreds and
hundreds of organizations pushing very
very hard on this and the reason is that
technical groups especially startups
tend to sort of focus on a very narrow
problem because that's what they they're
able to pull off in a a lot of time and
a lot of money but what we really need
is the application of this technology to
make the average person happier more
productive happier with their life and
so forth and so on and often people
build tools for themselves or their
local markets or whatever so I am
absolutely convinced that done properly
making everyone smarter is a net
economic gain for society I defy you to
argue with me in the abstract that it's
better to have dumb people rather than
smarter people it just seems like a
crazy argument and so if you think of
Google
as a strategy to give free access to
every person on the planet which is our
objective to all the information that
they could possibly ever consume that
has to be good right at some level there
are problems with it you know some of
the information is not the right one and
there are errors and lies and so forth
and so on but in aggregate making people
smarter right has to be a good thing
this is an educational institution you
clearly believe this absolutely but we
already have that so we already have
Google with information available to all
well what should we do first base last
less than half the world's population
has an available hat less than half the
world's population is connected so yes
there's all sorts of all sorts of
challenges like that which are separate
separate from the standpoint of
companies we we sufficiently concerned
about this we've announced a essentially
a Google for work project where we're
going to donate a billion dollars over
five years to two causes that are
fundamentally about education retraining
getting people ready for the digital
revolution and so forth
my personal view and I think the
corporation's view is that the
government's are not doing enough the
government's are fundamentally reactive
they tend to react to the current needs
of the current voters but you can see
these challenges coming you can see when
you look at the gap the the sort of
generation gap between a 15 year old and
a 50 year old or whatever metaphor you
want you can see the difference and we
need to get people in aggregate ready
for this so I think the girl with Google
program is really inspiring I wonder if
you can tell us a little bit more about
it are there specific sectors that
you're targeting are there other
priorities beyond what you what you told
us so far well there's a there are
various plans so one of the one of the
requirements is that Googlers will
donate a million hours of time
themselves into this and so we've
committed to doing that as well which is
a big enough company we can actually do
that believe it or not and I think that
the biggest focus is on digital skill
building so over and over again what we
hear is that
people don't really know how to use
these tools now everybody here knows how
to use them everybody here knows how to
use a website and so forth and if I
asked you to create a small business you
could do it very quickly but most people
can't they find the tools even even in
the current relatively easier state it's
still too hard they're still not simple
and so we are helping them there so what
should we do together universities and
companies for instance I really like the
idea of computer literacy I really think
that if we start training students in
computational thinking and computational
making and we consider that parts of
literacies and in ten years time we will
have people who will be prepared and
ready so it's not a solution are we
missing other well what I would like on
from the educational side is I'd like
everybody to focus on new forms of
digital learning and there's lots of
evidence that people learn in different
ways that the traditional model that we
all grew up with has competitors you can
now test these learning models by
measuring retention and other kinds of
things so I'd like to see the
educational establishment which seems to
the only people who seem to be
innovating our computer scientists right
applied to education rather education
themselves which is an issue in and of
itself if you take a look for example
the edx initiative that was done done
here it's been hugely successful right
so we know these models are working i'd
like to see those initiatives scaled at
a national and global level that would
have a big impact because then you have
enough data and enough training data
that you can begin to actually analyze
these i'm worried that much of what the
smart people in the top educational
institutions are doing does not have
enough data to actually be prescriptive
if you will for national and global
level solutions and i'm referring now to
the training mechanisms typical example
is how long should the should the online
session be what kind of questions do you
have
how do you do interactive learning so i
think if we if we do all these things in
10
time we will be in a totally different
place with the students we graduate but
in the meantime we have a wide workforce
we have all levels of jobs and
engagements and some people are feeling
overwhelmed by the rapid pace of
acceleration of Technology in fact I
recently read Thomas Friedman's book
thank you for being late where he talks
about dislocation and how this is this
is actually impacting people's sense of
confidence and security what should we
do for these people what's interesting
is you know we always complain about
everything changing so quickly
imagine being alive in the early 1900's
the combination of the automobile
electricity manufacturing industrial
prowess World War one
the invention of airplanes the invention
of military weapons and so forth we've
been through even larger amounts of
change we're just complaining more now
and and I think we're complaining more
because we're better connected and
complaining is fine by the way
but the human society is very adaptable
especially against the right kind of
principles and the right kind of and
with the right kind of leadership and it
seems to me pretty obvious that if we
can set down a set of principles about
what we really care about people will
get along the American model right is
incredibly flexible and as you heard
from Kai foo who who I've worked with
for a long time today China is has a
different model and they're going to
come at this problem in a different way
and ultimately that the challenge of the
American model versus the Chinese model
in everything right will come to
dominate our lives for the rest of our
lives just because the scale that they
operate out on the scale that we operate
it so we might as well get our act
together right as a nation and as a
society and say we better embrace this
and that takes leadership from the top
which is typically missing in America
and certainly now additional funding for
universities in these areas and a whole
bunch of things that I suspect we all
agree on so so let's talk a little bit
about tell
Google hires a lot of our students thank
you very much please continue what
should we do watch of companies and the
government due to to help retain the
talent in the US well the first and most
obvious thing to do is don't kick them
out I mean the immigration battle today
it is literally insane and of course the
government has actually done insane
things I shouldn't say it's a unique it
going to take one of your top PhD
students and then kick him or her out of
the country and send them off to
something else where they'll build their
lives and perhaps ultimately compete
with us in a business context or perhaps
in a military context I'd much rather
have them be in America I'd much rather
have them here and I'd like to have them
working for Google so we're clear so
that just strikes me as self harm and I
want to call it that way this is self
harm we're hurting ourselves if you
frame this as the battle against the
other great countries that are going to
be competing which include China and of
course Russia has a major strategy here
which they've announced and again I'll
take them at their word that they intend
to dominate in the blitter area
obliterate everybody else in this regard
let alone the Europeans and and so forth
so you get the idea that's point number
one
I think point number two is that we're
beginning to see the very top students
are choosing computer science machine
learning in AI which I'm very proud of
often you know you get these incredibly
polymath students and they would do
physics or math and now the field has
gotten so interesting that we're able
again through your leadership here and
in other examples which I'm very very
excited about we need more of those
kinds of people one of the problems and
you know this because you teach it is a
lot of the stuff is still very much a
black art we can't explain how some of
the algorithms work we can't explain
exactly how they fail if you can't
describe exactly how something works and
exactly how something fails you can't
put it in life critical situations it's
a real limit to where the technology can
go
right ultimately people are not going to
accept that now there are various
workarounds and solutions and so forth
but in I'll give you an example and
hanging around with the alphago people
who are beyond brilliant a group that
started out of Cambridge and it's based
in London now as part of deep mind you
talk to them about how they actually did
the go game and it took them two years
to build the AI algorithms to build the
learning model that took seven days to
learn the game so I used to say well
this AI syv is so powerful you don't
have to program you can just let the
computer learn stuff okay but the
learning is the programming and what the
data is that now your students coming
right out of MIT with a little bit of
work and some of the tensor flow and
other tools that are available can build
a mash up to do incredibly powerful
systems but real systems that humans are
going to rely on aren't going to be
built that way they're going to be
engineered they're gonna be thought
through they're going to be programming
and that skill is still a PhD brilliant
person kind of skill that we need more
of those kinds of people it's still and
I don't know it's still a unique skill
at the moment
we have built a library called Auto ml
which is an attempt to generalize this
so when you and I spoke last when I
spoke last year I talked a little bit
about this we think that we need a
couple more things to happen we think we
need another factor of ten or a hundred
of computational power ahead of us and
with that we think that we can begin to
do essentially generate the models
generate the neural networks and then
test them out so think of it as a meta
layer of generation and that's
interesting right we think that'll be
very productive and then the third thing
of course is we did a network and a
database of the knowledge that is being
generated and the simplest way to
understand that is that this lady over
here is teaching a self-driving car to
turn left and she teaches it to turn
left miss gentleman over here is turning
has has his car and teaching it to turn
right and so she has a car that can turn
left and he has a car that turns right
so they're kind of unhappy except one
can go left and one can go right what's
interesting about
it's after that Sun the two cars can
exchange the knowledge that's something
humans can't do so there's reasons to
think that if we can build a knowledge
platform of these kinds of specific
tasks we may be able to build up to a
much more powerful layer than we think
so transfer learning is extraordinarily
powerful but today's machines don't have
common sense how do we get there I'm not
sure that common sense is the first goal
because common sense is judgment and
judgment takes a long time so you're
gonna have to have an awful lot of
training data right to ultimately train
train for common sense we will
eventually get there but at the moment
that algorithms are so different from
the way humans actually work that it's
better to understand them as sort of
working with humans rather than
replacing humans there's this term
called cubot right which is sort of
robot plus plus there cooperator working
together where they where the human and
the robot that robot has been trained to
work with that human right and makes
that human more powerful right more
extensible and that's a more likely path
so that's certainly the path I want to
embrace but but going back to AI and to
getting AI assistants to be more like
like humans
I wonder if you if you are working on
building general AI systems that mimic
human thinking well we're not there yet
there is a project inside of deep mind
to work to try to advance general
intelligence at a research level and the
core idea here is to try to develop how
do you build the knowledge base along
the lines that I'm describing but the
vast majority of work that we're doing
is more of the specialized kind in our
industry there's so much training data
and there are so many opportunities to
improve our performance that's the low
level that's the low-hanging fruit and
now we're in the healthcare space and in
healthcare it's wide open
the scale of impact for healthcare is
hard to describe so I have to leave some
time for the audience to ask questions
but I do want to squeeze one more
question if that's all right so many
critics say that AI will lead to greater
inequality and in particular greater
income inequality I wonder what your
thoughts on this are and especially if
you have any suggestions for what we
should do to prevent that well let me
observe that globalization probably does
lead to inequality because you can
imagine if you have a global market
global competition you have global
winners those global winners will get
more of a share than there then this
sort of equal to the some of the
regional winners before so you can
imagine one winner this is sort of the
NBA salaries principle so there's lots
of reasons I think that globalization
has contributed to inequality and I'll
let the economists talk about the
specifics there it's not clear to me
that technologies which make everyone
smarter also increase inequality it is
probably true today that the more
educated can use this technology and
therefore they'll get a greater wage
game there's clearly an economic return
to going to college being highly
educated so again an endorse of a strong
endorsement of our educational system
and you all in particular to me the
question is at what point does that
break down and I don't think we know
there's research going on here and in
other universities to try to find where
is the break point you know we have this
naive notion that everyone is fungible
but they aren't there are some people
that won't make it but in my view
there's a very large number of people
who will be able to use this especially
as the tools get more accessible I give
an example we we and our competitors
have these things like Google home and
Alexa right now all of a sudden
computation is open to talking I spent
the weekend setting up my Google home
Mini and I found myself talking to my
computer and my rule for 40 years has
been talking to your computer means I've
gone insane so so you have I talked to
my computer all the time well they're
not join the clock I'm very happy to be
in the club any questions from the
audience we have a couple of mics here
otherwise I'll keep going after after
lunch it's important questions from the
audience yes when you were talking about
you know giving all this money to help
train people and that it's important
that people learn how to use the tools
that are out there one of the things
that you could do with the million hours
of Googlers time is to try to make it
easier for the average person to learn
things I mean you know when search
started out we all had to get trained on
how to search and now you know right and
so so actually the search engine was
changing us more than we were changing
the search engine and it flipped when
you had enough data so are you thinking
about how to use these projects to bring
in a lot of data and personalize the the
training so that you know the the AI
walks much of that last mile rather than
the individuals yes but not in that
program there's a separate and set of
initiatives that go something like this
the smart phone that you use is a
derivative of the WIMP interface windows
icon menus and pull downs that was
invented basically in 1969 1970 1971 so
you're using a user interface it's
almost 50 years old right there must be
a better way and there's quite a few
people in the research community they're
looking for AI driven interfaces that
remain for example a smart everybody
here uses a smart phone in the same set
and similarly for computers so my guess
is that your point first your points
correct but it'll be achieved through
product improvements which are
desperately needed let's take a question
from this side all right thank you for
being here
one thing I've noticed is many of the
panelists have taken it almost is given
that a decline in the number of jobs or
the amount of work is a negative thing I
was wondering what you think about the
shifting role of meaning in people's
lives
what else people might do if jobs do go
away well first place there's a there's
a great website that charts the changes
in the workweek
roughly a hundred hours and more than
hundred years ago on the farm to the
standardized 40-hour week in the US
similar number of hours in other
countries and it turns out it wasn't a
linear path there were nonprofit groups
they were activists there were laws
there were fights there were unions and
so forth to bring us down to where we
are today
so that 40-hour week was not sort of
standard throughout life history in fact
it's a relatively new idea so one
argument is that as people become more
productive through automation they will
work fewer hours for say more greater
income and be happier the limit to me to
that argument is that and I think this
is missed by most economists is that for
most people work is identity and
identity is very important so in order
for the work week to materially decline
as a percentage of people's life they're
going to have to have things aside from
internet surfing and playing with video
games right - I - as their own identity
how do I make the world a better place
how do I serve others I can imagine lots
that problem has to get solved thanks we
have time for one more quick question
okay I think that's perfectly so hey
yeah I think I represent maybe more a
younger generation here and what I love
to hear from your side is how do you
imagine the human future of work well I
think the truth is we we collectively
like to work right because it is this
identity thing and I'm assuming that in
the future you'll have an office which
is sort of built a office or workspace
that's built around you right both
verbally and in terms of human cues and
sort of gets you and that one of the
things that's gonna happen fairly soon
is that there will be these ubiquitous
personal assistants that will be highly
trained to what you need and will be
like having your own personal assistant
so that you as an individual can be
enormous ly productive right you know
what to do where to go what decisions
decisions support systems and so forth
that will improve productivity a great
deal and what kind of skills do you see
well I don't know we need it in this
time there's an increasing need in
analytical skills and in data science
skills and I think that's gonna continue
when you have and when you have the sort
of explosion of data you need people who
can think about data both negatively and
positively thank you so thank you all
very much let's thank every for
inspiring us Thank You Danielle oh thank
you okay thank you all
