wonderful
thank you very much Savannah and again
thank you sat magazine and thank you for
the organizers this is the second year
of the show it has grown exponentially
in size and I think we really have a hit
I mean it's very much to definitely
become a permanent fixture on the annual
industry calendar now today thank you
for coming because we have two
incredible speakers on stage with us we
have two people whose involvement in the
space and satellite industry the depth
breadth of knowledge and experience is
really quite extraordinary
both of founders of their own companies
and both are hands-on in the industry in
ways that well what we would discover
that when we're chatting so we're very
fortunate to have with us Steve
Jurvetson who is a founder and partner
at Draper Fisher Jurvetson capital
investor in many space and tech firms
not just in space but across a broad
spectrum an amazing experience based
there and also we have some Martin
Sweeting founder and executive chairman
of Surrey satellite technologies limited
one of the founding firms of this
variance he wouldn't be in this room
without these two gentlemen and what
we're going to do is ask them to each to
make a couple of remarks brief
presentation and then we're going to go
to questions if you have questions
please text them we actually have an
iPad I think you've seen from the other
panels the address which I will never
remember is actually in the it's in the
actual brochure today you do text Morse
at to a certain number I'm mildly
dyslexic so there's no hope in the nasty
asking me for that number but what I do
have is a good list of questions some
questions already coming in and then
let's have a conversation
but with that I actually like to please
ask so Martin please if you if you'll go
ahead and give your presentation that'll
be fantastic well thank you very much
indeed it's a great pleasure to be here
it's fantastic to see the the small
satellite community growing so to such
an extent I went to the very first
of the small Sat conferences in in Logan
in Utah and I forget the date but it was
a long time ago and there were I think
35 or 40 people in the room and it was
considered very much a sort of a hippie
venture of crazy types in thinking about
small satellites and over the course of
the decades we've seen it it grown
dramatically but perhaps I can you know
just point out actually small satellites
are not new if you look at the
beginnings of the of the space era there
were many small satellites but what
really changed is that over the last
decade there have been these dramatic
changes in their utility so the early
small satellites were physically small
but their utility on the whole was
fairly slow and what we see now is that
a small satellite community provides
lower-cost more responsive solutions to
many of the existing applications but
it's also stimulating completely new
business models and we've heard quite a
bit about that in the first two sessions
this morning the whole key to this
revolution if you like has been the
adoption oil and perhaps the sort of
parasitic exploitation of technologies
that have been developed out of the
enormous investments that have gone into
the commercial and leisure markets and
adapting those for use in space and
their so-called
commercial off-the-shelf or cots devices
but alongside that is we have to
recognize is the revolution in
production techniques which has meant
that actually these devices now are
essentially the modern high rel
components because the random failure
modes now have almost vanishingly small
and this is completely yeah I think
quite fundamentally change the economics
of space in both the civil and the the
military areas now small satellites come
in all shapes and sizes and this is sort
of a graphical representation of
Karissa's table this morning we see on
the top right yeah the nano satellites I
think
demonstrated very much by the the
CubeSat evolution and then micro mini
and small satellites and also just on
the left-hand side is bearing in mind
that there are some physically quite
large satellites which are still small
when you consider them in the class of
say geostationary communications
satellites and what has happened is that
this development of small satellites at
relatively low cost has brought space
within the range of almost every country
on earth and indeed also of course we
see it percolating down into businesses
universities and schools and so space
has become very democratized the big I
think game change the small satellites
have made if you were to point to one
single thing is in constellations the
low unit cost of the spacecraft means
the constellations are now economically
practical they of course practical
before and existed before but on
relatively small scales because of the
very high unit cost now the very first
of these constellations tended to focus
on digital store and forward
communications before the Internet
infrastructure existed and in a number
of specialized signals monitoring
services and it was really optical
communicating
earth observation from small satellites
which which took a long while to mature
and it's only probably in the last 10
years that these have started to be able
to produce operational systems and the
constellations in this case compared to
those who we're looking at for the
future fairly small constellations have
been addressing real commercial
applications and of course these are
stimulated number of new applications
some of which have been talked about
this morning particularly a maritime
domain awareness in smart cities
agriculture pollution monitoring
machine-to-machine communications and
and so forth and these are the some of
the new areas which we're seeing develop
and of course many of the applications
that are coming up in the future we
rather like we saw the applications in
the smartphone today we don't
necessarily predict so if we can look at
the evolution of this
all satellite market and from the last
25 odd years we've seen in the bottom
the yellow shows the the numbers of big
SATs that were so cool that were
launched and then on the top the the
small satellites and again other than a
burst of activity in the mid 90s you can
see it was fairly stable and quiet until
about 2012 and then we started to see as
we know in recent years tremendous
growth in Leo leo comms and particularly
in nano satellites so if we have a look
at the the number of new systems that
are proposed they cover a wide range of
different applications and we see that
there's something like by my calculation
at least 68 new systems not satellites
but 68 new systems that are being
proposed with a predominance as we see
in coms Earth Observation if we now look
at the numbers of satellites it's very
interesting to see that actually of
those something like and if all of these
were to come to fruition nearly thirteen
and a half thousand satellites are being
discussed in communications and almost
exactly 1/10 of that in earth
observation so we can see the the
dominance of communications in these
proposed the constellations and why is
that it's because if you have a look at
the map of terrestrial digital
connectivity and here you can see yellow
4G sort of like blue 3G and then radius
2g even in the apart from the developed
areas there are enormous Suede's of the
world where there's no connectivity at
all and so that is what is stimulating
the the growth in in the digital
connectivity so what are the emerging
trends well just looking at it I see
that you know small satellites have
exploited the advance in
microelectronics but what they didn't do
for many years was to change
dramatically the physical structure of
this spacecraft but the new materials
and the new robotic processes that we
see coming up now mean that we have very
different ways of of
spacecraft and satellite manufacture
which will make that we can not only
make it much more responsive hopefully
more low-cost and we'll also take quite
different approaches you know additive
and subtractive manufacturing techniques
means we can make things that we can't
previously made with human hands and
digital manufacturing means that we have
a freedom of location and dramatically
increase the speed and design and
technology cycle so what we see today I
think is the digital Factory what we
will see very shortly a software-defined
satellites following on that will be in
orbit assembly of spacecraft where we
can make large apertures by assembling a
series of small spacecraft together and
then eventually in orbit manufacturer
the the dream I think here is at the
moment if you think about it we design a
spacecraft to survive the rigors of the
first 20 minutes of launch and then it
just sits in a more-or-less microgravity
environment for the rest of its life and
so the constraints of the satellite are
dictated by this first 20 minutes if we
can just yet launch a chunk of metal and
a bag of sand and then print the
spacecraft in orbit it means that we can
then take a very different approach
indeed to to space manufacture there's
been lot discussion and it's hatched on
this morning about all debris and space
traffic management these things go sort
of hand-in-hand it is a serious issue
for the whole of the space community
which we have to address but there is a
bit of a misconception that it's you
know that satellites are the major
contribution we look at the majority of
the debris we see it's from defunct
upper stages and satellite breakups so
the satellites themselves are not
necessarily the major hazard what we've
got to ensure is that they can under no
circumstances fragment because it's the
fragmentation of satellites which is key
in this in in in the the danger and
therefore we have to ensure that we have
I think widespread best practice across
the community to ensure that
particularly with the large
constellations that we have really
effective mechanisms who avoid a
satellite breakup we also need to look
at how we can reduce satellite lifetimes
and there are many techniques
well known - to try to to do this so one
of the other areas that is in the
modeling of debris and the current
models have not really yet quite caught
up with the the the notions of having
these very large mega constellations and
so there's quite a lot of work to be
done but you need very good eyesight to
see the graph but it will be available
on it but what it shows is the vast
majority of debris is in the black and
white bit and the tiny little colored
bits are actually the satellites so we
need to just make sure that we have good
best practice on the integrity of
spacecraft and of course we need to
address the issues of space traffic
control so we've seen an incredible and
in unprecedented investment in the in
the industry in the last three years is
fantastic we can see it from the
attendance here today well I don't think
we've ever built or planned to build so
many satellites let alone small
satellites and we're completely I think
redefining through these new commercial
models what space can offer to to the
users completely different applications
very different business model but also a
number of new challenges and it's sort
of interesting if you look at small
satellites and you compare it to the
evolution of the mobile phone yeah the
first mobile phones were brick size and
then there was this drive to make the
Simone of the phone smaller and smaller
and smaller and then all of a sudden
people realized actually what you wanted
was a slightly bigger you know iPhone
six-plus or whatever so you could
actually do something more useful to it
and I think there's a bit of a trend
when you look at the evolution of the
cube SATs the further the cube sets are
for one you so to speak very interesting
but have limited utility and therefore
we see the multiple sizes coming up now
about I think couple years ago it's a
small cell light conference together
with one of my PhD students from the Air
Force Academy we decide to see if it was
possible to come up with a formula that
identified the optimum size of a
satellite and we looked at it in terms
of its size its cost its power but most
importantly its utility and it's a
fairly rough and ready equation but when
we solved it the answer you would be not
at all surprised was
equal to you know the the answer to life
the universe and everything it's 42
kilos now yeah and it wasn't exactly 42
but it's a round it up to 42 but it was
sort of interesting that satellites are
round about that sighs we were round
about the area of maximum utility but
we've got to remember actually there in
the past we've seen a number of business
cases that didn't work out quite so well
Aradia misery are examples of this where
the finance community got very badly
bruised by the those business cases and
nobody wanted to talk about
constellations or indeed low-earth
orbiting satellites for about the next
15 years now that's a wave has passed
then we have new enthusiastic folk ready
to invest in these new ideas and
enormous investments are being made as
we've heard this morning in the small
satellite constellations but all of
these investors are expecting
significant return on on their
investments and this is I think going to
be the real litmus test of of the small
satellite business can we actually give
the investors the returns that they
expect after very substantial capital
investments so I think we're going to
expect to see some consolidation and AJ
I think we've started to hear about that
with the the news from Terra Bella and
so this morning the this is the
beginning of a consolidation to
hopefully result in a very robust small
satellite community and as we said in
the last talk we have to solve the small
satellite launch capacity and cost
because this is constraining the
business thank you thank you very much
sir Marty thank you
and with that ladies gentlemen Thank You
Simone and Steve please Steve yeah sure
thank you well it's a great honor to be
here on stage with the legend and the
small ket that community and to see so
many people interested in this subject
as as was noted it's it's really
rewarding to see the popularity of this
program growing over time and and what
we're capable of doing I'll be sharing
the perspective of a portfolio investor
in several companies I realized there's
a common theme that I like to invest in
autonomous vehicles be it a SpaceX
Buster or Dragon capsule planetlab
satellite Tesla car zooks etc they're
all autonomous vehicles of different
sizes and shapes but that that's about
the only coherency one could find in the
investment portfolio pursued but space
is certainly one of the other exciting
ones so both be speaking from what I've
learned indirectly as a board member at
SpaceX and Planet and being there from
the early days and then some of the
other things that we see day to day at
dfj because we continue to look for new
investments in the sector I also noted
you were referencing the sort of
essential number of 42 that on the
interplanetary transport system not sure
was widely noted but there are exactly
42 engines on the boost stage and I know
you landed that on purpose
there's just no reason that it would be
any other number okay so let me share
this slide because I show it every time
I give a talk but I want to ask how many
people have seen something like at the
hundred twenty year version of Moore's
law sometimes called rakers Wells
version Moore's law hands up okay people
are shy or if it's always stuck at
around 10 to 20 percent max it's like
I've been showing this for over 10 years
and I know there's some overlap in the
population here but so in any case they
asked me to show it again because if you
updated at rehearsal and I have the
latest seven years of data points and
sure enough there's been some change
which is very interesting just to orient
again for people who don't know what
this is it's showing on the vertical
axis the y-axis a logarithmic scale or
an exponential scale 10 to the 18th
orders of magnitude um changes right
between back in the 1890s to the present
day and every blue dot is a computer and
what we're plotting is how much
computational power you can buy for a
dollar right so constant dollar
inflation-adjusted because then it has
nothing to a transistor counts which no
one cares about as
customer they buy storage of the by
computation and they're similar curves
for both and what's fascinating is no
one knew where they were in the curve no
one knew that they were you know on
something called Moore's law before
Gordon Moore named it actually cover me
named it after something Gordon Moore
observed which I believe is a refraction
of this longer-term trend because in
fact these technology this this curve
this phenomenon this this compounding
capacity to compute transcends five
different substrates right everything
from mechanical devices relay devices
that crack the Nazi Enigma code if you
watch the imitation game movie a vacuum
tube based computer the predicted
Eisenhower's one in fifty six and so on
few takeaways its exhaustion as to the
economy right you can think of it sort
of symbolically that inventions don't
slow down and in slow economic times
they may not be exploited the company is
behind these blue dots may have failed
but the baton keeps handing on forward
and forward and so from a business
perspective I known of nothing else that
you can hang your hat on for the next
ten years than this especially if you're
anywhere close to technology business
it's really hard to make a ten year or
20 year prediction upon any basis other
than this because of its health 120
years it sort of begs the question why
would it suddenly fall off the rails and
just cuz Intel says it's going to don't
worry until his long-lost the mantle of
holding the baton here it's been Nvidia
for the last seven years as we switch to
more deep learning machine learning
applications those sort of massively
parallel GPU computer architectures are
dominating an order the vast majority of
compute going forward as well so it's
good to know that a straight line here's
an exponential slightly up ticking is
actually a double exponential here's
what I think it means for the small set
community and and investing in general
is that of late over the last sort of
thirty years or so it's been doubling
roughly every year which means if you
design a satellite using ten year old
technology it that you want to be you
know rad hard or you want to show you
know only go with proven technology and
you choose architectures from ten years
ago to the tenth is at a thousandfold
change in other words a new entrant
using the latest off-the-shelf
commercial parts on the computation side
would have a thousand x advantage over
you without even being smart about how
they go about doing it just using the
latest and greatest version of what have
you and in many cases companies like
Planet and others many of the small set
companies we see as well as the robotics
companies and many of the other censored
systems of the world are reconstituting
the components of a cell phone the
accelerometer the sixaxis IMU if you
will the low-power processor and memory
what might be called the peace dividend
of the self
to build these other products using
those same components and if you're
competing against that with a different
set of technologies it becomes
increasingly painful to do so especially
to the extent to which software defines
the product and I think everything that
I've invested in that looks like a
physical thing if you ask the company
facil on what is the basis of
competition for Tesla or SpaceX it's on
the software side it's not a fundamental
patent it's not a fundamental
architecture of hardware there are smart
mechanical engineering designs don't get
me wrong but if they could say what
going forward over the next 10 years is
their basis of competent Pettit
advantage especially on Tesla site it's
entirely software and so our investment
theme oh these are the labels in case
anyone's wondering like some of the
examples of those machines but I'm gonna
go ahead and skip to the next one what
this does is it transforms industries
over time in our mission sort of as
venture firms to figure out what is that
next industry that is going to transform
and become a software centric
information centric business prior to
that transition they're typically crappy
low gross margin industrial businesses
that venture capitalist should not be
investing it so every venture investment
in the automotive sector basically
failed until Tesla right there wasn't an
IPO between Henry Ford and starting Ford
Motor Company and Tesla right the u.s.
was a deathbed you could invest you
would lose your money the same could be
said for many of these sectors that are
now having a burgeoning of investment
interest and I've been working for the
next ones like agriculture and synthetic
meat and stuff like that but most of
them fit into the adding of intelligence
almost like the same way the smartphone
transformed the telephone as we know it
and is something that's barely
recognizable as its predecessor that's
what's happening in these industries and
just like the iPhone with its
predecessors if you were at Nokia or
Ericsson the competitive response is
almost always to just give up to pack up
the bags and go home
and I'm not joking that literally is the
competitive response we're seeing when
you come in with a thousand next cost
advantage you know which you don't
really see any other industries except
in aerospace no in breathtaking
accomplishments over the last year that
opening video we saw today did a great
job bringing the booster back and many
of the other things like the Dragon
capsule landing under propulsive systems
and also being able to use as an escape
system propulsively you might ask
yourself why did SpaceX have these
innovations and why does it matter well
we'll get to why they had the
innovations I think it's because they're
shooting for a different star on the
horizon colonizing Mars where you want
to reuse the spacecraft to get back home
right it's a lot easier to reuse the
booster
in general than it is to build one on
Mars if you want to get back home so
this thinking process let him down in
the exploration of the design space that
just really wasn't economically
motivated if all you were trying to do
is loft low-earth orbits satellites in
geosynchronous satellites into orbit you
just wouldn't take these incredible
engineering feats and risks on new
product designs if you didn't have a
bolder goal and I think because none of
their competitors had Mars as the
definitive hell bent for leather goal
the company they wouldn't have done the
sort of things that SpaceX did now some
of you know that the US market share
this is a free you know the free market
if you will or you're not beholding to a
local provider as you might be in a
military sector the US market went from
zero I'm in from a hundred percent to
zero from 1980 through the early 2000s
and the blue recovery you see is largely
due to SpaceX and SpaceX is competitors
responding with price adjustments but
but it's mostly SpaceX frankly and
regaining the free market back to say if
you're in launch a satellite who is
price competitive because you if you can
shop the world people weren't coming to
the United States in the year 2010 I
alluded to Mars being the goal I don't
think I'll make that point again other
than to say I mean I'm you know rooting
for red dragon next year and um I want
to remind everyone that voted in the
bottom center is what every SpaceX
employee sees when they walk through the
front door it reminds them what is the
point Mars and Mars terraformed oh no
goofy guy was Buzz Aldrin as some of you
probably know quick transition to UM one
anecdote and then I'll finish up well
this will be somewhat lengthy one but I
want to give an update on planet because
visually they're just the most
interesting in terms of the data product
that they produce and because it's such
a fun story it started for me in the
Black Rock Desert I've been going for
over 12 years launching rockets and my
kids crazy hobby on the side and there's
this NASA team the phonesat project
Chris was one of the people cool
Marshall the CEO of Planet was another
and they were launching these in Android
phones on our Rockets they wanted the
g-load test them and they were planning
on about you know we won't let NASA
we've already tested him in a high
vacuum and we've really believed that
these little phones right here in our
hand have more compute power than any
satellite in orbit pretty amazing
statements they were making it was sort
of a demonstration project to some even
now at NASA to sort of shake up thinking
around commercial space and they did
eventually fly them Alexander Graham and
Bell the three telephones in space but
here on this mission there was something
different the guys we're thinking about
reconstituting those parts are not a
slightly larger lens because the imager
on a cell phone is not so great for
space applications and sure enough they
did they did a series of testing first
and blacker desert then on balloons and
less NASA I kept in touch with them over
those years and then visited again in a
garage here in Silicon Valley and you
know I'm really excited whenever I run
across a true garage startup I literally
in the garage and this is where planets
started it wasn't in called planet when
we first invested they weren't even
incorporated they weren't sure if they
wanted to be a see corporate because
they have a mission a passion to do
humanitarian good for the world and
transparency for the planet and they
didn't necessarily want to even be a
c-corp when we first invested so it's
just some of the early date photos and
online there's a full res version if you
want to look at what's on the white
board but it's quite humorous and so we
invested and then led the series a and
as you know this is you've heard from
Chris this morning well Marshall CEO on
the right really fascinating story this
is their first dove at scale it's not a
models it's that is the satellite and as
many of you know in a nutshell every
other company every other earth imaging
company is tasked you have to say eyes
on Iraq or eyes on Kuwait pick one as
you go over and you have to know in
advance and that usually involves a
complicated sales process an entirely
different business model a planet in
contrast raster scans the planet by
flying over the North and South Pole and
will image hopefully after the February
14th launch when they put 88 more
satellites in orbit on a PSLV launch
they'll be imaging the entire earth
every day every meter of the earth and
they don't have to change the angle
because you're always pointing straight
down it's all kinds of things become a
lot simpler and it's an entirely new
sort of hopefully expansion of the
market not just a you know price
reduction in the existing sectors i'm
sunni most people in the room are
familiar that here are some examples of
some of the most recent images that have
come out you can look down and tell you
know in the oil tanks with the floating
lids what the inventory is in major
shipping ports around the world and
using synthetic aperture radar you can
actually look through the clouds and
it's recently been shown with algorithms
measure that same data which is a keen
interest to some folks you of course
when your image in the whole of everyday
part of the whole point is to find
things you never have thought to task
like no one had before an imagery of
Fukushima
because until Fukushima happened it
wasn't interesting to have tossed a
satellite to it so if you want on a
humanitarian relief aid to know what
happened what bridges were there and
then just afterwards say a natural
disaster what fell out you want the
before and after you want have
continuous imaging of the planet
so the
recent missile from this month recent
fires recent volcanic explosions the
prior you know day that wasn't there you
also have time series over time this is
a major refugee camp that formed in
Uganda of refugees fleeing in from
southern Sudan and just over the course
of a few months of last year to be able
to show how that goes and the same they
have various news organizations have
found this there's a really interesting
way to have transparency what's going on
in various conflict zones around the
world the news Oh maple thing for Q&amp;amp;A
people want to talk more about this but
obviously one of the new items is that
after having acquired RapidEye um unless
your planet is in the process of
acquiring what used to be called skybox
from Google and also will be selling
data back in a multi-year contract to go
it's just Oh an arm's-length business
contract on the sale so yeah in a sense
Google is handing to planet the
operation of that above those assets and
de Planet fully intends to continue
operating that that full constellation
and the remaining satellites to come and
that'll be an exciting capability to
integrate those two they have sort of
find a change on the planet and then tip
and cue let's say a high-res satellite
automatically to take images of things
that are interesting that may have just
changed since yesterday again getting
rid of the sales team and all that
upfront I think one of the next areas
that will be very exciting over the next
five to ten years is all the data layers
and that then all of the applications
that can be built on these datasets here
are a couple of our dfj growth fund
investments in matte box and unity to
take the satellite imagery and then map
it onto the known texture map of you
know so the height of mountains and
buildings to create 3d polygons textured
environments for gaming or for whatever
kind of you know application you might
want you imagine flight simulators that
go through things like this already and
do you'll find of course much more data
analytic things so i counting every car
and every parking lot every day or you
know checking all ships on the planet
are monitoring all crop health globally
every day these are going to be pretty
amazingly interesting datasets for hedge
fund traders to start but then
eventually humanitarian groups and
others as well and again starting with
the February 14th launch just a couple
weeks we're hoping to have the you know
large enough constellation that to
deliver finally on that full vision so
just stepping back for a second and then
I'll wrap up with a couple other tinier
examples um you have a lot of disruptive
innovation occurring and
robotics autonomous cars in the space
industry largely for similar reasons in
this particular case one of the unique
enablers is cheaper access to space
so with NanoRacks and a variety of other
companies you can test things on a
one-off let's say to plate from station
the way planet did to iterate on their
hardware design every six weeks as they
did it that's nice to have then when you
want to launch at a large constellation
you know 88 at a go which would be the
largest constellation ever launched in a
single rocket there's plenty of options
now that weren't even here just a few
years ago and so SpaceX having if you
will every day low prices you know kind
of like Walmart online posted for all
the sea really helps with the business
case in modeling for a lot of groups you
know hundreds of groups that have relied
on that to get a sense of what launch
costs could be in the long run
simulation right one of the secrets to
SpaceX is success is iron maiden the
simulation rig as they call it that lets
them know way before the first flight
how's likely to go that's why the
booster when it came act the first time
over the ocean the first attempt to
bring the booster back largely succeeded
within its target zone and came to a
complete stop hovering over the ocean
now seeing is believing the engineers at
SpaceX knew it was a complete success on
the first attempt but until you actually
bring it back on the boat no one
believes you right we're have enough
standing there on land and seeing is
believing so the engineers knew from the
get-go version one worked just like the
first flight of the Falcon nine worked
and hopefully that will continue in the
future through increased use of
simulation I mentioned commodity
Hardware the dematerialization of the
physical thing much like the iPhone you
expect your next iPhone to look just
like the last one same with a lot of
these satellites over time as well and
of course certain global markets helps
um yeah you all know about one web
because they were just done that last
panel or the opening panel I believe it
was northern one just before here
actually and in SpaceX has an initiative
and a whole bunch of people are coming
out of the woodwork wanting to put up
these large constellations of satellites
provide broadband to everyone I think
this is a really huge business
opportunity it will be probably one of
the biggest economic booms from the
space industry over the next ten years
in other words the thing that will make
the most economic impact on the most
people bringing four billion people
online for the first time and becoming
part of the global economy is perhaps
unprecedented in human history and so we
are applauding as loudly as we can every
initiative in this regard to have more
net neutral pipes to the to the home
business and everywhere in between just
last week I took some photos of the
latest one web ground terminal and a
model of their satellite which is very
different than it used to be when they
were over
over at Google and and that's one of the
contenders as you heard that just raised
a bunch of money from South Bank we can
talk in Q&amp;amp;A why that's technical
technologically different from Teledesic
and other predecessors that had some
trouble one the last example before hand
is jumping out of the business side I've
also been a supporter b612 over the
years and this is a non-profit I
encourage all of you to check them out
started by rusty Schweickart know of
Apollo 9 and Ed Lou who's flown many
times for shuttle and Soyuz and the idea
there is that you put a satellite in a
Venus like orbit looking out and for an
all-in cost of about 400 million dollars
this is the old product but that's what
caught my attention for four hundred
million dollars all in costs for launch
operations satellite and everything you
could detect all possible threats to
extinguish life on Earth or even City
size some sort of planet busting or city
busting kinds of asteroids with a
forward-looking 50 100 year trajectory
modeling the n-body problem it's
basically become a computational
possibility that if you have you know
three points in a line you can now
predict the orbital dynamics that far
out so that you could do this incredible
thing and we should do that for less
than the cost of a new wing on the Asian
Art Museum in San Francisco you could
protect all the artifacts was sort of my
thought back then the update in the last
few months though that's fascinating is
I've been relentlessly fixated on the
sensor cost as a cryo cold IR sensor
really seems strange that it needs to be
so expensive so even though it's 400
million big chunk of the costs almost
half the cost of the satellite was a
sensor and sure enough after a bit more
software development a bit more in
putting more computational load into the
satellite sure enough a cluster of small
SATs as many as few as eight could do
almost as good a job at 100 the cost and
this is some partially published work
and they'll be doing more work in this
area and doing some actual flight tests
as well but it just is a great example
of the small set revolution
off-the-shelf components moving into the
satellite computational elements or
storage of data sets that you otherwise
couldn't in this case it's a synthetic
tracking that they put in satellite and
being able to do things that just
weren't possible before with us in many
industries you don't find hundred X's
you know entrepreneurs dream of a 10x
they often don't achieve that they
rarely even claim they're gonna make 100
X and you'll see this everywhere in the
small set industry that the march from
the mainframe classic machines down to
the
mobile laptop size computers if you will
in space is really what it's all about
some people had the foresight to know
this many years ago today it's
blindingly obvious that the future
belongs to the small and nimble the
agile and the commercial off-the-shelf
so with that let me end and say we thank
you very much Steve no no thank you both
lots of food for thought there and both
of you touched briefly on Terra Bella
and the planet labs have acquisition
what do you think this means for the
industry for investors moving forward
well I'll give you a rest so you can
take it a bit of refreshment there all
these safer well I think it goes I think
it just is the first example of exactly
what I said at the end of the my
discussion short introduction and that
is we are going to see a consolidation
you know there's absolutely no doubt the
you know the value is in the downstream
the services content is king yeah it's
only what you can deliver to the
customer and what the customer can use
it's actionable knowledge that he wants
you know irrespective of what his works
fairies and so if we're going to look at
the numbers of constellations that are
being proposed inand I say there was
some 60 nearly 70 systems little own
satellites empty systems being proposed
I'm sure they're all going to see is
some sort of consolidation and focus
within those and I think this is going
to be absolutely critical because I
don't think that there is going to be
the scope to be able to have all of
those systems operating with you know a
successful commercial basis in the short
term in the longer term the market will
grow and as we saw with mobile phones
and the infrastructure that grew up
around it over the in the 90s and 2000's
mm-hm
then once the infrastructure grows then
the market opportunities grow but I
think in the short term we're going to
see some consolidation and then some
different strands emerging well being on
the board a planet I should probably
just say it's good for the planet
but but I but I'm just tempted the say
more than I probably should say um so
let me let me just dope ein that I think
it's also good for Google because I've
witnessed firsthand their spinning out
of the broadband data initiative and and
now this and one may ask the question
well why is Google doing this and in my
opinion again this is not a Google
official point of view by any means is
they are delighted to have someone else
own operate manage and provide the data
service that then they can use so having
the data contract along with a third
party provider is a total win I in my
opinion for Google there's no reason to
vertically integrate unless you thought
that you were going to deny the rest of
the market access to this data that's
not what Google is all about so in the
both the broadband case we're not having
a Google brand does the Internet service
provider in China or in certain parts of
Europe is probably a good thing having a
neutral third party is a win for Google
and as long as it's a net neutral pipe
to the home similarly with imagery as
long as this imagery can be used by
Google which they of course you know you
know made as part of the arrangement
that I think that's just a win it
doesn't indicate any lack of interest in
the in the data is really all that
Google cares about and many of their
businesses and as many of you know this
is part of a larger initiative to shed
the robot businesses that Andy Rubin
acquired you know Boston Dynamics is
they're trying to sell that off they
shut down Titan aerospace today they it
bulked up with a lot of fun projects to
get deep learning engineers that are
fungible and now they're like well let's
get rid of the fun part and you know
let's get the business and keep doing
you know keep a few of the engineers so
it's good for planet as well they get
good talent they get an incredible team
they get a product line that it under
various stewards has probably received
over a billion dollars of invested
capital in Planet intends to fully
continue operating so whatever you
thought skybox was now Terra Bella that
will continue those products those
satellites the the the services that you
were hoping that they would deliver
should be delivered hopefully with a bit
more of a satellite companies kind of
expertise right everything from ground
stations to the data pipeline everything
that of course planets been working on
and then the integrated product says I
alluded to things like tip and cue where
change detection could be done
automatically with deep learning
algorithms right like for example the
images earth every day it's easy to just
find all housing starts you know any new
construction of any kind commercial new
construction people understand that and
then maybe take a high-res image if it
looks like a chemical plant
that's what you're interested in or
whatever right so that combination
product could be very interesting have
the high-rez driven by change detection
and discovery at something we haven't
really had as much of inside imaging
world is find me things like this as
opposed to go take a look at that right
where you know in advance what you want
to look at them um I can go on and on
other than I think it's healthy for both
companies yeah but can I come back on
that because interested because on the
one side we're looking at the
exploitation of data and it looks like
planets is now moving to be more
vertically integrated by both having the
spacecraft segment and the the route to
market so is this a move back towards
vertical integration in Planet when you
see vertical what we're really not I
mean in terms of playing role in the in
the space segment the space acts and
also the applications and route to
market oh yeah so that well they've
always been selling imagery and many
customers want data or analytic so if
you're a financial services company you
don't really want the pretty pictures
you want the car counts in the Walmart
parking lots or you want the crop health
for your global commodities index
they've always intended to provide that
they do that through partners in some
cases there's third-party integrators
who take the data and then do that
analysis and various verticals but to
provide let's say a basic layer right as
they have with open California and other
projects to say hey developers here's
some of the rudimentary stuff like take
take think about the image pipeline
obviously you'd like to rectify and you
know orient all the you know the images
with each other and you'd have liked to
have easy search time series that's
basic stuff and then to run a machine
learning harness or a deep learning
harness on top of that is is a very thin
and easy to bolt on kind of function
that could then open up all kinds of
applications for third parties so I'm
not sure it's any change from what they
always said they would do and have been
doing they just haven't been able to do
it all at the same time and again they
haven't I mean Elan is the master of
vertical integration
whenever anything hits hiccup he just
builds it that's how he got on the
rocket business in the first place um
was he didn't like the Russian suppliers
yanking him around but I don't know that
this is any substantial change from a
vertical integration point of view you
might argue there's a horizontal
integration going on if anything well
you're seeing this revolution in earth
imaging satellites and constellations
but we've seen constantly
and telecoms before you alluded to this
moment as well the global star lire
idioms gosh back in the mid-90s it was a
whole whole crowd what's different this
time for communications and small sets I
mean if I can just put in a couple of
comments quickly I think the big
difference is the evolution of the
terrestrial network system and now we're
seeing that the you know the spectre the
so-called you know space communications
area and the terrestrial areas are now
merging and so we look at the you know
they're very widespread despite my map
that I showed with ISM you know large
areas which are not met in other areas
you know the the evolution of 5g the
evolution of various other networks is
bringing communications to be a total
system a lot of space communication
systems a lot of terrestrials system but
something that's now going to be you
know really just a complete system
merging the two together I maybe just
highlight two things I think number one
change from let's say Teledesic or
earlier attempts is the phased array
antenna that if it weren't for that
there's just it wouldn't pencil out like
it didn't before so if you have to track
right because we're on Jesus synchronous
orbit you're moving right so then if you
have a parabolic dish on the ground
that's tracking that's moving parts it's
expense its bulk to use a phased array
antenna and to have it get up into the K
band and the K you bender is an
essential enabler it's sort of something
we always look for an investment is like
why now why why couldn't this business
have started 10 years ago and that's a
really important checkbox item does the
entire cost of economics of the ground
station just blow up in a bad way if you
have moving parts and so these $250
ground stations that are solar cells
phaser antenna processors LT chipset
Wi-Fi lighting up a village of st.
Africa 250 bucks just throw it on a roof
of a school or something pretty amazing
price right that's number one and then
close behind it tightly coupled to it as
Moore's Law just again if you can have a
digital chain and you know incredible
routing of information perhaps laser
coms behind between satellites a lot of
these things piggyback off the advances
in Moore's law as well yeah so it's a
wine in your opinions is this the good
is it a good time for small sets I mean
it's you know it's we keep hearing this
waves and waves but why now III think
it's just here you get the convergence
of different technologies that come and
you know their periodic sort of step
changes
gear changes if you'd like if you go
back over the last 25 years the
technology is sort of ratchet each other
up and we've now got to a point where
the terrestrial technologies the
including the other handset type
technologies and the terminal
technologies as well as the spacecraft
capabilities and the size and the
although we have a constriction in the
launch rate the availability of this and
the ability to launch constellations in
order to be able to support these things
you know it's a confluence of all these
things that have come together at the
right time if you go back over the last
25 years you'll see there were spikes
when you know satellite technology sort
of took a had potential but there wasn't
the supporting terrestrial sector and
then vice-versa
I think it's just all come together the
the synergy of the winds and waves are
alright yeah I think I think that's
exactly right and you could ask a
similar question like why did the iPhone
occur when it did is there something
magical at 2007 was it multi-touch was
it processors just got fast enough the
whole thing worked at that low power
footprint and I think you're seeing that
same thing here and in a variety of
sectors from robotics to autonomous
driving that you know this software
conversion of a formerly Hardware
centric industrial product is a really
big sea change in many industries I
think we're in the middle of that in the
space industry
I do think also there's a collective
leap of faith that takes place in the
investment community in the fact that
many of you are sitting here today in
that we are I think much more hopeful
that the near future is going to be much
more like that we'll have cheaper access
to space you know it's almost a
precursor for good satellite businesses
accesses kind like a precursor the
Internet is fibre broadband you know the
start before you had fiber build-out you
didn't really have a lot of internet
apps that we're that compelling in a lot
of parts of the world similarly here if
you believe that between the major
launch providers doing constellations
and the small set many small set launch
companies that are all racing to provide
dedicated you know spares and test
flights if you will that that belief
amongst investors and entrepreneurs that
it'll it's only gonna get better helps
fuel a lot of the enthusiasm to to give
it a go and you both mentioned well
that's a big focus on commercial this
moment but there's other apps I mean
it's just not just a commercial thing as
it sits
what NGOs and governments is that I mean
he mentioned that at lewd Rusty's
foundation
you mentioned the early work someone on
optics and working with small nations
bringing them in are we forgetting that
sort of other use of small sets no no I
don't think so at all in fact I think if
anything we see small sets raising the
awareness in a number of clearly in a
number of country developing countries
as to the you know the value of space in
helping them manage their resources and
their economies and I think even in the
UK which had had a on the whole you know
a rather disel tree review of space
until quite recently and from from the
point of view of government support a
study that was carried out over five
years ago which looked at the economic
impact of space on the UK came up with
results which startled the government
the result of that was the government is
now looking across all the different
departments in order how they can
extract the best benefit from and value
from space and small satellites I think
have played a role in that because now a
number of these government departments
look at it and say well actually space
need not be quite so terrifyingly
expensive as it was perceived to be 20
years ago it is possible to do these
things at budgets which are
proportionate to our other demands of
which of course there are many very
serious demands and so I think it's
stimulating a much greater awareness
within government departments certainly
in the UK and I'm sure that's probably
true in other countries as to how how we
can use space use small satellites in
space to get a more economic view of of
of the benefits of space to individual
nations yeah I think um it isn't
forgotten it's opening up in a beautiful
way do you think about planet for
example the first customer was in the
nonprofit world and some of the earliest
use cases that they evangelized and
spoke about where things like catching
illegal deforestation as it happens
catching illegal fishing especially the
ones that drag along the bottom you can
see the trawling from space you know as
it happens those sorts of things and
anything about transparency and
journalism and not being able to make up
stuff about the world I think gonna be a
for a positive and in all those areas in
those they are customers they're in fact
paying customers
and in other cases like in the case of
Planet they're gonna have a.org for just
letting all kinds of nonprofit use of
their imagery take place as well um if
you if they say something that's also
about some competitors cuz I don't
always just circle back to the ones I
have I happen to know that the founders
of one web and also initiatives going on
at face book and elsewhere to bring
broadband via satellite to the world is
largely and primarily motivated for the
developing world in particular Africa in
places that just don't have access and
in I know with my I learned a number of
the founding and Zuckerberg himself they
really do believe and I think it's true
that this access to the Internet is like
a fundamental human right it's like it's
like having clean water if you want to
have opportunity globally there's almost
nothing better you could do them to
light up a you know connectivity to oh
yes all the online courses and
everything that we take for granted here
in the developed world so I think even
in the businesses that will make
billions and wiring up the planet via
satellite um it started with a
humanitarian goal as did planet start
with a humanitarian goal well-liked
geeks Without Frontiers a great
humanitarian organization staffed by
satellite guys it's fantastic it's
making a real change and so we've
changed that remote sensing is dumb
commercial changed it communications
obviously but what's next
commercializing what's the next wave you
think going through in space in space oh
yeah in space I never thought I'd give
them both go ahead this is great
well I guess if I knew it I very quiet
but but I honestly think that if the the
biggest blockage in exploiting space at
the moment is definitely the cost of
getting there you know there's no doubt
and in fact if we were not to just
reduce the cost by 10 15 20 or even 30
percent which is of course extremely
welcome if we could reduce it to ten
percent or less of what we have now then
we would take a very different approach
both to the the how we technically build
spacecraft and operate them but also it
would open the opportunities for for
business and applications and how we use
space dramatically and I think so if
there's something that's going to really
change things it has to be an order of
magnitude change in the cost of getting
into space
what do you see Space Station is a good
platform for testing things the current
station is it's good for testing small
SATs right the lot of the companies we
see take advantage that for deployment
and obviously there's other things like
the maiden space initiatives and other
things that are using it as a research
tool but not not directly building off
what I was hearing from him in terms of
you know lowering the cost of lift and
other 10x doing in situ assembly of
larger structures up there that can be
pretty interesting once you have a goal
outside low-earth orbit all right so if
you wanna get to Mars or somewhere like
that you can imagine a different set of
economies forming everywhere from here
cislunar space and up to Mars I might
add that I think I agree and I hope but
SpaceX will in fact do exactly what
you're saying and leave that charge
whether it's you know flying a muse
booster for the first time this year
hopefully in the Falcon heavily flight
maiden flight hopefully this year and
red dragon and those kind of
inspirational moves might start to take
us forward and obviously the IDS or the
VFR depending what you like to call it
he's supposed to get to those kind of
price points you know these sort of 200k
round-trip ticket to Mars I mean that's
got if you you know back into what that
really costs per kilogram it's pretty
remarkably different so that'll be the
vision you're describing I think in the
near-term business-wise there'll be this
whole Earth Observation layer at the
data and analytics I mean it's woefully
thin right now
what's their images and there's
traditional markets meaning people like
Monsanto and everyone who have been
buying a lot of commercial satellite
imagery continue to but all the new
stuff right that's just on the cusp of
coming right and once you have the data
that you can apply all these algorithms
to see what we can find and who knows I
think that's gonna be exciting over the
next five years and then over five to
ten years I think this broadband data is
gonna be the biggest opportunity and
then sort of growing throughout but but
not one we've personally invested in as
a direct investment is tourism and of
course then eventually colonies but you
know getting people back into space
again in interesting places whether it's
a low-cost lunar base which we on a
little symposium estimated should cost
less than five billion maybe closer to
two billion dollars all in to get it
economically self-sustaining lunar base
kind of kind of mind-boggling right that
could be a donation of Larry Page you
know after a weekend Binger you know
let's just do this right kind of amazing
to think someone's walking around money
could set up a permanent lunar colony
yeah and and maybe actually part of this
in is an extension of tourism not
everybody will be able to travel I mean
it's just my tea in the near future so
the development of virtual reality and
avatars to be able to participate more
closely more personally in space
exploration I think is also going to be
an interesting development in
not-too-distant future and there's a
similar question but for both of you but
from different aspects
now mr. Martin maybe first and then
Steven so Martin what do you look for in
a customer and Steven what do you look
for in an investment why that's an
interesting one well I mean I think
first of all every when you look at a
customer and customers come in all
shapes and sizes so to speak and from
you know different applications and
different requirements I mean the the
thing I thing that we do is this first
of all is to sit down and talk through
with the customer what did what is it
that's important to them or what is it
that they're trying to achieve you know
that's the first thing because if we if
we if we go in saying look we yeah we've
got this and this and this why don't you
have that and that the other the chances
of us having a mismatch on their
expectation and meeting their
their goals is very high I said the
first thing we do is actually sit down
and say write what you know what is your
problem or what is it you're trying to
achieve or what is your idea which you
think is making a good new business and
then trying to see how in outside is a
satellite manufacturing company how can
we meet their objectives within you know
the golden parameters of you know price
cost and time scale and the course
reliability behind that but first of all
it's sitting down and funny out what
they want then it goes once once you've
understood that of course you do need to
do your own due diligence in just making
sure that you know the customer that's
coming to you with an idea actually has
the wherewithal to to see it through or
has roots to gaining that wherewithal
did you have much connection with the
finances to at that stage is there
something you look for I mean did you
help you help sometimes help the
customer with finances and put them in
touch with people and our customers are
extremely Catholic in cents of the small
C in that they come from all manner of
backgrounds and and different financial
backgrounds as well and sometimes we
will sit with them and and if if
appropriate help them with introducing
them into the how they can finance it
it's probably a minority to be honest
but we know we do do that how about
yourself Steve what do we look for an
investment um Elon Musk jumps to mind um
checkbox failing that it's much more
difficult but but it is a proxy for you
know and passionate entrepreneur who
wants to change the world who has an
infectious enthusiasm for their idea
whatever the sector and this ability to
get you jumping out of your seat the way
they will with their employees and
partners and customers well someone's
getting a little violent over there um
we also look for lately I at least I
look for a passion or a Purpose Driven
business more than just a money-making
enterprise I've it's been slow to learn
this lesson in my career but I look
across all the best companies well
within our portfolio and outside of it
and profit is not the priority it's a
byproduct of the mission and and if they
orchestrate their business well and
Tesla's a great example it
the goal of getting us off of oil in an
era of sustainable transport in
sustainable energy has to be an
economically self-sustaining and
profitable endeavor in other words you
can't suck and lead you can't be a worse
business model than the existing car
companies and expect anyone to follow
you you have to be better but that
wasn't let's just make the most money we
can it's know let's follow this mission
and that leads to all kinds of
interesting decisions like open sourcing
patents doing things that may help other
entrants but it wins the hearts and
minds of the engineers and that
ultimately is what it's about so we look
for that on the people side we look for
at least I'd look for a maybe and I
think our whole firm does but I
especially like to always invest in
things that are unlike anything I've
seen before because that's a great proxy
for it's actually new and on the cutting
edge of technology but if but if it's
just like something you've seen before
and this keeps me out of a lot of calms
and keeps me out a lot of great
money-making opportunities oh all around
me that look like warmed-over social
networks you know or another
communication platform I try to find
something that's different in new and at
least makes life interesting and
engaging and also means there's less
competition typically at the place where
we're investing and then usually there's
a dynamic duo it's not I mentioned
someone like you know an individual it's
usually a founding pair of people not
not individual that are cognitively
diverse because then if they respect for
each other they'll tend to scale out an
organization that has more cognitive
diversity in it then a single cult of a
CEO and hiring people like themselves so
the healthier companies seem to form
from that and mmm I guess it's kind of
that you know well at last week's
accounting leads on to a cup of
questions we've had from the audience
and that is one is you Steve you have
office an obvious interest in space and
passion for space how do you convince
your partners to also invest well it's
easier now I think it's easier a lot of
venture firms and they'll get you a
question in a sec but today it's easier
because you can point your success and
much of the venture community is a flock
like herd mentality of oh SpaceX is
making money so let's invest in rockets
Oh a planet seems to doing all the
citizen satellites it's just it's as
simple as that I mean the actual logical
linkage between whatever is being
invested in and the thing that they
think is successful is tenuous at best
kind of like when Netscape went public
you know it's pile on the Internet well
luckily that was generally a good idea
in that case it's weird but so there's
that so but in the earlier days like you
know ten years ago for example given my
proclivity you know launching rockets of
my son collecting Apollo space artifacts
for the office I you would have thought
that I would have found some space
investments and I kept meeting
occasionally with them but prior to
SpaceX were sort of like this watershed
moment prior to specifics there wasn't a
single pitch that I thought weren't had
bringing to my partners so I didn't in
fact bring anything not a single thing
to the partnership for decision there
was just something about the capital
intensity the lack of a defined customer
the long time frames you know who knows
there's uncertainty and once again we're
talking about everyday low prices and a
visible success like a new entrant can
make money and in fact the quote
military-industrial complex is not so
much of an uncrackable edifice the
better product might win all these
themes that SpaceX you know that stands
for a really powerful so it's easier now
but I do remember and I still say to
this day an email from one my partner's
when proposing SpaceX you know way back
in the day when they had not yet even
had a success so not even a falcon one
lunch success whose reply back to me is
that we should not let our personal
passion and passions cloud or investment
judgment and that's true but I had the
fight over past that well okay and I to
get some other people at the firm to be
is equally vocal that they liked it and
and actually led to a better decision
that instead of it being a roll over
like oh of course I had to defend a lot
of things I had to think about things a
bit more and this is again one of the
values of a diverse team is they make
you defend the things you think are
obvious and you sometimes think a little
more clearly about an opportunity when
forced by someone who's a doubting
Thomas know very cool thank you and
smart there's been a question for
yourself as well we talked about the
merger and acquisition of planet and
Terra Bella and everything else but you
yourselves went through a merger or
acquisition at sorry Sam with Airbus yes
indeed and one of the questions is how
did you retain your corporate culture
how did you retain your team when you go
into that such a larger entity as Airbus
how did you retain your identity that's
very good question and actually if you
look at the history of small
organizations being concerned not
necessary just in the space feel small
companies being taken over by larger
companies they sort of get loved to
death you know that if you're not
careful the you know the new mother will
come along so I will help you
and actually that's really probably
about the last thing well you want help
but you want arms-length help and just
to go back a little bit before that you
know my company s STL was started in
1985 with with four people and one
hundred quid $150 or whatever it was in
those days and one of the first things I
did in order to try and solve the
business we'll go and talk to venture
capitalists but I'd learnt very rapidly
then venture you know their idea of
venture and my idea of venture were not
the same in 1985 at least and so we took
the path of growing a company
organically and without significant
investors being backed by initially by
the university but it's interesting to
note that Elan actually took a
shareholding in s STL for I think three
years and was a very made a good
contribution to the board at that time
before we then come to this to your
point decided we had to change and up to
then for the first I suppose goodness
nearly 20 years the company had been the
shareholder the company had been the
University and universities don't have
much money if any and of course as we
started to take on larger contract
larger contract commitments the
customers said well you know what
happens if something goes wrong who do I
go and extract money with menaces from
and universities then hold cash they
have buildings and they have students
and you don't get much money for either
of those so we decided we had to change
and actually took nine years to make
that process with three sale events if
you like to look at look at that and on
the first two ago two occasions we had a
wide range of interest in it from all
manner of financial houses from trade
sales there was even talk of IPOs and
other things but looking at the nature
of the business which was a
manufacturing satellite manufacturing
business very very lumpy not very high
return and quite risky yeah this is a
difficult pitch to make to investors and
so in the end at cutting a long story
short the best offer we got was from was
then EAD s now Airbus but the key there
was the the airbus management
recognized that this process of loving a
small company to death would be exactly
what would happen and so partly from our
own sort of requirements that we set on
the on the deal plus support from our
government but also I think real
realization within Airbus that actually
if this was going to succeed is a
different type of animal within a big
company it has to operate in and out
orbit it has to have a degree of
independence of action and process in
order to survive we're going to be the
thing and the the reason Airbus wanted
to if I can speak on their behalf wanted
to acquire s STL was because they wanted
us to be the grit in the machine they
wanted us to be disruptive and so my
brief is to be you know disruptive to be
irritating to be innovative and not to
lose money and so those are the sort of
the ground rules and we have sometimes
we collaborate without our shareholder
on projects and sometimes we compete
Galileo being a very good example and
this is done on a on a sort of proper
basis so I think the real key here was
that we were very firm about our
philosophy our ethos how we wanted to
work and that our partner in Airbus
recognized that and since 2009 I think
it is so near now over seven years ish
coming up you know that has worked
extremely well they have done what it
you know what they promised and we
operate independent we have not been we
have not had the benefits of their HR
system or their IT system or various
other delights we do occasionally have
to fight back a little bit because they
IV does tend to creep up the wall if you
don't watch it to be frank but it's
worked very well and I think today
accredit and also to know were wrapping
up and there's defecate you can still
send more questions and as we're
wrapping up I think both of you been
traveling a lot recently Samar and you
were recently out in the United Arab
Emirates I think almost this time last
week even and you read the global space
Congress any takeaways there for the
audience anything that we found
interesting oh I'm not sure but I think
what was
really interesting there you know from
taking away an awful lot of sand the the
thing that was really interesting was
the you know their problem is building
capacity in the country and it's a small
population relatively small they want to
look at a post hydrocarbon economy so
they want to build capacity at the
moment the skilled capacity once it
starts you know once their universities
graduate people they leave for Europe of
the US and what they want to do is to
keep them they want to stop that brain
drain and what they did is to take a
very imaginative and quite a bold and
courageous leap and say right we want to
have a reformed a Space Agency we want
to set a national goal of having a Mars
mission and this is from a country which
has yet to build a satellite and I think
this is I say courageous but it has
inspired the younger people in that
country they can see that there is a
long-term goal a reason for them to stay
there a reason for them to get excited
and join and try to create a space
community in their country fantastic
thank you and Steve you're out in Deer
Valley at the Morgan Stanley tech
leaders summit recently too so not just
space bit more than that as well I need
anything to call your attention any well
yeah that was actually back to back
weekend there's a AI in fin tech
conference then Morgan Stanley and then
straight to Peter Diamandis is abundance
368 where I saw that means it's lumping
them all together I saw you know the
latest one wet terminal and and a really
interesting drone flight demo by
Qualcomm where they have a 1 watt
processor with the neural network and
all the flight controls in it for local
control of a fully autonomous flying
drone with you know conflict avoidance
and you know follow me kind of
functionality all in in vehicle as
opposed to some networks larger
computers so just another reminder by
the way that there are dedicated silicon
architectures that take at Moore's Law
curve that I showed you at the beginning
to the next level if the application is
something like machine learning they're
deemed blue deep learning we were
investors in Nirvana which Intel BOTS
and as well as movius which Intel vowed
to do that and then we have a new one my
newest investment is analog chip company
of all things to just radically increase
the power consumption improve the power
consumption of these neural networks
when deployed in things like satellites
or
Amazon echo devices things like that
both image in invoice kinds of
processing engines so those those
silicon advances those component
advances we as investor always keep an
eye out for even if they're being
deployed in a robot or being deployed in
some other application because there's
so many cross-pollination opportunities
so many fungible applications of a good
vision system in many different
industries from you know medical imaging
to satellite imaging and in fact the
neural network you build in many cases
has fundamental lower level constructs
be at the edge detection pattern
recognizing elements that if you train
it in one set you can now suddenly jump
into a new area with a head start and so
we're trying to get our head around this
these lateral process learning so that
Google takes great advantage of that's
like their whole business strategies
based on this but where else can we see
it within a portfolio of smaller
companies that are applying that in all
kinds of different industries and so it
was a lot of things like that um even in
areas outside of course this particular
area yeah I mean I think just ahead on
India you know I think this is a bit of
a sleeping giant in the space side
because they have now got a very firm
direction to commercialize and open up
their space industry and the
applications and so forth so I think
we're going to see India emerging as a
major space player in the
not-too-distant future alongside others
of course and we're getting close to the
end of the session and I have one final
sort of wrapping up closing remarks from
you both but blue sky thinking what do
you think is next but not just the sort
of material industry side but what would
you like to be next where would you see
us in a couple of years from now where
would you hope we are in small SATs and
in space and the commercialization I
mean really what would you want to see
no I I sort of tried to look ahead I
don't know whether it's it's not ten
years it's not possibly not 20 but it's
30 40 years there will be sustained
habitation on the Moon and Mars moon
first
I suspect Mars later you know we now
have identified that there are
substantial resources of water on the
moon and this fundamentally changes the
game that means you don't have to carry
everything there with you it's now
possible to envisage as you know
sustained habitation there and that's
going to require
an international effort but I think
there are real opportunities for the
commercial sector because whilst the the
government agencies perhaps are going to
take the lead in possibly in manned
spaceflight but we see actually
commercial players coming into that as
well there's going to be a lot of
infrastructure needed there's going to
be in more communications there's going
to be positioning there's going to be
you know in situ manufacturing and so
forth these are incredible opportunities
for the commercial sector I don't think
it's ten years I wish it were but I
don't think it is but somewhere you know
between the 10 and 50 years it will
happen well interestingly that's almost
exactly the answer I was going to give
except with a shorter time frame um but
the same goal the same motivation the
same dream which is you know we can
become a multiplanetary species we
should do that on the path to a
permanent Mars colony we could very
easily as you point out and perhaps on a
shorter timeframe and lower budget do a
test run on the moon for a variety of
reasons there are some arguments and
discussions on whether it could be
economically self-sustaining for variety
of reasons you know you could do a
railgun put things in low-earth orbit
from the moon more easily than launching
it from Earth there's a lot of
interesting things and I think he's
exactly right that the discovery of
water and some of these recent missions
just in the last five to ten years
spending on you know both the Indian and
US missions is a game changer especially
at the polls there's you know this again
there's was there was this retreat we
did with folks from all over the space
industry and every NASA base and to get
all these different minds together to
really pencil out you know if we use the
latest and greatest of Institute
resource fertilization and 3d printers
on the moon of maybe inflatable habitats
from Bigelow and of course you know
SpaceX launch costs factored in the
current model not older launch costs it
really did start to pencil out and you
have these even the specific crater lip
on the North Pole what was a period or
was it the South quad Freight which one
it was where you have permanent Sun
right it's permanent sun exposure for
solar if permanent shield for ice and
perhaps even a delta T you could mine in
a Stirling engine yes just everything
the obvious place to put it so you don't
need prospecting missions you just like
go there and and start with a robotic
pre you know it's pre built and I think
that's gonna inspire people like never
before so we all get very excited about
lower cost GPS or earth imaging and I do
think the world at large is going to be
a
the earth imaging side and the world at
large will be amazed by broadband
everywhere but when you put a colony on
the moon or mars
that gets people's attention right like
that is a big hairy audacious goal that
is one of those checkbox items in human
evolution kind of like the opposable
thumb right he is coming like that was a
big moment and I think it'll inspire a
whole new generation of people and kids
of all ages I think of myself as a kid
so kids of all ages to dream big again
and so I'm really excited about that I
wonder if there's one other disruptive
thing that might come on which is not
particularly associated with a
commercial side but that is you know I
suspect that sometimes in the next ten
years we might well discover an
independent form of life somewhere and
when that happens I wonder what is going
to be the psychological impact on
humankind and also whether it's going to
spur space exploration or cause us to
retreat from it and this might have
ramifications away back into the
commercial sector which we haven't yet
thought about so I just think that might
be one of the unexpected left-field
shots that comes in not-too-distant
future and there might be commercial
companies entrepreneurs heading out
there to provide science back to their
government customers be fantastic well
ladies and gentleman please thank you
Steve Jarvis and thank you sir Martin
sweetie
we're breaking for lunch and be back at
2:00 thank you very much to the panel
