familiar with many to many of you but
I'll just give him a quick intro he's
worked at Google since 1999 he started
out building some early versions of the
company's search and advertising
infrastructure and he's built a whole
lot of other cool stuff as well more
recently he's become tangled up in
artificial neural networks and he now
leads the Google brain research group
which works on machine learning
welcome Jeff thanks thanks for having me
and most excitingly Jeff has come
straight from the airport
straight from Seoul Korea where he has
been part of the team watching the
software alphago take on the go world
champion it's two games up right now yes
yes that's very exciting it's uh it was
quite an atmosphere that Koreans like
there go quite a lot and there was an
unbelievable amount of press interest
and it's actually pretty tense watching
the game like but yeah so far it's going
well for the computers but he's a very
good player so write and tell us a bit
about what it's like when you're
watching enough or go play so you have a
have a look into alphago's thinking as
it works and it's taken how the game is
going that other people can't see from
the outside right yeah so I mean it's
always assessing what the probability is
that it's going to win from the current
board position so you can kind of see a
little graph like going out for dipping
or going up that's you know kind of
interesting to get that kind of
real-time view of what it assesses its
chances are okay and the demine team who
built this you said it was ten so with
it they weren't sure they were gonna win
going in I mean they don't really know
like as they've never played a player
that strong right so I think it was
mostly ya know and they were reasonably
confident because they'd been assessing
the system strength in other ways and it
looked pretty strong but and also just
the kind of mundane things like their
network connection from the hotel seeing
that first move come out was also a
relief I guess okay no they haven't
triply redundant network connections but
right
alphago is poised to take the match
they're taking a break today
they play again tomorrow what would it
mean if the world human world champion
it gives way to a machine world champion
well I mean I think go is kind of the
last unsolved board game because it has
so much more complexity than chess and
your chess was done by a bit blue at
about fifteen years ago now but goes
kind of remained the main bastion of
human human mastery over computers in
board games and so this was kind of a
big event in that in that respect okay
and we've heard a lot in recent years
about new benchmarks being set very
significant new benchmarks being set by
a machine learning and what kinds of
fields particularly in perception images
and speech and that kind of thing we
we're living in this moment whether it
seems like maybe machine learning and
artificial challenge and sub bounding
forward is that fair to say yeah I think
one of the things about the machine
learning field in the last five or six
years is that it's unlike a lot of other
fields of computer science it's very
fast moving at the moment
you know another field people tend to
submit a paper to a conference and then
like nine months later when the
conference makes a decision they'll post
the paper on the web or something and in
the machine learning field people tend
to put out their research almost
immediately on archive which is a public
paper hosting site and other research
groups top labs around the world all
digests that paper almost immediately
and within a week or two you'll see kind
of improvements and changes and
enhancements of that work put out by
other groups and that that I think is
really remarkable that kind of like
weekly improvement in sort of the
research people are doing the results
they're getting it's pretty amazing
okay and as well as pushing forward
these research results your group will
say work so I'm trying to spread these
new techniques so you want to move them
and you have move them very quickly from
you know fresh research papers into
actual deployment people using it yeah
let me show our first slide so you know
our group started in 2012 to really look
in earnest at you
deep neural networks in both for
research purposes to understand what
their capabilities would be in lots of
areas of perception of language
understanding but also to use them in
real products and over time we've worked
with some of our product groups to kind
of integrate these things into products
one of the first products we worked with
was the speech recognition team that was
in 2012 and they rolled out a series of
enhancements using deep neural nets to
really improve the speech recognition
accuracy and then we worked pretty
closely with a bunch of image related
teams so our street view team and image
search teams and over time other teams
would see the success of you know
applying machine learning in that way to
their particular team's problems that
are similar to theirs and so they would
kind of come to us or come to that other
team and say hey that sounds similar to
us so we've had this nice smote
snowballing effect now and one of the
really nice properties about neural nets
is that they're really broadly
applicable to a whole bunch of different
areas you can kind of feed them
different kinds of training data images
or speech or text and really get very
different kinds of models but the
fundamental technology is the same right
and there are so many examples here and
it seems like it's popping up in all
parts of the business is it just that
people are able to take on problems that
were intractable before are you also
seeing these networks beat out existing
models that were in use and it's a
little bit of each so I think in a lot
of cases especially in the perceptual
domains Falah specially in computer
vision you know the system we just
didn't have systems that could do enough
to make real products out of in other
cases we already had like you know spam
classification or things we already had
machine learning systems in place and
we've now replaced those systems or
augmented them with with neural net
systems that work better but that's a
bit more of a you know kind of an
improvement in capability rather than a
completely new product area or product
okay and a lot of particularly lately a
lot of these deployments build on this
system tensorflow
so yes and and you decided from the
beginning even before you started to
build it you wanted to make that an
open-source package released to the
world so tell me how how that came to be
why do we need 10 split sure so in 2012
we started building our first system and
we kind of used that for about 4 years
for all these different deployments and
then based on what we learned we wanted
to make a system that was as good as our
first system in the aspects that we
liked but also had some nicer properties
with respect to being able to really
easily express lots of different kinds
of machine learning models our first
system wasn't super flexible and so we
decided we would develop tensorflow our
second generation system and we'd also
open-source it because we felt like the
ability to exchange ideas with machine
learning researchers outside of Google
was a very powerful one being able to
sort of publish a model or a publish a
thing alongside our research paper just
makes things much more tangible and
allows people to build off your work
much more readily ok
and so tennis if I was released last
year people are already building stuff
with it yeah so in November last year we
released it it's actually now the number
one machine learning repository and
github and people have done all kinds of
different things with it so this is one
of I think 800 different github
repositories that use tensorflow on
github that lots of people in the
external community have done this is
that if you saw Jeremy Howard Howard's
talk about the making of taking a photo
and rendering it in the style of a
particular painter this is a tensorflow
implementation of that that someone has
done using tensorflow so you can get
penter flow and then dip this repository
and presto you can you can do that
yourself or modify that code or whatever
it's pretty nice
ok and so a lot of the projects with
newer art and maybe a side projects but
you think tens flow is going to be
something that people use in production
in all types of businesses as well yeah
one of the one of the principal design
principles we had when building it is we
wanted it to go be able to go from sort
of easily expressing research ideas but
all
so take that same system that you've now
hopefully got that was research results
from and then put it into production and
have it round in a bunch of different
kinds of settings so some of our
deployments are running on a mobile
device actually running the model on the
device some are running in data centers
you know you can train on a single
machine or you can train on a large
collection of machines if you have them
so it's meant to be pretty flexible in
that regard okay and so there will be
different and very large groups like
yours with a lot of resources will use
this but startups can will build on tens
below as well everyone will get a chance
either yeah it was the most forked
repository on github last year despite
being out in November so I say that's
essentially so you've worked with
machine learning for a long time
describe to me how this technique is
gonna be different so it used to be
something that was very specialized and
hard to do there was a small group of
wizards that you had to hire if you
wanted to get into this and now well
what would it be like in a few years
like everyone in the industry will be
able to just yeah so I think you know
there's a kind of a collection of things
there's some of the researchers and our
team worked on this interesting research
problem for example of being able to
take an image like that the pixels of an
image and being able to generate a human
level caption of that and so that that
bottom sentence is what the model
generates given those pixels and if
you'd ask me you know four or five years
ago can you computer write sentences
like that about about an image I would
have said man I don't think so but
actually it turns out that these models
are very powerful and and we we can do
that so I think there's several levels
of kind of ways that people can take
advantage or use machine learning one is
sure a machine learning researcher
tensorflow at a low level is really good
because it's flexible and allows you to
use you know Express exactly the kind of
machine learning model you want and try
lots of things there's kind of a middle
level of people with problems for which
machine learning is applicable that are
similar to other problems that other
people have already solved using machine
learning like
maybe you have an image classification
problem but your classification problem
is you want to distinguish you know 100
tons of mushrooms so you can take an
image model that someone else is trained
and just collect some image some
mushroom training data and start
training on that data and use that
without necessarily being a machine
learning expert you sort of change some
file names and you start training and
and the way you go and then there's a
third class of people that I think don't
even want to do that level of machine
learning they just want something that
allows them to take advantage of the
kinds of things machine learning can do
so as an example that we've recently
released our cloud vision API so this is
an API that anyone can use you just
upload an image and that come a bunch of
interesting annotations on that image so
for example if you upload the image on
the Left will tell you we think that's
running and likely to be related to a
marathon and on the right we can find
faces in the image and we can tell you
you know that person's happy and that we
find text and the image that's clearly
pretty useful you don't need to read
know really know anything about machine
learning even though it's using machine
learning and recovery so I think there's
these three different levels and over
time you might see people who are using
this level move down a level and want to
train their own models or people
training their own models might want to
do more sort of research and explore
kind of a variety of different kinds of
models for their particular problem so
right ok
and as some as it becomes easier some
people say that data is gonna become an
even more important resource I mean that
seems to be I mean that's so important
right you can't train a model without
data and now it seems like building the
model might be the easy part yeah I mean
I think one of the things that's really
helped push the the vision community
forward for example is the availability
of the image net data set which is a
publicly available data set of you know
a few million photos labeled with tags
like running or marathon or whatever and
so I think having data sets like that
publicly available really pushes the
community forward
and certainly you know there's public
datasets often people within their own
companies have data stored in some
storage system that could be used as the
training data for a machine learning
system you know if people have
information about customers and they
want to predict you know which customers
are likely to spend money in
november/december or something that's
you know readily doable with data they
probably already have right that's
that's an issuing point there was over
the last few years there are some giant
silos of information that powered up and
now there's some new tools to apply them
and you mentioned how the research on
images has moved forward very fast I
mean it's it's really impressive stuff
like that captioning but there's so much
still to figure out right
Joe is beaten but you know lots of other
problems we can't build systems to take
on what are the big open research
questions for your group looking ahead
over the next five or ten years right I
mean I think the one of the main
unsolved challenges in machine learning
is how do you deal with unsupervised
data data where you're training a model
and you don't
and super vies training you have an
input and then you have the desired
output for that model for that example
so you would have an image like that and
it would say you know that's a marathon
but an unsupervised ADA you just have
the image unsupervised training and so
how do we take advantage of the fact
that there's a huge wealth of data in
the world that is not labeled by humans
but could be used to augment the
training we have for the limited number
of labeled examples that we do have
right so that's one of the key
challenges I think okay and in terms of
kind of other application areas that I
think you're gonna be exciting I think
the area of Robotics is gonna be really
important now now that computers can see
clearly it's gonna be really important
for robotics I think healthcare has got
a lot of interesting applications of
machine learning right that have a lot
of potential okay and then speak a
little bit about language that seems
something like something where if
there may be some quite near-term big
steps Ward I know that you work people
in your team have been working on
translation yes
I don't recently there's the I think at
least one person is site for this today
the smart replies function in in Gmail
yeah so actually that that's a good
example of a research project that some
people in my team did to do translation
basically mapping one sequence onto
another to another sequence and the
framing in translation is the first
sequence is like an English sentence and
the desired output sequence is the
corresponding French sentence or
whatever but it turns out that framing
is pretty general you can use this for
emails so the input sequence would be
the email you received and the output
sequence would be the reply you're
likely to generate right and we're now
sort of working with our translation
team to see if we can scale this up to
the production translate product I think
we all will have some good results
coming down the pike there but that is
not yet using the neural translation
bottle okay I look forward to it I only
have time for more questions so maybe we
could loop back to where we started
which was with alpha go you meant you
mentioned that go seems to be the last
board game to fall what hmm
it's assuming it's useful to set up
these big challenges what's um what's a
good target to take on next well I think
things that require taking actions in
messier spaces like dough is a very
clean space there's you know you know
200 places or something you can move on
the board at any given given turn and
the real world is much more complicated
and Messier you know it's not like
there's exactly 200 discrete things I
can do you're sitting on the stage so
figuring out how to build more
intelligent systems that can operate in
these Messier environments I think is is
one one one technique that the demine
group is probably going to pursue is
sort of more complicated games like
Starcraft I think demos as mentioned is
a likely next target that has some
interesting property because you can't
observe the entire state of the game
based on your view
you have to kind of remember what's
happening off the screen in some sense
and and develop sort of higher level
abstractions of that data so things like
that I think you're interesting you know
I think robotics will actually generate
some Messier settings when you actually
have real robots rather than simulated
robots okay good so we can look forward
to more high profile matches between
humans and machines yes perhaps for the
benefit of all okay good stuff great I
think that brings us to the time so Jeff
from anyhow for joining us today sure
