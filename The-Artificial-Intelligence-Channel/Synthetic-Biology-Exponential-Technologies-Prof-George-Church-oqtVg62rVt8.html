things that I'm obsessing about recently
one is is a global warming and the other
is you know augmentation we've talked a
little bit long vacation in the last
video and for conferencing that video
recording you did but you know global
warming is something that strikes me as
a very interesting social phenomenon
scientific challenge because what you
have is for the social side you've got
this case where you've got denialism
which to me is more important I mean you
have the nihilism on a bunch of points
you know you have denial of the
Holocaust you've got denial of evolution
but those aren't things that necessarily
in and of themselves impact our lives I
mean it's very heart-rending and callous
that they deny the Holocaust but as long
as they don't add to that a lot of other
racism nobody's gonna get really hurt by
it and evolution even people in my
companies you know which work on
evolution on a daily basis like I have a
company called in evolve it has
evolution in this title I imagine that
we could probably populate that company
mostly with employees that are
creationist and they would still get the
products out because you know you follow
a recipe and and even though you're
doing evolution you don't need to
believe it right and maybe the very very
top scientists it would help if they
actually believed in neo-darwinism or
something but anyway so that you have
this so those are curious things where
people fight about them and have deep
feelings about them but they don't
really affect day-to-day life global
warming is something that that could be
catastrophic
you could argue this in the same
category because you can't prove that my
life today is worse because a little
warning but it's something where it
could be exponential I mean the odds are
against it maybe but we don't really
even know how to calculate the odds it's
not like we're playing blackjack or
poker you know something like that it's
it's like that's that there's more
carbon in the Arctic tundra than in the
entire atmosphere plus all the rain
forests put together and that carbon
unlike the rain forest where you have to
burn the rain forests to release it that
carbon goes in the atmosphere as soon as
it as soon as you get melting and your
sous already many Giga tons per year
going up and so that's something it
could spiral out of control
and all of almost all the suggestions
even for the most sort of ultra
concerned citizens almost all the
suggestions are not how to prevent a
exponential release but how to slow down
the inevitable and and that's kind of
like it's kind of like the extinction
problem if you don't have a way of
reversing it it's not so much we have to
have the extinction it's that if you
don't have a way of reversing it then
you're fighting a losing battle and
that's not it's not psychologically a
good thing it's hard to get you know
enthusiastic funding for it and and you
will ultimately fail so so so you know
whether it's solar panels or you know
not using your SUVs as much of not
buying SUVs having smaller houses just
all these things are slowing down the
inevitable and it's hard to get excited
about the other thing that that that I
think is problematic socially is the
whole idea that is Inconvenient Truth
I think if some extent Gore's phrase is
brilliant but another extent it's it's
counterproductive because the people for
who is inconvenient don't want to
believe that don't believe this thinking
they don't want to deal with something
that's inconvenient they want they don't
want to give up their SUVs in their in
their steak meals and so forth and so so
what would be better would be to talk
about a convenient solution whether or
not that's the real solution or the best
solution but just talk about it so you
get you get acceptance first you need
acceptance before you can get to the
best solution any other problem the
other part that makes acceptance
difficult is blame is people will say
it's not my fault and that and that gets
confused into it's not anybody's fault
it's none of our faults it's not it's
not it's not anthropocentric it's not
caused by human beings you could make an
argument it's not your fault because you
weren't around during the industrial
revolution
you didn't personally do that much you
know you're you're just 1 7 billionth of
the problem at most so you could make an
argument that you're not person but but
then expanding that to no human being
has had anything to do with it is where
things go off the tracks but it really
the the thing that got us into the
position of denial was the blame game
it's like you know you want everybody to
be inconvenienced because it's their
fault it's that's two strikes against
you I don't know if you've you've read
the righteous mind that and he makes the
point that that that most people even
very people that consider themselves
very rational they're they're not using
a rational argument and then deciding
they're deciding and then using the
rational argument to rationalize and you
know a lot of what he says sounds
obvious once you restate it but the way
he says it backs it up with with you
know social science research I found
very
illuminating if not compelling and
anyway so I think that's what happens is
that the elephant as he refers to the
thing that's making your decisions in
your life is deciding that this person
is telling you that you're responsible
for something you don't feel responsible
for and it's telling me that you have to
sacrifice many things that you don't
want to sacrifice that person is
inconvenient and they're incorrect from
your viewpoint and there's and you're
gonna ignore them and them and the more
they insult you and your way of life the
less you're gonna listen to them and
then you're gonna make a bunch of
rationalizations about about that so I
think that these are these are why we
have also let's reframe it is you're not
responsible necessarily oh but here's an
opportunity here's an opportunity let's
let's say nature caused this global war
and maybe this little warming could get
worse let's not even say that it has
gotten to a horrible place I mean we're
at 400 parts per million maybe that's
too far but let's just say that it could
get much if you get exponentially worse
that risk is very high because if it
keeps going exponential you'll
eventually consume all of the carbon
dioxide and all the methane that's right
below the surface and we know there's
tons of methane in the cold water and
that that could be released and methane
is 28 times by the way worst global
warming gas and carbon dioxide so all
this stuff could result in melting of
all the ice and then and then you could
get to tap temperatures that aren't
necessarily without in in in the
historical record you know we keep kind
of there's a tendency to say to use the
history as indicator of the future and
of course the sec warns us against doing
this you know
investing in stocks but there is a
nonzero probability that that we could
go somewhere that is without historical
precedent I mean look at Venus I mean
Venus has the atmosphere that's you know
95 times higher pressure and
temperatures that would carbonize life
and at one point something must have
happened in its history that had never
happened before and was irreversible at
that point and we don't want earth to
turn into Venus I don't think so
so if you stop blaming x' and start
talking about opportunities what could
we do let's say it's it's natural we do
lots of things that are unnatural I mean
it's natural would be the left weeds
grow all over the planet instead of
planting crops the fact is that was an
opportunity it was it's not your fault
that the world was was not covered with
beautiful crops it's your opportunity
the cover it would beautiful crops and
this and the same thing would happen is
if an asteroid were headed our way or if
we had seismic information that there
was going to be some supervolcano it
wouldn't be your fault but you wouldn't
you wouldn't deny the possibility of the
human race should band together and
solve the problem proactively
anticipating possible disaster even if
it's not guaranteed even if it's not
guaranteed that sir is gonna hit us but
if it's big enough and it's headed our
way we would band together as as a
population that fight it so so then so
then then how once you get past that not
my fault it's not and it's not
necessarily inconvenient it's an
opportunity then you get to the science
and engineering aspects which i think is
more interesting probably started
seriously in
90s when I got interested in
photosynthesis we published some papers
together with penny Chisholm who's a
professor at MIT on the most abundant
photosynthetic organism on the planet so
there are you know on the order of 10 to
the 23 of these organisms on the planet
it's a mind-boggling number of them and
they were and nobody knew about them
before penny started working on sheep
and people would look at the ocean and
they'd see something that looks pretty
close to sterile I mean occasionally a
fish would would float by but there's if
you if you scoop up the ocean you'll
find diatoms and a few heterotrophs
various kinds of phytoplankton and
zooplankton of things that the whales
might filter feed but it it's not that
dense it's not like what you would get
from a pond covered scum covered pond or
from you know the excrement of animals
which is solid life
solid bacteria you know more bacterial
cells in just two kilograms of your
intestines than in the whole rest of
your body but in but anyway in the ocean
even there's a dilute there more of
these photosynthetic organisms in the
Russell and the reason people missed
them is because they're so small they're
even smaller than the bacteria that
people notice you can they just look
like little blips
on in the microscope they look like they
might be a mistake or a little speck of
something that isn't real but what she
notices they were highly fluorescent and
Sheila and
and eventually figured out how to
culture and they don't culture very well
either so even I used to think of the
ocean as a as a harsh and dynamic
environment and anything that survived
there had to be very versatile and could
handle all the the this differences in
storms and different sunlight but these
things are really really fussy fragile
creatures even though they're the most
one of the most abundant creatures on
the planet
and if you get the ion concentration or
the copper concentration just a little
bit off a little bit too much or too
little they say yeah I'm out of here I'm
dead forget about it no so they're very
they're very fastidious for the most
part these cyanobacteria these
blue-green algae
um anyway that's how I got it's one of
the things that got me interested and of
course I was interested in even before
that as a as a kid it's a teenager you
know when when Earth Day was getting
started you know that was that was
obviously interesting but the my first
scientific papers on it were having knew
these sign in the bacteria and I think
cyanobacteria might be part of the
solution as well to the problem yeah so
how does this relate to my genome work
so the way we met penny is we were Tecna
we were technology developers I mean
most of my interesting collaborations
came because I had a technology and
either people would would seek me out
too so they could use the technology or
I would seek them out so they would have
a good use for it and I had Department
of Energy funding ever since I've
started my laboratory in 1986-87 but in
fact it's the only grant that I've had
continuously since 1987 and and it
started out those developing technology
for the Human Genome Project and then I
thought that wow this department of
energy we should be taking this
technology developed with Human Genome
Project but really isn't in the purview
of the Department of Energy I mean they
have a health effects component but much
more in their realm was like organisms
that
and energy and the biggest energy
creators in the world the ones that take
solar energy and turn it into a form
that's useful that humans are these
photosynthetic organisms and the
cyanobacteria turned out that they fixed
light as well or better than the land
plants under certain circumstances ideal
sort of zenith they can be maybe seven
to ten times more productive per photon
so anyway I think I sought out pennies
because I was I had this genome hammer
you know I had a set of tools for
analyzing genomes and transcriptomes the
RNA and proteome so DNA RNA proteins and
I thought we should apply it to
something that would be a benefit to the
energy community to of energy and Penny
and I collaborated until there was a
reorganization of the Department of
Energy where we were encouraged to get
separate grants rather than doing it
together on one grant but it left a
lasting impression on me because she
came from a very different culture and
it she was technically in the Department
of Civil Engineering at MIT no clearly
not a civil engineer but moreover she
was an ecologist she would issue it that
was issues who loves the oceans and in
these photosynthetic bacteria this is
her life and and so I learned to
appreciate it from her viewpoint that
was that was great but I but I'm always
a technologist the same way she's always
a biologist and and I kept thinking well
how can we use these cyanobacteria to
solve energy problems so one of the
companies I started was called Joule
like most of the biofuel companies it
was a it was a fitness I knew it was
going to be very difficult problem not
just scientifically and which I think we
did spectacularly on the science there's
gonna be difficult problem from a social
and economic
standpoint at any moment the price could
prepare all could be engineered downward
very it's just trivial for OPEC or any
any anybody else in the in the business
to temporarily drop the price to the
point where these stabilizes all the
competing technologies and then drive it
back up again at their leisure so but
anyway it struck me as an important
problem an interesting one I wanted to
become more conversant with it and so we
we both at Jewel and at ls9
we discovered ways that you could turn
carbon dioxide or other carbon compounds
into alkanes that is to say that the
things that make up gasoline and diesel
fuel they're they're they're long
polymer of carbons with hydrogen's
coming off there's a hydrocarbon and
those things are we figured out how to
make those in somatically
we found the enzymes that occur in
nature it was not obvious and both
companies had patents on on making those
alkanes and the survival of those kinds
of fuel companies have depended on them
creating more more valuable chemicals
not solving the energy problem
unfortunately and so some of them have
survived like a Marisa's and actually
actually thrive by by pivoting a little
bit from biofuels to you know flavors
fragrances other high-value chemicals
it's not in my main stream of technology
development or even in applications of
our technology but we do have modest
efforts that at a minimum help base
consciousness and move and sometimes it
takes a very a relatively small
suggestion or demonstration to make a
big change and certainly that's happened
to us in the past you know a small
contribution to DNA sequencing or DNA
editing
or DNA synthesis has caused you know
millionfold changes in the economics of
those fields in this case the one were
most known for which is a really really
tiny project in the lab but has gotten a
disproportionate share of attention it
in a certain way is performance art it's
like it's it's it's getting mammoths
getting cold resistance ok elephants to
stomp around and change the temperature
of the soil in the Arctic because you
know there's so much carbon you don't
want the soil raising temperature
there's experimental evidence that that
that sort of activity could reduce the
soil temperature but the fact is that
even if that were spectacular ly
successful it is just another one of the
many methods of slowing down another one
in other words if you lower the
temperature of the Arctic tundra you
don't reverse the carbon problem you're
missing the opportunity of improving the
or changing in an intentional way the
amount of carbon and other global
warming gases
it's like solar panels and belt
tightening efforts you know lowering
your comp consumption and things like
that it's it's just but for the
cyanobacteria on the other hand they fix
they turned carbon dioxide a global
warming gas into carbohydrates and other
carbon containing polymers which
sequester the carbon they do not they're
no longer global warming gases they're
not methane or carbon dioxide
the problem is that and they and they
turn it into their own bodies
problem is that it almost as soon and
they do they do it on a big scale so
they do it at a level where about
fifteen percent maybe of the carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere is fixed every
year
by these cyanobacteria which is roughly
the amount that we're off from the
pre-industrial era so if if all the
material that they fixed in a year or
two didn't turn back into carbon dioxide
we did have solved a warming problem in
a year or two but the reality is that
almost as soon as they divide and make
baby bacteria phage hit them and break
them open and they spill their guts and
then they start turning into carbon acid
other other things around them start
chomping on the the bits left over from
the phages so these phages are so if you
could make the sign of bacterial
resistance the phages then you might be
able to reduce that and even a small
reduction in that immediate turnover
from carbon comes in gets fixed in the
carbohydrates and then the cell
protecting those carbohydrates breaks
open and then all the hungry
heterotrophs around the meat sit and
turns back into carbon dioxide if you
could break that cycle even a little bit
you'd start sequestering carbon dioxide
yeah so where are these bacteria in the
real world they are in all the oceans of
the world all the lakes all the rivers
every every body of water is filled with
these bacteria now they're different
strains and different you know as fresh
water set and there's a deep water set
and so forth but the there as a class
photosynthetic bacteria and they are so
simple their point like they're they're
not colonies for the most part some of
them are but most of the ones I've
talked about pundit ones the two most of
the photosynthesis there they're in
rugged individuals they're out there by
themselves doing their thing
and carpet and they're at great risk the
phases are also reworked there's about
ten times mini phage pages which are
barely alive they're parasites they're
in every ocean and every week and every
stream as well and they're constantly
killing the bacteria so the the bacteria
the the the main that the the most
abundant ones sign a bacteria of
prochlorococcus is a particularly
abundant one they're so small that you
can't really see them under a
conventional microscope the ones that
we've been using for centuries there are
some super resolution microscope swear
you can see some detail and certain
electron microscopes you can see that
but under you certainly can't see a
naked eye you pick up a glass of of
ocean water doesn't even look green okay
there's no even there's not even like a
bulk measurement that makes it look like
they're there but under but if you could
but they are there you can see them with
electron microscopes and they're very
small and of course the phages that
destroy them are even smaller those can
only be seen by electron microscopes at
at the best resolution and they're just
they're tiny killing machines that that
really just have DNA and RNA plus
protein code and they go in and they
take over the self but slowly I think
you know the world has come to see what
an important part of the ecosystem is
but nobody really discusses it as a
serious way of dealing with carbon
sequestration and I could be completely
off-base but I think it's in it in in in
saying that we should give this a
thorough look is there a way that we can
harness this incredible amount of
photosynthesis and use it to turn carbon
dioxide and water into carbohydrates and
just have that sequester it's it's
ironic that one of the big efforts in in
biotechnology has been making
biodegradable plastics I mean that's
been considered a great success story
but ironically what we really want to do
is make non degradable or certainly not
not easily degradable plastics out of
the carbon density we want to sequester
carbon dioxide into things that don't
turn over and the problem with this
is is they they they do turnover the
phage break them open and then they're
with their guts open then all the other
bacteria eat them well they're intact
they're in pretty good shape so so
they're really good at fixing the carbon
there's not good at keeping it fixed so
if we could change that then the amount
of photosynthetic capability is vast and
we could quickly pull start pulling
carbon dioxide out of the out of the air
there are two options that that that
ties in to my research and in addition
to the older research where we had with
penny elucidated many of the
characteristics of these organisms my
newer research is about synthetic
biology where we can make bacteria that
are resistant to all phages
we've done a demonstration project and
you call I were to change senator code
where we've by I it's one of the the
largest genome engineering projects
where you have to change hundreds of
genes in a particular way this is not
just arbitrarily making a copy of a
genome is's engineering hundreds of
genes not one or two or a few so that
that you could change the code where you
could remove from the cell something
that they'd does depend on in fact the
cell depends on it normally couldn't
remove it from the cell it was an
essential gene but by moving around the
djinn of the code that's so-called
synonymous
so the codon table there's 64 codons for
21 functions 20 amino acids plus stop
and so that means there's extra codon so
you can move things around in that extra
space and then that makes it possible
for you to delete the thing that was uh
previously essential
now when the phage comes in it can't set
up shop it can't do anything because
it's missing something that it's
absolutely essential for it it used to
be essential for the host but the host
is
been taken to the shop and made it so
it's non-essential and deleted it but
the phage wasn't present during that
transaction and so the phage is still
dependent on it and so it can't grow not
only can't grow it's so messed up by
this change that it can't even evolve it
can't it's not so so like you know like
you can develop drug resistant viruses
or even there's a constant warfare where
the bacteria becomes a little resistant
of the fades no stage becomes resistant
to the resistance and you keep playing
this little cat-and-mouse game but in
this case you've changes so radically
the phage can't evolve this is most of
this is a pretty strong theoretical
argument some of it is backed up by now
experiments as we've changed one we've
made one genome which is as it should
change to native code so how does this
go from the lab into the real world well
so this this the the organism we've done
the largest genome engineering project
on so far is e.coli it's an industrial
microorganism it does have a phage
problem and so the hope is that when we
perfect the strain which is resistant to
all viruses off you coli bacteria phages
that will then become the favorite you
coli to use in industry there's a bunch
of things we have to do to make sure
that it manufactures the things that
industry cares about as well as being
paid resistant because if we're just
fade resistant and didn't manufacture
well they're not going to take it so it
has to have all this so that'll be the
first probably the first product that
where we engineer something and it gets
into the real world via resistant to all
phages so they don't even have to worry
quite so much about ages they certainly
don't worry phases they've never seen
before
which is a profound thought that you can
be resistant to viruses and phages
you've never seen before you don't have
to make a specific drug or a specific
vaccine or pacific strategy for that
that particular virus then so then then
we need to do it again but now on new
bacteria
maybe starting with other bacteria that
are have industrial agricultural
significance like bacteria involved in
the dairy industry yogurt and cheese
those have a big phage virus problem
then you might want to do it on these
cyanobacteria these photosynthetic
organisms and show that you can make
them resistant to phases and determine
whether that increases their
productivity whether they now fix a lot
of carbon and the carbon stays fixed
there's a there and and what's
interesting is this doesn't necessarily
involve vast amounts of money I mean it
could it could I mean it could save vast
amounts of money I mean we're talking
about essentially the entire economy as
it is at risk but like many things in
early-stage science and engineering it's
highly leveraged you know you know a
hundred thousand dollars or you know a
couple million dollars can get you a
breakthrough that is transformative and
self fueling from that point on the once
it's obvious you've made the break
through that makes it obvious then then
there's plenty of money there's plenty
there's plenty of will to scale it up
even though this might make sense from
an existential risk standpoint it might
make sense from from a society-wide
standpoint it could be a tragedy of the
Commons where we can't figure out how
individuals can benefit how individual
companies or countries can benefit we
can see how if we did it would be a
great benefit especially would be a
great benefit if the most were if you
have an exponential increase in
temperature and releases of global
warming gases but I'm always looking for
the win-win you know something where you
don't necessarily have to sacrifice
where you don't necessarily have to make
crazy investment and I and I think that
you know the biofuels was one strategy
wasn't it was we
knew there wasn't necessarily a an easy
path where you get companies interested
in engineering these organisms another
one might be carbon credits to the
extent that those are accepted this
would be a good way of achieving compras
but the final and I think the most
interesting way is if you take the
carbohydrates that these organisms make
and turn them into something valuable
notice if you have something is that is
non biodegradable and a value
so-so so you take the advantage of fact
that these things are self-assembling
that that biology tends to build with
that it can build very large structures
with very little management so if you
want to have a forest you pretty much
just don't interfere with it and you'll
have a forest right it might in the
ecology might go one way or another but
it is it will fill the land with
photosynthetic organisms unless you
interfere with it on a regular basis the
same thing could happen the ocean with a
little little nudge is you could have
this is very whimsical and intentionally
playful but you could have these things
fix the carbon into a structure that was
valuable so let's say a bridge across
the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans
right you could make floating cities you
could make things that have intrinsic
value and that because of their
self-assembly nature don't cost a lot of
money they can involve as much if they
can create as many jobs as you want to
create but they don't have to you could
conceivably do it where the bacteria are
doing all the work just as in the forest
if you have you know if a if a volcano
or some other or forest fire clears the
land you don't have to do that much it's
gonna it's going to create a forest
there so but here you'd have to nudge
some kind of engineered way but again
the engineering and the science behind
isn't mess isn't nearly a isn't even in
the same league of cost as most of
industry and all the money that that is
at risk due to temperature change well I
think any book that is about or adjacent
to an existential risk needs to or
ideally would raise consciousness about
the raise additional risk it might cop
in my the goal might be to calm people
down or it might be to rile people up
but you should ideally the book should
either come to a conclusion or argue why
it's premature to come to a conclusion
about whether this is a sufficiently big
existential risk to to apply resources
now you know when I look at all the
existential risks and I kind of am
obsessed with with the basic idea I
think we should want to at least think
about existential if we're technology
developers in particular we should think
about those part of our time some of our
time should be set aside to talking to
the public some of us should be set to
you know ethical standards and safety
and security and part of it should be
towards big existential risk questions
even if they're low probability of
happening during our lifetime or kids
but especially things that could happen
exponential that could happen much that
could speed up and I and it seems like
almost everything that I get close to
and care about is exponential and and on
a time scale that's interesting meaning
that these Exponential's and computers
electronics DNA reading and writing
these are all things where I'm seeing
million fold changes in less than a
decade I can imagine that happening with
some of these other
I mean an asteroid could come out of
nowhere we would have very little time
to react global warming could go
exponential we would have roughly little
and reactant much better and in some
cases it's better to overreact to a an
imaginary problem or problem that could
materialize than to under react and not
have enough time and then because you
start making bad decisions when you
don't have enough time so for example
y2k we don't know whether that was a big
crisis or not it turned out it was a
fizzle in the end but was that a fizzle
because we reacted to it in advance that
many of the things were safety engineers
and security experts are most effective
they get least credit for because they
were so affected the no one even ever
knew was a problem right anyway I think
that the reason that we pushed back on
existential risks where we have unknown
or low probabilities is because it's
going to be inconvenient because it's
going to make us have to sacrifice if we
can come up with a win-win however where
we don't know the probability but we
know that the consequences are huge but
we can come up with a clever solution
that doesn't require much sacrifice it
doesn't require a lot of money to fund
the solution doesn't require that the
solution doesn't require us to give up
all of our sacred cows or any of our
city and now that's easy to say order to
pull off but there but I've seen them
again in my life I've seen many cases of
win-win you know so rather than having
the gut-wrenching decision of whether we
should sequence your genome or mine at 3
billion dollars we just said let's just
bring it down to a thousand dollars and
then we could do both of them right so
that's a win-win we didn't have to have
a big national debate as to who gets
sequenced and who doesn't you know we
didn't have to have death panels as the
you know who gets the benefit from those
new technology who doesn't
so for AI I think the main risk from my
mind is it's not so much whether we can
automatically understand what they're
thinking it's whether we're capable of
teaching them ethical behavior we're
barely capable of teaching each other
ethical behavior we're barely capable of
agreeing on what it is but over long
periods of time and over large numbers
of cultures we tend to agree on enough
that things might even be improving that
they're they're acceptable they're
acceptable enough so that our population
is growing our middle class and even
maybe our upper class is growing in
numbers and if Steven Pinker is correct
about than others about violence
decreasing maybe you maybe our ethics is
good enough even though he can't reach
consensus maybe it's good enough but we
bring in a wild card and let's say we
teach octopus we genetically engineer
octopuses brilliance and can manipulate
bombs and rockets and things like that
we have no idea how an octopus leaves we
have no idea of why it would why it's
all ethics would align with ours at all
if we teach a dog we've got a slightly
better chance than dogs are a little bit
more aligned with humans a little bit
closer but if we teach a piece of you
know silicon we don't know that they're
that they're going to to follow our
rules and you could say well well we
want the salute they won't necessarily
be doing huming pass they'll be you know
they'll be calculating big psalms
numbers they'll be doing all the
statistics that are really boring
they'll be doing you know advertising
oh wait about doing advertising that's
sort of the influence human life oh
they'll be they'll be guiding drones
well monster that could affect the human
being
it'll be manipulating markets
okay so they're starting to do things
that could really impact our lives
they're not just doing boring
Kanaka tennis we better make sure that
their ethics are somewhat aligned with
ours and since we have introduced our
own ethics to consensus or mathematics
it's all done by gut feeling it's no
matter how much rationalization we've we
wrap around it it's mostly good feeling
it's mostly it's a combination of
instincts and deep culture admittedly
multicultural but there's something that
we have in common that which is right
Thresher so I am doubtful that we can
guarantee or even come close I mean we
never let guaranties interfere with
technology we always do take the
technology we're very greedy um but I'm
I'm pretty sure that there will be
general consensus maybe that that this
that we can't teach these things ethics
so the alternative is teaching ourselves
how to be as clever as the machines okay
so rather than trying to teach them
ethics teach ourselves to do the tasks
that they're currently doing and it's
not so far-fetched because right now for
a machine to be a human at jeopardy or
NGO or chess which by the way aren't
really what are not really tasks that we
need to do right they were always sort
of luxury show-off bragging things right
I mean except for game playing and it's
an end in itself our ancestors did not
depend on being able to win those games
they they were representative of
intellectual skills that would be
beneficial like the ability to be a good
business person but in case in order for
a computer to win at those games they
have to use a hundred thousand watts of
power continuously while a human brain
is using 20 watts now admittedly the
body of sin is using another 80 watts
and maybe that body you know has
creature comforts that require some more
wallets but the fact is we're we're very
energy efficient for doing this and by
the way we're doing a lot more than
losing the game of chess CO and jeopardy
where we're worrying about our family
we're worrying about our career were
worrying about existential risk we're
doing all kinds of things that computers
can't yet do so the thing is we're ahead
and biotechnology is going faster than
computer technology so corporations are
kind of like machines and that they
corporations behave like people they
have some of the rights of citizens
they've been granted certain rights but
they're also like machines and that they
don't that we don't know that the ethics
of companies are going to perfectly
coincide with people the difference is
that those are machines made out of
people and so there is some hope that
you could that they might more naturally
align their ethics with with the
population and the some extent even when
people talk about evil corporations what
they really mean I think is that the
customers that are supporting the
corporations want things that are not in
their own best interests that words like
you know I would but if if if I bought
cigarettes I would be supporting a
company that's that's giving me cancer
but I'm the one that's doing it I mean
maybe they did an ad campaign that
sucked me in that makes an evil but I
paid for that ad campaign ultimately so
but anyway corporations can have
probably ethical problems because
they're composed in a way that's not
culturally and biologically aligned
perfectly with the people that make up
the the corporation and I think that
could happen with the big five eight you
know AI related companies or it could be
that they
are perfectly aligned with the
population hypothetically in terms of
ethics but they don't know how to teach
to the machines ethics there might even
be a consensus that's drivable on the
about the importance of value alignment
and there's so many people that think
about it at all think end up in that
direction it may be something we could
agree on as a goal but we may not be
able I think very few of us would have a
clue as to how to actually achieve that
full it's like we can all agree them be
nice to all of us but we could get some
agreement that would be nice to
eliminate poverty diseases of poverty
diseases in general etc but we don't
know how to we can't write our recipe
for that and I think the same thing goes
for value alignment we can agree that
this kind of a cool thing but how do you
do that how do you convince yourself
you've done it
we are definitely living in exponential
times where many of these things are
reinforcing each other we're getting
we're using deep machine learning to
accelerate our biological research we
might soon be using the biological
research to accelerate the production of
better algorithms like we have a grant
from IR PUC that's aimed at improving
visual deep machine learning by figuring
out exactly how a rodent processes
visual information in its visual cortex
that could result in much better
algorithms it could be that some of the
brain initiative projects or other
projects that allow us to build brains
allow us to build human brains that are
more consistent with our ethics but
still capable of doing advanced tasks
like artificial intelligence but now
you'd have to call it you can artificial
intelligence has the connotation of
silicon-based you'd have to give it a
new name
you know super intelligence or or human
based intelligence to distinguish it
both from artificial intelligence and
human ability I think the safest path by
far is getting humans to do all the
tasks that they would like to delegate
to machines but we're not obviously on
that that that super safe path but
anyway this is confluence of of
technologies where we have auto
catalytic cycles that is to say either a
particular technology feeds on itself so
I can use biotechnology to find new nano
machines in the wild turn them into new
bio technologies though we can use those
by technologies to engineer new bio
technologies you get a little tight loop
where we can have a bigger loop where
the biotech where the artificial
intelligence will help us build bio
technologies will help us build an
artificial intelligence but other point
is all these things are all I kill
within the init the more of them we have
the more we get and it just goes
exponential that can buy us all kinds of
medium to short-term benefits because
it's going so fast now it it's not
unusual to be able to get breakthroughs
that allow us to that may allow us to
conquer malaria Lyme disease by
engineering the animal vectors of those
to secure our transplantation crisis by
engineering pigs to be humanized enough
so that they can be organ donors that
may have its own little autocatalytic
loop because because it's hard to debug
enhancement in human beings you can
enhance the organs that pig organs so
they're resistant to debark to viruses
resistant to senescence resistant to
cancer maybe cryo preservable in a way
that that normally and and you can work
out this whole preventive medicine this
whole enhancement medicine in pigs that
are involved they're headed
for industrial ill people so it's
there's no ethical the the ethics is
well aligned desperately ill person you
want to give them the best organ you can
including enhancements to it all that so
that there's that's a whole nother
possible loop that would result in
enhancement of human beings that it may
save us from enhancements of non-human
beings and I think that's a very
important important all this all these
loops that make us more intelligence
possibly more ethical may also help us
see opportunities they're staring us in
the face the opportunity of whether or
not you want to deny our involvement in
Clarke in climate change there's an
opportunity there for getting the
climate to be what we want it to be
where we want it to be and just like we
wouldn't miss an opportunity to deflect
an asteroid we wouldn't miss an
opportunity to improve the crop
productivity we're probably not going to
miss the opportunity to make climate
what we want it to be there may not be
immediate alignment on that but there's
a remarkable level of alignment even
when you play the blame game and the and
the belt-tightening game that came out
of the the courts the United States is
not a signatory for or it was a
signatory and it may not be in the near
future nevertheless there's enough
consensus there and there would probably
be even more consensus if it were a win
win that didn't require sacrifice and
did involve preventing something that's
going exponential if it's going accident
so anyway I think all these things come
together in a time of exponential change
it's not necessarily some panacea
you know that's full of abundance and
and you don't have to think about it and
it's easy but there are some win wins
if he had if we think about it deeply
and we talk about it as if science was a
real thing rather than something that's
inconvenient</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
