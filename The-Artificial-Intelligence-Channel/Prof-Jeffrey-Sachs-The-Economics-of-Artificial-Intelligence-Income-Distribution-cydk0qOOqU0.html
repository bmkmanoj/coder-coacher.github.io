danny has convinced me that a computer
should have written my paper for sure
filled with biases and noise no doubt
but basically on the opening act of a
series of papers today on the
macroeconomic implications of the
digital age and artificial intelligence
specifically and my basic point that I
would like to argue is that its macro
economically important it's very evident
in the data for decades and a lot more
is to come and the questions of what
happens when machines replace workers is
a very real and important question not a
fantasy and it's not something for the
future it's something that's been
underway for a long time I think it's
probably right to say in in some sense
that the modern high income world
economies and especially the US economy
have been playing out the introduction
of the general purpose technology of
digital information for the last 60
years and so we're watching a revolution
that continues to unfold and the
revolution has not lost any steam it's
that's a mixed metaphor I guess in GPS
it has not lost any bits or any depth
it's probably accelerating because of
the ability of machines to substitute
for very sophisticated work and so I do
believe in a kind of not quite
singularity necessarily but an
acceleration and I think that it shows
in in the labor market so I have three
basic prop
positions one is that machines can and
do substitute for labor automation is a
real phenomenon it is obscured in the
way we learn economics because the
cobb-douglas production function in a
solo growth model doesn't allow for it
so it takes some decades to overcome for
me at least what I learned but there are
ways that are sensible to model
automation and it is a pervasive
phenomenon that's that's number one
second and very importantly smart
machines embody skilled labor in the
form of R&amp;amp;D and direct expertise so
there is that complementarity of skills
and technology that we observe and have
talked about for decades but it's not a
kind of mysterious production function
formalism that just happens to have the
right kinds of partial derivatives it
comes from the fact that experts produce
machines that substitute for labor and
those experts are therefore in demand
because they produce a significant
market value and they displace a lot of
Labor and then the third point that I
think is important and where there's a
lot of expertise in the room and a lot
of speculation about the future is that
the evolution of smart machines has
followed a discernable path up until now
and now there's a big debate about what
kind of path it will follow in the
future the general point that I think is
correct is that machines have tended to
be able to displace labor that have two
qualities one is relatively low skill
activities at the beginning so brute
force activities and manual labor and
second is repetitive and pretty
active activities and so the usual
classification is along the lines of
expertise or skill or cognition of some
sort but I'm sure that that's a very
difficult axis to define in that way and
the other is repetitiveness there too I
think it's a little bit difficult to
define because it's not as if workflows
come automatically in one form or
another we make workflows repetitive and
so we redesign our lives to work with
the machines and so it works in not a
simple linear way I read a book review
of a new book I don't know if the
authors in the room but it didn't make
sense to me what was quoted which is it
said when will when will smart machine
be able to read the instructions on an
Ikea box and assemble the the furniture
and the answer that the author gives in
this thing is well not in this century
and that's absurd because IKEA is going
to redo its instructions so that the
machine can do it it's going to be
machine readable design quite quickly
probably within ten years or less that
you could redesign the instructions so
that it is completely adaptable but up
until now I would say machines have been
able to replace relatively lower skilled
kinds of activities and now as Danny
said I'm sure they're gonna replace
economists soon in many many areas and
probably research in many areas because
I don't know about you but I can't keep
up with five journals much less fifty
thousand journals but machines won't
have any problem doing that so I think
that we will find ourselves in a happy
world where our work is being done for
us by others which sounds pretty good to
me actually
there's just a slight mackerel problem
which is I want to own the machine that
does it and so there's a little bit of
income distribution that we need to get
clear so we haven't seen this
dramatically until recently and the
discussion in the profession has really
only come intensively I would say in the
last 15 years because up until the 1990s
or so caldor's stylized facts and a
laborer augmenting technological change
solo model was still our working model
in our heads and it seemed to be just
fine that productivity went up wages
went up prosperity went up and all good
things went together and if you're in a
cobb-douglas world all good things have
to go together basically no matter where
the productivity comes from and that
worked pretty well up until the
beginning of this century you might see
a slight downtrend and then many many
kinds of data show that productivity
continued to rise and wages stagnated
and then we looked back and said well
it's actually even a little more
interesting than that because certain
classes of wages stagnated not just
since 2000 but back to the 1970s
actually and we all came to understand
that high school graduates haven't had a
real wage increase or real compensation
increased for 40 years now and so the
story started to get richer and richer
and I would argue that what we have seen
recently is a manifestation of
automation broadly speaking and it's a
manifestation of something that's been
going on for a lot longer than the last
17 years but it's been obscured by
aggregation essentially so we have to
disaggregate
the economy and it turns out both
heuristic aliy and statistically that
there's a pretty good disaggregation and
a number of the papers use something
like this the goods producing sectors
agriculture mining construction
manufacturing is a good aggregate
constructions a little bit of an outlier
because it's been harder to automate
till now but agriculture mining and
manufacturing are the Machine age power
excellence because a lot of what the
machines do is both brute labour they
literally substitute for hand picking
and agriculture or moving products
through an assembly process in in
manufacturing and they're pretty
repetitive or as I said you can redesign
the workflow so that they are repetitive
I don't think anyone would have thought
assembling an automobile as a repetitive
activity before the assembly line made
it a repetitive activity so you redesign
the workflow so that it becomes
automatable in that in that sense then
there are a series of basic business
services that really in a way our
ancillary to the goods-producing sector
they're not really final demand sectors
on their own wholesale trade transport
warehousing
retail trade are how to get those goods
to the market and they have often a
little bit higher level of expertise
than in the production spear I they have
less predictability of activity mainly
because of the human interface and
that's the big barrier that's being
overcome now machines did not talk to
people
effectively until 20 years ago or 25
years ago in our first 10 years of
talking to machines was a pain in the
neck and now we're used to it still is a
bit of pain in the neck but as Danny
would say less than talking to other
people
there the machines are a little bit more
predictable and so that sector is very
much linked to the good sector personal
services are typically low skilled and
workflow is a little bit harder to
handle
now professional services is the sphere
of high-level expertise that writes the
code that develops and designs machinery
it's advanced engineering it's advanced
medical skills up until now though all
of these are subject to themselves to
eventual displacement but typically this
has been very high expertise and very
low workflow predictability and
government I won't get into the
philosophical argument about whether
this is a high skilled low-skilled
predictable or unpredictable activity
but I I think it's actually almost
completely automatable definitely with
less noise and but I'm not going to deal
too much with the e governance right now
now if you disaggregate by these sectors
then you see some pretty striking
differences and the main point is that
the labor share of income which I
believe can be thought of and in a
moment I'll argue it more formally but
can be thought of as an automation
induced phenomenon has been underway
pretty seriously for the last thirty
years at least and probably longer I
didn't have good consistent national
accounts data to to draw on for that but
that's this is the goods-producing
sector and several papers note
the automotive sector which has been
replayed were assembly line workers have
been replaced by robots but it's pretty
pervasive especially through the durable
goods part of the manufacturing sector
and certainly in agriculture where it's
basically been almost completely
mechanized and we have no more coal
miners almost because all of that is
subject to almost complete automation
the red line is the basic business
sector trade wholesale trade transport
and so on and there's also a more
gradual less noted down trend of the
labor share of value additive factor
prices the other sectors don't show that
trend at all and if anything the
professional sphere which has been the
fastest growing part of our economy over
the last 50 years is a very high labor
share of value and even slightly rising
so when you aggregate this you don't see
this effect jumping out as sharply as I
think it deserves to be noted and my
argument would be it's been this sector
where smart machines have done their job
up until now and they're coming for
these sectors now so we can learn a lot
about the implications of what's
happened here for what's going to happen
in the future well one of the things
obviously and that's quite obvious and
important is that if a certain class of
labor is displaced and it's basically
been lower skilled labour high school or
less say now even some college is
basically getting the same returns as
high school until you get a bachelor's
degree there's really not a even a break
almost anymore in the data there is of
course a tremendous supply response and
one of the most important macro
questions is how elastic is that supply
response
and that's really a question of how
educate Abul is is a population are
their underlying skills and cognitive
limits and aptitudes that will earn
long-term rents or is this all perfectly
substitutable on the margin so that the
extra year of schooling earns the same
rate of return as basically any other
asset in the end we don't know the
answer to that but what we do know and
what I would argue is that the dramatic
structural change doesn't just show up
in it doesn't show up in unemployment
first of all that's the wrong place to
look of course unemployment has to do
with the supply side people want jobs so
they'll find jobs even if they're very
low wages at very low end it shows up as
a withdrawal from the labor market and
going on to the dole in some way but the
idea that the that what we're looking at
with automation is the loss of jobs is a
misunderstanding we're looking at
whether the labor demand curve is
shifting in or out in other words what's
happening to real incomes
it's the much more interesting question
but even that depends on the supply
response of workers at different skill
levels so the other huge shift in our
economy of course is that massive the
increase of educational educational
investment at which we undercount and
you know in multiple ways because we
don't count the opportunity costs we
don't even count it as investment but
this has been a huge transformation and
actually yeah so share of employment by
education shows that the low education
that's by standards in this room is
below a bachelor's degree and that's
declined from about 85 percent of the
economy to about 65 percent which is a
big change over a 40-year period and the
share of earnings by education is
obviously an even bigger change because
the wage gap between low skill and high
skilled workers widened as a result of
these
processes what we see is that an initial
steep widening narrows over time because
of the lagged supply response of
education and in the end whether it goes
all the way to zero is basically the
question can everybody ultimately end up
with PhD if that's what the market wage
differential is is is indicating so the
basic idea that I think is helpful here
is a an increasingly well treated idea
that production is a series of tasks the
series of tasks are filled by
occupations the occupations typically
require different aptitudes skills and
training and these different tasks have
different degrees of of susceptibility
to automation so in the simplest case I
in the paper which is still being
written there's a goods-producing sector
and it has production and non production
tasks so P and N and it has buildings so
I say that buildings are complementary
to labor but machines are substitutable
for labor we don't this is crude but it
is emphasizing the point that capital is
not simply complimentary to laborers in
a cobb-douglas production function
certain kinds of capital are pure
substitutes so I say that the production
side can be carried by labor or by
machines
similarly the non production activities
supervisory activities can be carried by
labor or by machines but to be in the
non super non production part requires a
higher level of skills and the quality
of the machines which is given by a
parameter here
that's the evolution of this technology
and typically non-supervisory work up
until recently has not been as
susceptible to automation as production
as production work so in the simplest
model I say it's only production workers
who are less educated workers who are
vulnerable to vulnerable to to
automation and then my aim what I'm
working on is a parameterised computable
general equilibrium model for the US
economy basically a one-digit si si
model that allows for this kind of
substitution of different kinds of tasks
over time and recognizes that those
don't fall from heaven as technological
manner but they require the inputs of
the R&amp;amp;D sector so there is a boom of the
R&amp;amp;D sector in the US economy empirically
and consequentially for the distribution
of income because people with PhDs are
the best paid people in the country and
they're producing the automation that is
putting their counterparts out of out of
high wage work and that's the dynamic
politically and and from an income
distribution part of the economy if you
simulate this kind of phenomenon I this
is not to be taken seriously because the
parameterization is not serious yet but
this is an example where there is a the
single parameter that is being studied
here is basically the introduction of I
would call it a GPT in the sense that
the productivity of returns to R&amp;amp;D go up
and so there's a parameter that
determines how productive R&amp;amp;D is that's
the only parameter but it's designed so
that is
intellectual property Rises the first
jobs that go are the more easily
automated jobs and over time you capture
more and more of the labor force so the
first effects of this are a boom of
higher education a boom of wages of
engineers and a loss of wages of those
on the assembly line
who continue to work but at lower pay
that works out overtime with a
supply-side response on education so
that more of the economy becomes
educated the wages of unskilled or the
labor demand for unskilled workers
continues to decline the next step
kicks in where a higher skilled Cotter
of workers faces automation that starts
the decline of their real wages the
labor share of income continues to fall
and so forth
what is the end point of a story like
that and I'll just conclude here the end
point of the story is that all of this
is potentially welfare improving in the
simple sense that the output capacity of
the economy is expanding but it's of
course tremendously disruptive in terms
of growing income inequality and to get
the a Pareto improving design requires a
significant and growing amount of
redistribution so the bottom line of my
story is that this process is underway
it's been underway in a significant
sense for several decades and we're
probably in a period where it's coming
after our jobs too and if we manage the
distributional consequences of that that
will all be great because while all of
our computers have the next conference
we'll all be having a nice cup of coffee
in the coffee shop next door thank you
hey thanks for having me here to speak
I'm here to talk about education and AI
I'll respond a bit to Geoff's paper but
it arrives sufficiently late that it
basically place no constraints on my
content whatsoever so I appreciate that
but I read the broader set of papers and
I think what I'll talk about fits into
the conference writ large
so you know the the question I study the
economics of education and I think an
important question for what you're
talking about in this room is can we
increase the number of highly skilled
people using the education system so a
lot of what you are talking about all
depends on us being able to create
workers who who know how to learn and
who are not immediately made redundant
by each improvement in technology
otherwise we're going to end up with
this labor immiseration
situation highly unequal economy you
know our classical model would be as
their returns to scale and education go
up education Rises as well with the most
academically able obtaining that
advanced education and in that world we
got nothing to worry about
so I'm gonna tell you instead what world
were in so these are statistics from the
Census organized by year of birth of the
share of the population that has
obtained any college and that's the red
line and has obtained a BA and in my
world the NBER economics of education we
include this among the skilled folks so
now I'm even more depressed right
because this is now being classified in
and your categorization as most of them
being unskilled alright so you can see
that number has risen considerably we're
up to probably more like 70% at this
point and this is
entire cohorts so this is you know the
net product of whether people finish
high school and then go on to college so
this is driven not just by increases in
college entry conditional on on high
school graduation but increases in high
school graduation about 90% of the
population graduates high school at this
point as you can see the BA completion
rate and this is BA by your early 20s or
so it has increased a lot less and I'm
showing this by birth cohort rather than
for the entire economy because this is
essentially where any increases in
education come from very few people
return to school in their 30s or 40s if
we're going to see increases in
education it's going to come from birth
cohorts coming through and increasing
education levels so that might be more
up to 29 30 32 at this point but not
much higher okay and then within that
what you've been talking about is highly
skilled of course is a graduate degrees
and that's an even smaller cut of this
this group this is this just cuts the
same thing by gender so this is any
College and here you can see that it's
women who have accounted for most of the
recent increase in college attendance
and this is even starker when we look at
the BA so male ba attend attainment has
been essentially flat for about three
decades so most of the action is coming
from women and obviously if you're not
completing a BA you're not going on to
get that proce graduate work either so
this is these are the numbers we're
currently working with ba is moving
quite slowly and that's what we've been
talking about and Jeff talks about is
basically the middle skilled the growth
is also highly uneven if you have in
your mind that what's going on is
basically the the smartest kids are
rising to the top here's some statistics
by income so this is by your family
income as a child we're breaking the
population up into four quartiles this
first second third top quartile this is
those born in the early 60s
and then this is people born in the
early 80s and this is college attendance
now and you can see that college
attendance has has gone up across the
board
eighty percent again this is just this
is unconditional on anything this is
just the entire population here's ba so
we've gone from 5% of the lowest income
group getting a BA to 9% and this is
during the era between these two periods
it's when financial aid expanded
enormously higher education expanded
enormously so we got a lot basically
it's the it's it's it's highly skewed by
income and this is not simply explained
by the highest income kids say having
the best academic skills this is
organizing ba completion by low SES high
SES and what you can see is in the low
SES kids with the highest scores just
41% of them are getting a BA which is
basically the same as for the mediocre
rich kids okay so we've got a system
that is that is essentially replicating
income when it comes to who's getting a
BA now can we fix this by one proposal
I've seen and several the papers you
know make College free and then
therefore everything will will get fixed
and we will have more people going to
college and indeed you know tuition
crises have tripled over time but net
evade and for those low income students
tuition prices really haven't changed
much at all so I'll jump through these
quickly but believe me when I say that
basically the cost of attending college
for the lowest income students has not
been going up very much in recent years
so I'm just gonna leave you with this
with this figure up as I as I make my
final points the extensive margin as
we've expanded college education in the
US has been in very low quality schools
so we have not added to our Harvard's we
have not matt added to our University of
Michigan's we have
really add into our University of
Massachusetts you know our our expansion
has been in the community colleges and
in for-profit colleges both of these
have extremely low graduation rates and
this is not just a u.s. phenomenon this
has happened in other countries as well
where the college sector has expanded it
has done through so not by adding more
public capacity in terms of universities
but by letting the for-profit sector do
it and it's been an unmitigated failure
in every country that's tried it so it's
not gonna be the answer the private
sector is essentially not going to fix
it we need to build institutions public
institutions so changing the price
students smart students by themselves
cannot get themselves a college
education no matter how cheap it is
manipulating the price is not going to
do it we need to build colleges that are
good colleges that can train those
students and then let them attendance so
this is a supply constraint as opposed
to a demand side constraint in terms of
us getting more people into college and
it's not just at the college level so
what we're seeing from the evidence is
that we can increase graduation rates
increase skills by improving the
college's instruction the institutions
themselves we can also do so by
improving k-12 education why that's even
easier of course right
so what we have ahead of us if we want
to expand the population of skilled
workers is not manipulating prices but
improving government institutions
through tax spending building thank you
so it's great to see these papers on
this really important topic I want to
ask both both Jeff and Susan the the
about how things are different now than
before both of you sort of looked at the
historical series but a lot of this
conference is about how AI is different
I think David autor is here and he's
talked about polanyi's paradox limiting
what what machines can do I there is and
I've been saying more about the end of
polanyi's paradox in the past few papers
which is this idea well just to remind
you polanyi's paradox is the idea that
we all know more than we can
tell that it's hard for us to express
and write down and codify things that we
know about how to recognize a face or
ride a bicycle and that has for most of
history put enormous constraints on what
we can teach machines to do because if
you want to code you have to codify you
have to be able to express what it is
you want the machine to do of course as
we heard yesterday we're seeing a new
paradigm machine learning the end of
good old-fashioned AI where you had
symbolic or good old-fashioned
programming where you codified exactly
what you wanted to do and instead the
machines are figuring out on their own
not just how to play the game of Go but
how to have a data center that is has
40% less cooling than any of the humans
could figure out or many other types of
applications so I want to hear from the
from Jeff in particular about how you
see that changing your your model in
terms of the role of educated people and
education and putting the information in
and see if those same trends should just
be extrapolate or if we're in a new a
new era okay so we're gonna collect
questions and then get response so next
is Rebecca Jeff my understanding is that
there's some discussion about the
declining labor share you're showing
that it varies by occupational classes
of course interesting but there's at
least some argument that some of the
decline in labor share is driven by
political changes a changes in the tax
regime changes in our transfer policies
and so on and I would like to invite you
to speculate about the interaction
between the dynamics that you identified
and the political dynamics in which we
currently find ourselves and and whether
that increases or decreases the odds
that we'll be owning the machines that
are running the conference as we're
having our cup of coffee I think I just
wanted to maybe double down on Eric's
point but be really specific about it
and related to something Joel said
yesterday I thought was very important
so in the one hand there's no doubt that
in some sense we in this room probably
may the degree to which the information
technology revolution is now just
hitting its stride right and so Eric's
talked about that very articulately in
many ways over many years but that in
some sense we all experience the IT
revolution basically like 25 years ago
but it's only today that it's really
washing over basically great mass of
jobs and activities in the economy I
think that it's really useful to
distinguish that I think Jeff's facts as
well as even the theory and I think how
you've been thinking about when you use
the word robots it's really about
automation and that automation is a very
direct consequence of the basic ability
of digitisation and the basic ability to
do kind of you know to basically set
that up I think that it's useful then to
distinguish that from the very specific
new thing that is multi-layered neural
networks and their particular
performance properties and the ability
to predict against very disparate data
sets that I think at least I took away
from yesterday as being at a much
earlier stage and so if you were in 1880
the real action in the economy was the
Corliss demon steam engine not the
electric motor yet even though Edison
was kind of doing all this we
misattribute the 1880s as the age of
electrification when it was in fact the
age of the actually distributed steam
engine and I just think that that is a
useful starting point but you know very
very interesting so I thought the
discussion about Sue's discussion about
education was interesting and great and
it reached relates to Jeff's points um
you know I think something we have
always been terrible at is that question
questions around you know what specific
educational skills should people be
investing in and maybe that's been kind
of okay in that the BA for a long time
has been the ticket to a pretty reliable
ticket to the middle class lifestyle and
I don't know if we've been thinking
enough about the question
weather changes in technology will lead
to really big changes in the riskiness
of educational investments in that you
know some people are going to invest in
skills that are just gonna be the skills
that are displaced and other people are
gonna invest in the skills that turn out
to be the skills that are slow to be
displaced and whether we have any way in
any previous attempt we have ever made
to be good at this has been disastrous
but I'm curious whether we have anything
we can say on that topic two remarks
about about education the first is that
I think it's important to distinguish
between the kind of educational sources
that actually create the technological
knowledge and those that teach the
population how to cope with it and how
to live with it and on the former I
would say you know most of these data
don't matter because technological
change is generated by a very small
segment of the labor force you know
there's a whole literature now on this
sort of upper tail human capital and
basically you know within you know five
or ten percent of the labor force at
most probably less most of this
technological change that we are talking
about is being created the reason we
should educate the rest is not because
they're gonna add all that much to
artificial intelligence or machine
learning or algorithm or anything like
that but they have to learn to cope with
it and there - and here I'm you know
undercutting the fact that I have been
teaching the University for over 40
years
I actually think universities probably
don't matter very much I have been
totally persuaded by a range of work all
the way from David Barker to Jim Heckman
and Janet curry they're actually what by
age six it's essentially over you know
that we you know that what you are going
to become in life what your capabilities
are going to be almost entirely set by
you know in utero early childhood and
you know and in very early education and
you know I just attended to talk to Jim
gave you know the data
really
blow your mind I mean it really is quite
amazing how powerful that effect is so
if we want to reallocate our resources
okay we should probably not necessarily
make sure that these curves keep going
on we should pump everything we have and
give people access to the best health
and educational conditions in the first
six years of life I want to give both
Susan and Jeff the chance to respond so
maybe we'll start with Susan and Jeff
will have the last word a good one to
respond to at the very end their
question can we can we educate people
was essentially your question right so
and indeed Heckman has a very firm early
childhood does matter a lot you know
numbers that show how large the gaps are
by socioeconomic status and how
persistent they are through school is
conditional on our current system of
course which doesn't do a very good job
change that so there are ways to improve
education should be about what our
system is doing right now and not about
what any biological constraints are on
the ability of people to learn or the
distribution of skill thank you
first I think it's absolutely right to
use a general category like automation
as a replacement of of labor by machines
as a very broad category and that has
been going on at least since the
spinning jenny for example which put a
lot of spinners out of out of work or a
gregorio machinery so it doesn't
necessarily have anything to do with the
digit
age of course with the with more
sophisticated computer-controlled
machinery and and all of the cybernetics
revolution so-called and the redesign of
workflow this linked more and more to
the digital revolution and that became
quite intense in many manufacturing
processes already by the 1960s and
certainly by the 70s and 80s
that's not artificial intelligence as we
use it today so I think it's really
important to make those distinctions
artificial intelligence of course is
also a very broad concept and the
breakthroughs I understand it really are
the machine learning breakthroughs of of
the last 10 or 15 years which are simply
unbelievable and unexpected it's in a
sense unexpected that you can actually
do language translation almost purely
statistically without needing a linguist
on your team and that's a phenomenally
great discovery and there's obviously a
lot of a lot that's going to come from
that discovery that's extraordinarily
rich what does it mean certainly the
most basic thing in my modeling context
it means a larger and larger swath of
occupations will be replaced by machines
and that will have all of these
ramifications for income distribution I
that I think are quite significant and
I'm very much of the view that were in a
big sweep of of technology as a result
of this what will it mean for the future
of jobs and education is of course what
we're really talking about in this macro
side of this issue and
when it comes to education I would say a
couple of things one is that as we just
heard between Susan and Joel I think the
the way to reconcile these different
positions is early childhood development
and growing up in a in a family
environment where you are tended to
decent nutrition low stress good
healthcare and a loving household gives
a lifetime of Greg a greater capacity in
those early years matter but taking a
high SES kid and saying we're gonna
really treat you well for six years and
then you're on your own is not really
conducive to good long term labor market
performance either so I think it's more
helpful when the parents help put the
kid through their ph.d program so I
don't see this really as a conflict
between early childhood development and
an education it does raise a big
question what kind of skills are needed
and there are two very different answers
to that question it seems to me and yon
already hinted at one of them which I
very much believe one is you could say
well the boom really is STEM education I
mean everyone should be coders probably
not for two reasons one is there will be
the supply response and then the incomes
will go down and probably coding is very
much susceptible to actually these same
forces so the other kind of education is
being human because maybe what are we
really going to be good at is
complimentary to the machines is that
the machines will be machines and we'll
be humans and so actually learning
things that are good for humans
maybe the humanities will become the
most profitable labor market activity
because all the stem stuff will be done
in your little box and what will really
count is can you make a nice poem can
you paint a nice picture and
can you be nicer to someone than the
robot that's caring for them so that
they want to be with you for a couple of
hours even though you're just a human
being
my guess is humans will not be replaced
on the human dimension by machines for a
while but maybe that's too optimistic
too if if I'm waiting for the second
season of Westworld I don't know if it's
out yet but so far I'm persuaded that we
still have a role at least as humans and
that's probably what we should focus on
so we need some humanities in the
training so that we remember what being
human is about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
