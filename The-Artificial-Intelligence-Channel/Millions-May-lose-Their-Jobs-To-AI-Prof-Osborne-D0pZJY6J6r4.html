worries me steve kelley is a heavy
equipment operator with son corps in
Fort McMurray and he's worried that AI
technology can put him out of a job
depending on how an automated fleet
rolls out with driverless trucks it's
hundreds of thousands of people we're
talking you know two three four thousand
people just in as salt truck drivers
that could potentially lose their
positions if I were if I were to lose
this position today and I want to be
clear I don't know that I would lose my
position today because we're not sure
where this this outcome is going on land
but if I were to lose my position today
it would it would definitely be a game
changer I don't know what would happen I
have to look at changing careers paths
it changes everything in the decades to
come there could be millions more people
like Steve researchers at the University
of Toronto's mowett Center say anywhere
from 1.5 million to 7.5 million Canadian
workers could lose their jobs to
automation in the next decade and
Michael Osborne says the real number
could be even higher particularly with
the rise of deep learning we've begun to
be able to do things using machine
learning algorithms that many of us even
within the field thought were next to
impossible
Michael Osborne is a machine learning
researcher and the co-director of the
Oxford Martin program on technology and
employment in 2013
Mike made headlines when he published a
study warning that up to 47% of jobs in
the United States were at risk of
automation now just four years later he
says some of his predictions have
started to come true with significant
political repercussions
Michael Osborne is in Oxford England
Michael good morning welcome to day six
good morning friend thanks for having me
on you have said as many as forty seven
percent of jobs in the United States
could be at risk of automation how is
that possible well it's possible due to
the enormous Lee rapid advances in
technology such as machine learning and
robotics that are already beginning to
have impact on the world of work so how
does your algorithm decide which jobs
might be automated right so in fact the
algorithm is one derived from machine
learning that is my technical background
right so we held a workshop in Oxford
and had participants label occupations
as being either emblematical e non
automatable
or
emblematical e automatable so the
algorithm went away and identified you
know speaking roughly that
characteristics of jobs like originality
or social perceptiveness were protective
of automate ability right and use those
judgments to make predictions for all
other occupations even in some cases
revising the judgments of the experts
themselves okay and for you personally
were there things that surprised you the
participants had labeled waiters and
waitresses as a non automatable
occupation but the algorithm came back
and identified it as highly automated
ball another example was economists
which again had been labeled in the
workshop as non automatable with the
algorithm then coming back and saying
the probability of as much closer to
5050 huh another surprising example was
that of fashion models right so you
might naively think that this is a non
automatable occupation but if you look
at the characteristics of the job in
fact it does seem relatively routine and
it's not entirely inconceivable that in
the not-too-distant future we might be
able to use computer generated models
for at least some purposes for the
purposes of advertising for instance and
those numbers came out in 2013 so four
years later in 2017 how does the
situation today compared to the
predictions you made four years ago well
certainly some of the occupations that
we'd predicted would be automated seem
to have some signs of in fact becoming
automated so one particularly
interesting example is that of waiters
and waitresses which back in 2013 now
algorithm had predicted as having a 94
percent chance of automate ability
another time we're a little skeptical
our only intuitions were that perhaps
you know the requirement for the waiter
or waitress to persuade a customer to
buy a say a slightly more expensive wine
at the table is not something that an
algorithm could readily reproduce but
actually we've started to see tablets on
tables in some restaurants that are
indeed replacing some of that human work
looking at how quickly things have
changed between 2013 when your study was
completed and now are you surprised by
the rate of change when it comes to
automation living within the world of
machine learning I think you'd have to
say they're advances in the last even 5
years have been startling particularly
with the rise of deep learning we've
begun to be able to do things using
machine learning algorithms that many of
us even within the field thought were
next to impossible so a particularly
prominent example is that of deep mind
success in
go with its alphago system we've also
seen successes in computer vision tasks
such as identifying faces in a way that
will certainly lead to economic outcomes
so you are skeptical of your own
algorithm but others are skeptical of
the number of jobs that you've been
predicting they say some tasks might be
automated but jobs won't necessarily
disappear and the result of this will be
increased economic growth and there'll
be an increase in productivity so what
do you make of that argument right so
I'd say firstly that this improvement in
productivity resulting from
technological change is not something we
should dismiss we need that productivity
growth ultimately that will yield the
wealth that will enable us to tackle
some of the social challenges we're
facing but nonetheless on this diagnosis
of some jobs being safe as a result of
only some of their tasks being
automatable we shouldn't lose sight of
the fact that even if only some of the
tasks within a jobber automatable the
skills required to complete that job may
change completely those are not
necessarily occupations we should
identify as immune to the negative
effects of automation so we are looking
at professional positions and
well-paying jobs but so far it's been
mostly lower class and very often white
male workers who've been affected by
automation so your colleagues analyzed
the effect that automation had on the
u.s. presidential election in 2016 what
did they find
right so reporting on the work of my
colleagues they found a direct link
between the fraction of work and a
county that was potentially susceptible
to automation and the fraction of people
in that County who voted for Trump and
that is adjusting for things like
immigration or gender or political bias
there are a number of controls that the
authors considered to their credit and
interestingly they even corrected for
Republican voting such that counties
that had more routine work were more
likely to vote for Trump than they had
been to vote for Mitt Romney
so let's look back because this is not
the first time in history the
technological change has uprooted the
social and political sphere how does
what we're seeing now compared to the
situation in Britain at the start of the
Industrial Revolution various authors
have looked at exactly what the
Industrial Revolution meant for the
average worker in England and despite
the enormous gains in wealth resulting
from technological change the enormous
improvements in productivity resulting
from things such as the threshing
machine that's been Jenny the
a steam engine these technologies did
not result in the distribution of those
gains to the average worker some
findings say that it took as long as 70
years for the average worker to see any
improvements in pay at all and in fact
in the initial 40 years wages actually
declined for most workers so at least in
the example of the English Industrial
Revolution that do seem to be some links
between those people who are most
affected by technological change and
those who chose to undertake such
political action as the Luddites did as
the swing riots demonstrated the
concerning parallels here are that
perhaps it's the impact of automation on
low paid workers in the u.s. that has
led to some of those workers fighting
for the outsider candidate of the now
President Trump so what we're talking
about Britain in the 19th century we're
talking about the United States today
but these are the wealthiest the most
powerful countries in the world in their
respective times what happens when these
forces of automation are unleashed in
unstable States or developing economies
what are the implications then so we've
seen other authors use our results to
find a correlation between those states
that have the highest degree of
political instability and those states
that also have the highest fraction of
their workforces at risk of automation
this is a far from a causal story but
nonetheless it is concerning it suggests
that as technologies are pushed even
into those developing nations that are
relatively unstable more instability may
be the predominant result so if the rate
of displacement by automation continues
at what you're predicting it will be how
is it going to affect political
situations in contests going forward so
I think here the parallels to that
English Industrial Revolution are quite
alarming in which you know technological
change certainly did result in political
instability with workers essentially
taking the actions they could to protest
at the reduction in the living standards
resulting from technological change and
here with the exacerbation of inequality
that seems to have been the result of
technological change you'd have to have
some concerns that we might see similar
things in the years to come
Michael Osborne thank you for being with
us a real pleasure Thank You Brad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
