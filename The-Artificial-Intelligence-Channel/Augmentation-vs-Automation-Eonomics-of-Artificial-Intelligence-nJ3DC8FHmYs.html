augmentation or IA with doug engelbart
once called intelligence augmentation
and wayback 1 1962 at the dawn of
interactive computing there were two
labs on either side of stanford
university john mccarthy who had fled
MIT because they wouldn't let him do
time sharing was trying to build an AI
on one side of campus and Doug Engelbart
was trying to augment humans on the
other side of campus and that created
two communities and they haven't spoken
to each other since so two in the brief
time that we have allowed we're going to
try to square that circle so our
panelists are Dimitri Papa Charo John
van Raden Kristen Van Vleet and Sophie
Van Van Brooke my worst challenge of the
day but Dimitri why don't you start
first of all thank you for being here
and I have this pictorial back which has
how we got to where we are today in
terms of technology stacks and landscape
and the reason why I have it here is
most people will see multiple
technologies that are kind of connected
with each other what I see is a pool of
talent this is where we draw people for
where we need to go next so people that
have been doing this type of work for
the last 15 20 years are the people that
we're trying to risk kill and obscure in
terms of bringing them forward with
artificial intelligence and this has
given us the foundation needed in order
to get there we now have a lot of
technologies that provide inputs to the
artificial intelligence process and
provide the data points required for us
to actually apply the algorithms and all
these I would say technologies were
played first in the retail market and
the consumer market and then made their
way into the back office of operations
and commercialized fully commercialized
so we all have been exposed to some
degree with a I threw through Siri and
Google and other applications and now
we're seeing that this is making its way
to the enterprise level so to an earlier
discussion we heard about
the prize grade I think that's how we
are bringing things forward first we
give them into the retail and for the
consumers to actually experience and
then bring them into the enterprise
level second thing is we're talking way
when we tapped a little bit earlier on
the topic of what does this will have as
an impact for jobs in the future and I
will tell you the reason why we're also
concerned about jobs is because we are
still thinking five days a week eight
hours a day with the thinking of in
terms of full term employment full-time
employment and that is not where we're
heading we are heading towards
employment for skills employment for
knowledge not employment for a role or a
task that somebody has to do and that
result is actually going to lead to much
more flexible working arrangements and
probably less time needed to perform
those activities
so the FTE is probably going to be dead
as a notion in the years to come because
we will not be working the same way we
worked in the past so the first thing is
we're gonna have the demise of
traditional design for organizations
it's no longer gonna be the paradigm
where individuals enter a company at
junior level positions and work their
way up because they're not gonna be a
lot of junior positions if we automate
these things so how are people going to
be trained how are people are going to
become experienced enough to become
managers so we have to think this as we
are progressing in this space second is
leadership how do you apply leadership
in a digital environment where you
actually have digital colleagues as well
as humans how do you reward people how
do you enable them to be productive and
last is the end of the apprenticeship
model people used to go to work for
tenure for pension and all these things
are no longer there people don't go to a
company and hope to retire there 40
years later people actually will join a
company and a millennial today's
statistics say they will probably jump
eighty ten times employment in their
lifetime which means about three or four
years per employer so with this
statistics in mind we know that the
paradigm of the full-time employee is no
longer there so how is this gonna come
forth and how are we going to make sure
that organizations actually enable
themselves to absorb this type of change
and the one thing that at Ernst &amp;amp; Young
we have identified is purpose purpose is
what drives innovation purposes what
drives progress and purpose is what
drives people to become more productive
and connected with an organization so
having purpose is in in mind as you're
designed this digital path and solutions
associated with it it's probably the
biggest differentiating factor that you
can think of the second thing I would
say that you actually have him know I
keep in mind is the ability to change
and ingest change train on change and
diversify we cannot be as inflexible in
what we do or what we think our roles
are as we used to be in the past we have
to become much more flexible much more
adapt to the environment that it's
around us I was not a technologist by
trade I actually grew up in nature
operations and slowly transition into
technology and eventually took an
interest in artificial intelligence and
robotics process automation this is an
evolution that is happening for many of
us especially at Ernst &amp;amp; Young we heard
earlier financial or it as a topic and
we as an organization to many of you we
are an accounting firm or we're an
accounting firm because we understand
that this is not how we're gonna survive
in the future so we are changing we are
becoming much more technologically
astute and we try to adapt our business
model to what we perceive the need to be
in the future so a lot of us are
upscaling a lot of us are changing and
that's in tune with what the market
actually dictates audit which used to be
our biggest business it's probably not
gonna be around in the next 20 to 25
years when many of the processes that we
used to
are now automated so with that in mind
we the topic of this discussion today's
augmentation versus automation and I
will tell you what we see in the market
it is heavy automation everything is
pointing towards automation because
everybody's looking for instant
gratification in the form of return on
their investment but like if we do X
what are we going to get back as Y and
that is the old paradigm the old
thinking again on Y we outsource 20
years ago and we sifted jobs overseas to
lower cost locations in order to capture
arbitrage it is purely let's do the same
things we were doing in the past but do
them for less money spend in order to
get them done and we are also seeing now
in the market that this is not the
solution 1 the return on the investment
may not be as significant or as high as
initially anticipated by doing just that
exact same shift the second thing is
there is not enough talent in the market
to make this automation shift happen
fast enough without changing the process
so many organizations are now struggling
to recruit and obscure individuals
within their organizations to meet this
demand this excess demand and I will
tell you there is a talent war going on
out there and in thankfully thanks to
MIT we are getting a lot of qualified
candidates in organizations like mine
but there is still a significant need we
showed geopolitically a huge shift from
where we initially thought that talent
was going to come in the last couple of
years so there is countries like Estonia
and Costa Rica that have gone to their
universities and change the curriculum
based on what they predictability matter
of the future so this is how deep the
change is and this how disruptive it's
going to be for many complement
countries many companies and many
individuals so ok my apologies ok so
move on to the next one
thank you Corinne thank you okay so
thanks very much for giving me the
opportunity to speak here so you you
might be surprised as an outsider coming
here because there's a lot of optimism
here but if you actually go in out onto
the streets or thoughts of many people
there's a lot of fear so the main thing
I think you experience when reading
newspapers or talking to people is that
people are very very fearful about what
the impact of new technologies are like
AI and many other things and this is not
new we've had these moments of history
where there's been many periods where
there's been a lot of fear of Technology
and my view is that the fear is actually
not over just technology is actually
technology is almost the displacement
from fear over many other things as fear
of fear of immigration that's fear of
trade and I think what this is rooted in
is the economic experience that people
have had especially over the last ten
years after the global financial crisis
and more you know actually more over the
last 30 or 40 years as Erik Brynjolfsson
said this has been a very tough time for
American workers with slow wage growth
over the last ten years across the whole
world this has been over other poor time
in terms of wage real wage cuts and high
levels of unemployment so many parts the
world so you know I think when we think
about technology as other people have
said there it has us you know is both
difficult to predict what the impact is
going to be on the labor market and as
always this inherent ambiguity so on one
side many of the new technologies create
new occupations they all give end skills
but even those technologies which kind
of automate skills which replace some of
the tasks humans do have this ambiguity
so think of it from a company
perspective if you have a new technology
which makes things more efficient
reduces labor costs yes you might
substitute away from labor and other
things by other hands you can produce
things a lot more efficiently which
enables your firm to expand that
therefore creates more jobs so it's the
play off of these two different things
which means that technology on the
impact of jobs is inherently ambiguous
and that's true not just at the firm
level but also the level of the industry
the
the economy and the kind of history of
the last you know two or three or three
hundred years when we've had a rapid
technological progress is a positive one
we haven't had ever claiming
unemployment in fact the economy has
been able to create new jobs in order to
keep unemployment at you know a kind of
similar level of fact at the moment
relatively low levels so the issue for
us I think from a kind of business point
of view and from a society point of view
is the quality of those jobs rather than
the quantity of those job that's what
waiters have is what skills people
people have and I think the big
challenge is I mean if you think about
what the economy is it's a way of
matching different tasks that jobs
require with the different skills that
people have and what happens with
technology is it you know it destroys it
destroys some tasks and creates new
tasks and therefore demand for new
skills so the the question really is how
you can move people to be able to
prevail to produce the new kind of
skills which required so you know my
mother actually worked in a bank she was
a bank clerk and you know a lot of the
jobs the bank clerk was actually giving
out money and taking in money when the
ATM machine came along that destroyed
those tasks but my mother's job didn't
disappear what you know what happened
for many bank clerks as they became good
at relationship managers they started
doing different tasks and banks and what
that meant was if you had the
flexibility to change what you do your
job didn't disappear at all it actually
could enhance your job and I think
that's a microcosm of what needs to
happen in society and the economy as a
whole we have to think of ways in which
we can enable people to move across to
those new tasks now that's not an easy
thing to do so even with the company
re-skilling retraining people is hard
when that requires you moving to a new
job in a new company or even moving to a
new geographical area into another state
that is a very difficult thing to manage
so I think from the the kind of policy
point of view what we need to think
about is ways of actually creating
resilience with people giving them
general education so they can shift
tasks it requires creating insurance so
people can more easily move job as
terrible if you lose your health
insurance if you lose your jobs most
kind
don't have that and it requires
compensation mechanism so for people who
do lose out from this it is a necessary
thing to kind of help them in that
process of adjustment so it's right from
a moral point of view for through no
fault of their own they lost skills they
need to be compensated for that it's
right for an efficiency point of view
because you need to create transport
infrastructure retraining re skills to
move them across although your economy
grow and it's also true for the pure
political expedient of view because
unless we do create these type of
systems which create resilience great
ways of people moving into new tasks
moving to new areas then the populist
uprising that we see all over the world
will continue I did in my own personal
brexit well I came to MIT last year but
the fact that the UK did brexit it's
part of this kind of challenge there
were groups who lost out that's made
people very very angry and that's
created the kind of social and political
problems we face not just America and
Britain of all over the world thank you
very much yes good no it are your slides
we saw them on there thank you the first
excellent all right thank you so I'll
pick up where that where that left off
with a specific example of what
automation versus augmentation means to
a sector of the economy and that's
manufacturing so I actually discussed
this in several different settings how
is manufacturing affected by what is
called digitalization in certain
audiences and you can see that I often
talk about this in the European context
where we spell digitized with an S so
you can if you'd like to watch a longer
version of this discussion in a
worldwide context I point you to the
YouTube video shown there but how this
affects the citizen and as well as the
the co-workers and the companies is
something that MIT spends a lot of time
thinking about not only for but
including AI and so AI as part of the
technologies that are within Europe and
Asia more commonly referred to as
industry 4.0
and many of those of you from companies
here today are familiar with that
language as well it has been promoted by
Charles Schwab and the world economic
foundation about thinking about how AI
and other technologies that provide
automation or augmented human function
will affect the workforce as well as the
economies and so we think about this a
lot I'll give you a couple of examples
of what that means to the citizen right
so you think about how your news comes
now from automated programs as has been
mentioned in the previous panel and that
you can carry that news around with you
and you may be checking for breaking
news right now as I'm talking right so
that access to information is important
that information can be used to get
around we use it to get around MIT you
use it to get around the city and
companies use it to move products around
so it affects the citizen in some ways
the same way that it affects the
companies but then it brings on these
consequences even for the citizen about
how much information to share with whom
so for example I have an eye robot in my
house it is vacuuming right now because
my husband has it on his phone where he
can control it from its phone but I
don't install that app on my phone
because I don't want that interface and
I don't want anybody to know what I'm
vacuuming okay so it's all up to
personal preference but these are the
things that Internet of Things and AI
brings into the citizen where they may
or may not be aware how much information
they're sharing with the company or with
others this gives us the chance to have
Internet of Things smart cities a lot of
ambitious approaches that seem like they
will improve society and they will if we
make the right policy choices as has
been mentioned but there's also
consequences to building this up and I
emphasize this because AI seems on its
face as a very clean suite of
technologies you're using information
you're using intelligence but there's
physical consequences to the products
that enable us to live those lives it
can be water diversion that affects
populations through dams
can also be the materials needed to
build some of the hardware that we're
using to enable all these all of these
applications so I show you here a mine
that's used to develop and produce some
of the materials metals rare earths
platinum group metals that are used in
the devices that you're using right now
and the devices that are used for AI
data mining so your data mining requires
mineral mineral mining I think that's
something that's important to keep in
mind and I'll show you another picture
of a different mine and a third picture
of a different mind these are in three
different countries one is China
one is Peru one is the US so to keep in
mind these these actual consequences of
building up these technologies at scale
these jobs are partially automated not
fully automated and so there's a
consequence there and then to the co
worker it means new ways of working
together and being trained perhaps more
in isolation and perhaps more with Co
BOTS ik's
it also means more complicated
structures will be produced so that's
the creative element that we've
discussed and then should the company it
means something very specific you're
able to produce products that are highly
customized very rapidly with increased
automation that can include some job
displacement but can more often include
more creative uses of the humans within
the factories and in these challenges
that relate to all of the manufacturing
investments made in the US and in other
countries I'm showing you here the 14
manufacturing USA Institute's that were
stood up in the past few years how to
think about how to rescale retrain and
augment the workers with AI is going to
be the challenge for this country in the
next 10 years
other countries are ahead of us in this
regard many countries are behind and so
working together through efforts like
the World Economic Forum helps us think
about the future of production that
includes the future of work and I and AI
okay real good good morning it's a real
pleasure to be here after Mike is after
25 years of Xerox Corporation I joined
IBM earlier this year in research and so
we about have IBM's revenue today comes
from what we call our cognitive
solutions business really looking at how
they should move it's not oh here it is
yeah it was a bit much how can as Tom
also said a lot of the tasks that
professionals do today are being
automated by AI for example if you are a
cyber security professional and have to
look up multiple databases to try to
predict where the next hack hacker is
what they're doing what's the next big
thing that's coming at you there's now
capabilities in fact that's being sold
also by IBM what's the security business
that can help security experts who do
this job more effective and efficient by
automating parts of the tasks or in
financial services as new regulations
come out having natural language
processing imagery learning at your
fingertips to actually read these new
regulations compare them to the old ones
and then adjust your processes within
your company
so these specific tasks will help
professionals do their work
significantly better and give them
significantly more insights and
knowledge to do a great job but many
companies I'm also on the board of a
company called idec's which is the
largest animal diagnostic company in the
world and and in ITEX we have moved AI
to the edge AI is going to be embedded
all around us and what happens here
there is a vet if you take your pet to
the vet often a vet takes plot these
blood tests can be done up to in the
veterinary practice or sent to the
reference lab but if the vet needs to
take urine because a lot of diseases can
be identified by looking up urine
it cannot be sent to the lab because it
degrades and so you have to do it in
and so the technician would look through
the microscope very very manual and and
try to identify them all the particles
in urine
that's image processing right and neural
nets are extremely good at recognizing
images and recognizing things within
images as you heard earlier from Jana
McCune so what we did there is we
trained neural networks with information
first with about a half million images
then deployed into these systems that
are now you put urine in there and
within three minutes
it detects and sees actually the
particles within and can diagnose help
the vet much more easily diagnose the
pets situation and so the second release
has gone out at 40 million images
because you're all in icing and this is
influencing at the edge it is done
within the system right there
but then the fat corrects it if it
doesn't work it's a sorry no this is not
disgrace so it's something else sends it
back to the ITX cloud and the next
release came out with 14 million images
so from 50% correct
initially this was only 50% correct it's
now like 90% correct in the next version
with 60 million images will be launched
in January will be almost a hundred
percent I tend to find like twelve
different particles weights superhuman
than any of the vets could ever do in
the past so this is truly automating a
test that number one that didn't like to
do and that number two really augments
and makes it that keep some superpower
as Mona said in the previous
presentation again I can go on and on
other examples on sale racks we worked
with teachers is about a decade ago
project where we observed the teachers
would spend hours every night any time
they did the test with 30 kids in the
class creating the test and they were
just too tired even after all the
grading that that was it every student
got the same tasks a medication we had
the system ignite were again a
multifunction device at the edge that so
I wanted to show this example would
print all the tests the students who do
test with scan it in and I give the
teacher in three minutes instead of
again a couple hours of work at night
the results of the students and group
them by issues that they had this was
elementary school software so again a
specific tests a student the teacher
didn't like to do it and it really
helped the
and it really helped the teacher get
superpower Ramona I'm gonna keep
stealing your words here to do a better
job in personalizing education for the
students and so John this relates your
point and they've got at this point
about really automating tasks so the
point of view is more and more tasks
will be automated thereby augmenting
human knowledge and human intelligence
and so it's exponentially processing
power and exponential in network
capabilities and social networks and
exponential and data will lead to an
exponential in in knowledge and at IBM
we like to call this Watson Wow
that what so now instead of Metcalfe or
Moore's law finally three principles
which I think are extremely critical in
the interest of time I'm gonna go over
them quickly we can discuss them at a
panel the purpose the purpose here is
again automating tasks with art which
are most of them are really boring
because that's what narrow AI does today
it's not yet broad AI or next-gen AI de
neri AI you automate has to really make
a professional much more effective and
efficient there has to be trust and
transparency to as it is extremely
critical that if you give you go through
mortgage and you said no you can't get
your mortgage and you ask why oh sorry
Watson told me you can get it that's not
gonna whatever cut it right you need to
get insights of why you were not
approved for a mortgage sure why you
have cancer being able to explain
ability is important and the number
three skills we discussed it it's very
important how does and yeah a lacuna the
nice picture right how the skills have
to keep up with the technology IBM
started five years ago creating with
PTAC professional technology school but
creates nine and move it through paid
fourteen we now have 60 schools touching
12,000 students to really help them
adopt these new technologies and and
then become very effective in applying
them in the workforce and so these are I
totally agree people mentioned this
morning it's responsibilities of
companies like us to really help retrain
the new color workers for this new world
we live in
thank you thank you seeing how much time
we have good good we have 20 minutes so
let me start by saying you know AI
automation augmentation
it's a dichotomy but isn't it also a
paradox if you augment a human don't you
also need fewer humans let me ask that
question to the panel as a whole what
what is the consequence of augmentation
for the society as a whole because for
you know for a given task then you may
replace that old mentor is done by AI
but it also creates new new things that
you couldn't already do if something has
to create the AI in the first place as a
whole sort of new things which has to be
done there's things we haven't imagined
the at which needs to be done so I think
that this is this is always this this
crystal you to any new technology yes it
could mean that we need less humans but
we've always know for hundreds and
hundreds of years with Al to come up
with new ways of using it people make
new demands that's that we hadn't
thought about you remain a Keynesian so
you remain the Keynesian okay not the
Keynesian I think I mean I think all
economists realize that it you know it
could be the case you know the amount of
work goes down and about that changes
how we do but it certainly hasn't been
the case in the last few hundred and a
few hundred years and I I know I see no
necessity that it has to be the case in
the future something I think in all the
examples that I gave it didn't I can be
narrow er I would specific tasks are
automated like for the teacher no longer
having to do degrading and the group
indicates now she can spend more time
personalizing and with individual
students so that's the benefit for the
fact it hasn't replaced veterinary
that's because you still need them to
deal with the pets and and the patients
and the same in most of what IBM does AI
for professionals people are working at
the end to the quarter they work like 60
80 hours a week trying to close the
books if you have some of these AI
capabilities on your shoulder
can actually do it a much more effective
and efficient way and and in fact
perhaps I mean somebody mentioned there
might be an opportunity for people to go
back to 40-hour week working being from
Europe originally I like that I'm
waiting for this 60 80 hours that some
people do in certain times you throw out
the quarter yeah I am also optimistic on
this even though I've never heard of the
40-hour workweek so it's equal to you in
seems critical yes but I think that this
idea that augmentation requires or will
lead to to fewer workers that may be the
case in certain tasks but there's many
many tasks that it will not be the case
for and radiology was mentioned earlier
earlier this morning one of the key
radiologists who's using AI and
developing AI in his work at Mass
General Hospital said this will
absolutely not lead to fewer
radiologists in the foreseeable future
of his lifetime because what is now
being able to be done by computers gives
the doctors now actually time to consult
with each other and consult with their
patients which they currently don't have
the time to do so there are many things
that humans would like to be doing with
our time and are usually pleased when
they can be automated and that includes
in the manufacturing production lines a
lot of Unleashed creativity that we
simply don't have time to access right
now overall do you have a sense of
whether augmentation will lead to
descaling or skilling one of the things
a scenario I worry about is this you
know this human machine combination will
lead to humans will take skills away
from humans you could see that
potentially in radiology if it's
deployed that way is there a general
notion about the way this I would say
it's like in first was the AI for
consumers and again we saw the wave form
that was shown earlier where nobody
remembers phone numbers anymore right
it's just there you push a button and
you call your mom or are you don't need
to remember facts and that's in the era
of a are we living in it's a narrow AI
air and I'm gonna move to broader I and
to channel AI but in this era it's more
it's really about not having to do this
memorization or not are really getting
access to all of this data very
effectively and very quickly you still
need your deep technical expertise as a
professional to understand and what the
systems will tell you and then it's at
work with your colleagues and the
patient or the student or the others to
make sense out of it
my favorite example is we're all exposed
to it flights we get on a plane and
there is two still two pilots in the
front even though most of the flight is
actually conducted through the autopilot
they're not no less good pilots than
they used to be when they didn't have
autopilot they're just using and
leveraging technology to make them safer
in conducting a flight versus actually
eliminating them so I think that's
that's a good paradigm for us to use
when we think of augmentation versus
automation
I do have some concerns here I mean the
you know what has happened a leak for
about a hundred years is that the you
know technology has has been skilled
biased in favor of skilled workers so
you know what an extraordinary factors
that despite the huge increase of
numbers of people going to you know
colleges like MIT you know the the wage
premium for having skills has actually
gone up not down massive increase of
supply yeah you know prices gone up so
demand has gone up and that's been
driven by technology you know and in the
first stage of that it was replacing
kind of routine tasks you know first of
all the manual production line you know
and then increasingly nah you know
really no routine caracal jobs like my
mother's job but I think AI is somewhat
different I think as you mentioned it is
it affects people much further up the
skill distribution so you know
radiologist is a pretty skilled job you
know it is you know we really know 20
years ago he'd be encouraging lots of
people to get those type of skills and I
think AI is replacing many of those type
of relatively highly skilled jobs yes
there's going to be you know jobs like
ours who are still in high demand but I
think going below that there was a lot
of people who thought they were in
pretty highly skilled places who are now
gonna see that you know their tasks are
disappearing now and I think the
challenges can they go further up the
skill that all they actually fall down
the school that are I think there's a
genuine issue but Sophie I mean the
question of Watson IVM I've seen really
wonderful advertisements about the
notion of augmenting doctors which is a
really wonderful idea but societally
maybe we should actually Aude meant
physician's assistants and have fewer
doctors it becomes a much more complex
question have you thought about that
level of sort of know I think ultimately
knowledge will also be democratized
right like we have lotsa nan shoulder or
in the eye system on your shoulder what
physicians do today
nurses will be able to help with
tomorrow right if they can really get a
lot of insights and information and and
then have the dialogue with the patient
so yes these systems will benefit
basically everybody in the end there
could be a nice app on your phone in
fact it exists really today's skin skank
skin cancer detection is a example of
extremely narrow AI it's excellent tools
out there direction today but still you
have to go to your physician then about
what's the treatment plan I mean the
whole reasoning and coming up with new
solutions I mean that's still a whole
area that needs to be of course is
covered and a lot of work is going on in
that space but coming back to the
radiologist
idec's veterinary company employs a lot
of radiologists because they look at
x-ray images of pictures of cats etc and
they can't hire enough so they're just
bored enough great radiologists in the
veterinary area the space available to
be able to do that because it's
difficult you're not just looking at
humans you're looking at all these
different creatures and so in depth in
that situation they are extremely
delighted to have now one radiologists
have the productivity of a few of them
going forward yes yeah I just like to
add that the descaling versus
re-skilling will also be culturally
dependent so it's moving up the
skill chart quite a bit I agree but it
also depends on your culture so for
example in Japan there's a much higher
level of comfort with robots that appear
to have human features and the
interaction with these robots so that
they're being developed with AI
capabilities to interact with the older
population to care for the elderly right
that's not something that is equally
enamored to the u.s. population right so
we think about oh that's a creative job
that would be filled by the human but in
other cultures and other countries that
is a creative job that would actually be
filled by the robots so it won't just be
the skill set it'll also be determined
by the local culture as well because I
think that you know I mean one of the
huge areas of growth is going to be that
caring for seniors and that so you know
as a society's age thinking about kind
of care homes and the role of robots
care homes that people's oh I ain't
never happened that maybe in the u.s. is
harder than Japan but it's also if you
think about that job as a there's some
task on that which you know like
physical manual tarp moving people
helping them have have a part of the
physical movie and I think you know
machines with robots actually can help
with those whereas the the softer skills
the kind of emotional interaction and
the support and the conversation that is
something which is very very very
difficult to also make whether we'll
ever do a part so I think that's an
example where you know the job of a
someone who is in care may focus much
more on the kind of soft skills element
which are harder to do in AI and the
more manual type of tasks will be the
things which get maybe increasingly
taken over by do you follow the pace of
those kinds of autonomous systems you
know looking at the most recent DARPA
Grand Challenge which was just two years
ago the notion of robots moving
autonomously in unstructured in violence
looks like it's very long away and maybe
we'll be lucky if the robots come just
in time for a particular generation I
mean so if you have a sense about the
pace of automation in these I mean
self-driving cars are still in a
structured by
moving around in a completely
unstructured environment is a very
challenging task in IBM we're not into
robots it sounds right it's I was
looking at you maybe that's one with
your industry industry for all I think
today like drones a robot they are
autonomous they're not you're
intelligent right I think ultimately we
are working at I be able a lot of
technologies that will also allow the
intelligence to move into the into the
throne or into the car so it doesn't
need to constantly get back to the cloud
and and get the city structures and
information and there's a lot of big
processing capability happening in the
cloud today how do you minute rise is
how do you get to extremely low power
how do you create whole new noodle
Network inspire chips and a6 and in fact
having said that now we will talk about
it earlier at IBM we're also extremely
looking forward and very optimistic
about a new partnership IBM and MIT F
formed so many of the new colleagues are
in the audience here creating the MIT
IBM Watson AI lab just announced it a
month ago and now everybody is
submitting of course you David author
and your team we had been participating
for a long time but the students are
professors the researchers it's a it's a
joint research lab that they're gonna be
addressing a lot of these challenges and
again with the focus on how do we make
sure it's on an ethical way and in a
fair way so we make a positive impact on
society one of the things that you said
that gave me pause was the the notion at
the end of the FTE what is that what
does that world look like so again I
think we we killed the afte ten years
ago when we killed a 40-hour workweek
because none of us works 40 hours
anymore so that that notion has long
been dead but probably to a negative
effect to most of us so I think the the
notion of having somebody in a place or
for a given task 40 hours a week 50
hours 60 hours a week whatever it is
what is their job description is going
to change I think we're gonna start
hiring people for skills and just on
demand type of expectation so M
Lerman will be a platform it's not gonna
be a career it's not gonna be that I'm
joining a company and I'm gonna be here
for the next four years I am here to do
this specific task that I am very
skilled on and then I move on to my next
place of employment does it suggest a
move toward the skilling if you think
about humans in this kind of Charlie
Chaplin like environment in which
they're doing a different task or
perhaps a different job on somebody's
somebody's talent platform every every
hour perhaps what I necessarily dis
killing I would say actually it's it
forces a bigger divide between lower
skill and higher skills because you're
gonna have those high skilled
individuals that are covered and needed
by many organizations and have that
opportunity to to work with multiple
entities whereas the individuals with
low skills we start seeing themselves
becoming more and more obsolete through
technology so that's how I think what we
have as a challenge ahead of us is how
do we bring everybody forth not just the
select you that have access to
technology so so I wanted to ask you
about the practical distinctions between
an augmentation strategy within the
corporation and an automation strategy
and I wonder if one of the sort of
categories I think a lot about is the
call center and I think about the notion
of what you do with the call center
operator you could replace them or you
could perhaps create a system around
them of the would augment them it has
IBM face this or yes bold IBM face it in
my previous company at Xerox
we had a big customer care business
before it split into two companies and
kept traditional printing publishing
managed print services in Xerox as panov
all the BPO but we had 40,000 call
center agents on staff that were doing
the customer care for the Airlines for
the retail for whatever many telecom
many different industries and clearly
within the labs they were coming up with
tools to augment their knowledge right
if it is a certain product right I mean
the customer care for this Kachin making
sure at your fingertips with natural
language processing they could access
and get right information to really have
a
effective and efficient dialogue with
the client that was calling obviously
what's happening to these call center
agents job as many of them are being
automated with virtual agents and chat
BOTS which are becoming better and
better especially in very narrow areas
just customer care for this particular
awfully fairly simple chat gadget
most probably virtual agents will
already do as well as a as a cost a
regular customer care agent today and
even like a company like Soul machines
I think Australian company if you go
check them out the virtual agents I mean
they really interact with you through
the camera attic and there they look
like real humans even today so some of
these jobs that are currently like the
minimum income chops to really follow
already very well scripted customer care
related rules that I see I do see those
being out automated if I may add one
point on this and it's actually one of
my favorite examples of all call centers
large global furniture manufacturer not
many of them around so you can probably
deduct will which one I'm talking about
so they had 4,000 people in their call
centers and there were a 10 billion
dollar company they are today a 30
billion dollar company and they still
have 4,000 people in the call centers
what they actually did they took the
excess capacity and need that for
additional people and automated it so
the level 0 level one type of support
typically in a call center is now being
handled by virtual agents and anybody
that actually needs to speak to a person
and it's a more complex type of
discussion goes to that level 2 level 3
type of support indeed and you can have
a more personalized and create better
linkage to the individual customers
because all the knowledge about that
customer is at your fingertips you don't
have to say again your name where you
live in all of that of course you need
to securely make sure it talked to right
person but all the knowledge of the
fingertips of the person who ultimately
picks up the phone to be able to give
the best possible customer experience
and potentially upsell and do a whole
bunch of other things that today is in
many calls and there's not even
happening it's a better experience it's
a better experience in the end
we're where the ethical decisions
situated in this kind of a world where
you have to make augment versus AI
decisions whose responsibility is it to
make these design decisions on whether
we augment or I think that's a good
question I think there is a
responsibility of industry of the
individual company because the company
has employees and their employees will
be impacted I think there's also there's
a responsibility on society in terms of
thinking about given the augmentation
may result in some workers requiring
rescaling or are being laid off coming
up with the compensation mechanisms to
to deal with that and create new
opportunities in most cultures including
the u.s. reefs killing and Retraining is
available when you have shifts in the
kinds of jobs and it's not welcomed by
the workers who need to be Reis killed
right none of us want to be told we've
become at least partially obsolete so we
could go to this nice training center so
I think policy you know at state and
federal levels has to think about how do
we really provide that resource to the
workers it can't be all on the companies
it can be it can be partially on the
companies and then I would say one more
thing we are talking about augmentation
as we have the current workforce that is
able-bodied you also want to think about
the possibility that augmented
workforces now enable some of the
community that has physical disabilities
to join the highly skilled workforce of
new ways right so that's that is a
positive that is a responsibility of the
companies as well as the policy makers
the question of the ethics of automated
systems one one of the good things about
having an automated system as you're
making explicit what was often implicit
ethical judgment you should be made by
people in the company the whole time you
had to make decisions and now this is
actually an explicit decision there's
also mated but the paradox is of course
the the kind of progressivity of AI has
been precisely fukushi learning or
often a complete black box as to how
these decisions are being made so I
think this is going to be a kind of
tension of it is a positive thing about
making explicit or ethical judgments but
then actually explaining what the black
box does is it in question was more
about automation versus augmentation
high level you're going to what's
embedded to deny models right what
ethical biases or etcetera and I think
all of the engineers and AI scientists
are building this model to train these
models it's our responsibility to make
sure that they are that they are fair
that they are transparent at least in
the Eifel professionals we are for
business and that that they are not
biased yeah so we are out of time
yes is a good panel thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
