thank you for joining us for the 2017
Gabriel Silver Memorial Lecture which
the School of International and public
affairs is delighted to host in
collaboration with the world leaders
forum as noted the silver lectures
cephas most prestigious lecture
established in 1950 to foster
international understanding on critical
global challenges we've been fortunate
to have had extraordinary leaders to
deliver the silver lecture president
Bollinger alluded to Dwight Eisenhower
when he was president of the university
Rajiv Gandhi as Prime Minister of India
and most recently ban ki-moon during his
final months as secretary-general and
today we continue this very important
tradition by welcoming to Columbia
University dr. Jim Kim president of the
World Bank Group in its more than 70
years of operation the bank and its
partner agencies have played an
essential role supporting economic
advancement and addressing defining
problems facing humanity and while we
know the bank was originally founded in
the aftermath of the World War two to
support rebuilding of countries riven by
war it has continually redefined its
mission to evolve and ensure its
relevance and its ability to meet the
needs of global populations and
countries worldwide in the early part of
its history it focused on infrastructure
investment around the world
later on loans and technical assistance
and then prioritize poverty alleviation
and more its impact has been immense and
the world has made progress its recent
projections by the World Bank suggest
that for the first time in human history
the number of people living in extreme
poverty has fallen below 10% of the
global population for our part sefa is
devoted to much of the same core mission
of the bank
more than half of our students today are
studying international trade finance and
development sustainability in the
environment other areas critical to the
bank we have numerous faculty that
continue to serve or have served in
senior positions at the bank
are one of our most popular degree
programs is a collaboration with the
World Bank since 1992 our students
regularly work with the banks teams on
capstone projects including six just
last spring on extension of educational
services in Malaysia assessing digital
technology and communications
infrastructure in Malawi promoting open
data and Tanzania with more than 230
SEPA alumni either currently or formerly
part of the World Bank system dr. Kim I
say to you your visit today's of deep
significance to the school in our
community and I'm very grateful that you
have chosen our University to deliver
this major address in advance of the
upcoming Bank Fund meetings dr. Kim
brings unique attributes to his
leadership of the World Bank a former
University President as a scientist and
doctor dr. Kim joined the World Bank
Group in July 2012 and soon after he
assumed his position he established two
ambitious goals to guide his work to end
extreme poverty by 2030 and to boost
shared prosperity focusing on the bottom
forty percent of the population in
developing countries in September last
year the World Bank Group board
unanimously reappointed him to a second
five-year term and already during his
first term the World Bank Group
supported the development priorities of
countries at levels never seen outside
of a financial crisis and with its
partners achieved successive record
replenishment of World Bank Fund for the
poorest the institution also
several innovative financial instruments
including facilities to address
infrastructure needs prevent pandemics
help millions of people force forcefully
displaced by climate shocks conflict
violence and also to support financial
inclusion before joining the World Bank
Group dr. Kim a physician and
anthropologists served as president of
Dartmouth College and held
professorships at Harvard Medical School
in the Harvard School of Public Health
from 2003 to 5 he was director of the
World Health Organization's hiv/aids
department where he led the 3x5
initiative the first ever global goal
for AIDS treatment to expand access to
antiretroviral medication in developing
countries in 1987 he co-founded the
Partners in Health a nonprofit
organization that works in poor
communities on four continents he has
received numerous awards and today he
delivers the silver lecture and an
important moment for the bank just days
before its annual meeting in Washington
next week and indeed at a significant
period in the world a time of rising
tension immense humanitarian crisis and
when globalization itself has come under
strain we look forward to his views
today on the many challenges facing the
world and how the bank will continue to
engage the future in areas critical to
human progress and the global economy
following his presentation dr. Kim has
graciously agreed to take questions from
our audience in a discussion moderated
by Michelle Fleury New York business
correspondent for the BBC without
further delay please join me in
welcoming dr. Kim to deliver his remarks
thank you so much Dean J now and I'm
especially glad to be here with my old
friend Lee Bollinger you know in 2009
when I became president of Dartmouth
College I went to my first Ivy League
presidents meeting and I think it was
here in New York Lee and I was thinking
oh my god we get to go and with these
eminent scholars people like Lee
Bollinger we're gonna sit down and talk
about the most important problems of the
day we're going to discuss higher
education and its role in the world we
talked the whole time about football and
we talked about football because that's
it's a league it's a sports league and
where you set the academic index the
lower border determines whether you win
or not and Lee has done so much for this
school but I think he may be remembered
for Columbia being three you know in
their football team and leading the Ivy
League with Dartmouth right now but I
just it's great to be here at Lee's been
here for 15 years you know being
university president is one of the most
difficult jobs that I can imagine having
had the experience for a relatively
short period of time but I I want to pay
tribute to Lee and all he's done in so
many different fields in the defense of
affirmative action the defense of
diversity you know he's a great man and
I'm honored to be here with him thank
you so today the the crisis and Dean J
now I think talked about it a little bit
it seems that commitments to human
solidarity are breaking down
we have nationalism we have isolationism
revolting against trade agreements there
are so many forces in the world that
seem to say you know we don't really
want to embrace the rest of the world
what we're going to focus on is what's
in it for us and so I think that the
most important thing that we have to do
in the World Bank Group but also
especially in universities in places
like Columbia is to rebuild the
foundations of human solidarity and so
after having worked on trying to build
human solidarity around the issues of
health and education for most of my life
we come to a moment now when
we have to ask ourselves the question
how do we rebuild these foundations now
I also want to let you know that this is
an absolutely urgent task everywhere I
go I see images just like this where
young people are on broadband they're
looking at their smartphones and more
and more and this is going to be
complete very soon everyone in the world
no matter how poor knows how everyone
else lives and it's a real phenomenon
it's we call it the reference income and
this is research that we've done at the
World Bank Group the more access you
have to the Internet the more your
reference income goes up in other words
the income to which you compare your own
goes up so what we found is that when
when you start seeing how well other
people are living you have higher
aspirations higher ambition and there
are a lot of good effects but the other
thing that we see is if your aspirations
start to rise but then there is no
opportunity it can lead to fragility
conflict violence I mean so much of what
happened during the Arab Spring was a
result of people getting at having a
college education but being unemployed
in Tunisia the highest rates of
unemployment during that time were among
college educated young people over 50%
unemployment so this is the crash course
we're going down this is that this is
the collision that we we're seeing high
aspirations lower opportunities and and
the need to invest more in people
now this talk in in so many ways and I
beg your indulgence on this it took me
my whole life to prepare for it and so
I'm gonna get a little bit biographical
because it's hard to understand where
I'm coming from without telling a little
bit about where I came from so this is
me and it was about in 1962 or 1963 I
was born in Korea
not too long after the Korean War and as
you can see I was pretty well fed back
then I was well taken care of and my
parents
really freakish good fortune had
actually met and married in New York
City right here my mother was a student
at Union Theological Seminary my father
was a dental student studying at NYU and
they met in New York City married here
my older brother was born here and then
they went back to Korea to try to make
their lives but what happened to them
is something that happened to very very
few Koreans by being here by being in
New York City their aspirations were
raised and of course their aspirations
for us were raised and so I had a I had
the great opportunity then to come back
to the United States when I was about
five years old and live out the rest of
my life as an American back then though
the World Bank which as Dean Jo
described came out of the ashes of World
War two and was founded to rebuild
Europe wasn't very let's say didn't have
very high aspirations for Korea and and
what they said it's probably hard for
you to me let me read it for you Korea
would find it difficult without foreign
aid to provide its people with more than
the bare necessities of life
so Korea didn't qualify for a world bank
loan because it was so poor until I was
about 3 years old 1962 and the
relationship between the World Bank
Group in Korea the long history of the
relationship between the World Bank
Group and Korea has really had a
profound impact on me and how I lead the
institution in a bunch of different ways
so first of all the World Bank had said
very negative things about Korea's
prospects just look at the country in
1959 the year I was born most of the
natural resources mineral wealth was in
the northern half of the country north
of the 38th parallel the industrial part
of the peninsula was also in the
northern part the southern part of the
peninsula was the agricultural part
literacy levels were below 20% in the
early 1960
so no industrial base no natural
resources agricultural low levels of
literacy now back then right about at
that time some of the explanations for
Korea's inability to develop were
focused on Confucianism they said you
know Korea has a a fundamentalist form
of Confucianism and because of that they
will never be allowed they will never be
able to grow and then probably 20 years
later the development economists at the
time said you know it's Korea's
commitment to Confucianism that has
allowed them to grow so it it it it
helped me to gain a healthy skepticism
about the
pronouncements of especially development
economists in thinking about the
prospects for different countries and so
now one thing I tell everybody is that
in the World Bank Group of today there's
no such thing as lost causes there's no
country that we're going to get out of
because we think there's no hope in this
case hope is not the result of analysis
but hope and belief and optimism has to
be a moral choice every single country
should be able to rise out of the ashes
just like Korea the other thing though
was that the second project that Korea
received World Bank funding for was
education and the World Bank was very
much against it right they were very
much against Korea investing in
education in just its second loan and at
the time there was a very strong sense
that the World Bank Group that what you
do is you invest in infrastructure in
other words get rich first and once you
get rich then you can invest in your
people but the Koreans rejected that
idea you know it was really pretty a
pretty stark there was a there was a
gentleman named Robert garner a very
respected World Bank development
economist who later was the first
president of our private sector group
IFC and in in a trip to Colombia and
Colombia had presented a plan for its
development that balanced infrastructure
investment with with human capital
investments with investments in health
and education and his response to that
proposal he said
quote dammit we can't go messing around
with education and health we're a bank
now this persisted for a very long time
and I would argue that in many ways it
persists up to today now thinking about
all these different issues and in and in
the process of moving to the United
States I have the great good fortune of
having a father who was very practical
he's a dentist and my mother studied at
Union Theological Seminary she was a
philosopher she eventually did a PhD in
philosophy in in in fact studied
Confucianism those two influences were
very powerful in my life but I was
leaning far more toward my mother's way
of approaching the world and my father's
and so one day I was I did my
undergraduate work at Brown University
and one day I flew home after the
semester and my father picked me up at
the airport we were living in Iowa at
the time so he picked me up and we're
driving on this rural road back home and
he asked me said this was my sophomore
year he said so Jim what are you
thinking of majoring in and I told him
dad I'm gonna major in politic political
science and philosophy and I'm gonna
lead a social movement someday right so
my father the dentist slowly pulled the
car over to the side of the road and he
said he said look after you finish your
residency you can study anything you
want now not you laughs but when I tell
this story to an audience of Asian
American older people they don't laugh
at all because it's like of course
that's the right thing to do it turns
out I'm very grateful to him for having
done that but what I did was I sort of
went around his admonitions I went to
medical school and at the same time I
did a PhD and this is the campus of
Harvard where I did both my degrees and
at the time I felt like the task for me
was to bring these two together bring
medicine together with the study of
anthropology and anthropology you know
we study all the great thinkers Marx and
Engels and at the time you know people
do was was the was the sort of hot
french thinker of the time and we
studied all these different view
of how to move the world toward one in
which there was more human solidarity
more equality opportunities for everyone
there are many different views and in
fact when I was in graduate school there
were strongly competing views there was
one view that said that planned
economies that trade with each other and
and worked for equality of outcomes is
the right approach and there was another
approach that was saying all of us have
to deal with the market system and in
studying these different approaches to
how society should be organized one of
the things that struck me and this was
in teaching the aunt introductory
anthropology course as a graduate
student one of the things that struck me
is that the the drive toward human
solidarity is deeply embedded in art in
in you know I don't want to say genes
but it's deeply embedded in the way that
we have evolved as human beings I
remember stories that we were telling
about about the bones of of ancient
peoples I mean tens of thousands of
years prior where you could tell that
there was an older gentleman who had a
handicap his entire life and so
literally would have had to be carried
around by his family and the tribe and
so this the sense that human solidarity
was at the core of what allowed us to
survive at all these years as a species
was core now at that time you know for
me I remember graduate school is just
like an idyllic experience where I could
spend a whole day reading a book and
sitting in cafeterias talking to people
but eventually as I finished I asked
myself the question so what do I do
what what is what is my responsibility
and what can I do to bring these grand
ideas together with practical solutions
and so I met these two people Paul
Farmer and Ophelia Dahl and we started
this group called Partners in Health and
by the way the film is opening tonight
it's playing somewhere in in in the
theatres in New York City starting
tomorrow and we founded this
organization with the idea that we were
going to provide health care to the
people in the world and we were gonna do
it on the basis of a philosophy and the
philosophy that we adopted came from
liberation theologians and many of those
ideas were were crafted you know in this
neighborhood liberation theologians we
called it a preferential option for the
poor and for us it was a preferential
option for the poor in health care and
we felt that it was a much more powerful
idea than the others that we'd been
studying you know in 1978 the World
Health Organization came out with this
notion of health for all by the year
2000 but it it was a great slogan they
did lots of things to sort of get the
idea out but there wasn't a plan
associated with it so what we said was
we were gonna take seriously this idea
that came from mostly Catholic priests
in in in in Latin America and the idea
was that you'd live and work with the
poorest of the poor and then learn from
them what they need learned from them
what their aspirations are and then do
everything you can you could to help
them meet their aspirations so we
started in Haiti and we asked ourselves
so if you're going to make a
preferential option for the poor in a
place like Haiti what-what you know what
would we do and when we asked them if
you were if you were to talk to people
who were in the field that it wasn't
global health back then it was
international health if you were to ask
them what they would what they should
what we should do they would say oh god
Hades so poor you should only do the
very minimum the basics you only should
only do the things that are
cost-effective you should only do
vaccinations and she you know other
things just aren't possible but when we
asked the Haitians what they want they
wanted every child to be in school they
wanted to be able to produce their own
food
and they wanted a hospital so that's
what we did we we built a bakery we we
built the hospital
we built schools and we began the
process of making ourselves humble in
front of the aspirations of the poorest
people now the second place that we
worked in a large scale was Peru and
this is the part of the project that I
took most responsibility for
and and we were going to do the same
thing it's a it's an urban squatter
settlement it's on the one hand it's it
looks very poor because it's a squatter
settlement but if you can see there are
electric poles so the the level of
poverty was nowhere near the level of
poverty in rural Haiti there were there
was no electricity at that time in rural
Haiti but then something happened that
really challenged us fundamentally we
sell patients like this
this is milky Addis actually now one of
the stars of the of the movie that was
made about Partners in Health
Melquiades was suffering from multi
drug-resistant tuberculosis this is a
form of tuberculosis that's resistant to
the two most powerful drugs and so the
official position at the time of the
World Health Organization of the Pan
American Health Organization of just
about every public health leader was
that you do not treat multi
drug-resistant tuberculosis in poor
countries it's they said it was too
expensive it distracted attention from
treating regular tuberculosis the the
drug regimens were too complicated and
and they were we're talking about a
minimum of 18 months of treatment and
during that 18 months of treatment at
least 12 months where these patients get
an injectable and intramuscular
injection six days a week for about 12
months so incredibly complicated when
these cases come in to the hospital here
and my my old teacher Lee Goldman is
here you know that place place goes
crazy because you have to put them in a
negative airflow room to prevent them
from infecting anyone else really hard
to treat the side effects of the
medicines are are severe and so this was
a fundamental challenge for us how
serious were we oh yeah preferential
option for the poor what about those
patients are you going to treat those
patients we felt we had no choice and so
we began and what we found was that by
using community health workers and
visiting patients every day we got
higher cure rates that any Hospital in
the United States and it turned out that
what was the most important element was
seeing these patients every day
providing the level of tender loving
care by nurses by community health
workers that got them through this
difficult treatment this is Melquiades a
couple of years ago I met Milky Hadas in
Lima when we had our annual meetings
down there and I just couldn't believe
it
I mean this guy looked like he was
almost dead very close to dying and he's
now a confident young man and actually a
bit of a movie star in Peru because he's
in he's in this film then AIDS so I
remember 1982 when I started medical
school that we were just beginning to
learn about HIV and it was so
frightening and from 1981 when it was
first described until 1996 it was
hopeless everyone was dying from it but
in 1996 a highly active antiretroviral
therapy really completely transformed
the disease except for poor people and
so as we saw the discussion around HIV
treatment in poor countries it was just
this intense sense of deja vu oh my god
they're doing it again it's exactly the
same thing all over again they're saying
it's just not possible it's too
expensive it's not cost-effective you
shouldn't do it and in fact when the
administrator of the US Agency for
International Development in the early
2000s
testified before Congress here's what he
said if you've traveled a rural average
you know this people do not know what
watches and clocks are they do not use
Western means for telling time they use
the Sun these drugs have to be
administered during a certain sequence
time during the day and when you say
take it at ten o'clock people will say
what do you mean by ten o'clock so that
gentleman had visited Africa some time
before that and the African colleagues
that we knew said you know the only one
who was late to every meeting was this
guy right now but let me this is andrew
not ciose Edra not ciose is a very good
man right I don't mean to make fun of
him is he's a very good man and he was
only saying what just about everyone
else in the world was saying people who
are my heroes were saying you know HIV
treatment in Africa I think we're really
talking about the next generation
my heroes were saying that and they were
a tiny tiny few literally a handful of
global public health people who at that
time were in favor of trying to treat
HIV in Africa but in Haiti we were
seeing patients like this this is joseph
jun unfortunately passed away some time
ago but we were seeing patients like
this and at this time famously the world
bank's position was that antiretroviral
treatment should not be offered and and
they and the World Bank actually forbid
countries from using World Bank loans
for treating HIV but was not cost
effective it couldn't be done at scale
it was not sustainable over and over and
over again so think about what everyone
was saying everyone was saying 25
million people in Africa living with HIV
I'm sorry they're all dead because it's
just inconvenient it's just too
expensive and we kept saying a small
group of us especially in Haiti we kept
saying that patients like this can get
better they're not a different form of
human being these medicines will work
with everybody and we began treating and
we began making the argument that if we
allow this to happen if we allow 25
million people to die because of our
inability to get around this fact that
it's complicated and difficult to treat
HIV we will be guilty of a passive
genocide and we our generation will
always be remembered as a generation
that allowed 25 million people to die so
we began treating and results were
fantastic we used to call it the Lazarus
effect of HIV treatment now I made the
point about mr. nachos because again
he's a very good man who cares a lot
about development and about the poor but
what we've learned is that these things
happen because people don't always think
even powerful people they don't they
don't think and make decisions on the
basis of rationality and evidence I wish
they did but they don't we actually did
a World Development Report a few years
ago and calling it we called it mine
society and behavior and the conclusions
were that people think automatically
they tend to fill in missing information
and think quickly people tend to think
socially they are very much affected by
the people around them think and they
think according to mental models and so
the social thinking and the mental model
that existed at that time was it's just
impossible and it was difficult for
people to look forward and say what our
future generation is going to say about
us if we let all 25 million people
living with HIV die they were heroes in
this fight and one of them the most
unexpected hero is George Bush and
everyone around him his own head of
USAID was saying they can't do this
because they don't they don't they can't
tell time but he vetoed all their
decisions and said we're gonna do this
and he launched the President's
Emergency Plan for AIDS relief probably
the single intervention that's had the
biggest impact on Africa in many many
decades so he going against the
conventional wisdom made a big
difference and another was just your own
Jeff Sachs one of my heroes Jeff Jeff
was the only one the only one among the
economists who actually came to Haiti
and saw that this was possible and then
fought and fought and fought for more
financing more funding for HIV he taught
us them one of the most important
lessons he said you know you guys gotta
stop talking about the M word and start
talking about the B word not millions
but billions of dollars and for us in
global health who had nothing we
couldn't get our heads around it but
Jeff helped us and he is still fighting
the good fight today but he was
absolutely critical in winning this
battle so now there's a lot more
financing this is how much money you
know it's it's sort of exploded now in
terms of money for for global health but
the lesson from this graph is that it's
probably going to tail off for a little
while especially given the nature of the
global economy and it's not nearly
enough it's not nearly enough to meet
the aspirations of people today know in
the mid 90s late 90s and into the 2000s
at a period when most of the my time had
been spent fighting against the World
Bank Group I got so exasperated that
with with colleagues we wrote this
entire book critiquing the World Bank
it was called dying for growth global
inequality in the health of the poor and
it was essentially a 500-page extremely
well-researched critique of the World
Bank Group and I was part of a movement
at that time called 50 years is enough
in which we tried to close the bank and
the IMF on his fiftieth anniversary this
is 1994 so we lost that battle which was
which is good and we lost that battle
and what happened at around 1995 was
that the World Bank began to change very
quickly based on evidence and I have to
tell you this is the thing I'm most
proud of being president of the World
Bank Group is that this is an
organization that will respond to
evidence that will change as it needs to
and now I have the great privilege of
being president let me tell you how that
happened so I was president of Dartmouth
minding my own business when I get a
call from Timothy Geithner and Timothy
Geithner was Secretary of Treasury he
was also Dartmouth class of 83 and when
Tim called me and Lee knows this story
well it's usually because he has a
friend with a kid who wants to get into
Dartmouth I had my piece of paper I was
ready to write down the name of the
person that Tim was recommending but he
called man he said instead hey how would
you like to be president the World Bank
and I said you mean the World Bank he
said what do I need to do so we'll come
down and talk to President Obama I said
when he said how about tomorrow so
literally the next day I fly down to
talk to President Obama walk in the
office and it's quite an experience
walking into the Oval Office especially
with President Obama and that voice of
his and he said to me he said so Jim
why should I nominate you to be
President of the World Bank I mean what
am I going to tell people and this is
exactly what he said what about I tell
people like Ernesto Zedillo Ernesto's a
wonderful man former president of Mexico
a great development economist he said
what am I going to tell people like
Ernesto Zedillo that I chose a physician
and an anthropologist and not a macro
economist to be President the World Bank
and I said to him I said well President
Obama have you ever you have you ever
read your mother's PhD dissertation he
loved me he said well yes I have
so I after seeing him speak in 2004 I
researched him and I found out that his
mother had done a PhD and
apology at University of Hawaii so I
actually ordered her dissertation from
the University of Michigan archives
that's probably like one of five people
who had ever ordered her dissertation
and I read the whole thing and I said
well President Obama you'll remember
that that when your mother went to
Indonesia she studied the artisanal
industry and it was specifically artists
who worked in metal the the the the
metal the metal focused things and if
you've seen these beautiful Indonesian
about works of art made out of scrap
metal and she showed that while every
economist suggested that these artisanal
industries would be wiped out because of
globalization she showed that in fact
they thrived that globalization was
great
and I said you know that's that's what
you'll get from me I'm not gonna be able
to give you the view of the world from
30,000 feet like macroeconomists do but
I've been on the ground for 25 years and
I'll tell you how our programs are
working there and he looked at me and he
said you know I get that now later at a
at a more social event around with other
people sitting around a table he said
you know Jim that was one of the best
ploys to get a job I've ever seen read
read the president's mother's thesis so
so you may be thinking you're eating
arcane pieces of work but you never know
how it might come in handy now at the
World Bank Group two goals in poverty
blue shared prosperity and we get to
those two goals in three different ways
the first is by boosting economic growth
I'll tell you I'll tell you how we're
trying to do that inclusive sustainable
meaning meaning environmentally
sustainable economic growth the two is
investing in human beings and I love
that see pose hashtag is hashtag invest
in people I think I saw that on the
chart invest in people and the third is
to create resilience to the major crises
of the time climate change refugees
pandemics now this is a difficult part
of the lecture because it it's it's a
conversation with many of you who may
have participated in the Occupy movement
how many
participate in the Occupy movement know
so many of my friends and certainly my
friends children participate in the
Occupy movement but since the days when
we were studying Marx and Engels and
looking at these two ways of organizing
the world planned economies versus
market economies this is what happened
President Xi Jinping at Davos just this
year in January said this whether you
like it or not the global economy is the
big ocean you cannot escape from any
attempt to cut off the flow of capital
technologies products industries and
people between economies and channel the
waters in the ocean back into isolated
lakes and creeks is simply not possible
so the head of the largest communist
party in the world is telling us that
the global market system is the thing we
cannot avoid and so the task is to
figure out how we can make the system
work for everybody if it is the ocean
then we need to equip everyone to be
able to swim in it and that's what
they're trying to do of course in in in
in China now we worked very closely with
the Chinese government and I thought I
thought that this was such an important
statement and it really defines what I
do now every day now this was Occupy and
and I I think the the the the commitment
of the Occupy movement was very
compelling the idea is that we are the
99% in the financial system doesn't work
for us but what I have learned probably
the most important thing I've learned in
my five years as head of the World Bank
is that finance is such a powerful tool
and it is our responsibility to make
finance work for everybody
professor Bob Shiller Nobel laureate
economist from Yale wrote a book called
Finance and the good Society and if you
haven't read it I recommend it it didn't
sell very well he told me but he really
points out and I quote finance despite
his flaws and excesses is a force that
can potentially help us create a better
more prosperous more equitable Society
we have the potential to support the
greater goals of good societies
prosperous and free societies in the
industrialized as well as the developing
world if we expand correct and realign
now this is a picture of the Ghanaian
stock exchange and I have learned about
these financial financial tools and it's
just incredible how powerful they are
these are the tools that just down the
road and Wall Street just down the road
and all the great financial industry
that sits right here in New York City
these are the tools that people use
every single day to make themselves
wealthier and we're now doing everything
we can to use those same tools to
support the poor they're they're great
examples of how to do it now in terms of
using the tools of the rich to serve the
poor there are some facts that have
created a situation of just enormous
opportunity seventy eight trillion
dollars is the size of the global
economy there's more than ten trillion
dollars sitting in negative interest
rate bonds in other words you you give
your money to the Japanese central bank
and they don't pay you interest you pay
them to hold your money ten trillion
dollars negative ntuc you give them
money but you pay them to keep it
another 24 trillion or so in very low
yielding government bonds and again this
is because people are worried people are
scared of the risk they would take and
putting their money in anything else and
another eight trillion sitting in cash
these are usually thousand euro bills
just sitting in people safes now
everybody who owns this capital wants to
get more out of it they want they want a
better return and we think that the
opportunities in developing countries to
get a better return if we play our role
in de-risking and making these
investments possible are just enormous
we have a fund called the Global
Financing facility for every dollar that
a donor gives us we can give the country
five four five six dollars of not grant
based money but money that they can pay
over twenty or thirty years at 0%
interest so getting five times the money
that you can pay back over 20 years at
0% interest often makes much more sense
than getting grants so leverage
something that rich people do every day
is something that now we're trying to
use much
more for the sake of the poor I'll never
forget the Ebola outbreak I mean I think
most non physicians especially
non-infectious the disease physicians
have probably forgotten about it but I
will never forget how Cara fide we were
during Ebola but what happened was we
waited way too long the epidemic started
in December of 2013
money didn't start flowing until
September of 2014 nine months later and
so we decided that we're never gonna let
that happen again and what we did was we
created something we call the pandemic
emergency facility this is an insurance
instrument that will disperse
automatically when a problem happens so
this is the these are the number of
cases that happen during the Ebola
outbreak right and this is when the
money started to flow was about in here
right right the money really didn't flow
till out in here if the pandemic
facility had been in place back then we
would have dispersed some cash right
here at the beginning and probably
snuffed it out but certainly the
automatic part of the insurance bond
instrument would have happened here and
we would have had a much better chance
of stopping it now this is a completely
new financial instrument nobody has
thought about insuring the poor against
pandemics before but we did it and in
June I actually did the bond call I was
in the call talking to the different
investors 450 million dollars and we
paid eight point seven percent interest
and the eight point seven percent
interest was enough for investors to
take the risk they could lose all their
money they could lose all their money
but it was worth the risk
because we paid eight point seven
percent this is what rich people do
every day they share their own risk with
the capital markets we haven't been
doing it enough for the poor we are
talking about a human capital project
because we're living in the middle of a
human capital crisis and this is a map
about childhood stunting childhood
stunting is one of the things that
worries me most in the world child is
stunting means that your two standard
deviations below height for age
in in in the first two years but also
all the way through five years to
standard deviations below height for age
what we found is that these children end
up actually having 40% less brain mass
the mass of their brains is actually 40%
lower and we've done Studies on stunted
children they they don't learn as well
and they don't earn as well and so what
is the percentage well overall 155
million children in Indonesia 37 percent
of their children are stunted Pakistan
45 percent of their children are stunted
Ethiopia Democratic Republic of the
Congo 50 percent of their children are
stunted these these children when they
grow up to be adults will not be able to
compete in the global economy but it's
not just it's not just childhood
stunting that that we have to tackle
from the early to the very early in a
child's life there's other things 250
million children in the world cannot
read or write
despite some schooling in Kenya Tanzania
and Uganda three-quarters of third
graders and these are children who've
been in school up to third grade
three-quarters of third graders in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo cannot
read a single word so not only do we
have a problem with stunting we have
problem with education what we've
learned it's it may be hard to say that
what you're seeing is the top of the of
the graph is the number of years of
schooling the dark blue is a number of
years of learning adjusted years of
school in other words are they actually
getting the learning that they're
getting from the number of years they're
sitting in those seats and what you see
is huge variability and you can there
are countries in which they may be in
school for 10 years but it's the
equivalent of less than five now we have
a plan for this we we just released a
World Development Report on education
they're very specific things that we
want countries to do but this is a major
crisis now what about technology this is
the one of the coolest things I've ever
seen I visited Rwanda and Rwanda is the
first country in the world to use drones
to deliver life-saving blood so instead
of having to create the supply chain to
take blood everywhere it's needed the
use drones and entirely based on
automate artificial intelligence
fantastic innovation but we think the
actual impact of automation is going to
be mostly to get rid of jobs jobs are
going to be lost lots and lots of
low-skilled jobs will be lost because
tasks are going to be done by machines
we may be able to get ahead of it but
not if we not unless we start running
really quickly our teams now are really
looking at human capital differently and
we're going to publish soon a book or a
document that's called the changing
wealth of nations and here's what we
found so the dark blue is human capital
the lighter blue is produced capital
meaning you know factories and things
that you build that can that can
contribute to productive capacity and
the grey is natural capital forests you
know the natural resources energy
resources and what we found is that
human capital is so much more important
as part of the overall wealth of nations
than we'd ever thought in fact but in
fact not until very recently have we
included an accounting of human capital
now some of you may say why you keep
saying human capital they're human
beings man there's a reason why I'm
using the term human capital because in
order to make a change you're gonna have
to get the real decision makers who are
usually the heads of state but also the
ministers of finance you're gonna have
to get the ministers of finance
especially to think about investing in
human beings differently so human
capital is huge now this is huge this is
overall wealth this is natural produced
and human capital per capita so you can
see the high income countries of a huge
amount of wealth per capita and I'll and
the majority of it is human capital the
middle-income countries have a lot less
and look at the low income countries
this is how much the low income
countries have to catch up in terms of
human capital if they want to compete in
the digital economy now the question
then is how do we change the environment
so that heads of state and ministers of
finance are
cannot but help to invest more in human
beings what do we need to do well one of
the things we need to do is to convince
them that investing in human beings is
directly connected to economic growth
and so we begun work with the Institute
for Health metrics and evaluation in
Seattle with Chris Murray was a who's a
very good friend of mine we did
internship and residency together and
Chris started looking using very
sophisticated data and analytic tools if
you take the average years of completed
school schooling if you take the average
standardized test scores for math
reading and science and then you take
physical and mental health in the
working age population if you take those
three things and ask a pretty
straightforward question if you divide
it up the if you divided up countries
into quartiles into four segments and
you looked at the group that improve
their human capital the most over the
last 25 years and you compare it to the
group who improved their human capital
the least over the last 25 years the
difference in economic growth between
the highest improvers and lowest
improvers is 1.25 percent of GDP per
year so you take that and multiply that
over 25 years this is extraordinary and
this is among the highest correlations
and it's not causation it's right now
we're just we're running regressions and
looking at the correlation but this is
among the highest correlations to
economic growth that we've ever seen so
we have no choice now but to do this
calculation put rankings together and
reveal to countries how important it is
for them to invest in people now how do
you do that how do you actually make
things happen well Franklin Delano
Roosevelt is famous for having said to
labor leaders I hear you I like your
ideas now go out there and make me do it
in other words create an environment
where I have no choice but to do what
you want me to do a friend of mine this
is the president of the of the European
Commission jean-claude juncker
jean-claude Uecker in 2007 during the
during the the financial crisis he was
prime minister of Luxembourg at that
time he's very funny man he said hey we
all know what to do but we don't know
how to get reelected after we do it so
how do we create a situation where we
forced them to do the right thing but
then also maybe even help them to get
reelected what what is the process of
doing it well one of my one of my great
mentors and Lee Lee Goldman knows and
Julie Richmond he was he was the surgeon
of the United States he put he was the
the creator of I think one of the great
programs of all time which was head
start and the way he did head start was
he had a knowledge base that said do it
he had a social strategy and he had
political will well we need now to think
about what it would take to create
equality of opportunity we have to base
this in a foundation of human solidarity
we have to have the knowledge base and I
showed you the beginning pieces of it
how important human capital investments
are we have to have a social strategy
how do we make it so that the real
decision makers will make the right
decision we have to generate through
that political will and then we have to
use financing strategies as well can we
create insurance instruments that will
happen automatically can we use
concessional finance interest rate
finance to compel people to do the right
thing this is urgent
aspirations on the rise everywhere jobs
being eliminated at huge percentage this
is a this is just our estimate of how
many currently existing jobs will be
eliminated by automation in these
countries and I you know I this this
ranking of countries on human capital is
going to be incredibly contentious it's
going to be incredibly controversial but
I feel that I have a moral
responsibility to reveal this connection
and to rank the countries in order to
you know to do the right thing by the
hundred and fifty five million children
who are living in poverty I think
another person who studied in this area
and and was one of my heroes had the
best way of thinking about urgency
around this kind of social action
marna for king in his book letter from a
Birmingham jail now wrote about letters
that he received when he was in jail and
one was from a white moderate who told
him all Christians know that the colored
people will receive equal rights
eventually but it is possible that you
are in too great a religious hurry it's
taken Christianity almost 2,000 years to
accomplish what it has the teachings of
Christ take time to come to earth now I
hope you see in this statement the same
thing that the people who are against us
treating MDR TB and HIV were saying this
is not a bad person this is a person
responding to the conventional wisdom of
his time to which Martin Luther King
responded such an attitude stems from a
tragic misconception of time and a
strangely irrational notion that there's
something in the flow of time that will
inevitably cure all ills actually time
itself is neutral it can be used
destructively or constructively more and
more I feel that the people of ill-will
have used time much more effectively
than the people of goodwill we will have
to repent in this generation not merely
for the hateful words and actions of the
bad people but for the appalling silence
of the good people we cannot be guilty
of being silent about the crisis of
human capital investments but we have to
be strategic and we have to find a way
to create a situation where there's no
choice but to invest right now the
situation in many developing countries
is well if you give us money and
preferably grant money for health and
education we'll do something but if you
don't we won't the levels of investment
are just nowhere near what they should
be and so we've got to create an
environment that makes it impossible not
to do it look when Martin Luther King
talks about repent repenting my mother
was a theologian and I think it's okay
to repent every once in a while it's
good it's good practice to repent every
once in a while but better than
repenting and especially I see so many
students in the room better than
repenting is to think what are the
things that we're either doing or not
doing today that in 20 years will shake
our heads and say how can you
believe that that's what we were
thinking can you believe that that's
what they were saying the white
moderates the head of USAID find out
what those things are take them on and
we have then a chance to create a world
in which every child has an opportunity
to become whatever they want just like I
did coming here from Korea and just like
I know all of you will as well thanks
very much
thank you
now we have about half an hour left so
we're hoping to get as many questions
from the audience in as possible when we
do eventually go round there are going
to be microphones people hand you a
microphone we'll ask you to introduce
yourselves and to say what school you're
from and just to give everyone a second
or two to sort of think up the questions
they might want to ask dr. Kim thank you
very much that's all for speech if I
could just pick up on what you said
there at the end the idea of merging
this ranking the importance of of taking
action now I mean that sounds like quite
a radical idea Wow why the sort of new
thinking now so I mentioned it briefly
but well what we learned from Chris
Murray out in the Institute for Health
metrics and evaluation is that and I
don't I don't even actually know what
this is and I know students here know
what it is but the ability to use
Bayesian methods it's a new kind of
ability to crunch large numbers much
more effectively have given him so much
clearer view of what are the causes of
death its global burden of disease
report and if we apply that to not only
health outcomes but also educational
outcomes we're gonna find powerful
connections and powerful connections to
things like economic growth that we
wouldn't have been able to do so things
have changed we've got a lot more data
now on health outcomes and educational
outcomes and what Chris tells me is that
and I have to give credit to my
predecessor Bob Zoellick Bob really
pushed on data transparency the amount
of transparency in the world is just so
much greater than it ever was before
that countries are sharing their data
and then the question is you know do you
have enough data and then and good
enough methods so that you can be pretty
confident in making this connection
between health education and growth and
if you've got enough confidence are you
willing to withstand the clear criticism
and anger that's going to come from
countries that come out lower than
whether they think they should come out
so it's it's very predictable we have a
measure called doing business
and it's not it's not a perfect measure
by any stretch but it's the only thing
where we look at the ease of doing
business in different developing
countries and in the reaction is usually
pretty predictable those who come out
high they like it and they use it those
who come out low critique our
methodology so we have we're working so
that the methodology is so robust that
we'll be able to defend it and keep
going and the other thing we're going to
do is we're not just gonna say oh you
guys are in bad shape for every single
country we're gonna work very hard to
give them a plan for how they can much
more effectively and quickly improve
their stock of human capital for
attention to the issue and pressure to
try and well there'll be public pressure
and I'm sure that opposition parties
will use this you know in their own
political interest but what that will do
is for the first time create a political
cost to not investing in health and
education and often that doesn't exist
the other thing is I think investors are
going to look hard at at these rankings
and make decisions on where they invest
their dollars based on it and so in a
country a foreign direct investment goes
down what happens often is that your
borrowing costs go up and that gets
everybody's attention right and so
that's not what we're not trying to hurt
countries we're trying to reveal to them
the reality of their situation and and
the urgency of the task of investing in
people yeah I've been doing this work on
global health for 30 years and I've
spent 30 years begging for more
financing and I the notion that we could
take it from a purely supply driven
where it's just all about the generosity
of donors - one in which we have more
generous donors because they know how
important it is I mean we need to keep
pushing donors to provide more financing
but link that to demand where leaders
are saying oh my god we've got to get
out we've got to go up these ranks as
having a real impact on our political
fortunes on our economic fortunes if we
can create a situation like that then I
think we have a much better chance of
reaching this situation where everyone
has equal opportunity
now for those who are watching online or
in the room here please feel free to use
the hashtag invest in people to sort of
comment and share your thoughts and if
we could start taking questions from the
floor I see the lady there in the third
row in the blue shirt hello my name is
Amna buta I'm a Fulbright Scholar from
Pakistan as an aspiring policy maker for
Pakistan are pertinent to fourth
Industrial Revolution my question is
that currently with the recent creation
of Asian Development Bank how the World
Bank and the Asian Development Bank sort
of separate away from the competitive
environment that they were operating in
initially and how they can sort of
connect together to learn from the World
Bank's experience and sort of meet the
collective objective of development in
the world thank you thanks for your
question I think you mean the Asian
infrastructure investment bank Asian
Development Bank's been around for a
while and the new player is the Asian
infrastructure investment bank well we
we work very closely with them and you
know the one that one thing we have to
remember is that there's nowhere near
enough resources for infrastructure in
developing countries so we've welcomed
them from the very beginning in fact
there are HR systems there are financing
systems that we provided them with all
of that and right now at a time when
they have very few employees what
they're mostly doing is Co investing
with us and so we'll prepare a project
we'll put all the pieces together and
they just put their money on the table
another quickly getting capacity and
they'll be making their own loans but
you know what what we've realized and
over the past five years what I've
really were caught in is bringing me
bringing all the multilateral
Development Bank's together because we
have to work together we have to work
together as a single system and we're
closer to that I think now than we've
ever been you know we're talking the the
sustainable development goals are gonna
cost if we're gonna get to their goals
by 2030 four trillion dollars a year so
you put all the multilateral
banks together we don't touch that we're
not even close so we have to work
together not only to make our own
dollars go as far as possible but we
need to use our dollars to bring in all
that cash I told you about that's
sitting in these negative interest rate
accounts we've got to bring that off the
sidelines and put it to work for the
poor hi dr. Kim my name's Benjamin Wong
I am from a United Nations Development
Program recently professor Scott Rozelle
argued that 63 percent of Chinese rural
children have not seen one day of high
school education and this conclusion
actually stirred much debate on the
Internet community in China so many
people think we should focus more more
on the software construction for example
education rather than the hardware for
example infrastructure so how do you
envision the bank enhancing its
corporation based developing countries
in the for exemption and other countries
in China are in Asia and we would there
be opportunities to establish relevant
initiatives ways for example the AI IB
or other authorities thank you very much
thank you
Benjamin thank you for the question so
what we're trying very hard to do is not
go in a direction of either-or right
either you invest in people or you
invest in the drivers of economic growth
like energy and transport things like
that
China's actually done quite well in
terms of its human capital investments
there the childhood stunting rates are
around 8 or 9 percent so you just
compare that to some of the other
countries you know Indonesia 37 Pakistan
45 India 38 China's run 8% now the the
educational outcomes are mixed I mean in
Shanghai they're among the highest in
the world but in the rural areas they're
not they're not as good and so I think
for every country they're gonna have to
step back and say okay in addition to
investing in infrastructure in addition
to investing in all these other
important parts of economic development
we now also know that human capital is
far more important as a driver of
economic growth than we ever thought and
with every passing year as automation
becomes more sophisticated
educated more jobs are lost every
passing year is going to make human
capital more important so in that
context I think we have to think
differently I think the notion that we
bring in private sector financing for
more infrastructure will free up money
in government budgets to invest in
health and education that's where we
think we're going to be going with many
many countries but the point is every
single country has to have its own plan
and there's no there's not going to be a
one-size-fits-all solution for everybody
and do you see bringing in the private
sector absolutely absolutely so you know
there we're now working on on principles
for private sector involved in the
health and education because it's not
straightforward it's not building more
hospitals but what we found is that in
countries like India more than half of
all health services in India are
provided by private practitioners so if
you want to improve the health care
system in India you cannot ignore the
private sector you have to figure out
how to make it work we think that as as
jobs in like manufacturing in
agriculture as they get eliminated
probably the biggest growth is going to
be in empathy workers you know the
community health workers community
social workers community education
workers and I think that the movement is
going to be more in creating cadres of
individuals who can provide those
services and I think it's perfectly
reasonable to think that that small and
medium enterprises run by women for
example could be one of the ways of
bringing those workers online
thank you for your lecture President Kim
my name is Mario Saraiva
I'm from CIPA I'm part of the Masters in
development practice and I have a it's
been a question I've been pondering
throughout my year at SEPA first is what
does invest in human capital looks like
if you could please expand in that and
then should we make it profitable to
invest in human capital or in other
words should create an environment as
you mentioned that forces us or forces
policymakers to invest in human capital
but then if we do so can the world
really change you for still acting
because of financial returns well the
the first the the the first part of the
question what does it look like right so
let me just let me take exactly what it
looks like and we're trying to create an
example of just what it might look like
starting with a pregnant woman
and so in Rwanda President Kagame has
said that they're stunting level is 38%
he wants to bring it to zero in like
five years right never been done before
that kind of shift but you could do it I
mean based on 30 years of work in
developing countries if you've had
community health workers out everywhere
identifying all pregnant women making
sure they have outstanding prenatal care
and this is not rocket science it's very
straightforward make sure that they have
attended births make sure that children
are given appropriate nutrition and
stimulation or the child development
from the very beginning improve the
quality of the primary school so that
they get preschool and they start in
preschool and then they go all the way
and every step of the way you're
improving the quality of the educational
system so that their learning outcomes
are getting better then when they get to
be 18 or 21 or whatever and going
through college then I think you've done
everything you can to give that the
pregnant woman and her child every that
the city you know as as good an
opportunity as you can possibly imagine
for that particular situation now on the
profit motive you know I just refer you
back to the quote a president xi jinping
right so China when it shifted from just
simply dictating quality of outcome for
letting market forces work you know it
used to be that when out in the 1980s
Chinese young people could quote from
the little red book from now and now
most people quote she don't shopping who
said to get rich is glorious who said
things like some of us will get rich
first and in comparing planned economies
versus market systems said I don't care
if the cat is black or white as long as
it catches my
and so it I I don't for me it's not an
ideological issue and you presented it
as you know how can this happen if the
ideology of profit I you know I was
trained by Lee Goldman alright so if you
guys don't know how what kind of figured
Lee is there something called the
Goldman criteria but we all know I was
trained by Lee Goldman and what legal
been taught me was you got to go with
the evidence what does the evidence
suggest right the evidence suggests that
if you want to end extreme poverty you
need more economic growth evidence
suggests that if you want to end extreme
poverty you have to figure out how
countries can insert themselves in in
the global market system you know I I
met with the head of the Vietnamese
Communist Party right and he was a
highly respected man who has PhD in the
social sciences and his PhD was from the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republic
School of Social Sciences and his PhD
was in that well-known field of party
building party building right and I
asked him I said you know your
excellency how do you reconcile
Vietnamese socialism with your embrace
of the market system because all you
guys talk to me about is how you can you
can you can you can interpolate with the
market system more effectively so it's
very simple he said you know we've read
our Marx - and every perfect socialist
system requires a stage of capitalism
right but he said something else that
was even more profound he said but we
realized that - perfect Vietnamese
socialism you needed faster economic
growth and more robust job creation so
that's why we do what we do and so here
was a person trained in the USSR in
party building the leader of the the
keeper of the faith of the Vietnamese
socialist party who was telling me hey
buddy have you seen the evidence the
evidence suggests that whether we like
it or not we have to find a way to
insert ourselves effectively because if
we don't it will be more poverty less
job creation less economic growth
hi dr. Kim my name is Gabriel barrientos
I am a second year student at SEPA
concentrated and development practice my
question is in regards to the
investments in education particularly we
see that a lot of developing countries
focus their investments on more
quantifiable things like infrastructure
building more schools or just getting
students into schools much like bolsa
famÃ­lia in brazil you just pointed out
that schooling does not equate to
learning how can investment models and
education shift into learning rather
than just schooling yeah
so I strongly suggest you take a look at
our World Development Report that came
out just a couple of weeks ago and some
of that some of the lessons from there
or is that you first of all you've got
to be focused on learning and you've got
to be evidence-based and most school
systems are not like that the great
movements around education have been
building schools and getting children to
sit in seats and get you know getting
their butts in seats as we say and we we
have a program at the bank called sub
err
and I don't remember what said that R
stands for butts as in you know the
Spanish word for no very much focused on
on going from the quantity of classrooms
and the number of seats available to
actual learning so one you got to focus
on the evidence - it's got to be a
whole-of-government effort this is not
this cannot just be the education
ministry frankly education ministries
are often the weakest ministries in
developing countries and so what we're
trying to do with this human capital
index is to force countries not force so
we never force countries to do anything
but to make it possible for countries to
work with the minister finance you know
worried about his bond spreads and
worried about reducing FDI and have them
work directly with ministers of
Education and ministers of health there
are many many countries who are
investing money in health and education
getting nothing out of it so our our
laser focus over the next few years is
going to be to improve the quality of
those investments but in the world
Development Report we have a whole
program of how you can move more toward
learning and away from just you know
building classrooms
I'm guessing pretty much everybody in
this room has a smartphone we're all
used to access to the Internet I mean
how has technology well has it made life
harder or easier for you to fulfill your
mission well so the the the head of our
education practice now one of our most
brilliant economists worked for the
World Bank for many years and he was
asked to come back to Peru his home
country and take over the Ministry of
Finance but what he said to the
president was hmm now I want to be
Minister of Education because he knew
that he already knew then that better
educational outcomes were going to be
the most important drivers of growth for
Peru well he tells me is yes technology
can be very important but the biggest
problem for him was the ability of
principals to manage their institutions
and improve the quality of teaching over
time so he began focusing on literally
management skills of principals Jack Ma
that the founder the brilliant founder
of Alibaba in China is creating an
institute just to teach management
skills to principals so it's it's
potentially great I mean I think what
Saul Khan has done in the Khan Academy
that the learning modules are fantastic
you know and the Carnegie Mellon
teaching modules for chemistry math and
physics are just incredible right so I
think there's a lot of great stuff
online but at the end of the day it's
going to be a person intensive process
you know improving the quality of
teachers and the managers of teachers
has to go side by side with bringing
technology into the into the classroom
and it's also actually not Hardware it's
the software that goes on on onto the
machines that's going to make the
biggest difference we've actually
translated Khan Academy stuff into both
Arabic and Spanish to see if if the the
impact that has had in the United States
can be reproduced elsewhere Thank You
mr. Kim I'm Juan from Cigna I'm from
South Korea and I have a question to ask
you about
the woman's - initiative I mean the
woman entrepreneurs' finance initiative
that was mischievously launched by the
World Bank in July please feel free to
correct me if I'm wrong but from what I
understand about how the initiative of
work is the 1 billion financing that the
World Bank has will go down to
multilateral banks which will go down to
financial institutions which will
eventually go down to one more
entrepreneurs but some of the criticism
has been about how multilateral banks
will be able to arbitrarily define women
owned banks I mean women owned
businesses and be able to target the
women entrepreneurs that they want and
how does the World Bank intend to target
what you aptly call it the poorest of
the poor and especially considering the
fact that a lot of women entrepreneurs
in developing countries are engaging in
informal networks and informal markets
where they're not captured by the gut
state governments or formal institutions
and also if you don't mind could you
give us a update on the financing
because I'm from what I understand that
325 million was funded in August's and I
haven't seen a update since then so that
was a lot of questions a lot of
questions okay well I'm sorry so let me
just so we started something strongly
supported by the Trump administration
but also Ivanka Trump specifically and
it's actually built on our previous
experience we had something we did a
program called 10,000 women that we did
with Goldman Sachs where we so the great
thing about the World Bank Group is that
we have been in these developing
countries in the case of IFC the private
sector group for 60 years in the case of
the World Bank for more than 70 years so
we have incredible networks in all of
these different areas and the the idea
here and is just getting started
and the number right now is over 350
million and the 350 million of grant
donations will be leveraged with our own
financing - I think well over a billion
we're not quite sure how far it will go
but right now there is a huge gap in
financing for women entrepreneurs part
of it is because there were
and they the criteria for getting a loan
is often something that that just can't
be overcome in many many developing
countries and so that's why we've
created women a fun specifically focused
on women that we will preferentially try
to find women entrepreneurs the 10,000
women project has been tremendously
successful and because we have these
networks were able to find women
entrepreneurs now you're right that in
many countries a lot of the women-owned
businesses start out informally now you
know the the the micro enterprise
lending phenomenon has done a lot to
support informal women-owned businesses
but one of the problems with micro
enterprise lending is that it that very
very few women who started off getting
these micro loans turned their informal
enterprises into formal businesses
that's why we're focusing on
entrepreneurship because we want to
identify those women who've done well on
an informal level and who are ready to
create formal businesses now it's just
one part of what we do we also have
conditional cash transfers that go
directly to the poorest women but the
fact that we were able to raise three
hundred and fifty million dollars from
16 or 17 different countries in four
months was was really encouraging thank
you very much my name is Catherine I'm
international student from Venezuela
here at Columbia University and my
question is regarding countries that are
facing a little political instability
for example Venezuela in the last few
years has Rison the poverty rate has
risen from 40 percent to over 80 percent
and the humanitarian crisis is it's
really really precarious so how do you
build or what's the base best way to
deal with countries institutions like
this with the political instability has
caused such extreme rates of poverty
yeah so we were what we're not we're not
working in Venezuela right now and part
of it's because we would only work there
if the government asked for our support
and they haven't asked for our support
yet
are unfortunately fragility conflict
violence there are now 2 billion people
living in countries that are in some way
affected by fragility conflict and
violence so in our fund for the poorest
countries
it's called Ida which is seventy five
billion dollars over over three years we
have doubled the the the amount of funds
that are going to go to fragile and
fragile and conflict affected countries
we've been thinking hard about this and
we as a World Bank we're not very
involved in things like refugee problems
but Antonio Guterres now the
secretary-general of the United Nations
when he was the High Commissioner for
Refugees came to me and said you guys
have to get involved in the refugee
situation and I said why is is because
some of these situations last for so
long that we find ourselves a bunch of
lawyers doing development work so we
need to work together we need to find a
way to go upstream and stop these things
from happening so what we're focused on
right now is identifying sort of pre
fragile pre conflict countries and
intervene to see if we can prevent this
path down to fragility in conflict one
of the things we know investing in human
beings is critically part of it and one
of the things I worry most about is
there so many refugees and so many of
those refugee children are not getting
any education so there in the time that
they're refugees we're investing
essentially nothing in in in their
education so the reason this is so
urgent and it's something that the
Germans understand very well I mean you
know during the German g20 which is just
you know it's still going on but that
the summit was in Hamburg in July
Chancellor Merkel at that time it was
the mr. finance Wolfgang schÃ¤uble I
kept saying okay we we absorbed 1
million refugees from the Middle East in
North Africa but if we don't invest more
in in sub-saharan Africa what we saw
over the last few years is nothing
compared to what will happen if if
people from Nigeria and Kenya start
getting on boats if Ethiopia falls apart
so the German
leadership of the g20 understood very
carefully understood very well how
important prevention was right and so
this is part of that effort right we're
we that the prevention piece of it is
investing in human beings so that
instead of being frustrated by the lack
of opportunity that they're creating
businesses that they're you know
becoming doctors and lawyers and other
kinds of things that will it will
improve the prospects for everyone so
not working in Venezuela there's other
countries we're not working in Cuba not
working in North Korea a number of
countries we're not we're we're not
working yet but when Myanmar opened up
when Burma opened up and there there are
lots of issues there now we were one of
the first organizations to go in and
that's my my hope is that once a very
conflict-affected fragile country opens
up we can move in quickly I'm afraid
we're gonna have to leave it there we
are out of time but thank you very much
for all of your questions of course you
can keep it
thank you and of course you can keep the
conversation going online the hashtag is
invest in people and with that that
brings to an end the 2017 Gabriel silver
