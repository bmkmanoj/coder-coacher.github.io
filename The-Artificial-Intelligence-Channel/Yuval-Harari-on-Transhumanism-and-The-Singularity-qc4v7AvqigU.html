history of Homo Sapien from the
collective revolution 70,000 years ago
up to the present day in the last lesson
of the code I want to take a look at the
potential future of Homo Sapien what is
going to happen to our issue in the
coming century - in all likelihood our
species in going with the fear we are
probably one of the last generation of
Homo Sapien in the medium future within
a few decades or a couple of centuries
mode homo sapien will disappear now I
don't mean I don't think that our
species will ameliorate itself in some
nuclear or environmental catastrophe
rather our P she will disappear because
it is going to upgrade itself into a
completely different kind of being as we
told the previous lesson there have
already been many far reaching
revolutions in history political social
cultural and technological revolution
yet through all these revolutions for
tens of thousands of years one thing
remained relatively constant and this is
the human
themselv homo sapien victory is a great
constant of history the taken mind and
the tape in body have been the constant
day on which also title all identity or
religion has been founded our world
today is very different from the world
of day biblical time but people in
in Jerusalem in the time of the Bible at
displaying basic bodily and mental
abilities that we have today they the
people in the park experience the world
in roughly the same way that we
experience it today and ddy we feel kind
much of interest in the Bible or in the
philosophy of Plato or in the writings
or conclusions because they were written
by people just like you and me
this however is about to change the next
big revolution in history will echo
transform the economy and politics and
society and all that but it will also
transform our bodies and our mind and it
will replace Homo sapiens with a very
different kind of being when we think
about the future we'll usually think
about a world in which people like you
and me will enjoy better technology they
will have like fitted sheet they will
have laser gun they will have
intelligent robots in total this is what
we usually imagine but the truly
revolutionary potential of Technology it
to change people and not just our tool
and our weapon it's not the page it that
are going to be different in the future
it being the travel in the spaceship
that will be defrayed now how exactly
will hold a pin upgrade equal into a
different kind of beings at present the
great main method the human thing to be
able to use in order to upgrade themself
the first method is biological
engineering the
committed in cyborg engineering time
bugs are being that combine organic with
non-organic part these are table and the
third method for upgrading homosapiens
it by engineering inorganic life life
which is not based at all on organic
power I will now try to examine briefly
these three method to totally understand
what what we are talking about so the
first method this might be used to
upgrade Homo Sapien into a new kind of
being in biological engineering
biological engineering is any deliberate
intervention on the biological level for
example implanting a gene or taking some
drug which is aimed to modify the shape
the capabilities the need of the desire
of an organism there is nothing new
about biological engineering percent
people have been using biological
engineering for thousands upon thousands
of years in order to reshape themselves
and in order to reshape other organism
like dogs and cows and horses and so
forth a simple example of biological
engineering in castration human have
been cut rating bull for perhaps 10,000
yield in order to create Achtung Achtung
are little aggressive than bull and
under code easier to train in to
dominate and to make them pull wagons
and cows and flows and so forth to
decrease biological engineering you take
a bull with very aggressive you can
trade it you get an oak which is much
more easier to
humans similarly used car tration on
themselves cut rating young men or
children in order to create a piranha
fingers with wonderful voices or in
order to create contrasted eunuch who
could basically God the harm of the
Sultan or the Emperor without any danger
that they may do something with the
thousand women because they can't the
advantage of castrating men but recent
atrocities biological engineering and
it's not new in itself what is new is
the degree that the ability to date
theological engineering recent advances
in our understanding of how organisms
work down to the cellular and molecular
level have opened up before possibility
for biological engineering which
previously were simply unimaginable for
example today we can not only create a
man which is relatively simple but we
can use all kinds of hormonal and crew n
surgical treatment in order to turn the
man into a woman to change his technique
are more ambitious than just contraction
and let's not all look for example at
dick photograph this photograph was
published in 1996 almost twenty years
ago and when it appeared it sent shock
waves around the world it's called the
girli huge stones now this is a real
photograph of a real mouth it is not
something that somebody created on Cotto
shop it's a real mouth what you see here
is a very real mouth on whose back
scientists have implanted the calculus
cell which they took from cattle from
cows now the scientists were able not
only to implant
these cows held on the bank of the mouth
but also to control the growth of the
new tissue and to shape it into
something that look very similar to a
human ear and they can shape it into all
kinds of other shapes that they want
this process is now used in all kinds of
laboratories in hospital in order to try
and manufacture artificial ill and other
artificial organic structures that can
then be implanted in humans for example
somebody lost his ear now this
photograph is a kind of eerie echo of
the lion man that you promised from the
saddle cave that we encountered in the
second lesson of because in the cave of
the lion man from the shuttle came human
imagined a combination of a human and a
lion now thirty thousand years ago
people could imagine could think about
such a hybrid creature half human half
lion and they could make an ivory touch
you of touch a Christian but nobody
30,000 years ago knew how to actually
produce a living being which is habit of
them today
humans are acquiring the ability to
actually produce touch beings with the
help of very sophisticated biological
engineering this mouth that you see here
in a real combination of power taking
from cattle with a mouth with the body
of the mouth of all the kinds of
biological engineering that we did today
developing the ones that attract the
most attention is genetic engineering
genetic engineering ebay on taking
yiii from one organism and implanting
this gene in the DNA of a different
organism for example today we know and
it is often done we know how to take a
gene from a jellyfish that glows in a
green fluorescent light and to implant
the gene in a rabbit or a monkey which
then autoscout to glow in a green
fluorescent lighting it has been done in
monkey it can be done with human too
we have now the technology to take this
gene from a jellyfish to implanted in
human DNA and you will get a human being
that glows in a green fluorescent light
it hasn't actually been done because of
all kinds of ethical a prohibition but
technically we know how to do it
another example concerns the genetic
engineering of all kinds of
microorganism the bacteria equaling has
been genetically engineered by scientist
to produce biofuel lot of biofuels in
order to try and solve the energy
problems of the world the plane bacteria
equaling and other species of a micro
organisms and fungus have also been
genetically engineered to start
producing insulin and thereby lower the
cost of insulin and the cause of
diabetes treatment another interesting
example is the scientist extracted a
gene from a kind of Arctic fish that
lived in the Arctic Ocean and inserted
the gene from the fish into the DNA of
potatoes in order to make the potatoes
more resistant to rot and to cold
condition the electric engineering is
used increasingly not only on micro
organisms and in jellyfish and the
potatoes it is also
on mammal for example every year the
dairy industry the milk industry
suffered billions of dollars of damages
due to a disease called Motiti Motiti is
between the strike dairy cow the others
of dairy cows and causes all kinds of
problems earth scientists are currently
experimenting with genetically
engineered cows that the milk of those
genetically engineered code contains
contains a bio chemical called little
stuffing and this bio chemicals attack
the bacteria which called Motiti and the
panted hope that in this way the problem
of McDivitt will be told by genetically
engineering being counted dairy cows the
illicit have already managed to engineer
also other mammals like night and grain
there's managed to engineer jeannie
Adnan the de clay not only different
physical qualities but genius mind that
we play that have improve cognitive
abilities improved memory improved
learning killed now how do you know how
do you measure the cognitive ability of
the mouth it's not so difficult you have
all these amazing is that the standard
give my mind to to to soul you put the
mountain in the main and there are all
kinds of a all kind of levels of
difficulty for the amazing can you see
the day genetically engineered mouse is
able to solve a normal main much quicker
than a normal Mouse and the genetically
the genius genetically engineered mouse
is able to solve very difficult mazes
that normal mind cannot solve but we
have your evidence of a real cognitive
change brought about by genetic
engineering now if you can do touch
think to mine you can certainly do them
to Homo sapiens
as well the ability the need the desire
of Homo sapiens just like those of might
have a genetic date and the Sapien DNA
is not much more complex than the DNA of
mine
the sapien genome is only 14 percent
larger than the genome of mine that
practically the same the same a level of
complexity so there is no technical
reason why we couldn't card engineering
superhuman or why they couldn't create
entire new species of human different
from Homo Sapien in the medium range
perhaps in a few decades or centuries to
genetic engineering and other home of
biological engineering might well enable
us to make far-reaching changes not only
in our physiology and in our immune
system and in our life expectancy but
they will also enable us to make major
intellectual major changes to our
intellectual and emotional capacity if
genetic engineering can create genius
mind there is no obvious reason why it
couldn't create super human genius units
if you remember the cognitive revolution
the turned homo sapien from an
insignificant African ape into the
master of the world did not require any
noticeable change in human physiology it
did not even require a change in the
time an external shape of the human
brain
apparently the cognitive revolution
resulted from a few small changes in the
in turn
no structure of the tape Ian's brain
so perhaps another relatively small
change in the human brain brought about
with ethnic engineering would be enough
to ignite the second cognitive
revolution to create a completely new
kind of consequence and to transform
Homo sapiens into something very very
different from us something different
from us just as we are different from
the Neanderthal now we are still not
there don't where you are still not
there in 2013 but there's been no inter
mountable technical gap separating us
from the production of Dutch superhuman
the main obstacle on the way to the
creation of superhuman are not practical
the main obstacles are ethical and
political objection that slowed down the
research on human the research on mind
is much more advanced than the research
on human because of the ethical and
political configuration and no matter
how convincing these ethical and
political arguments are it is very hard
to think how they could hold back the
neck step in the process indefinitely or
even Co very long especially because
what is at stake here is the possibility
of prolonging human life indefinitely
giving human indefinite life spent
living forever
what is the tank in conquering all kinds
of diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's
and so forth and what is it take it
upgrading our cognitive and emotional
abilities so it's unlikely the deep
ethical and political objection
indefinitely prevent the research from
going forward what would happen for
example if scientists managed to develop
a cure for Alzheimer's disease that at
the same time in the time benefit could
also dramatically improve the memories
of the cognitive abilities of healthy
people would any government or any
combination of government would be able
to stop the relevant research and if
they killed a technique is indeed
developed with any government or any
police be able to limit the usage of
this invention only to cure altmer
patient and to prevent healthy people
from using this technology to acquire
super memory and all kinds of amazing
capabilities it is unlikely so this is
the first method by which Homo sapiens
might upgrade cell upgrade itself quite
soon into something completely different
biological engineering in the next
segment of this lesson we will examine
two other methods that we might use to
upgrade out those in a engineering type
of and engineering non organic life
in the previous segment will it cut one
method by which homo sapien might
upgrade itself into something completely
different and this is biological
engineering another method to upgrade
human is Bible engineering tiberg our
being with combined organic and
inorganic part such as a human with
Bionic hang in a sense all of us our
tribal did a inter natural tenses and
function are supplemented improved by
devices such as eyeglasses and
pacemakers and even computer computers
perform more and more talk previously
done by our organic brains in memory
however in the new future the process is
likely to go much much further we are
likely to talk having inorganic devices
connected directly to all brains into
our a novelty devices that will be
inseparable from us and it will change
our abilities desire personality and
identity one example is the bionic ear
we already have functioning prototype of
bionic ear a bionic ear means an implant
that absorb sound wave through a
microphone located on the outer part of
the ear the implant filtered bead down
identified human voices and other
important town and try to lay this down
into electric signal that has been sent
directly to the central auditory nerve
and
from there to the brain the Bionic touch
bionic ear can not only enable deaf
people to doubt hearing but it can also
enable healthy people to acquire amazing
new hearing abilities the same can be
done with bionic eyes Bionic nose world
and even bionic arm and leg you see here
before you a picture a real picture of
Jetix sullivan holding hands with
Claudia Mitchell justin is an American
electrician who looked both his arm up
to the shoulder in 2001 in an accident
Claudia has lost one arm in a motorcycle
accident both of them now use bionic arm
the amazing thing about this bionic arm
is that they are operated by rote alone
neural signal arriving from the brain
and translated by microcomputer so it's
more computers into electric command and
according to this command the arms move
when gently Oh Claudia want to move the
right arm they do whatever normal any
normal person
unconsciously does when I want to move
my arm up I don't know I just think
about it it move exactly the same thing
just in close you can now do with the
bionic arm just think about it and they
are moved at present these Bionic arms
are a very poor replacement for the
organic original but they have the
potential for unlimited technological
development Bionic art for example in
the future where in the distant future
in the near future can be made much more
powerful than the organic arm even of
the world boxing champion
moreover the unique arm has the
big advantage that they can be replayed
every few years or upgraded whenever a
new model appears on the market they can
also be detached from the body and
operated in a distance we have used to
all the parts of her body being
connected here and part of a single
single body but these are just our
organic but it work
once you have organic hands and organic
eyes and ears in cohort there is no
reason why the all the time have to be
connected and be in the same room of the
tank PT or even the same continent or
planet scientists at Duke University in
North Carolina have recently
demonstrated it with rhesus monkey they
took rhesus monkey and implanted in the
brains of the monkeys electrode the
electrode gathered signal from the brain
and transmitted these signals to
external devices that control arm in
legs and so forth
the monkey were trained to control
detached Bionic arms and leg through
throat alone one monkey called Aurora
learned how to control only with her
mind only with her thoughts a detached
bionic arm while simultaneously moving
her to organic arm so or I'd now like
some Hindu goddess she has three arms
and her arm can be located at least the
third arm can be located in a different
room in another city another continent
or over can't eat in a laboratory in
North Carolina crutch her head with one
hand Crutcher back with another hand and
pin alternate clink feel a banana in new
york with the third hand which
controlled by the mind alone and
associate concerned is the hand of her
she feels like a hand
another of Aurora companions the real
monkey called Edo I became very famous
in the year 2008 when she called
controlled a pair of bionic leg which
were positioned at the time in Japan
from her chair in North Carolina
she said in North Carolina with her
brain connected through the internet to
beat length in Japan and she walked in
Japan with with the thought even though
the leg in Japan were 20 tying the
weight of a Doyle entire body another
very interesting development concerned
the possibility to mind-read to read the
content the thought in the mind of a
person there is a very severe disease
which is called the locked-in syndrome
because people who suffer from it are
kind of locked in people who have
locked-in syndrome gradually lose on
evening all or nearly all the ability to
move all parts of the body but the
cognitive ability to feel and to think
and so forth they remain intact and they
become locked inside their body unable
to do anything now people suffering from
this terrible Kingdom have up till now
been able to communicate with the
outside world only through very small
eye movement they can still make very
small eye movement and it is how they
signify yet though no anything like that
however there are now standing in which
patients will suffer from deep in Durham
has electrode implanted in their brain
like what they did with the monkey and
these electrodes also they gathered
signals from the brain and planted for
making an escort to translate these
signals not only into movement of Bionic
arms and legs and computers and so forth
but also to translate them into words in
the experiment the cream it means that
locked-in syndrome and people who doctor
from locked-in syndrome would be able to
pick directly with the outside world
with the computer at the translator
translating the brain signals into world
and also is deep the clean it means that
we will have at our disposal the ability
to read the thought in the mind of
another person directly whether he wants
it or not the thing was the CIA for
example could do with such an amazing
invention however of all the project
currently under development in the field
of fiber engineering the most
revolutionary project is the attempt to
create a two-way brain computer
interface that will allow computers to
read the electrical signal of the human
brain while simultaneously transmitting
signals that the brain can read and
interpret in an event now just imagine
what is touch direct interfaces are used
to directly link a brain to the internet
so you can surf the internet just with
your consciousness not with finger than
I all to directly link several brain to
the same computer and thereby linking
all of them together and creating a
thought of inter brain net what might
happen in such a case to think like
human memory human consciousness you an
identity if the brain can have direct
acted to collect the data bank and
collective memory in such a situation
one tyberg could for example retrieve
the memory of somebody else not to hear
about them not to read about them in a
book not to imagine how this tells the
master spelled but to directly remember
the memory of somebody else and if they
were his own or perhaps their own what
happened to contact like gender identity
when mind become collective and when a
man can actually remember the memories
of the woman nobody knows the answer to
the complicated question what is quite
clear if the touch tiberg would no
longer be human they would not even be
organic creatures organic animal they
would be something completely different
from us and from any other animal they
would be fundamentally another kind of
beings that we cannot even begin to
grant the philosophical psychological
and the political implications of such
an eventuality so this is the second
method by which Homo sapiens may upgrade
itself into some other kind of being by
using tiberg engineering the third
method for creating some kind of new
entity that will take our place in the
world
it's by engineering completely non
organic being type of pill combined
brain with computers all kinds of
organic part with inorganic part but
there is a possibility of creating
completely non organic beings without
any organic part
the most obvious example in computer
program and computer viruses that can
undergo independent evolution and can
develop and learn new things
independently computer scientists today
are trying to create learning computer
programs that can learn by themselves
that can involve completely
independently of the person who
initially program we initially created
this program the
that independently learning program
would be created by a human but one it
exists it can card evolving in new and
very different direction which neither
it maker know any other Union could ever
have predicted a prototype of such a
program and of their evolution already
exists and it is called a computer virus
and the computer virus print through the
internet
the virus is replicated millions upon
millions of time all the time being
chained by predatory antivirus program
that try to Detroit and all the time
competing with other other viruses and
other programs for the limited pain
inside directly now what happened is one
day when this virus replicated tails the
mistake occurred some computerized
mutation perhaps the mistake the
mutation occurs because the human
engineer this initially programmed the
virus programmed it to make random
application with take every now invent
perhaps the mutation occurred due to
some random error who are not crippled
and if by chance the new virus the
modified version of the virus is better
at evading antivirus program without
losing its ability to invade other
computers then beat new version of the
virus will read quickly through cyber
state and equal the mutant viruses will
survive and reproduce better than the
previous version and end time goes by
fiber state will become full of new
viruses that no human engineered viruses
that undergo non-organic
evolution now I'll be living creatures
in bit life it depends on what you mean
by the term life and living creature but
what is certain is that there is here if
there is here a new pathway and you and
method for evolution a new evolutionary
process which is completely independent
of the organic world of the Lord and
limitation of organic evolution now
imagine another possibility the pole you
could take your brain and back it up on
a computer and then run it on the
computer would your computer be able to
think and to feel like a staple and it
no would it be you or would it be
somebody else what is computer
programming could create an entirely new
but digital mind composed of computer
code when complete with a sense of belts
and memories and so forth
if you ran past a program on your
computer would it be a certain if you
delete it could you be charged with
murder
it sounds very very hypothetical all
these questions but we might have the
answer good question much sooner than
most people realize
in 2005 target launched the Blue Brain
Project and the Blue Brain Project Hope
correctly egg a complete human brain
inside a computer with electronic
circuit in the computer emulating the
neural would network in the brain
whatever they all the electric signals
in the brain that this no intent to
destroy one totally hope to replicate it
inside the computer with electronic
signals from this lyrical to this
miracle in the computer now the program
director
and claim that if the project received
proper funding within a mere decade or
two we could have an artificial human
brain inside a computer an artificial
bionic brain that could talk and feel
and behave much as a human done not all
colors a green the different possible
because many colors argue that the mind
work in a manner which is very different
from the way that computers work but it
not which will never be input it will it
will never be possible to create a mind
inside a computer with a lot of
arguments about it
however we should note that just a few
months ago in April 2013 the European
Union decided to make the Blue Brain
Project the flagship of the European
science in the years to come and to give
to donate 1 billion euro to finance this
project again 1 billion euros not 1
million 1 billion so it lick the head of
the European Union of the time the the
part of the European Union they think
that there is serious possibility of the
Blue Brain Project receiving these then
of the three main method by which Homo
Sapien might upgrade itself into some
other kind of being with biological
engineering with time for engineering
and with the engineering of non organic
life if any of these methods
bactine and if this really occur what
would be the causal and the political
and the ethical implication of such a
thing we will become the social and
political and ethical implications in
the next segment of
in the previous segment we discussed
three main method by which homo sapien
might upgrade itself into some other
kind of beings biological engineering
fiber engineering and the engineering of
non organic life presently only tiny
fraction of the potential of these
methods has actually been realized yet
already today in 2013 we are in the
middle of an immense social political
and ethical revolution more and more
layers of activity are being shaken out
of the complacent way lawyers and judges
need to rethink issues of privacy and
identity government need to rethink
matters of health care and equality for
the procreation and educational
institutions need to redefine what her
play means and what achievement means
and pension fund and labor organizations
need to really jump to a world in which
dictum might well be the new 30 they not
all deal with the ethical and social
problem which are raised by bio
engineering by tiberg and by inorganic
life take the issue of privacy for
example mapping the third human genome
took 15 years and create billion dollars
today you can make your DNA within a few
days at the course of a few hundred
dollars that many companies on the
internet that also deserve it this opens
the way they eat me a mapping of DNA it
opened the way to a revolution in
medical care it opened the way to
personalized medicine that matches
treatment to your own
DNA will be a print of your DNA the
family doctor can tell you with greater
certainty than ever before that you
yourself play high risk of liver cancer
whereas giving your DNA you don't need
to marry wasn't meant to worry of a much
about heart attack because you're very
unlikely to have a heart attack the
family doctor could also determine based
on your DNA did a very popular
medication that helped 92 percent of the
population it useless for you and the
intent you should take another pill
which is dangerous to most people but
for you it is just perfect
however with is the ability to map your
DNA may open the way to other things as
well for example would insurance company
be entitled to act to see your DNA 10
and to raise premiums if they discover
that you have a genetic tendency to
reckless behavior so they say okay you
have this gene you pay double all for
example when you apply for a job could
your future boss ask that instead of
texting him your TV I did watch your TV
tract neo DNA that's much better I want
to do DNA not your TV would the employer
be entitled to ask for such a thing
and would the employer be entitled to
favor somebody else to give the job to
somebody else because he liked her DNA
more than he liked your DNA because you
have you some suspicious gene which is
often connected with all kinds of total
the problematic behavior so he prefers
her would you be able in touch a que to
do for genetic discrimination or would
it be acceptable why not if we have DNA
when it uses
that dilemma out walk by the ethical
with social and the political
implication of the Gilgamesh project the
project to give human eternal life and
by the potential new ability to create
Cooper Union the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights government medical
programs throughout the world national
health insurance program and national a
continued constitution worldwide
recognized that a humane society a good
society ought to give all its members
fair medical treatment and to keep all
members of society as solid possible in
relatively good health that was all very
good and well as long as medicine was
chiefly concerned with preventing
illness and with healing the TIC what
would happen one medicine becomes more
and more preoccupied with enhancing
human abilities giving humans new
abilities instead of just healing
dignitaries and irritants would all
human be entitled to touch enhanced
abilities Oh would there be a new
superhuman elite that only they have
deeds wonderful new abilities our modern
world today pride itself on recognizing
for the first time in history the basic
equality of all human but we might be
point to create the most unequal society
that ever existed on earth throughout
history the upper classes always claimed
that they are smarter they are stronger
they are better than the underclass but
they were usually just deluding them
in the Middle Ages the King for their
very superior to the thousand but a baby
born to a poor peasant family was likely
to be an intelligent as the crown prince
at the time of the king however today
with the help of new medical scientific
capabilities the pretensions of the
upper classes might become an objective
reality they might really be louder and
stronger and better than the other than
the underclass and everybody else and we
need to realize that this is not science
fiction this is time most science
fiction plot decribe a world in which a
peon identical to you and me enjoy
superior technology such as fate ships
the traveling speed of light and laser
gun and the ethical and political
dilemmas which are central to the
science-fiction movies and books they
are concerned with people like you and
me they are taken from our world and
merely recreate our social tension and
our emotional dilemma again a futuristic
backdrop but the real potential of
future technology it to change noted
pages but Homo sapiens itself including
our emotion and quote and desire type
fiction rarely describe such a future
because an accurate description it by
definition incomprehensible to people
today producing a film about the life of
some Cooper's tyberg in the future if
life producing Hamlet to an audience of
Neandertal they want to be able to
understand what happenings and similar
we can't understand a real story about
the future and what should the empty
tile it is the future masters of the
world if all these predictions come true
we'll probably be much more different
from us then we are different from the
undertow well as we and the Neanderthals
have a cleat human and organic these
future beings are going to be godlike
and probably inorganic at least in part
of their body this is why more and more
colored thing just was really aways that
in the future is distinguishing now what
is the singularity the singularity is
the point in which our world of meanings
collapses completely a point when
everything we know about ourselves and
above the world all our hopes and fears
and so forth our very identity they will
all become irrelevant we cannot imagine
these points or anything happening after
this point it is singular it is not
comparable to anything else within our
field of experience the third excell
singularity in taken from physics
physicists define the Big Bang in a
singularity the Big Bang was a point
when all no natural laws including state
and time did not exist and did not
function in any way that we can
understand using our current models and
knowledge and anything that happened
before the Big Bang is also meaningless
to us the very notion of time had no
meaning during the Big Bang so it is
meaningless
to kick about things happening before
the Big Bang because there is no time so
this is a point of singularity in the
talk the Big Bang we might not be
approaching another future point of
singularity in which our known world of
meaning will simply collapse everything
happening beyond that point is
incomprehensible to us and it's useless
to try and imagine it or talk about it
unless some nuclear or ecological cutter
job intervenes the state of
technological development in no rapid
that we will soon come to the point when
Homo sapiens is replaced by completely
different being who possess not only
different beliefs but also different
cognitive and emotional abilities and
experiences this is something that most
people most type in find extremely
troublesome extremely disconcerting we
like to believe that in the future
people like us will travel from planet
to planet in fact hatred we don't like
to contemplate the possibility that in
the future being with emotions and
identity like ours will no longer exist
and our place in the universe will be
taken by alien life-forms with ability
grow our ability a lien life-form or
dependents who would look on us in the
same way that will look at Neanderthal
now it should be at the time that all
this is of course just speculation
nobody really knows what will happen in
the future it would be surprising it's
all the forecast and given today
and if all the talker that I mentioned
in the last few minutes would be
realized in whom he threw it teaches us
again and again that would things to be
inevitable of just around the corner may
never materialize just lead you to all
kinds of unforeseen barriers and that in
Contra other scenarios which nobody
thought oh they will actually happen for
example when the nuclear age began in
the 1940 with the bombing of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki and later on when the faith
age began when the Soviets launched
Sputnik faith and the Americans landed a
man on the moon then everybody began
fantasizing and forecasting that in the
year 2000 people will live in colonies
on Mouse and on the moon and in on Pluto
and which will and all kinds of
fantasies and pocus
about the nuclear world of the you 2000
based you of all the in poker actually
happened
we don't live today in colonies on Mouse
used by nuclear energy in contracts
nobody in the time of Hiroshima and
putnik and managed to polka the internet
which in very tech is much more amazing
than living in Milan on low income
nuclear colony so you should take most
of what I said in this lesson not as
reliable forecasts for the future but
war as a finland for your imagination
what we should take very seriously if
not the exact forecast but the basic
idea that the next stage of history will
include not only technological and
organizational transformation but also
fundamental revolution in human
consciousness and human idea
anything and then could be revolution so
fundamental the day will call into
question the very term humans
whatever happened after the Revolution
it won't be human anymore
now how long do we have until this
happened until singularity
nobody really know the cause some
experts say with by the year 2050 let
them fall to youth from now they will
already be superhuman living on earth
let's radical focus think about the next
century or two centuries or three
centuries but from the perspective of
seventy thousand years of AT&amp;amp;T story
what are a few centuries we are very
very close to the end of Homo Sapien to
the end of history and to the beginning
of something completely different
whether it will think a few centuries or
if you decade what's becoming very clear
it did we tape Ian's business start
thinking about these matters the most
important question facing humankind
today is what do we want to become this
question in called the human enhancement
question in what way do we want to
enhance humankind and this question work
all the day the currently preoccupy
politician and colors and philosophers
and ordinary people after all all these
debates today between various nations
and ideologies and religions and classes
will disappear along with homo sapien if
our total human successors indeed
function on a different level of
consciousness or perhaps will possess
something beyond consciousness which we
can't contain
then these being it's very doubtful that
they will have any interest in
Christianity or eat plum that they will
organize themselves in a community or
copy Kellie Twain or even that they will
have genders like art males and females
all this will disappear most people
prefer simply not to think about the
possibility even the field of bioethics
crystals usually to address another
question most bioethicist people who are
interested in the ethic of all the
biotechnology and so forth
they're usually accident well not what
do we want to become but work is
forbidden to do it is acceptable for
example to make genetic tournament on
living human being it's okay to do
experiments on aborted physical or on
tensile it is ethical to clone sheep it
is ethical to clone chimpanzee what
about human now all these questions are
important I don't want to say that they
are not important but it is naive to
imagine that we might simply hit the
brake and stop scientific project that
are upgrading Homo sapiens
into a different kind of beings it
impossible to completely top such kind
of project because they are inextricably
meshed together with the human quaint to
overcome the need to overcome them the
Gilgamesh project our scientists were
studying the genome or AK scientists who
try to connect a brain to a computer or
try to connect a mind inside the
computer why they do this why do you
want to do this nine out of ten times
you will get the same standard answer we
we are trying to connect the brain to
computer we are trying to create a brain
inside a computer we are trying to the
type of the secret of DNA in order to
cure the demon be if the standard answer
and this is the standard answer because
nobody could really argue with it it was
wonderful to 2d business why not even
though the implication of breaking the
code of the DNA or the implications of
creating a mind entire computer our fall
far more dramatic than curing disease oh
that disease this is still the standard
certification for all the scientific a
project because this is justification it
convinces everybody nobody can argue
with it and this is why the Gilgamesh
project the attempt to overcome the deal
all the age and death is the flagship of
time it served to justify everything the
tsiyon done whenever the readout we just
think about that and we say okay go on
so this is why we cannot stop the march
of science and technology the only thing
we can try to do is to somehow influence
the direction they are taking we have
therefore to start acting ourselves not
only what is forbidden to do what we
need to ask a far more important and
difficult question what do we want to
become and pimply might very soon be
able to engineer our desires as well the
real question faith in humankind today
in what do we want to want those who are
not frightened those who are not put by
the question what do we want to want
probably haven't given this question in
a thought
with the troubling question what do you
want to want we come to the end of deep
core before we take goodbye
I want to tread one more that what we
learned during the code the brief
history of humankind is not the truth it
is Jake one possible story about the
history of humankind if you ask 10
different historian to give this code
you would only get 10 very different
stories so you shouldn't accept
everything you have in because and the
truth it is better to take it as an
invitation to explore history by
yourself my aim in keeping the code was
not so much to convince him this bit of
that particular theory is true but
rather to raise important questions in
your mind about the history of humankind
about the past present and future of
humankind so I hope that you live the
call with more question then you have
when you enter this and that you leave
this code with a desire with a wish to
study and to learn more about our
history in addition I hope that you
leave this course
feeling a bit more uneasy then when you
started it and evening about the many
questions to which we urine have no
clear answer yet and even about the many
problematic events that happened in the
cart and uneasy about the erection
history may be taking us in the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
