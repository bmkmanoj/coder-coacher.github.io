the organizers for having me here I want
to present from work from the Google
artificial intelligence lab and tell you
a little bit about our experiences in
building actual Quenton processors and
then maybe relaying some insight some
learnings from this effort to this
community who is interested in whether
quantum effects do play a role in higher
brain function now we'll go from sort of
more hard engineering to more
speculative ideas so first I want to
explain you in experiments that you may
have read in the news about and knock on
wood we hope to be able to perform it
later this year and this is the so
called command supremacy experiment it's
a bit unfortunate name but it was given
by the Feynman professor at Caltech John
pesco and said it was refined for
example by Sergey on our team but the
basic idea of quantum supremacy is that
you have a well-defined computational
task and you have a quantum processor
that can do this task in a short time
say a second while even the fastest
classical supercomputer that would be
currently in Taiyo light in China would
not be able to do this in a reasonable
time let's say a year note however that
for this benchmarking it's not
necessarily required that it's a useful
task it can be an exotic mathematical
problem so how do we perform this
experiment of course if you want a win
with a quantum processor as may be best
to start on the home turf of sequential
processor and you write down a quantum
algorithm and you may not familiar with
this notation here as the details don't
matter so much
does Quentin sheet music it has three
basic parts you start your qubits in
time zero let's say here all started
them in the zero state and then there's
a bunch of gates that either act on a
single qubit on two qubits and you apply
a number of those gates and then at the
end of the day we'll have a Quentin
state and possibly it can be a
superposition state that is a very broad
entangled superposition over if you had
n qubits to start with you could have
support over 2 to the N classical bit
strings as as a Hilbert space involved
here's 2 to the number of qubits you
start with and then you will at the end
measure this state but measuring a
quantum state is really sampling from a
probability distribution encoded in this
quantum state so the next thing you're
going to do is you take your Quentin
chip and here you see actually as our
latest chip it's a 22 cubed chip and
sits in our labs in Santa Barbara we use
superconducting qubits and they operate
in these devices that you here's see
here to the left
so court dilution refrigerators say
keeps the chips at about 10 Mille Kelvin
and so it's the little quantum
algorithms that I showed you can be put
onto the random chips that's what I made
for and then I can do this protocol and
essentially measure M bit strings and so
I take m samples from this probability
distribution and then next thing is I
will try to see with which probability
should I have seen those samples and we
initially work together with high
performance computing experts at Intel
but it's nicer to play against a red
team play against the south and they
managed to push this to 42 cubits so 442
cubits they used the Edison computer
from Department of Energy and with that
they were able to give us exact
probabilities which you should have seen
the bitstrings when you measure but just
a few weeks ago there was a team
collaborators of our stamina Tiger and
Thomas Hanna from ETH Zurich who
improved this they pushed it to 45
qubits booking out this machine on the
pictures as quarry - at the US Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory it's one of
the top supercomputers in the world and
you had to clean this thing out for a
whole day to compute the probabilities
that the circuits that I showed you
produces and then you're kind of Dunsey
in the task is to show that the samples
from this probability distributions at
your processor quantum processor
produces are close enough to the ideal
distributions that you wrote down on
paper by defining your 20-mile grism
said no classical machine could produce
samples of similar quality and this
chart here's a little bit to illustrate
why is this why is this a hard task in
the first place it is a hard task in the
first place because it's I don't know
whether you have ever seen this and
sometimes I bring a demo along like a
little laser where your visions of laser
speckles is so intricate patterns that
laser produces probably two week and
those speckle patterns they come about
from because it's a coherent light
source so when it goes through the
diffuser let's say on some glass then
you have a lot of different pathways the
light can go and sometimes you have
constructive sometimes you have
destructive interference and that
is very intricate patterns versus an
incoherent light source if you would
just have taken LED and shine against
the walls and you get sort of this
washed out pattern so basically because
we have a very coherent device you get
these speckle patterns but now inhibits
ways in qubit space and therefore the
probability distribution that you will
measure from or draw samples from has
this very intricate speckle like shape
and essentially what's shown here is if
I have n qubits I can get as
measurements bit strings of length n so
I measure n 0 0 1 and here in this
pictures they are sorted so the
probabilities from the bit string 0 0 0
all the way to the bit string 1 1 1 1
and it's like there's a bits of a very
very fine key and you need to sort of
draw samples according to this very
complicated function actually it turns
out however is that if you were to
reorder those probabilities from the
smallest to the largest you see actually
there's structure in this probability
distribution and you get this
exponential shape and it's a so-called
potter thomas distribution and it's
essentially the distribution you get if
you pick randomly in your in dimensional
hilbert space a state and then ask what
are the probabilities to see the
different components of this large
superposition state that will be
distributed according to this
probability distribution and therefore
if you try to be sort of a classical
imposter you say oh I can do this with
some classical black box that don't need
a quantum computer then the challenge is
as I take a very simple-minded imposter
plus the uniform distribution if you
would just uniformly draw some strings
here chances are you will pick them
somewhere here from the middle
you will miss the ones with the high
probabilities but a good sampler should
sample more from the high probability
point and therefore it's a hard task and
actually complexity theorists will tell
you that if you you have a classical
machine that tries to produce our
samples the cost is exponential in the
number of qubits and therefore if you
push it to about 49 qubits then even the
largest machine will fall over because
you have to maintain two to the 49
complex numbers somewhere on the
scratchpad and that is we still have
machines with enough RAM to keep that
many complex numbers but in every step
of your computations these numbers have
to talk to each other and that creates a
huge communication bandwidth sneed that
no computer has and will not have and
versus skip the rest of the slides is
essentially to say you can introduce a
measure called a cross entropy which is
a figure of Merit that says yes these
samples really come from a certain
probability distribution or not and then
you see that the hardware will be able
to produce samples of high cross entropy
difference so of high quality versus no
classical machine can give you high
quality samples in reasonable time okay
so this is quantum supremacy experiment
and to go forward I want to explain you
one important notions that when you hear
about quantum computers you should know
and this is a spacetime volume of a
quantum computation essentially how our
bits are organized we have two
dimensional chips so they sits as a
little erasing of like a little sort of
square lattice let's say seven by seven
cubits and actually a good way to think
of qubits this was mentioned a few times
in previous talks is to think of them or
of their state as vectors on a sphere so
called Bloch sphere and then you come in
with your gates to manipulate your
qubits
and a gate you can sing of it will
rotate those vectors around and the
single qubit gate will just take look at
one single qubit rotated around certain
axis and the two qubit gates might do
this conditioned on the state of another
qubit so you look the qubit is our left
what state it is and then according to
the state you turn the other qubit by
certain angle and then at the end of the
day you measure so in the beginning if
we won't have enough qubits to do error
correction and therefore we can only
have space-time volumes meanings of the
two space axes are again seven by seven
and then the time axis is how many gates
I apply to each qubit and we have very
high fidelity gate so we approach three
nines fidelity actually required to do a
successful supremacy experiment but
there's still a bit of error and unless
you correct it you are sort of you have
to sing of your quantum processor as you
have a certain budget of gates you can
execute and then every time you execute
the gate it gets a little bit noisy or
noisier so you have to end at a certain
time and so therefore you have a finite
space time volume but if you look how
quantum computing will develop the
fidelity will get higher and therefore
the space time volumes will get larger
and eventually we have enough qubits to
do quantum error correction and then you
can go in the time axis as long as your
patience for the result allows you so
therefore we think that this year we
should be able to do the quantum
supremacy experiment far out there once
we have error corrected quantum
computers there's a whole candy store of
algorithms such as unstructured search
factoring semi definite programming that
you can run and where they're proven
speed ups but the big question is in
between are there four processors that
are have passed the supremacy
frontier but are not error corrected yet
can we do useful things with those and
on after the Monday talk many people
came up and asked me so what is the
first useful application rather than an
exotic benchmark and it will be what
Feynman already identified early on
Feynman's killer application it's
actually a simulation of other quantum
systems and you might sang other sounds
very inbred but it's actually very
important if you want to make it better
battery better solar cells better
catalysts for pharmaceutical industry on
and on and on whenever you do sort of
engineering on a nano level where
quantum effects play a role send today
you have no good tool to simulate such
systems but those processes will allow
you to do that and actually just last
week we published a nice breakthrough in
this direction that actually we have
quantum simulation algorithms now that
are likely to fit into these early
space-time volumes that we can support
pre error correction okay so here's the
first maybe message to this community
and that is the following like Stewart
often points out that a Paramecium a
single-cell organism can do all these
amazing things such as finding a mate
avoiding an obstacle even do simple
learning tasks and as a roboticist you
have some respect vs these things are
not that easy to program so what I just
told you is that a rather small quantum
circuit which does 49 qubits and just 30
to 40 circuit depths or 30 to 40 gates
per cubed that's already supercomputer
level stuff and there's just plenty of
opportunity to talk such a little
circuit away somewhere in living
organisms I'm not saying that the
coherence environment is necessarily all
there but it's in
message is there are just many places
where you can tack away a supercomputer
great machinery inside some living
system okay so let's play around with
these early quantum circuits and see
what we can do and the recent game that
I'm playing with my co-workers Edward
Farhi Jeffery Goldstone and summer
Guttman is to do quantum neural networks
of these near-term processors and we
have seen earlier some slides for neural
networks these circuits here don't look
too different again you can present an
input pattern by setting your qubits up
down so you present an binary input
pattern you push it through your gates
and then you go to one qubit and you
measure the qubit let's say in the Y
direction and if it your qubit points in
the plus y directions and you
particularly as a label to be +1
otherwise it's a minus 1 so it's a
straightforward way to represent a
boolean function and you can very
similar how you would do it with neural
networks you can define loss function
which essentially counts how many times
are you doing correct or incorrect
classification on your training example
and then I told you earlier that you can
sing of these gates as sort of they
rotate the qubits so instead of weights
like in neurons you have angles in these
gates and essentially by changing these
angles you change the input output
function and you can now ask questions
that the machine learning person would
ask would ask can I classify something
with slower time complexities and the
classical Network do I need less samples
you know that machine learning people
always want to know how many training
samples to I need to train a certain
architecture to drop below a certain
training error
I can also ask how bad is it my data is
polluted and there actually a number of
new games to play when you consider
quantum neural networks and for example
the answer can i express can I get away
with a shorter
Quenton neural networks and what I would
get away with classically and the answer
is probably yes and I realized is a bit
of an arm very answer but you could have
sort of let's say formalizing factoring
as a decision problem so it's a boolean
functions that you may want to choose to
learn and we know that a quantum circuit
can do this in polynomial lengths
while the classical neural network as a
classical circuit would have to be
exponentially long so there will be such
advantages you can also do things that
are have no classical analog I can
present multiple examples at the same
time in quantum superposition so what
does that do and finally the outer loop
of this algorithm which just means to
set your angles in your gates of free
parameters you have for each gate you
could use a quantum enhanced
optimization to achieve this learning
task and let me tell you a little bit
about this letter and in previous
presentations here the signs of
consciousness conference I've told about
quantum enhanced spoken about quantum
enhanced optimization and quantum
annealing and I just wanted to give you
late-breaking update where we have been
in this so learning means you have sort
of this objective function and your task
is to find a low point low point means
low training error a high point means
you make a lot of errors or your task is
to find the gate setting the angle
settings that produce a low point so the
way how we formulate this today and it's
a little bit evolved from where we used
to be we use sort of a classical
dynamic so one that can exchange energy
with environment dissipative means if I
go down this energy landscape I have to
get rid of energy I have to give this
back to the environment and that is what
a classic let's say for example I could
use steepest ascent a gradient descent
and then I I come down but then
eventually I will be stuck in a local
minimum and quantum processes can help
you will escape from a local minimum and
in the past we have sort of demonstrated
that if your energy landscape has very
tall and narrow barriers quantum
tunneling will get through these
barriers with higher probability than
sort of a Cermak lassika over the
barriers cave so you have two ways to
improve on your optimization or escaping
local minimum as compared to classical
but we recently found there's a much
more intricate physics going on basin of
Attraction to a different Valley and
from there you can hopefully find lower
better energy point and it's the
centuries of physics that you use to
understand conduction in a metal so if
you ask how do electrons make it through
a metal it's similar physics that is
being used here and it turns out that
you can get through this energy
landscape at least quadratically faster
than what is possible classical and
there's actually a simple case that's a
considered it's a so-called impurity
band and this is just the most extreme
case you have sort of two local minima
and all the other energy states are sort
of high up there so it's like the
landscape is like a flat table there are
two holes in it and you start out in one
Valley and you need to find the other
one
and then if you analyze this you find
the following you find that the time
- so there's this rather complex formula
that shows a quantum mechanically these
two states are covered and never minds a
whole formula just look at the exponent
here there's a 2 to the minus n half and
that's rather exciting Amanda really
finds that very exciting but it's
exciting because it's quadratically
faster than what's classically possible
classically it's an unstructured search
problem if sort of your optimization
landscape is flat only to local minima
you start in one I give you no guidance
but the other one is then it will take
you essentially a linear time it will
take you 2 to the N for any classes for
the best it's easy to prove the best
classical algorithm will take time steps
2 to the N while here using this
many-body delocalization physics you get
there quadratically fast and only in
2000 - and half steps and this other
point can actually be rather far away
because that's why we are pretty getting
more and more convinced that quantum
enhance optimization in general will do
better than what you're classically able
to do okay so from here two more lessons
one is said shallow quantum circuits can
act as learners to be honestly exact
properties are not yet known so sort of
a new area of study but we have good
reason to hope that our advantages in
time complexity in robustness to label
noise and sample complexity and other
observations are small sort of targeted
to my colleagues the ones that were
earlier mentioned by the two traditional
machine learning I will say come on
hardmode
how many qubits do you have like 50 and
you go circuit depths of 50 that's just
tiny we use neural networks that have
literally a billion parameters to tweak
and there are millions of input
parameters so what can you do with your
20 neural net but of course what you can
always do is we can just replace last
layers in a deep neural net by quantum
neural net and if there are advantages
to acquaintance neural network we can
have such a hybrid architecture and
that's why I'd like to show you sort of
the Quenton neural network sitting in a
single cell I could actually sing of the
Zizi quantum layers are just sort of the
executive decision-making level for a
much larger neural network which in part
may be classical so that's a possible
scenario okay so I come to the last part
of my talk and the nice thing about
those conferences and sort of encourages
you to go to places where you cannot say
sort of just hard crisp things like we
typically strive for an engineering and
that's about subjective experience in
machine learning and so not too long ago
I was I went through an episode that
reminded me of the stark difference
between human learning and machine
learning actually I have a little boy
and I tried to teach him how to ride a
bike so we went out on the street I
helped him up you know stay on this
little bike and didn't go too well I
know and then me bad dad I said hey come
on you're a little clumsy I
shouldn't have said this he was
devastated like really dead I'm clumsy
okay so the next day we went out you
know like I held him on his bike and
somehow I got it you know so he zoomed
down the street and he was just so happy
like every single fiber of his being
Neck yeah I got that and that sort of as
a machine learning person I was yeah
that's obvious we all know this
firsthand you know that there there's
essentially a congruence between
learning success and a pleasant feeling
and if you subscribe to materialist
worldview let's say something that Roger
put for us then you can get around from
assuming that there must be certain
states of matter
or certain evolutions of states of
matter that feel better than others yet
nor physics nor computer science has any
model
I mean barring sort of ones that we can
really implement we don't really have a
model of what constitutes a state of
matter that feels pleasant and I would
even argue that not knowing this but I
think we can make some arguments why I
think a machine learner is unlikely to
have such congruence between success and
pattern classification and pleasant
feeling and the reason is as follows
even though the overall situation that
say if I were to program the robot to
ride a bike then the overall situation
is not symmetric there are right actions
and wrong actions I don't know in these
times the fake news we seem to forget
that there is objective right and wrong
often if I follow of this your bike or
you don't so there is an asymmetry there
but then if you look closer how much in
London people implement it look at the
lost functions I look do I go down or
did I do this last pattern right or
wrong and then I have a plus or minus I
get a a positive signal or negative
signal or I get a larger loss or a
smaller loss but at the end of the day
let's say for example setting the sign
differently it's just setting a 1
instead of a zero somewhere and it's
just hard to argue that if let's say
having the 1 over here as opposed to
shifting it over a few memory cells that
if that state let's say it feels good
that suddenly this other state here
feels bad or vice versa it's just too
similar and if you go even lower and
look how the zeros and ones implemented
let's say like in the flip-flop circuit
it's just symmetrical again and to be
even more extreme I could have just
changed the labels of that says a plus
one and minus one in my learner and
long cable to another little system that
all it will do is change the sign again
that this whole initial piece would
operate but just inversely so the
pleasant and unpleasant feelings should
just switch so I think it is implausible
and in a way if you think about it if
you don't have a model for what
constitutes a pleasant or unpleasant
state it would be miraculous if you
would have implement our learning
routine such that this coincides as you
have such congruence for a machine
learner as well I would rather sing it
would if anything it would feel confused
so I took time to doodle around a little
bit I thought okay can we with our new
quantum computer could we we have now
quite some mastery to a high degree of
fidelity to produce states of matter and
to go through evolutions of state of
matter could we possibly organize it
such that have we build an AI Skinner
box we make it go through a pleasant
experience and then we once the circuit
to ask for more but didn't get very far
let's say you start with a decision
where was a certain probability you do
something that's Pleasant and was a
certain probability 1 minus P you do
something that's unpleasant how would
you proceed from here if you would
assume that you have some measurement
device that can tell you how happy you
were when you went through this process
then it's rather straightforward you can
go back and update your P so that you go
more to the happy branch but in the
absence of somebody who makes a
suggestion how to measure so as this
happy operator then we can really do it
I've no idea but the last slides I want
to sort of offer up a proposal now so
again we stay in the materialist world
view and say that Pleasant States or
pleasantness
business must be associated with a state
of matter or its evolution and what I
would like to explore is the notion that
relaxing to a stable state is associated
with a pleasant feeling and evolving to
an excited state is associated with
anxiety and maybe telling the physicists
or a UC psychological notions there was
no need for it really to call it such
and essentially what you would find is
if you adopt this notion there is this
interesting idea or observations that
physical and psychological perspectives
become congruent yes are you the
physicist would say the system evolves
this way because it minimizes Gibbs free
energy but if psychologists would say
well no it does is because it feels
Pleasant and just of course also logical
consistency an organism that has
pleasure in doing things that
destabilize it this organism will not be
around for very long and so also
engineering advantages to mapping
patterns or let's say positive learning
results to stable States
you already saw that now you can take
advantage of quantum tunneling and also
if you map use stable States in a
deliberate way you find that this helps
you stabilizing percepts and behavior
patterns in the presence of noisy sensor
readings okay and the very final thing
with this notion that relaxing to a
stable state feels Pleasant you could
think of psychedelics as literally a
catalyst for the state of mind because
again if your materialist you must be in
some state of mind and what happens if
this is catalyzed somehow and goes
through a typical chemical reaction so
we think of psychedelics as nothing more
than
helped to catalyze a reaction and then
we can ask the question how what would
happen if there you're in a state of
mind catalyst comes in and you go
through a tunneling transition that's
interesting seem to sink through and to
me it explains one piece I sort of for
about ten years I'm working with an
amazonian and telogen called ayahuasca
and sort of every time even though I do
it for ten years
it's sort of the same things it's the
onset of the experience is very scary
it's your anxiety ridden and once you
come out on the other side those fields
extremely peaceful and maybe it's just
me a scary dickhead but looking at my
fellow folks who go through these
experiences as well it seems to be
similar to everyone so this notion that
destabilizing is associated with anxiety
stabilizing with pleasantness would sort
of fit this here too and then you also
have such nice situations that you have
such as double description goal finding
this lower state here in computer
science or computer scientists would say
you found a solution to a problem but in
physiological terms you may say you
relaxed or this relaxation correspondent
to finding a more stable homeostatic
equilibrium so kind of healing and
problem-solving sort of goes together
here this model okay I think I would run
my time so this is the team in Venice
Beach and Santa Barbara as a software
and hardware teams for the quantum AI
group thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
