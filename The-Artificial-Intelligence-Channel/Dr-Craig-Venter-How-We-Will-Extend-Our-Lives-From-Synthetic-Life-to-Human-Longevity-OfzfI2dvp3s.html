bit about the protocol so I'm gonna say
a few words of introduction for a few
minutes about Craig then Craig will give
a speech and then there will be a QA for
10 to 15 minutes and I want to emphasize
the QA because unfortunately after the
QA Craig and I are gonna have to leave
for a press interviews so the QA make
sure you ask your questions that you
have during that QA okay all right so so
all right so you know the Craig is our
capstone speaker thank you for coming I
guess you guys know who he is you're all
here
and I thought you know I found it
fascinating I was reviewing Craig's Veta
and you know it's really a fascinating
story you know how do you go from being
a rebellious irreverent supered surfer
dude right to you know being a
world-famous genomics innovator and
visionary and entrepreneur and you know
so I'm gonna I'm gonna give the Vida and
I'm going to start at 1965 surfer dude
yes and I think the most interesting
part of the story which I I can only
imagine is that in 67 68 he was a
corpsman taking care of injured soldiers
doing triage in the Vietnam War and I
can only imagine what that's like
you know I managed to I was a little
younger I managed to avoid that bullet
but it clearly was a life-changing event
for him a pivotal event from him where
he did not lose the rebellious Ness and
he did not lose the irreverence he still
has those in spades
but he basically I think it was one of
those transitional events where he
realized that he didn't want to waste
his what his life and he has obviously
not wasted it in spades and I think
that's really the story so what happened
then after Vietnam well he he got
serious he went to school
he got a bachelor's degree in his
hometown of San Diego he got a PhD from
Nate Kaplan in physiology and
pharmacology where he's working on
cardiac receptors he then went and
walked the academic ladder at SUNY
Buffalo buffalo from 76 to 84 where he
continued to study receptors both
cardiac and there are receptors you know
he's trying to understand the
biochemistry and the function at that
time it was very difficult to clone and
isolate these things and I think things
really started to take off in 84 when he
went to the NIH and became a chief there
and and in the process he basically got
involved to trying to basically analyze
these receptors he got very involved in
trying to clone them to basically get
genetic access to them and that really
began
I think his career in genomics and one
of the first innovations at the NIH that
was done with young guy by the name of
Mark Adams mark was a postdoc in his lab
was basically the est or cDNA approach
which really was quite revolutionary I
mean you guys would probably know it as
RNA seek now but this was the first
version of RNA see right and it was
suddenly there was a way of basically
grabbing the mRNA out of the cell and
cloning and suddenly seeing all of the
genes right because you have to realize
this is the stone-age you can't you know
there was no genomes okay we have no
knowledge of any of the sequences of any
of the proteins and suddenly there was
this treasure trove right this fantastic
technique this technique was very
successful and it was commercialized and
off of the the secondary revenues from
that commercialization pregnan went on
to form basically a private Institute
Tiger which was a non profit Institute
the Institute for genomic research where
he was the president and he has been the
president for the last 25 years it was
there that the genomics thing really
started to take off so in 1995 craig add
together with another cool guy that he
picked
by the name of ham Smith except in this
case ham was quite a bit older than
Craig ham was already what 66 63 of his
my age okay at the time but he thought
Craig was a hoot he got together with
Craig and they came up with this crazy
idea - shotgun sequence a free living
organism
I'm off less a jamaica based pair of
genome and they did this in 1995 it was
a pivotal event it was the first whole
genome shotgun a living organism from
that success then he was in 98 - OH -
basically Solera was warm so based on
his experience as a as a leader in
genomics he was asked to be the
president at CSO of Celera genomics
where he as you know we basically
sequenced the human genome along with a
flaw in the mouse and he incidentally
picked up another guy this kind of
compulsive obsessive mathematician Myers
I think was his name who joined the
company in 98 and also and I think that
was really you know certainly for me it
was the time of my life
Craig was a fantastic leader he's the
only person I could have imagined you
could have pulled that thing off but it
was an incredible thing I mean it was it
was a rush extraordinaire so and as you
know we sequence fly mouse human using a
parrot and whole genome shotgun
technique which is now used basically by
everybody so after that kind of
experience I think many of us kind of
wandered around a little bit a Craig
tribe had a tche he had a sequencing
Factory
he had an Institute for Biological
energy alternatives in o2 and o4 and he
was really starting to think about
genomics and you know big issues of our
time although he and and thinking about
what to do next and and one of the
things that he did at that time was he
basically he took his private Institute
tiger and moved it to San Diego
primarily to San Diego where it became
the J craig Venter Institute and it's
actually about to celebrate his 25th
year and he's been
founder chairman and CEO of JCB I threw
out that a really entire period and
really and tried to then accomplish
these larger missions he's basically he
formed the SGI company Synthetic
Genomics incorporated in 2005 where he
was the chairman and the co CSO and at
the SGI basically they produced the
first synthetic genome of mycoplasma so
complete synthetic genome of a living
organism and later on they even did
yeast which I find really impressive the
yeast genomes ten mega base pierces it's
no small small feat in 2012 and then
most his most recent foray is human
longevity in which he founded in 2013
with a number of partners and as you
know hli is very interested in human
longevity by basically looking at the
genotype phenotype correspondence for
human beings where they've published a
paper in PNAS where they've sequence
more than 10,000 human beings and are
you gonna tell us what the count is now
I imagine it's a lot higher than that
yes it's probably I'm guessing it's
about 40,000 by now having seen the the
factory floor so you know it's it's it's
really it's a it's an incredible career
an incredible theta you know you can you
can actually read more if you're
interested in the store you can read
more about it in his books a life
decoded which is autobiography and he's
also written a book about the
convergence of computing and genomics
and life at the speed of life that was
published in 2013 as you can imagine
with a career like this he's won a few
awards just a few he's in the National
Academy of Science he's the National
kadek Medicine one of his early awards
was German award was the Paul Ehrlich
and Ludovic Adams death Prize in 2001
the Gairdner prize the Dixon prize the
Dan David prize and most recently the
cook metal which is only rewarded every
decade in 2015 and probably the most
prestigious is Obama gave him the
National Medal of Science in 2008 but
the other you know so that's an
incredible scientific career but one of
the things that I've observed that Craig
is that he has an incredible gift and
it's really not a small gift to be able
to take the complex scientific things
that we do and basically distill them
down to their essence and describe them
in a way that people can really
understand them and this is this is a
very important skill and and as a result
he's also known not only as a
world-class scientist but he's also a
superstar right I mean he's he's in the
press he's in the media in large part
because of this skill and he's been he's
been named Time magazine's top 100 list
both in 2007 2008 he's America's best
leader in US news the greatest innovator
in Businessweek top 25 managers again in
Businessweek
Man of the Year in financial times and
of course the one that I'm the most
jealous of is gqueues Man of the Year
anyway all right so hopefully you got an
idea of who it is that's giving this
talk to you you know Craig is a leader
and a visionary and he really sees the
big picture so I'm really looking
forward to the talk and Craig is really
now interested I think in the big issues
of our time energy food vaccines
longevity which another to produce and
if I might just close with a personal
concept a comment I'm you know I you
know it's it's it's it's not often that
you get the kind of opportunity that we
had at Solera
and that the time that I shared with
Craig was a very important time with me
you know I I hope you don't mind Craig
but I do consider you one of my mentors
I don't know if you noticed but I
watched you very carefully pride in my
own small way to emulate you and carry
on all of the things that you've taught
me so
it is my deepest pleasure and honor that
Craig has come here to support the
opening of our Center in our little
provincial town it's really a wonderful
thing and without further ado J Craig
I wanted him to just keep going I was
really enjoying it's such a pleasure to
be here on this great occasion to see
this new Institute opened up so it's we
need a lot more cooperation and
collaboration than the space now there's
a place to make it happen so
congratulations to gene and his whole
team for doing that I'll get back to
gene in a few minutes I want to put him
in the right place conceptually so we
have we have to work up to that but this
is actually a picture of the Venter
Institute in La Jolla it's actually on
the UCSD campus and overlooks the ocean
so it's it's a gorgeous spot so I think
he copied it a little bit for this
building he just couldn't get the
location quite right but very similar
inside all glass walls everywhere
there's no place to hide like there is
here you everybody has glass so
everybody can see each other and believe
it or not I think that leads to more
interactions and more collaboration so
again congrats on that and as Jean said
this is our 25th anniversary this year
we're celebrating which makes me feel
even older on the same side I'd say my
whole career has been working towards
trying to interpret the genetic code
trying to predict phenotypes from
genotype and you know including
predicting the future ultimately to do
that we decided we had to rewrite the
code to be able
prove that so I'll walk you through some
of that but the early sequencing that
you heard about with mahvelous being the
first genome there are a few viral
genomes before that Sanger did Phi X in
1977 and there was an RNA virus that was
sequenced the year before other than
that there wasn't much done insulin was
the first human gene sequenced in 77 so
we didn't have a whole lot to go on but
when we started doing whole genomes I
called the digitizing biology and we
started filling the computers with ones
and zeros so this I don't look like I
had more hair then I just had it in
different places today but this was the
the cover of science and in 1995 and you
know we thought we had a totally unique
thing with doing true shotgun sequencing
of a genome Sanger did a pseudo shotgun
and were actually did restriction Maps
took their worst written fragments and
then sequenced those and then put them
back together but this was a true
shotgun where we just literally blew the
genome of heart than used algorithms to
reassemble it and at the end of this
paper we said that this was a method
that the would be likely used for the
human genome the editors were saying
it's really fought that because they
thought that was
because the the project was head in a
different direction but 'men interesting
turn so we wanted to ask that question
that most people have had depending on
your religious background or your belief
in fairies does DNA contain all the
information
sorry for life and the way we chose to
do that was to see if we could
reconstruct we constitute life starting
with the ones and zeros in the computer
to do that we had to learn how to
actually write the genetic code also
this assumes that the ones and zeros in
the computer are accurate and correct
and it turns out for reading the genetic
code you can get by with pretty sloppy
data I mean that's why even from the
earliest stages with errors sometimes as
high as 5% you could still pretty much
work out what the sequence was if you
have a 5% error it's usually
incompatible with life so to be able to
write the genetic code we had to have
the right code to begin with so quite
often we had to read sequence things to
get to that right code we started small
those of you have worked with all good
nucleotide synthesis it's an N minus 1
situation so the longer the piece of DNA
the more errors are so my colleagues in
this Wareham Smith we've got the Nobel
Prize in 1978 for discovering
restriction enzymes and fight hutchinson
who was retiring from UNC one of the
early developers of site-directed
mutagenesis so the nice thing about
hiring people that are past retirement
age and that five I love the early
retirement age in in Europe as we get
really fantastic postdocs
but these postdocs come with a level
where they're not so worried about their
next job they just want to do really
good science and that's all they're
focused on so they they work hard on it
and so this team developed a way to
correct the errors that came about from
doing DNA synthesis we chose Phi X
historically because it was the first
DNA virus sequenced and Clyde actually
worked in Singers lab as part of the
sequence and always carried a vial of
Phi X 174 in his pocket just to prove
that scientists are weird and so we had
one of the original sources to go back
in sequence for comparison but it took
us two weeks to design and build the Ala
goes put them together and correct the
errors in that next challenge came with
injecting the synthetic piece of de DNA
into E coli but as soon as we did we had
a pleasant surprise of all these clear
spots which means there was active virus
air and the virus was killing eco a
cells so if you did this without error
correction if you just took all the good
nucleotides put them together with
polymerase even with amplification by
infectivity which is millions fold
amplification you don't get a single
viable virus so the error correction in
giving the letters correct is really key
so we call this the situation with a
software is building its own hardware
we've put in a piece of chemical
software we ended up with these viral
particles that will on their own infect
e coli and make millions if not billions
of copies of themselves now we wanted to
go further we wanted to make an entire
bacterial chromosome but going from
5,000 bases up to
1.1 million was not an easy jump it took
close to a decade and we had to develop
all these new techniques along the way
for Hendley large or larger pieces for
example unless you're working in this
space you don't know that you cannot
pipette large pieces of DNA once you're
over a hundred thousand base pairs DNA
gets very brittle and pipetting that
just shears it so you certainly can't
pipette entire chromosomes so we have to
do everything in gel blocks when we take
the chromosome out of themselves we've
lice it into a gel block we do all the
enzyme treatments and these gel blocks
and then ultimately released the
chromosome from that we had to correct
errors we had to find ways to assemble
all these pieces together so I will skip
all those steps and just give you a very
quick simplistic overview so we made
1,000 base pair pieces and we could get
those with very high fidelity we put 10
of those together to get 10k babe pieces
and at each stage we'd resequenced them
checking them for accuracy and if they
weren't 100% accurate we remade them we
then put 10 of those 10 KB pieces
together to make 100 KB pieces and we
made 11 resequenced them and they were
all valid but they were too big to
handle but we found this really neat
trick if we just put them into yeast
along with a short piece of vector yeast
using homologous recombination would put
all these pieces together for us and
assemble the entire chromosome the only
issue is we now had our procure a
chemist chromosome inside a eukaryotic
cell
and had to work on ways to purify that
out so we had two teams we had this team
working on chemistry and another one
working on biology and the the team on
chemistry ended up being led by him
Smith but Dan Gibson was the one who
really made a leap and many of you have
used what we call the Gibson assembly so
putting these pieces together was very
laborious and he found that he could do
them all at a single temperature in a
single pot and he came in to talk to him
and I and he said I don't know what took
you old guys so long so he took
something that the bass to do down to
minutes and it really sped up everything
because allowed automation of the
process which we'll get back to so on
the biology side that trick was getting
from zones in and out of bacterial cells
now it's really easy with a eukaryotic
cell you can just pop out the nuclei and
move it to another cell and we do that
all the time when we're trying to make
new pigs for organ transplantation but
for bacterial cells you can't do that
you can't just pick up the chromosome so
we had to develop some several ways to
do it what we used was the knowledge of
restriction enzymes and made sure that
there is a differential set and our
synthetic chromosome and the chromosome
in the recipient cell we use this gel
and electroporation to insert the
synthetic chromosome in the recipient
cell so now we have a cell that has the
body of one species but it has two sets
of genetic instructions what we think
happened in a short period of time the
new DNA started to be red enzymes
produced some of the early ones where
restriction enzymes that recognize the
chromosome in the cell is foreign DNA
and to
and that created a situation where we
now have the body of one species and the
genetic software of another in a short
period of time we ended up with these
totally new cells when we interrogated
them there wasn't a single molecule of
the original recipient cell left
everything in the cell every protein
every molecule came either directly from
the synthetic piece of DNA or a dove or
a end result of the proteins being made
in those cells so this was published in
2010 this was actually the control
experiment because we use largely
mycoplasma mycoides we made some changes
but it was largely based on a known life
form but there were so many variants
that we had to start with something
unknown we added some things to it
to prove that it was in synthetic so we
came up with a new code where we could
write the entire English language with
numbers and punctuation in the genetic
code and it's not new to do that people
have been using ASCII code for ever to
do that but ASCII code is not good for
biology if you wrote up the name of this
new Institute and gene Myers that could
create a new bio toxin that you know
just killed bald people or something and
so our code puts in very frequent stop
codons so we don't inadvertently make
some new bio peptide the code in the
genome first told you how to decode the
code and then gave you a URL that if you
decode it at the send an email
message to saying that you achieve that
and I'd told you how to read the rest
which contained the names of all 42
scientists that contributed to it names
of institutions and I added three
quotations from the literature that
seemed appropriate so the first is from
James Joyce to live to air to fall the
triumph to recreate life out of life you
know that somehow seemed appropriate the
second is from American Prometheus
Oppenheimer's biography what he heard
from a teacher early on see things not
as they are but as they might be and the
third is from Richard Feynman what I
cannot build I can't understand after
this was broadly translated I think the
the first email came in in less than 10
hours it was pretty stunning how quickly
people can decode out there but after
the translation was broadly in the press
one of the early things we got was a
letter from James Joyce a state attorney
asking if we had permission to use that
quotation I don't know what German law
is but American laws you can use up to a
paragraph with attribution without
permission so we dismissed that one and
then we started getting emails from a
Caltech scientist saying we had
misquoted finally and we sent him the
quotations we found on the internet and
and finally to prove his point he dug
into the Caltech archives and where
there was a picture of finding moons
blackboard when he wrote his original
quotation which was what I cannot create
I do not understand so I guess his
biographer thought that was kind of a
boring quote he jazzed it up a little
bit but I think the original is much
better and you'll see in in a few
minutes why this is true you have to
understand it to be able to build it and
by trying to build it or show you what
you don't understand so we went back and
edited the genome so that final 'men
will rest happily so we wanted to go to
this next stage of actually designing a
genome from scratch you know we had
plagiarized the first one from nature
but from all the studies that we had
done from 95 we published two genomes by
own from editions subtracted them from
each other but there's literally
hundreds of papers in the literature
since then of people looking at all
kinds of microbial species and listing
what they thought were the minimal
essential gene set so even we started to
believe this and so we set up a contest
between SGI and and JC VI to design a
cell and whichever one worked was going
to get a big prize
so we started down this road and none of
them worked so that that wasn't very
helpful so we had to start adding back
jeans and so we'd uh sort of made this
designed a build a component so trust me
it's not easy each time you want to do
an experiment to build a 1.1 million
base pair genome but we got very good at
it and we did it in sections of 8 so
that we could change and modify one
section and then use the other 11
components so we went through this
adding back genes until we could get to
a living cell and then we went in the
other direction with transposon
insertion and other methods to see which
of those genes could then be eliminated
and we got down to a minimal genome and
I think every microbial species you do
this with there'll be a different answer
so we got down to 473 genes but the big
surprise and the reason it took so long
to do about a third of the genes 149
genes were of a complete unknown
function all we knew is if that gene
wasn't present
we couldn't get a living cell we
expected 2 to 3% dis based on the
unknown fraction and each genome and
that this set of subtractions that
everybody been doing for years was
actually true but this shows you when
you just look at the same thing over and
over again with the same eyes and the
same way you'll get the same answer and
if you don't look at it from the
different vantage point you won't see
that you've been fooling yourself so
missing the function of a third of the
genes essential for life of this
simplest cell was a huge surprise the
team has now I've been working on those
this is a picture of what we call CIN
3.0 it divides very rapidly and billions
of copies have been made but we we've
probably learned what a little over a
third of those unknown genes do in some
cases you can just line them up and
they're certainly transmembrane protein
transporters but that doesn't tell you
what it transports and getting things in
and out of the cell is obviously one of
the steps that's essential for life so
we think it's actually a great platform
everybody got a copy of this book at the
Institute if you read that there's
quotations from Frenchmen going back to
the 1700s who said give me basic
protoplasm and I will recreate all of
life so they didn't even know what was
in the protoplasm they didn't know about
proteins but they believed that the
essential pieces of life were inside
each cell and once that was understood
you could recreate all of life so we
think we can add cassettes back to this
minimal genome and theory you should be
able to recapitulate evolution and
create higher species from the minimal
set when we look at the unknown genes
they go across the evolutionary tree
they're not just some bizarre rare set
in the mycoplasma the other things we're
doing is we're trying to defrag
the genomes because if we want to make
cells by design it'd be so much easier
just to have a cassette for glycolysis
and a cassette for methanogenesis etc
and we're actually quite surprised as
long as you know where the regulatory
regions are just to completely redesign
the cell input genes in a logical order
put em in sets of like functioning genes
initially microbiologist an early
molecular biologist because of a few
studies in e.coli you know thought that
everything was gonna be extremely highly
or ordered because there were few sets
of genes that had interdependence but in
fact after four billion years of
evolution things are pretty random with
all these changes so forgetting to
rational design we at least now know
it's possible to do this but this just
shows you for even for a one each
segment that's how many changes in
rearrangements we have to make just to
get to an ordered set now we just had a
paper come out yesterday that the papers
described early on in this book life at
the speed of light and we've called it a
digital biological converter because it
can take digital information either
through the internet or through radio
waves the digital information in the
form of a DNA sequence and at the other
end if you have a box at the other end
you can convert it back into
living material so we've made proteins
we've made RNA we've made viruses we
made vaccines and you can send the
sequence for one of these cells and
remake the cell at the other end so in
the book I described that would be much
faster to send biology to and from Mars
by the speed of light instead of some
slow Elon Musk rocket show so eventually
the rocket boys will catch up with
what's actually possible this is
actually the prototype in the picture of
the first one DARPA was actually funding
some of this work and they were all
excited about doing a test and they
proposed doing it on Air Force One that
we were going to send up Phi X 174 by
radio wave to Air Force One until
somebody told them that Phi X was
actually a virus
and then they told us we had to think
the word virus out of the application
and just but my extra phase but
basically once they knew it was a virus
they didn't want the press release of
its accept successfully sending a virus
up to Air Force One and although people
might be much more interested in trying
that today just because of the strong
interest in science so this is a machine
of the future because for example we
were using this to send the new flu
vaccine around in fact when the latest
epidemic broke out in China a group in
China sequenced it posted it to a
special internet site we downloaded it
and synthesized the entire virus and
vaccine the next day and so Synthetic
Genomics was the only site in the US for
about two years to actually have the age
seven and nine virus and we divided that
to the CDC and to Novartis and to other
parts of the US government and led very
rapidly to a vaccine
we got FDA approval for the first
synthetic DNA based vaccine and they
stockpiled a fair amount of it there's
still been more eight seven and nine
outbreaks but none have occurred yet in
the US but if these boxes existed
everywhere you could send a new vaccine
around the world and a fraction of a
second but that's just a little Side
Story so going on from small species to
trying to think about ourselves we have
a different context for that now you
know that your DNA software is the
software of life it codes for everything
and what that everything is can be much
more complex but it all started back
with sequencing of the human genome and
your leap leader here gene Myers was not
just an important part of this project
he was absolutely essential
he and his team wrote over half a
million lines of software code in less
than six months and it was high risk
business we had sequenced the drosophila
genome and we were doing the very first
test of his algorithm that finished just
a few hours before we were supposed to
present this at the fly meeting so had
it not work it would have been on the
world news what a spectacular failure
was but this was actually the first test
it were any partial tests or anything
else this was building up plugging it in
and running it and fortunately the
drosophila genome came out the other end
he then modified and did the same thing
for human but let me backtrack a little
bit I'd known gene for a long time he'd
written even some theoretical papers on
doing shotgun sequencing and why it was
logical and this was even after we
sequenced the first genome using shotgun
sequencing but the rest of the genomics
community was was not buying it I
started getting phone calls from
somebody pretending to be it applied
Biosystems and they said they wanted to
give me 300 million dollars to sequence
the human genome
and I thought they were joking so I hung
up on them they kept trying to call back
and then showed up in person said they
were real and wanted me to go look at
their new prototype capillary sequencer
so I flew out the foster City and it was
pieces of a machine separated over four
separate buildings but it was very clear
that it was gonna work I think it was
gonna have the potential to work
extremely well so I went back to the
Venter Institute and sat down with ham
Smith described what I saw and I said
look they're giving me 300 million
dollars to do this experiment I have to
go to it will you come and his response
was I don't think it will work but I'm
going with you which was in the central
part as soon as we let it be known that
we were putting this together and we
were looking for people I think we sent
a note to gene but he was enthusiastic
about the project and so I called him up
and said you know well we'll pay you a
full-time salary come here you know what
do you want he goes just just match my
University salary and I'll be there in
two weeks the next day he called me back
and he said I understand industry pays
more than activate
so by the time we finish that
conversation he was getting three times
his academic salary and I said are we
all settled now he said yeah we're
settled you know I'll be there in less
than a week he called me back the next
day he goes what are stock options he
was getting advice from somebody but
they were they were slow to give out the
advice of him and by the time he was a
multi-millionaire on paper and a big
salary he decided he was actually
satisfied he was going to come and had
he not done that we would have
absolutely failed that what we are
trying to do
so the reason we and others described
the experience there it was a team well
we had about a thousand employees the
key team was about 250 that if any
person any component that team failed
the whole thing would have failed but
the radical new piece that we were
depending on was the new algorithm that
gene had it in his brain and let a team
to put together so not only did you get
a good negotiator here you got somebody
who actually is truly mathematical
genius and had he not done it we we
probably still would not have the human
genome so thank you Jean for all
he wanted to be on the cover so that's
his baby photo it's really not but this
is the team when we were at the White
House in 2002 announced the first genome
with President Obama and and the the
head of the UK and here's the same team
ten years later celebrating the first
anniversary so few people had a little
bit more hair on their faces than they
had done so but they otherwise still
intact
him is 85 and works everyday in the lab
and is doing fantastic
so what are we trying to do that's
different today with understanding the
human genome so clearly in 2000-2001
having one or two or even he and full of
copies of different genomes was
interesting because the main news if you
go back and look was that there was only
20,000 something genes because some
people expected there to be hundreds of
thousands geneticists aren't necessarily
the brightest group because they tend to
think very linearly and and as a group
they really wanted there to be a gene
for every trait and function and it's
even a problem today dealing with
genetic counselors trying to take genome
information and give it back to patients
because they're trained in one gene at a
time for a given for a given trait but
it's clearly much more complex so we
were waiting the first genome we did
cost a hundred million
that wasn't very replicable the computer
we built for genes experiment cost 50
million dollars and was only one and a
half teraflops so you can buy a teraflop
card for your PC for about a hundred
dollars today
sequencing has changed even more in
addition to the pace of change in
computing where it became highly
distributed but also machine learning B
came into being of practical use pulled
the trigger for us to start human
longevity a little over three years ago
sequencing was below $2,000 a genome and
the compute seemed relatively cheap so
we're using this a process to try and
change medicine from being what it is of
reactive you get symptoms you go see
your clinician you go to the hospital
where as will show you it can be
preventive it can be predictive it can
be extremely personalized and I think
this change can happen relatively
rapidly if we want it to this is
probably the worst news you're gonna get
today most of you are quite not in this
group but it pretty much applies if
you're between 50 and 74 and a male in
the u.s. 40% will never see the age of
74 if you're a female 28% won't see the
age of 74 the statistics in most part of
the world are worse I think Europe might
be marginally better but two-thirds of
that risk for both males and females is
cancer and heart disease
so if we could predict early on prevent
cancer and heart disease we would shift
that whole curve so this looks at the
depth curves for the last century where
the median age was 57 now it's out to 84
people born the last decade but you can
see once you get past 90 we're still in
very very small percentages of a
population that reached that now
everybody knows somebody that's a 90 so
you think well that's not unusual but
you know 3/4 of the population that they
were raised with are already dead we
think we can shift that curve but the
goal is not to move the line out to here
we're not trying to make people live to
150 or 200 we're trying to increase the
healthy lifespan so whatever a normal
lifespan is it can be live largely
disease-free and you can lead a
productive healthy life
so sequencing has changed a little bit
in these 17 years each of these boxes
and these are not even the newest ones
that we just got there about a million
dollars each and each one of these boxes
is 1,350 times what all of salera could
do in a year so Solera we had 350
machines working around the clock one of
these boxes is thirteen hundred and
fifty times that output so things have
changed we have a room full of these and
we have two more rooms we're building
out to expand it to where we would have
the capacity
a million genomes a year
the trouble is with data we've done a
little over 40,000 genomes gene it was a
good guess just in terms of AC GS and
T's that's about six petabytes of just
AC GS and T's so if we had 10 million
genomes would be an exabyte of genome
data not to mention all the other data
that read into it right now doesn't have
matter how many node you have I don't
think you can handle exabyte computing
here we used Amazon Cloud we pushed it
to its absolute limits were one of the
top 1% users of Amazon were up there
with video streamers and porn sites but
we use a lot more CPUs than either of
them do and we wanted to reanalyze just
ten thousand genomes and they didn't
have the excess CPUs to do that so an
experiment that should have taken two
hours took two weeks so trying to get up
into exabyte computing Moore's laws
gotta pick it up a little bit if it's
gonna keep up with with genome data
today so we did an analysis of the first
10,000 genomes just to check on accuracy
and a number of things and a number of
surprises came out of this one of them
was that there's a lot of confusion
what a genome is even in the scientific
literature so Swee sequence to a 30x
coverage which means every base pair in
the meaningful genome gets covered ten
times but last year there was a paper
published in Nature from the UK ten
genome project that said it was the
genome of 1,000 people turns out it was
sequence from 1,000 genomes it wasn't
1,000 genomes and the genomes averaged
23 percent coverage so that journal
editors are sort of like tabloid editors
now
trying to expand the headlines to sell
more journals even with all the
sequencing we do the genome is not
completely covered the blue areas are
where you have high quality coverage the
gray areas are where it's much lower
quality due to highly repetitive data we
have various long reads that go across
these we know the distance of them
fortunately there's no genes any of
these regions so in the blue areas we
have very low false positives and false
negatives so this is data we're using it
with the FDA that showed that genome
sequencing is actually works quite well
one of the biggest surprises to me was
that we saturated all the common
variants in the human population with a
little over 8,000 human genomes so all
the things that 23 million others
measure on their gene shops that are
virtually shared by everybody just fell
out very quickly what we find now if we
sequence anybody's genome will find on
the average of 8,000 variants unique to
that person at least unique thus far in
the datasets that we have when we look
at the genome just statistically looking
for sites of information we're looking
to see if there was an onion
part of the genome wherever you see
these down spikes means the genome
cannot tolerate variation there which
means if there's a variant that one of
those sites it probably leads to a
spontaneous abortion or just lack of
viability from the beginning from this
pattern we can work out just with
unknown data whether it's likely to be
clinically significant or not some of
these are pretty obvious so we put
together 23,000 transmembrane receptors
and transporters and it became very
clear that the most problematic area is
the transmembrane domain itself
obviously a mutation a frameshift that
leads to a charged amino acid would be
lead to a loss of function mutation just
by popping that out of the membrane for
the most part the outside mutations
don't matter very much but we all know
of examples where there are few sites
where they do now this slide might be
very upsetting to to gene and others
with like to play with mice or our human
cell lines we find that extrapolating
data from gene knockouts in mice or
studies on human cell lines don't
correlate with the essential population
we find by actually studying humans this
should not be that surprising to people
as soon as you put a cell line in
culture it starts mutating like crazy
and does not represent even the host
after a short time in culture so I've
been against model systems
rather than for some fundamental
understanding if you really want to know
what's going on in humans you can't
study mice you have to study humans and
you can't use cell lines as surrogates
other than to get hints so obviously
this would change the scope of NIH
funding because this sort of looks like
the distribution of funding very little
goes to work directly in humans and it's
almost all for model systems and it
makes sense in terms of looking at
essential genes you know when you get a
variance and essential genes obviously
the passage in the city is much greater
than it is throughout the rest of the
genome now we can use some of those data
very quickly and we have some phenomenal
tools one is called hli search that can
search all 40,000 genomes in about 200
milliseconds and you'll be able to play
with this soon there's a site now with
the 10,000 genomes that you can play
with the version of it but we use this
clinically and it's it's a remarkable
tool so we can this was a rare patient
brought to us from Children's Hospital a
young boy with if you can read MRIs his
brain is obviously quite scrambled
that's more surprising to me that he's
alive than being relatively normal and
his body is covered with these small
tumors we got a trio we sequence his
parents genome as well as his genome and
things became relatively clear-cut just
on sequencing the parents genome it
became clear that they were very closely
related to each other where you see
these dark bands
orange bands those are regions where the
parents have virtually the same exact
sequence so we check to see how related
they were they are actually second
cousins not first cousins but they came
from a small village in Mexico that had
a lot of inbreeding and that shows up
clearly and what this does has everybody
know this is if you have rare alleles
but what's unusual is for both parents
to be carrying blocks of them that leads
to major changes and this is where we
found all the fundamental genes
associated with brain abnormalities the
other gene that showed up that was sort
of stuck out was the end of one or
neurofibromatosis one gene you probably
know this as the Elephant Man's gene so
we were curious about that and it turns
out neither parent had that mutation so
it was a spontaneous mutation so you can
understand maybe why 30 kids in the
world have this disorder first they have
to have highly inbred parents that have
those common variants that lead to the
brain disruption and have a spontaneous
mutation than the nf1 gene at the same
time but I use this to illustrate that
you can't just look to your parents to
understand yourself they're good hints
but when we sequence multiple sperm
cells or multiple egg cells no two sperm
cells are the same no two egg cells are
the same on top of that we all get
several hundred to several thousand
spontaneous mutations that truly make us
unique so it doesn't whether it Aunt
Millie lived to be a hundred and five
smokin six cigars a day and drinking the
quarter booze or or both your parents
did that doesn't mean it
to you and the only way to find out what
applies to use they have your own genome
and to start to understand that because
the genome is full of surprises we spend
a lot of time on cancer we have a to
cancer programs to help people that
already have cancer and then I'll
describe a much more important program
so this is our comprehensive cancer
program where we sequence the person's
entire germline genome we sequence the
tournament tumor genome to an IV X
coverage we sequence the immune cell
repertoire we actually isolate T cells
from the tumor and characterize those
and culture by taking the identified neo
antigens we make peptides for these and
then we find out which of the T cells
recognize those peptides and then those
are used by us and testing and others
trying to make anti tumor of vaccines
sometimes we look at liquid biopsies and
a few other things we find liquid
biopsies correspond to the tumor DNA
less than 50 percent of the time so we
don't think it's going to be a panacea
for looking at this here's just one
example a man in his 50s just looking at
his genome we had three mutated
oncogenes he had a couple of mutations
and genes associated with his immune
system as microbiome said it he had HPV
16 president I say this is a person it's
going to be when not if he gets cancer
he got had neck cancer it didn't respond
to much we saw him at late stage we
found the total tumor burden had 25,000
mutations and his tumor and 315 neo
antigens
Thirteen's with the sequence actually
changed we take everything in to look at
pathways and we came up with a number of
possible drugs that should have worked
but because he was not doing well
he was randomly switched to a a immune
therapy that our predictions from immune
sequencing he would not do well on it
but one of the problems with clinical
trials once people get locked into them
nobody wants to change even though
there's other information but that's the
depth of the information we get we have
another program that does almost as much
but it does it just with exome
sequencing instead of full genome
sequencing and our goal is to start to
make vaccines both as a preventative
vaccine and also was the therapeutic
vaccine so we will be trying both of
those our biggest problem was we start
out from the beginning not just wanting
DNA sequence myview DNA sequence on its
own is like having one hand clapping we
wanted as much phenotype and clinical
data on each person we're doing all
kinds of clinical trials for major
pharmaceutical companies and we got
limited phenotype data from them we've
done a large number of academic
collaborations where the academic groups
characterized the phenotype in depth but
in a very narrow fashion so we decided
to set up our own phenotyping clinic
that we call the health nucleus where we
do a very large number of tests
including whole body MRI kasam
concentrating not on the the brain we do
the whole genome
we do the microbiome the Metabo loan we
do DEXA scan we do CT scans for heart a
number of cognitive tests etc and a
number of pulmonary tests these were
done initially just to get phenotype
data we only had quote normal people
coming that we didn't want anybody who
was sick if they were already sick they
were supposed to go to the hospital but
from day one we started making major
diagnoses of people with cancer people
with heart disease and one of the
reasons for this we have a whole new
technique in MRI that is really
fantastic
it's called restriction spectrum imaging
and it makes use of looking at water
molecules and different tissues for
example with tumors the nuclei are
slightly larger they have more water in
them but the water is more restricted in
its motion and so on the MRI with the
post-processing tumors literally light
up quite clearly in our images and this
is in contrast to what happened in the
70s when CT scanning first came out
there were thousands and thousands of CT
scanners everybody had whole body CT
scans and CT is just an x-ray and so you
saw a bump or something but you had no
idea whether it was cancerous or not
today we can tell whether or not there's
a tumor for example with prostate cancer
is a study that was recently published
by guys on our team where straight from
the MRI they diagnosed and graded the
tumor that the pathology matched
perfectly in fact here's one that's
blown up that you can see that with
normal MRI this would not show up but
what's fantastic is
what's done now I went through this
myself you get random biopsies around
the prostate gland to see if there's
cancer there this was down on the edge
so it might have been missed but with
the new MRI images these go right into
the operating room along with ultrasound
and the images can be overlapped so
these exact spots can be biopsied versus
just doing random biopsy so it's a very
useful technique we find a variety of
things this would say grapefruit-sized
ovarian cysts that a woman did not know
she had these are quite dangerous
because they can just twist and usually
they present with women having massive
internal bleeding from these but some of
the more interesting things is we can
actually measure your metabolism
straight from the MRI image so liver fat
is something everybody should know what
your measurement is MRI is one of the
few ways to get it normal liver fat is 4
percent or less we've had people
presenting with us high is 38% no
symptoms no awareness but likelihood
that they'll need a liver transplant
within a few years there's a disease
called Nash where it's associated with
non-alcoholic disease so it's not just
drinking alcohol that makes this worse
and we just published a paper on this
showing changes with the microbiome but
this is quite label I went on a thirty
mile bike ride with one of the world's
experts on organ fat and we stopped for
a break at fifteen miles and he said you
know exercise won't get rid of your
organ fat I said what the hell you
couldn't have told me that fifteen miles
ago
and the only thing that does is calorie
restriction but obviously exercise helps
with that but it's a really a big deal a
number of people have totally changed
their lifestyles and change these
numbers because you go in the MRI every
day because there's no radiation or risk
because we don't use any contrast media
because of this new technique
I found out after last end of last
year's holiday season that my liver fat
went from 3 to 7 so I found out how I
could make it go up very quickly alcohol
and rich food but it does go back down
if you work hard in the other direction
so we measured this across the body so
we measure your exact organ fat but
these are the kind of pictures we get
without contrast media of your vascular
system so think for comparing to the
genome we can get exact measurements of
blood vessels and with machine learning
find out which genetic components code
for that but also we can diagnose
diseases
here's woman who had an aneurysm that
usually people learn they have brain
aneurysms because they died suddenly
from having them they burst and almost
everybody knows somebody that's died
from from a brain aneurysm these are now
fixed as an outpatient in less than an
hour with just a stent we get these
incredible pictures of your brain a
neuro quant is a program that's better
than any neural pathologist that
measures very precisely the volumes of
eleven different brain regions and you
can all learn to diagnose Alzheimer's
disease very easily so here's the
hippocampus of a normal person so we
actually calculate the exact volume of
that
but you don't need to do a calculation
on this one with the Alzheimer's disease
there's a huge void around it and the
hippocampus is substantially degenerated
so between these kinds of images and
genomics we can predict up to 20 years
in advance before your first symptoms we
also find all kinds of things in
people's brains this is a meningioma
that's a vascular tumor again they
caused problems by bleeding here's
another one the cavern oma again it's a
vascular tumor that mimicked strokes the
cardiovascular we're using now remote
sensing we give people a patch to where
we do cardiac CT we do 4d echo where we
can generate these kinds of pictures so
you can see all four chambers of the
heart and you can actually look down any
of the blood vessels
you get precise measurements but you can
see how the valves are working we
measure Doppler shifts so we know
whether there's any regurgitation but
think of all these imaging pictures of
taking precise measurements off to work
back to find the genomic components of
it this is just from a CT photo this is
actually my heart I use this for HR
meetings to prove that I have one you
might you might try that gene but
there's some technology that's very
close in the MRI to actually be able to
see inside the coronary vessels so the
same technique that can measure whether
you have cancer whether you have
Alzheimer's whether you have aneurysms
what your metabolic state is very soon
we'll be able to also predict cardiac
function with this remote patch we've
made a number of diagnoses with it as
we're collecting data a number of people
have episodic atrial fibrillation for
to eight hours a day and don't know it
that means they're extremely high risk
for stroke so they're now on
anticoagulants one of the most
interesting cases was a man who has
second-degree heart block his heart rate
would go down to less than 20 beats a
minute and he was unaware of it
he we learned this on a Friday we
thought we could wait till Monday to
tell him but he was at such high risk
for sudden death that we called him
right away and he got a pacemaker
installed quite quickly so this is the
kind of computation now we can do from
the whole body MRI gives you your exact
muscle mass we can tell you how much
each leg weighs if you want
how much organ fat you have what your
organ fat or peripheral fat ratio is and
so this is really useful data if you're
trying to get control over your own body
versus the parameters that are given
without being able to measure things so
we're discovering things in about 40
percent of healthy people that come to
the help nucleus because we're detecting
disease early we're detecting cancer and
two-and-a-half percent of people that
are completely unaware that they have it
and you asked a million and a half
people get diagnosed with cancer they
didn't get it just the hour before the
diagnosis sometimes they've had it for
weeks sometimes for months sometimes for
years the trick is with all the cases
now and we've been 100% accurate on
diagnosing these high grade cancers is
every one of them has been treatable and
all individuals are cancer-free
two of the people are ones have been
mentioned here I was diagnosed with
high-grade prostate cancer in my own
Ammar
and had surgery to remove it just before
it had started to metastasize in him
Smith because we had everybody in the
Institute go through we found a fist
size tumor in his lungs
turned out to be a lymphoma extremely
rapidly growing one so it responded well
to chemotherapy and then to radiation
and he's now back as hairs growing back
and he's back working as an 85 year old
everyday in the lab that the chemo
really knocked him down and was tough
for him to get through his physician
said we've not discovered that when we
did he would have been dead in six weeks
so we get these cases brought to us like
we've now have four women and their 30s
with stage four colon cancer so the
guidelines don't really help them of
waiting to your 50 to get a colonoscopy
discovering cancer affords metastasize
where every one of them has been
treatable and apparently curable is far
more satisfying than anything else we do
I'm it's really changing the focus of
just trying to do the science and
correlating with the genome both though
in every case we do try and correlate it
with the genes when we can it shows up
pretty quickly with known things but
we're now getting enough cases for
example of distended aortas where we
found a gene duplication that seems to
correlate with that and makes it
predictive in the future so we're using
machine learning I'll give you one quick
example of how that's worked out in the
genome report we predict people's height
their weight their BMI their eye color
hair color and a picture of you I was on
I don't know if you watched Chelsea
Handler here in Germany she's a female
comedian
she wanted her results live on
television so I showed her her data and
as it predicts that you're gonna weigh a
hundred and sixty pounds her response
was you and I said we don't all
have to achieve our genomic potential
the problem in America is most people
are exceeding their genomic potential
but these are lifestyle choices but the
face study we had a thousand volunteers
we took 3d photos of their faith faces
did a number of other measurements we're
now on the 11th version of the software
we smooth the photos a little bit so
this is the the subject and then this is
the prediction straight from the genetic
code and so right now we're just doing
the face mask if you look at the person
next to you the face mask is not the
first thing that you use to recognize
somebody it's it's their hair its other
features here's a young man
here's the DNA prediction the more
ethnicity in the background the easier
is young african-american and here's
here's his prediction we can predict eye
color and eye shape we're not putting
that in these photos at this stage these
predictions predict your photograph just
post puberty so a lot of people say well
that doesn't look like me yes I will
find a picture when you were 16 and it
all of sudden they they find pretty good
matches so while we're trying to link
all this together in the world's largest
biological database we're trying to make
these diseases predictive proactive and
preventative and we're trying to change
medicine from being a clinical science
supported by data - a data science
supported by clinicians thank you very
much
all righty so we'll do two questions
Matt we have a Mike we have Mike runners
yes please so thank you very very much
for the nice talk there were a lot of
results that I didn't know about um
so forgive me one somewhat more critical
question
so basically when I was hearing that I
was thinking about a lot of science
fiction stories but at the same time
we're living in a world where people are
more in risk of getting diseases when
they have less money when they're out of
jobs a lot of people don't have access
to health care so basically when you had
the spec forefront off of the medical
science how do you deal with these
social and moral questions so all things
have to start somewhere
these machines are expensive medicine is
expensive I don't know what it's like in
Germany I think you have a single-payer
system here in the US people are not
used to paying for healthcare themselves
so they have no idea what something
costs unless you're outside the system
which Obama tried to change that as
going the other way so if you're in the
poor part of the country any healthcare
you get you have to pay for it yourself
we're trying to design a system that can
change how it's all done it can save the
u.s. trillions of dollars a year by
preventing diseases detecting them early
and just with any other system that's
backed by third-party payers it can
cover everybody because the money saved
the difference between treating a cancer
patient like myself that was simple
surgery versus treating me for 15 years
with chemotherapy and eventually early
loss of life
there's no comparison than the costs so
you can't say well here's a whole new
system and approach it cost a lot of
money now it's no good because we can't
treat poor people with it we can if you
give you have money to treat poor people
I mean it's a question of where the
resources are for medicine and how
they're being applied it's got nothing
to do with the technique utiful Tyson's
once you have enough data on this
genotype-phenotype relationship for
humans to make for for machine learning
strategies to make sense of it they will
probably be able to formulate what the
ideal genome looks like is that going to
be a prototype for you months and I
would bet my idea might look different
than your idea
so mine was the first genome done in
history
nobody's proposed so far that I've heard
of making me the prototype human to
model everything out there so I don't
think that's going to happen I think we
will understand the range of phenotypes
that arrive we will be able to
understand which environmental factors
change those phenotypes and how they do
it but I don't think it will change to
clones armies of identical humans that
happened socially now we don't need to
do it
genetically so I'm not too worried about
that okay so yeah so as you progress
over here
so as you progress with the artificial
genome synthesis do you think the basic
eukaryotic genome would be without
enhancers and you know this complex
other regulatory elements will you be
able to synthesize it without enhancers
or regulatory elements I mean of course
the the later version would definitely
include it but you know can you remove
some of this enhancer and will it still
work
you were talking about the human genome
here no it doesn't have to be humans you
know but as we go more complex from
bacterial to the eukaryotic to further
as we progressed so even in the the
simplest cell our first synthetic cell
has RNA regulation molecules in it and
yes as we go up to eukaryotes the
regulation gets more
more complex we're gonna have to
understand that to design and build a
truly functional cell presumably that
regulation is important for its survival
so I don't think you're gonna get a
viable cell just stringing together
coding regions it doesn't work with
viruses and hasn't worked with bacteria
so far so I really don't expect it to
work with eukaryotes won't take up too
much of your time thank you for the talk
what about psychological and emotional
health and the burden of psychological
and emotional problems how do you tackle
that through heads nucleus no sir it's a
great question so we do extensive
neurological testing not necessarily
testing some base psychology but testing
neuronal function brain activity etc but
this is a system and a paradigm that you
can apply to anything so be careful to
make sure you want to know the answer
before you do the experiment because if
it's done right we will find the genetic
basis of every human behavior and trait
so you have to have your control group
extremely well defined to get the right
answer
thank you do you think do you think
there's a unique minimal genome or do
you think that it might have depended
somehow on the path you took the genes
you deleted or put back in the order
yeah
for a given cell type there's absolutely
a unique minimum
for each the order doesn't matter we've
done them in thousands of different
orders and we've shown that we can
completely rearrange the gene odor so
that does not matter but if we were
going to start the study all over again
say with the meth antigen we'd end up
with a different set of genes as the
minimal genome so there's it's it's a
minimal genome it's not the minimal
genome but I don't mean exactly the
order on the chromosome but the order in
which you took things away yeah what
that also doesn't seem to matter
hi little nice talk if you compare the
genomic information with the lipid omics
and the bio microbiota information how
much correlates with the genome and how
much you can say is environmental and
difference so if you think about trying
to measure you know in the answered
nature versus nurture there's only one
simple way that's even possible to do we
can measure what's nature and by
difference everything else will be
environmental the environment is just
too broad to start trying to measure
environmental influences without knowing
the true answer for what's coded in our
genome but we can see in some cases that
there are other influences we are 100
percent a DNA software driven species
but our DNA drives a lot of flexibility
in the outcome of the answers does that
help
thanks for a great talk I'm wondering if
you collected any epigenetic data on the
genomes that you sequence so in some
cases we measure RNA seek particularly
on the tumors to verify the new antigens
or help to do that we looked at various
protein measurements and we have not
found anything that is robust accurate
inexpensive and works on high scale the
same is true with DNA methylation they
if I was going to measure something that
would measure DNA methylation on
everybody everything else you can infer
directly from from the genetic code so
it's kind of a waste of money just to be
measuring but DNA methylation that thus
far we don't know how to predict which
sites will get methylated under
different conditions
what I constantly remind people
especially in places where the
epigenetics department is separate from
genetics is that epigenetics derived
from that same genetic code and people
often forget that thank you for the talk
so I was wondering this idea to
basically have a sharp cutoff I mean not
having the average lifetime prolonged
but the healthy lifetime this seems a
little bit counterintuitive because I
mean people have to die from something
eventually and how can one know that the
something will be abrupt so I mean I can
immediately believe that you can shift
the curve I don't quite see how you can
make it sharp well
using something sharp you can make it
very sharp but when people don't die
from coke disease they die from
basically degeneration of all their
processes we can tell exactly how old
you are by sequencing your genome you
know it's like counting rings on a tree
we can count your age from the
accumulation of mutations so if we want
to live longer we have to find a way to
stop having our DNA mutated or find a
way to have it be super repaired but
flying from here back to Nantucket
tomorrow yeah I'm gonna probably
accumulate 40 or 50,000 new mutations if
you sit in the Sun for an hour you get
about twenty thousand mutations in your
skin
most of those go away because every two
weeks we've replaced our outer skin so
that that dust in your house that's you
and that's why you can never get rid of
it you always making more right so we
have some systems that do try to correct
for it and that's why some of the work
we did early on with Bert vogelstein
finding DNA mismatch repair enzymes when
those are mutated there's a higher rate
of colon cancer so but you're constantly
getting bombarded by radiation by from
chemicals from things you eat and the
number one risk for every disease is so
you can die from natural old age just
you know look at an old car sitting
there not running everything kind of
rust and fill it falls apart that's
different than having it die as a new
car
because the carburetor the computer chip
failed so yes we will all die from
something we're not trying to
necessarily change that but we concede a
lot of people listen to the news every
day actors musicians dying in their
forties and fifties look in your high
school or college yearbooks you know
people die most people will die before
they ever reach 80 so I prefer to live
as long as I can be healthy and still
drive cars and write motorcycles and
things like that if if I'm confined to a
bed and can't do anything you know
changes the quality of life of what you
can do and whether you can contribute to
society or not so some states more
states in the u.s. are allowing for
assisted suicide there's lots of ways to
deal with people at the end stage of
their lives without it just costing an
enormous amount for the medical system
to prolong their lives when they don't
want it for long thank you I have a
question how much of medicine of
diseases you think you may predict from
sequencing one genome after all I mean
you know due to epigenetic changes but
other encounters many disease may result
indeed in rotation changes that occur in
a given cell type that you might not
have you know represented when you take
the blood you know and when you say one
gene you're saying one genome right yeah
you have one genome you have you have a
couple different lineages with minor
variations and
tissues if they're really important
they'll show up
we haven't found too many volunteers
that want to let us take brain biopsies
and heart by using if you'd like to be
the first to volunteer we can but know
much we can see how different it is from
the blood to the brain tissue but thus
far it looks like white blood cells are
a good surrogate for the rest of the
genome that doesn't mean there weren't
somatic mutations we find these in the
mitochondria we find these if we
sequence deep enough to look at lineages
but the only way the answer that would
be to biopsy every tissue on everybody
every time you're trying to diagnose a
disease so we need to rely on a
surrogate and I think the data shows
it's a pretty good surrogate what do you
think the prospect is of understanding
multifactorial
multi gene diseases said something that
that you must be very interested in that
I personally believe all diseases are
multifactorial and multi gene diseases
geneticists with finding so-called
single gene disorders have kind of
distorted scientific fact and have
overly simplified things because
everybody with changes even the same
changes and the chloride ion channel
known as the Cystic Fibrosis gene some
kind of early onset some late onset a
huge range of symptoms
my favorite misinformation is Braca one
and breka two that if you do not have a
family history of breast ovarian cancer
the best prediction you can get from
bracket 1 and bracket
Changez is a 50-50 lifetime chance of
breast ovarian cancer it goes up at to
the high 90% of every woman in your
family has breast ovarian cancer which
means there's two netic pieces yet to be
discovered that are the true factors
that will predict breast ovarian cancer
not bracket 1 or bracket 2 genes there
are surrogates right now for what we
don't know
so thank you all for coming and if you
you know if you haven't seen the
NewsCenter
they're doing tours today if you want to
see the cave and the microscopes they're
all running this afternoon all right
take care everybody thank you again for
