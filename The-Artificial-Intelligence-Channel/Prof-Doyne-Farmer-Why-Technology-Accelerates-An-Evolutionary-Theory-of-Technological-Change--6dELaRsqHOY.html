Iceland and a great fan of the sagas and
so it's very nice to be here so I'm
going to talk today about things that I
don't understand so I hope that you'll I
hope the questions are interesting and
I'll give you the fragments of things
that we do understand and so here's an
outline of my my talk I'll try and mix
some theoretical ideas with some very
practical things but it's not going to
be coherent because despite my title I
that's why the torte is in there I think
we're a long way from having this theory
but but we do have some some hints about
what what should be in it I have to
begin with current events just because I
think that's at least if you're an
American you can't not be thinking about
this right now I had a dream last night
I'll admit to you I got into about 3
a.m. that's all I was sleeping a bit
restlessly and had this dream that and
by the way so this is from the the cover
of the Sun who was pointing out that
actually 16 years ago the Simpsons had
an episode in which they imagined that
Donald Trump was became president ran up
a giant deficit and then Lisa had to
become president to replace him I have
not been able to find the actual episode
that I gather that's the plot outline so
it is a bit and you can see you know
America you could be my ex-wife I think
that's about the attitude he's going to
take now in my dream though I was mixed
in with his conference because in my
dream it turned out that Jackie and her
group back about 16 years ago had
decided as an AI project to make a model
of Donald Trump and Donald Trump had
actually helped them out by supplying
his answer as to what he would have done
but the cool thing was at this point
they could simulate Donald Trump
perfectly so I woke up it was a well it
would be a nightmare except that what's
happened is actually a much worse
nightmare now back to technology and
what I'm going to talk about today
technology something that's co-evolved
with early humans
I like this stone
Rock carving the guy with his little
poles and his cool hat and his very big
skis tool use predates human beings by
quite a lot and I would argue along with
others that actually tool use tools in
humans co-evolved so technology isn't
something that it's not like humans got
a big brain and then they suddenly
understood how to use tools no these
guys here we're already using tools and
we evolved a longer trajectory that
involved a strong coevolution between us
and tools without technology none of us
would exist for anybody that in Iceland
you I don't think you would have to be
too convinced of this Rob Boyd from the
University of Arizona has a lecture on
the technology of the inner wit and you
see the remarkable cleverness that goes
into these technologies without which
it's very difficult to exist in a
hospital climate but if you think about
it actually almost in any climate people
can't exist without using tools you have
to use tools at some level and in fact I
if I had more time I could talk about
the whole evolution of the human
population
it's clear there's been a feedback
between invention which allows us to
raise the carrying capacity for human
beings in particular by making by
agriculture and making agriculture more
effective through time and then
increasing the population means more
inventors which means more invention
which accelerated growth so that we
actually have had a super exponential
increase in human population until about
fifty years ago since Roman times and so
there's a strong sense in which I think
without technology we literally wouldn't
exist I was influenced as a kid by t
large a rather unusual Jesuit priest who
who envisioned technology biology and
culture Co evolving to form a greater
whole that he dubbed the noosphere and
and I've had the feeling through my life
that the technology piece of this while
technology is all around us
we use it all the time we buy it we
talked about it we think about it we
don't really we don't really have a way
of thinking about it and and we haven't
exerted as much effort towards
understanding as we have to evolution
and biology and evolution in culture and
as I started my talk this is a field
where the state of understanding is
still anecdotal the subjects dominated
by economic historians I mentioned a few
of my favorites here I loved their
writing but you read these things it's
more or less history they say well
here's what happened with the steam
engine here's what happened with the
laser printer and they give examples and
they talk about the specifics of those
examples but there's no broader theory
about how they actually work now there's
another branch that I'll come back and
say a little bit more later about growth
economists that that do things in a
different way but that's also in my
opinion well valuable very limited now
so my thesis that I'm gonna be talking
about today is the idea that
technologies are undergo Darwinian
Wallis Darwin type evolution for you and
the reason I say that is because they
undergo descent with variation and
selection that is technologies strongly
in that we have at this point in time
strongly influenced the technologies
that we can make next there's a lot of
trial and error I can say this with some
experience having actually made the
first wearable digital computer there
was an awful lot of trial and error
involved in getting something to work
I'm one of the authors of a review paper
on making an analogy between biological
and technological evolution you might
also want to see this paper at this
interest you by andreas lager and Rosen
from 2014 discussing the similarities
and the differences I'm not going to go
through this in great detail you know
they're driven by selection they both
result in diversity there's incremental
variation temporal progression
purposeful function of units but there's
a lot of differences in the way things
happen and
my remark in the bottom that I'll say
something about the end I think through
time the dividing line between
technological evolution and biological
evolution is going to become ever more
blurred as genetic engineering becomes
increasingly more used in widespread and
as digital technologies become more
autonomous one of the reasons that
technological evolution is harder to
understand is because there's no sex and
sex actually makes biology biological
classification easy because it means
that you end up with trees as the
underlying classification scheme but in
biology it's already in technology
things are much more Lamarckian
inventors take a little bit of this and
a little bit of that and they must
things together in ways that are hard to
track and they even often deny the
things that clearly did influence them
because maybe they either aren't
self-aware enough or have other reasons
for that and so unlike sexual
reproduction so which determines what
happens with all larger animals where
you get a tree you get you get these you
get a more complicated grass and it's
analogous to what's called horizontal
gene transfer which is the way bacteria
reproduce where bacteria are a bit like
inventors they go along they encounter
each other and they grab little bits of
each other's genomes and splice them in
so that a bacterial genome is not made
in the very systematic way that that of
a vertebrate is and I would argue that
in part because of this complexity and
in part because we haven't focused on it
that the understanding of the way
technology's involved is pre Linnaean so
you probably know that Linnaeus quite a
bit before Darwin created a
classification scheme was a very
empirical descriptive thing they just
they observed plants and animals very
carefully they wrote down character
mystics they group things together and
they created a tree which served as the
basis I would argue for what Darwin did
with without this classification scheme
Darwin would not have been able to think
about to turn taxonomy into phylogeny by
realizing that this taxonomic structure
reflected very deeply the evolutionary
history of the biosphere and but in
technology we don't even have something
like a Linnaean system we have
classification schemes that are
constructed by patent offices and the
first tip-off that they're fairly
arbitrary is that they're all different
every country has a different scheme now
they are starting to standardize around
something called the IPC but the it's
constructed in an ad hoc way now it may
be that it can serve as a kind of rough
basis for for an evolutionary theory but
there's quite a lot to do yet it's also
worth noting that the data available is
very different in biology people have
been gathering fossils and trying to
organize them for centuries now and
they're rich databases built on efforts
by tens or hundreds of thousands of
people and and a lot of thinking has
gone into what these fossils mean what
those organisms were and how they how
what their patterns of descent were
excuse me I'm fighting a cold in
technology in contrast as I already said
we don't have a good texana me we have a
vast an anecdotal phylogeny from the
economic historians but we do have other
kinds of information like with
technologies we often have a very clear
idea of what we want those technologies
to do we can measure quantitatively
how they perform and we can track that
through time so we can really think
about the concept that technological
evolution is a process of things getting
better or at least performance
metrics going up not to impart too much
of a value judgment on it but we can we
can literally see in technologies the
course of progress through time which
allows you to study something that you
can't study in biological organisms now
as an aside this is a much debated point
in biology biologists generally don't
even like to think about concepts like
that though I would argue that if you go
back to the beginning of life over the
last four billion years or so there has
been a pretty strong progression in the
characteristics of the biosphere and I
might even argue in the performance
characteristics of the biosphere it's
for its ability to fix energy and
process information but those things are
all really hard to measure and people
actually get nervous when you talk about
things like that because they're you
think you're talking about some form of
social Darwinism which I'm certainly not
implying but so there's a very different
kind of science that that is done as a
result of the data being different now
one advantage we have in technology that
I don't think has been properly
exploited is that the simplest
technologies are far simpler than the
simplest organisms in fact one thing
that makes it challenging is it's hard
to define what a technology even is
because if you take something like a
stone
I mean it's stone it's just a stone
unless I pick it up with my hand and
smash somebody's head with it in which
case it becomes a weapon and now I can
compare it to other technologies that
are weapons so because of this in a
sense this almost creates a confusion in
in even defining what we mean that's
actually something I've thought about
quite a bit it's not in this talk but
I've come to the conclusion that
machines and technologies physical
technologies are our ways of
constraining momentum but that's that's
a longer story I'm not going to get into
but you can ask me about it if you want
and by the way you should feel free to
raise your hand and ask a question while
I speak I'm very open to questions as I
go along now complexity economics this
kind of funny fringe field
I'm a part of is one of the things that
I think we can offer is our alternative
ways to think about growth in particular
if you go back to traditional economics
the way they think about growth is in
terms of production functions so to a
traditional economist production why is
some so is some function of things like
labour L in capital C with some
coefficient and then this coefficient in
front a is called total factor
productivity in a very famous study
performed in nearly in the 50s actually
solo took data and asked well how much
of production can we explain from cnl
and what he found was the answer was not
much most of the explanation has to come
in variations in a which technology
which economists interpret to mean that
it's really technological progress
that's the main driver of economic
growth and not good planning in the way
capital and labor are allocated and so
the lion's share is explained by this
now someone like Paul Romer who I
mentioned who's the growth economist
tackles this by postulating dynamics for
a of T but they're still thinking about
technology is a number so this number
described technology for the entire
world and I argue that we need to go
beyond that we need to think about
technologies and interacting and
evolving ecology and to understand
economic growth we have to get inside
the black box and really think about
what technologies actually are so now
I'm going to give you two examples of
how this can help us and and as I said
these are just little little snippets
really of what I think ultimately needs
to go into making a proper theory and
I'm now going to transition to talking
about something that's quite practical
so this is let me let me just talk you
through this slide and explain the
reasons why is appellate policymakers
need to be thinking more carefully about
what's actually driving technological
change and the fact that different
technologies are different now so what
we're looking at here is a plot as a
function of time so these are years so
it's a fairly long time span we plot the
cost on the left-hand axis of generating
electricity measured in dollars per
kilowatt hour and and in particular this
black curve here is the coal fuel price
for electricity generation so so this
curve is really it's just a cost of coal
but but presented in units that relate
it to electricity the fuel cost is about
40 percent or 50 percent of the cost of
generating electricity from a modern
coal-fired electricity power plant and
so if you take a modern electricity
power plant and you just look at this is
just then the cost of coal reflected in
the roughly two pennies that correspond
to the cost that you're paying per
kilowatt of electricity kilowatt hour of
electricity now the striking thing when
you look at this time series it's about
150 year time series is that it hasn't
actually gone up or down very much it
Wiggles around but once you adjust for
inflation the price of coal is pretty
constant you can show this by fitting a
time series model to it you fit time
series model to it
you get a random walk without drift you
can't reject that null hypothesis second
technology's nuclear power each of these
little red triangles represents the cost
of the electricity from a nuclear power
plant in the United States in the year
where the nuclear power plant came
online and so what you see is during the
lifespan of this data if anything the
cost of nuclear power went up by a
factor of two or three most likely the
lion's share of that cost is because
people had concerns about the safety of
nuclear power and so it became more
complicated to generate electricity with
nuclear power because the safety
standards went up but that's not clear
that's the whole explanation now in
contrast this green these green dots and
now the axis is over here because what
we're looking at is the cost of solar
modules and so the way you think about
the cost of solar modules is you look at
the cost of making a solar module that
in this case in dollars per watt-peak
so in other words if you can take that
module and you just lay it out in the
Sun what's the cost of a module that
will generate 1 watt of electricity and
what you see is a very different looking
behavior so across the span and the data
we plot relative to the others the price
is coming crashing down it's got some
fits and starts you see there's a
plateau there other places where it's
really plunged and but in fact if you
look at solar photovoltaic modules the
first module was commercially you well
not quite commercially went to the
vanguard satellite the cost is now a
factor of 3,000 cheaper than it was then
it happens that same year 1956 was the
year the first British power plant
nuclear power plant went online and you
cannot say the same thing for nuclear
power this by the way is the projected
cost of the Hinkley Point north nuclear
power plant that's projected to be built
in Great Britain politics are still a
little complicated because of the
Chinese and the French and the British
Relations the British government but
this is what the electricity would cost
if they actually bring it in at the
projection historically nuclear powers
come in about a factor of three higher
than projections but what you see is
that solar solar energy is actually
becoming cheaper than nuclear power and
if this extrapolation that I made is
correct by 2050 it should be
substantially cheaper than coal-fired
electricity so food for thought
no in fact one of the things we've done
is look at collect time series like that
for lots of different technologies and
look at how their rates of decrease of
the cost change with time so we make
plots like this we fit we assume that
prices are dropping exponentially as
they are roughly here we fit an exponent
and we translate this into a percent
change so solar energy for example has
been coming down at a rate of 10 to 12
percent per year throughout its history
so we take that number we put it into a
histogram we did that for about 200
different technologies including lots of
things oil natural gas various minerals
chemicals and and what we find when we
do that is that most things live in this
kind of Gaussian looking center that's
roughly centered around zero it's not
surprising in a way because when you
think about it we're adjusting prices
for inflation most of the technologies
in the economy are improving roughly at
the rate of inflation because in a sense
they're defining that rate of inflation
but then there's exceptional
technologies like computer hardware or
DNA sequencing that have been improving
it dramatically faster rates in some
cases for many many decades now so
there's something fundamentally
different going on with these kind of
technologies and photovoltaics just for
reference are at 10% there they're out
here toward the tail but but on the edge
of that tail I'll come back at the end
of my talk actually to say something
about robotics no now how can we use
this practically so we began by well
would be I won't even say how we began
I'll say I'll present a story for how to
make sense of this in a simple way
Moore's law something I think
everybody's familiar with but Moore's
law in its original form was something
that was originally about the density of
transistors as a function of time that
was what Moore's hypothesis was about he
basically said transistors will become
more dense such that the density
doubles roughly every two years and now
it then rapidly though came to be
discussed in other terms to be a
statement about the speed of computers
about the cost of computers and and so
on
so it immediately started being
generalized and in fact we've seen that
it it's for these technologies they're
out on the tail most of the time Moore's
Law laws not a bad hypothesis although
as you get toward the center things get
noisier and noisier no there's actually
another law that's been around longer
than Moore's Law it's due to this fellow
Theodore Paul right very interesting guy
he he was he was part of a family his
two brothers are more famous than he is
one of them is Sewell Wright who's one
of the most famous evolutionary
biologists and the other brothers I
always forget his name and I think is
personal Wright who is a considered one
of the founders of political science he
was a black sheep of the family he went
off to World War one and became a flying
ace and and then came back after the war
and was was a key player in the aircraft
industry and 1936 he wrote his only
paper where he pointed out that if you
take a given kind of airplane that the
cost of that airplane drops about 20
percent every time the cumulative
production of that airplane doubles so
the more we produce the airplane somehow
we get better at producing it so the
cost goes down and so so you can write
that in the form I've written it up
there where the cost Y is if X is
accumulative of production the cost is
following as some power of cumulative
production where that power
Alfa's typically typically around 0.3
although i'll question that typical ness
in a moment that that was what was
generally believed and at least for
airplanes that 10
and that translates into the statement I
said that when cumulative production
doubles costs dropped by about 20
percent
now Wright actually went on to become
the head of aircraft production for the
United States during World War two
and and actually used his own law to
forecast what was gonna cost to produce
planes because during World War two the
cumulative production went up
dramatically for all these planes and so
was actually a very useful thing but
very large drops in cost were observed
during the course of the war now again
if I were giving several lectures I
might go into the origin of rights law
we have a paper trying to derive why
rights law should exist and any and
making a hypothesis well actually
something we derived from our model
which is that more complex technologies
in the sense of more interacting parts
that have to be coordinated should
improve at lower rates that is have
smaller values of alpha than others to
be honest I think this is about as good
an explanation as exists but I don't
think it's a very good explanation I
think the essence of what's driving
rights law still remains to be
understood now just to compare these
things in this plot we've got Moore's
law so I took three different
technologies transistors photovoltaics
hard disk drives and ethanol and we plot
them through time so you were plotting
now this is a Moore's Law plot so we're
plotting the average unit price as a
function of time since the hypothesis is
that the costs are dropping
exponentially then we use a semi-log
plot and you see that you get roughly
straight lines and you know there's
variations from them but as these things
go an exponential fit is not bad
now you can plot the same data using
rights law requires more information
because now instead of time on the x
axis we have cumulative production we
have the logarithm of cumulative
production yeah so we fought these same
technologies and you can see you get
some really good fits in fact perhaps
this cuts are a bit
and now how can this be well it turns
out we discovered that there's another
irregularity going on here which is if
you look at these technologies and you
plot the production as a function of
time you can see that actually this may
be cumulative production you plot this
as a function of time
you also see exponentially increasing
curves and as was originally pointed out
by sahal in 1987 if it's a kind of an
obvious fact when you think about it it
productions expanding exponentially and
costs are dropping exponentially then if
you just eliminate time from these two
expressions so you're right cost as a
function of cumulative production then
you get a power law and now in the
exponent of that power law is minus B
over a so you can relate these two
exponents here this is the one for the
generalized Moore's law that's the
exponent for the increase in production
a are directly related to this exponent
alpha for rights law and in fact we
tested that and it works extremely well
now I I have to tell you a strange story
well I don't have to tell you this but
it's sufficiently strange that I sort of
can't resist telling it this my postdoc
Milla Nagy is one who really drove this
early work he collected the data sets
that I'm about to or let's say organized
like local high school students and so
on to help him collect this data sets
the transylvanian and he he got he got
very interested in this fellow sahal
because it turns out so hall just
mysteriously disappeared in about 1989
that's he was around one day and one day
he wasn't there anymore and you know
there was no suicide note nobody ever
found a body he just disappeared and
Beyla went so far as to track his
brother down and have a correspondence
with him well about two years later
Baylor disappeared so strange
I don't know so it's a pity though
because I thought he was doing some
great work and well who knows who knows
now
so the question can we use these laws
that I'm just talking to you about whose
origin is not really well understood to
predict things how can how well can we
do to go back to this slide here if
you're the skeptic it looks like by
about 2050 photovoltaic electricity
should be a lot cheaper than coal notice
it's a log plot so well is that true I
mean this is just an empirical
regularity how do we know this isn't
gonna just turn around in plant oh wow
so our approach to understanding that
from the empirical point of view lacking
a deeper understanding is to collect a
lot of data Beyla and his team collected
around data on 50 different technologies
that we're improving and we had a first
pass in the paper above to try and then
make predictions and test whether
whether if we pretended to be in the
past
what would we have been able to reliably
predict the future let me just look at
my next slide here just to give you
explain what we did we pretended to be
in a given time the past we forecast
each future date so we forecast if we're
sitting we imagine we're sitting in 1980
we forecast 1981 1982 1983 1984 all the
way up to the end of the data set that
we have we repeat that for all past
dates we score the methods based on
their forecasting errors so that's what
we did in the top paper and then now we
have this problem of when we do that how
do we compare the errors on all these
technologies how do we make sense out of
this because at the end of the day we
didn't want to just make forecasts we
wanted to be able to give you a
distributional forecast that would
effectively
tell you how good our forecast is and we
wanted to do that and test it so that we
could have some confidence in it
now what Francois Lafond and I did was
to go beyond I'm not going to tell you
about the earlier thing because a bit
complicated doesn't work as well this
this works quite nicely so we
reformulated Moore's law and rights laws
time series models so what does that
mean well we take the logarithm of the
cost and I apologize for the change in
notation why now means log cost rather
than cost so we look at the change from
year to year from t plus 1 of T in the
logarithm of the cost and we assume that
that's given by some drift term to say
Mew I showed you in the earlier slides
it's the rate at which costs are
dropping and then there's some random
noise around that it's actually we're
gonna make it a random walk so there's
some noise in T that's accumulating and
there's some noise amplitude K that
determines how noisy that random walk is
alright and then similarly it turns out
we can rewrite rights law in a similar
way I won't I won't go into how we do
that because it's a bit of a
mathematical details now the nice thing
about doing this to go back these
formulas is now we're gonna think about
all the technologies the same way we're
gonna make a bold hypothesis which is
that all technologies follow this it's
just a question of what Mew is and what
K is so mu and K are now technology
specific parameters that will assume
actually stay constant in time
throughout the history of that
technology so the nice thing about this
is it allows us to collapse all the data
use the law of large numbers using the
trick that Gauss discovered a couple of
centuries ago now and collapse all the
data in one distribution because
basically we we fit these constants we
divide by the constants to normalize all
the time series in the same way and then
we can collapse everything all 50
technologies onto one distribution and
then we can test things in that vein to
see what
works now as you know you might remember
from elementary statistics if you have a
gaussian process you you and you look at
the empirical distribution where you're
forced to measure the means and standard
deviations you get a student
distribution know so how well does does
this work well we could derive some
formula and this is where we had to work
hard because if you think about this the
errors are going to be growing in time
that is if you're forecasting one year
out it's gonna be a lot easier than
forecasting 20 years out and under this
kind of process in fact that's what you
expect even if you knew the parameters
perfectly because this is a random walk
the the error envelope is effectively
going to go at the square root because
this is a diffusion process so you
expect to see the error growing as a
square root of time or the squared error
to grow linearly in time and indeed we
can derive that in our model so we see
this number tau in that formula above
which is a formula for the expected
error that's and the error is now this e
this squiggly e which is the difference
between the forecast made with that
simple Moore's law model and what
actually happened so it's the difference
between these two things
so we we take that number we divide it
by the estimated standard deviation of
the process that's how how noisy was the
curve we square that we take the average
of the errors our hypothesis which we
derive under this the assumption of that
process I showed you is that this grows
now linearly with tau that's the horizon
that's the time arrives it into the
future plus there's another term which
is tau squared over m now M is the
number of data points that you have to
make the fit as you have more data
points remember we're assuming a
stationary process here as you have more
data points that it gets better and so
your model should get better but what
happens is with finite n there's always
some error which means that the
a this tau squared over m term
corresponds to the fact that that error
asymptotically always dominates because
tau squared is asymptotically bigger
than tau it starts out smaller because M
is typically a number like in the
experiments we did because we had a
short data set we only had about 5000
data points we we we had we actually
took intentionally m to be small we took
em to be 5 so we just use the 5 last
data points the 5 last years and then we
forecast up to 20 years into the future
using just that data and but so what
happens is initially the town term
dominates it later on the tau squared
over m term always dominates so we make
a very specific hypothesis about the
functional form of a document how
accurate our prediction should be and
would we compare this quantity here you
see the dots are what we actually
observed over about 5,000 different
forecasts the this dashed line here is
what we observed from the simple random
walk without drift and this solid line
here is what we get when we extend the
process to allow for Auto correlation
between the data points so in other
words if a technology is improving a lot
in one year it's likely to improve a lot
the next year too and vice versa this
effectively decreases the amount of data
and makes your forecast worse so what
you can see is our theory fits the data
pretty well and to test this in another
way we actually look at the student
distribution so the student distribution
is your plotted on semi log scale so we
plot the positive side here and the
negative side over here and and we
compare the simple model without the
correlation which is here to the earth
we get with the model with the
correlation there and the basic
punchline is okay we've got some
fluctuations away from the student
distribution but the forecasts are not
too bad and actually we can do test and
show that in fact they're pretty good no
no now we can actually use this stuff to
come back to my question about solar
energy this is our distributional
forecast
or energy based on that time series up
above we forecast that this is roughly
the zone where we'll stay within one
standard deviation the the light gray is
the zone where you within two standard
deviations that is the 95 percent
quantile and so you can then just see
that the odds that by the time you get
to 2030 that solar energy will not have
dropped in cost are not zero there are a
few percent based on our historical
experience using lots and lots of
technologies now we can do this with any
technology the differences between these
technologies turn out to be that as this
parameter view gets smaller the data get
noisier and noisier so all right now
just as a by the way we happen to look
at the actual usage of different energy
sources and we were triggered in some
sense by the International Energy
Association whose recently updated their
forecast they used to say 11% now they
say 16% of electricity could be
generated by solar energy in 2050 so
that's a point that's way out here
somewhere in contrast this is the actual
data for solar energy compared with
other energy producing technologies and
you can see that while on the other hand
it starts out very low because the rate
of deployment has been the order of 45%
per year throughout the history if you
just extrapolate that curve the the
point where you might hit 20% of primary
energy which might be a reasonable
number because that's probably as far as
you can go without better progress on
storage that happens in 2027 so that's
actually good news for climate change
and by the way it's a little hard to see
how the IEA could forecast 16% or
previously 11 in fact if you go back to
there's forecast
they've systematically always forecast
much lower they've been steadily
updating their forecasts over the last
couple of decades from a minuscule
number to these numbers now we can also
do the same thing for rights law that's
so important because countries like
Germany have tried to encourage adoption
of US energy technologies green energy
technologies through things called
feed-in tariffs which basically amount
to intentionally stimulating production
to try and accelerate the rate of
progress and so one of things we can do
with this is estimate what the effect of
those kind of tariffs will do and we've
been working on that let me just make
say one of the thing there's there's a
cause-effect question with something
like introducing a feed-in tariff that
is is it the case that we see rights law
because increasing production drives
costs down or is it that innovation
drives cost down which increases demand
so what's the cause and effect relation
and in a paper that well we haven't
gotten done yet but we actually got a
huge data set for world war two
technologies American production of
military materials during World War two
and it's a great natural experiment
because we know that it isn't the case
that Franklin D Roosevelt in 1939 said
well you know tanks are getting really
cheap let's build a lot of them quite
the opposite America had the 17th
largest military in 1939 and Roosevelt
ordered all the manufacturers of the
United States to begin producing more
material essentially for example he
famously told it you know the car makers
he told them what he expected them to do
they said that mr. president we won't be
able to make any commercial cars he says
gentlemen do not misunderstand me you're
not going to make commercial cars you're
gonna make tanks anyway so it's a great
natural experiment and indeed we find
that increasing the scale does actually
bring cost down now I want to end my
talk changing the subject a little bit
to go back to the sort of lofty stuff I
talked to you at the beginning about
Ecology's of technologies and ways to
think about that so this is a sort of a
first step this is an example of the
generalized usefulness of ecosystems
thinking which can be applied lots of
things
I give a list here and I've got another
paper here that anybody's interested in
financial markets it applies this kind
of thinking to financial strategies but
what did you talk about here is
production networks in the economy
production networks are pretty
complicated for a lot in the modern
economy this is the supply chain of a
laptop computer which as you can see is
not only complicated but geographically
distributed it's a kind of a strange
developmental process where imagine you
know imagine if you try to assemble a
baby by making the parts all over the
world and shipping them all to some spot
and assembling them but that's how we do
technologies now the theory I'm going to
present to you very briefly because I
don't want to go over time because I'd
like to leave a little time for
questions it is based on that they're an
old theory by leon TF it's a beautiful
theory doesn't get the attention it
deserves in economics now but basically
it treats the physical production system
is a network of inputs and outputs based
on the physical flow of materials and so
the nodes or industries each produce a
single good their way to directed links
are the inputs to each industry and you
can base this on either physical flows
or on the monetary flows there's a
precise analogy to equilibrium chemical
kinetics and you can if you make
equilibrium assumptions and you apply
conservation laws which are things like
the money flowing into node one node
equals the money flowing out of that
node you could write down a linear
system equations and these kind of
things have been used since the 50s
in fact this theory is what stimulated
the whole concept of national accounting
that we now rely on for things like GDP
measurement and so on now we're going to
use this in a pretty different way that
is we want to think about a kind of very
primitive evolutionary model where and
we want to compare our two different
kinds of economies what is a plat
economy where
industries s-one and s-two both fruits a
final good and just compete with each
other and the other is a chain economy
where industry s1 produces an
intermediate good which is used by NSPS
- which then is the final good and what
I'm going to argue from this theory is
that if if locally each industry is
improving at some rate this economy
well prices will drop faster and and
good Goods production will become more
efficient in this economy than this
economy and the idea is that this
industry makes an improvement that
improvement gets passed on to Innis vs2
it makes it and its improvement so the
final improvement is actually the
product of the improvements that the two
industries made and you can see this
with something like a laptop if you know
if the chips improved and that's passed
on automatically to the laptop then they
do something else about the actual
laptop you get both of those now so how
do we do this we we first of all assume
a simple local process for technological
improvement and then we look at well we
make these predictions that I say here
which I'll come back to so what's our
model for improvement it's simple input
tuning so it's a very naive model it's
it's I list here one of many factors
that go into actually making
improvements but because we we can't
make most of these easily trackable we
just tackle the very first one up there
which I quote we call input tuning
meaning well I'll give you a concrete
example I I I owned a sailboat I used to
own another sailboat before it sank in
Cuba and that's a long story but this
boat was fiberglass hauled sailboat
built in 1965 and in 1965 they still
didn't understand just how strong
fiberglass was so one of the things I
liked about this boat I mean that Hall
was really strong I actually tested it
once by hitting a rock at full speed and
you know was scratched a little bit but
hardly damaged that wasn't what actually
sank the boat
but but you know since then sailboats
the hulls have simply become lighter
because they realized that they didn't
need to put that much fibreglass in and
and actually they got faster when they
became when they did that because they
got lighter and so that's input tuning
you just you just somehow realize you
don't need as much of that stuff as he
used to and it could be a proxy for
other things like finding new materials
that are cheaper or better but we just
as soon as a simple input tuning model
now so then we plug that into and I'll
just flash these equations for purely
Gestalt purposes you have some linear
equations at the top for the physical
process equation the middle allows you
to compute prices from those leontyev
approximation and the third equation
allows you to compute statements about
physical inputs to a statement about
prices so so we take that we make the
assumption that the physical network is
somehow getting more efficient so if you
look at the normalized if you take
industry I and you look at its inputs
from industry J then you assume that the
that's just going to decrease due to
input tuning at some rate given by some
constant gamma I but specific to in this
VI times gamma I J so we're assuming an
exponential improvement in that industry
through time so this connects up a
little bit with what I said before and
so we just kind of turned the
mathematical crank and go through this
the equations and I'm not going to bore
you with this but we end up driving some
very simple relationships between prices
GDP the rate of improvement of GDP and
the topological structure of the
production network and so we applied
this to some data from the world
input-output database we first of all
can now back out rates of improvement of
industries because you have from the
earlier statement I may need you should
have realized that if you think about a
given industry you could say well what
what improvement is Apple actually
making on this computer getting that
versus what improvement did motorola
make in making the chip keeper so you
have to factor those things out even
think about specific industries you can
see there's a huge variation and the
rate of improvement of industries
ranging from minus 60 percent to 60
percent roughly it turns out fits a
student distribution we also were able
to prove some simple theorems like we
can prove that there is a quantity which
could be called a generalized output
multiplier in an ecological term it have
to do with how deep the the production
network is so it's like your position on
the food web we can show that if you
take the given country then it will give
it a closed economy that the ratio of
gross output to net output is equal to
the depth that the the depth of the
economy and so we can show that this is
invariant under aggregation I'm gonna
skip that slide because in the interest
of time and then we can make some
homogeneity assumption so we say well
what what if all industries were
improving at the same rate now that's
not at all true but what if we assume
that then we can at least look at the
all else equal what effect is this
trophic depth or this aggregate output
multiplier that says how deep the
economy is or how high the trophic level
of an industry is how does that relate
to the rate of growth of GDP or the rate
at which price indices for given
industries drop now to give you a little
better
I probably snowed you with this last bit
but let's just just to show you that
this what the idea is we're going to
compare the economy of the US and China
this is just which industry we're
talking about the y-axis contains the
trophic level of the industry and the
trophic level here you should think of
as the mean number of times a dollar
changes hand before it reaches a
household so if you're in a business
let's say take that CEO K which is
nuclear fuel and oil basically fuel for
producing energy
if you're in that business the number of
times a dollar changes hands typically
before it actually goes to a worker is
about three and a half so that's what
the depth means no so right away and now
each dot here is an industry the size of
the dot is the weight of that industry
and the GDP of the country and you can
see that these two graphs for China the
US look really different
first of all China has much deeper
ethnic levels on average for its
industries just look at the scale
secondly China the industries at the top
are the big ones are things like
electrical and optical manufacturer ELC
TPT transportation rubber chemistry
metallurgy the u.s. in contrast the high
winds are small and you know the biggest
pie win is real estate up there this is
like public administration without that
public administration this is
essentially this ladies but these are
all service industries down at the
bottom financed sort of sitting part we
have to change it's a very different
kind of economy agriculture is
interesting agriculture in the u.s. is a
very high trophic level industry
agriculture in China is one of the
lowest trophic level industries
corresponding to the difference in the
way these happen now we can then plot
growth rates against trophic depth and
we see we see a strong positive
relationship and actually we can show
this performs better than standard
standard growth models it turns out the
developed countries typically sit in
these these clusters where they have
barely a low trophic depth and a high
GDP per capita now I'm going to flip
through these olivia's make one more
statement we hypothesize that the
typical developed country has gone
through a trajectory where the trophic
depth of the country that's its
aggregate output multiplier first goes
up and then goes down as they enter the
service economy and so we've been
looking at these trajectories through
time now these key points summarize my
talk
want to just end on a couple of brief
philosophical notes so first of all go
back to that if you think about that
laptop slide the technological ecology
is extremely autopoietic what do I mean
by that that all its components depend
on each other to exist and if you
somehow collapsed it it would be
incredibly hard to start it again just
imagine if all technology disappeared
even if you understood even if the
knowledge was still around what would it
take to get it going again you would
have to go through a sequence of steps
you know you have to go back to those
guys with their scrapers build your
first primitive tools smelts metal it'd
be a very long road to get back to where
we are now
okay this is my central point that I
think though III I mean I've only given
you hints of it I think there exists an
interesting evolutionary theory for
technological change and I wanted to and
oh darn it I got didn't get the slide I
thought I had here well okay I had
thrown in a slide about robots because
I've given to this this is about this
conference is about AI we use the same
stuff we use to look at full solar
photovoltaic cells to look at robots and
we benchmarked it against various things
and the result was interesting what we
ended up seeing is that the cost of
robots has been coming down at around 5%
per year for around two decades the
quality of robots has been going up at
about five percent per year for those
same two decades and this is pretty
robust across several data sets so in
other words robots in that histogram I
made sit at about 10% and you can then
ask how does that compare to human labor
well if you assume that a human laborer
and say the United States in a
manufacturing job makes around 20 bucks
an hour we're at the point now where
we're at breakeven with robots so it
does suggest we are at a critical point
regarding robotics we are robotics is I
think set to enter the mainstream
which presents some rather profound
challenges and I think on that note in
my talk you know so this is a very
common question and it's a question
that's been investigated in the
literature I didn't say that right after
he wrote his original 1936 paper and in
a 50 somewhere the Business School guys
picked up on this and there was probably
a couple hundred papers written applying
his lot of various things and there are
papers hypothesizing floors as you
mentioned but I mean I've looked at a
lot of data and seen very little
evidence for them and and I think the
reason is that we're talking about cost
cost is a funny thing cost has to do
with things like the way you produce
stuff and learning and it doesn't have
physical limits on it so I'm like
Moore's law with the original Moore's
law is hitting wall as we know right now
and so I don't you know we're not going
to see transistor density doubling any
more but cost seemed to kind of keep
doing what they're doing interesting
question everybody has that question but
the data for it is but the data doesn't
support it so far
similar until it hit this sort of upper
upper plateau isn't there any solar the
perfect organization of material so
again it's distinguished cost from
efficiency so so I could have another
plot of efficiency of solar modules it's
in general gone out but it hasn't
changed dramatically in a while actually
it's it's around you know there's a 20%
seems you can get to pretty easily and
getting above that's harder although
some of the technologies have higher
efficiencies but efficiency is not
generally the limiting factor limiting
factor is what it cost to produce it and
that's not affected by efficiency that's
that's you know and in fact I think a
lot of the progress we're going to see
is actually in lower performance solar
cells that can be applied in very easy
ways like just painting them onto a roof
you somehow paint the roof and you you
know you have you collect the
electricity off the roof just from the
paint people are talking about doing
this thing with things like roads having
roads be big solar collectors so roads
roof buildings etc but that could
nuclear power in it this again this is a
cost and there's no
okay well I don't think I have a later
one for nuclear power though are you
yeah I don't think I have a later when
particular power and it hasn't gone down
and and you know and what you see when
you look at these technologies that
haven't decreased in cost like oil the
oil now cost about what it did in 1890
once you adjust for inflation and you
did see kind of noisy noisy behavior
when you look at those so there's some
special set of technologies that are the
improving technologies and those are the
technologies I would argue that the
economy is rewiring itself toward so you
take say computer technologies you know
semiconductor chips photography used to
be an industry that was about chemistry
chemistry in this histogram has one of
the low rates of improvement and so the
chemicals are down in here somewhere
it's rewired itself over here so now
it's an industry about silicon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
