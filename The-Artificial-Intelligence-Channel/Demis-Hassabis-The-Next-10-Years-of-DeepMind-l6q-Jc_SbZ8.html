had a very long term but I'd love to get
you thinking about the next 10 years of
deepmind
what do you hope that will happen in
those 10 years for the company yeah so
my big hope and I think we're just
approaching the point where we're going
to be able to start doing this is
applying all these learning techniques
we're building learning algorithms to
science itself so actually sort of you
know we use the scientific method to
create these algorithms but actually
then reapplying them back into other
domains of science like you know quantum
chemistry or protein folding or whole
bunch of areas we're looking at and -
you know one we're looking forward to is
the first big breakthrough that comes in
a really hard area of science that makes
a huge difference you know to the
scientific or medical community that was
in a large part helped by you know Nai
tool int and being used by experts in
those in those areas so I think in the
next 10 years we're going to start
seeing you know my hope would be in you
know a couple years from now we're going
to start seeing that happen and then by
10 years maybe it's gonna be quite
routine which I think it's going to be
unbelievably revolutionary if that if
that can happen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
