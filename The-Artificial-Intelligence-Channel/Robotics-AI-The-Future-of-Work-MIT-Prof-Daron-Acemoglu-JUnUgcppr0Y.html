very nice introduction it's my great
pleasure to be here
CFR has been like a home for me for for
now oh my god
eighteen years and according to my wife
it's been too much like a home I spend
too much time with z-bar but this is
also a special event because you know
it's it's the David dodge lecture and I
think I'm very very honored to have been
asked to deliver this lecture and and I
think given David dodges many
contributions to intellectual and policy
world in Canada I think the topics of
today's lecture are probably important
to emphasize and re-emphasize especially
in the context of many discussions and
anxieties that exist in the Puffin
public's mind so without further ado let
me jump into the today's lecture so
there have been huge changes in the
labor market of the United States Canada
and many other advanced nations over the
last three decades and this has of
course come at the heels of major
technological transformations in the way
that we live our lives we produced we
consume we interact with each other and
especially with the increased importance
of robotics and AI in many workplaces
people have started asking questions
whether this really spells the end of
work as we know it whether machines are
going to make humans redundant or much
more limited in the functions that they
perform whether the type of work that we
are used to which is meaningful and a
source of sort of good living and wage
growth over time has come to an end and
I will show you some data in a second to
sort of underscore that some of these
concerns have some connection to the
trends that we are observing and these
are centrally important questions
because unless we think correctly based
on scientific and historical knowledge
about how technology is going to impact
work we are going to be hampered both
because anxiety is going to take the
place of reasoned action and because our
approach to policy or other sorts of
corrective actions is going to be
delayed or totally misplaced so it is
important to have a continued
conversation on this which will include
of course people who are at the
forefront of the AI robotics technology
computer technology as well as social
scientists from different parts of the
academic divide but it is also important
to emphasize that we have been here
before the anxiety about technology that
we are experiencing right now is not an
entirely new phenomenon one of the
Giants of the economics profession John
Maynard Keynes wrote a variant
well-delivered a very interesting
address in 1929 which he wrote up in
1930 and I say about the world that we
are going to leave to our grandchildren
and in in that essay he got many things
right in particular he was very very
much on target in predicting steady
about 2% a year productivity growth
increasing prosperity and technological
improvements but on one point people
have always thought that he was wrong in
the same essay he also predicted that we
would be experiencing increasing
technological unemployment because
machines would be replacing workers as
our productivity increases he thought
there wouldn't be enough jobs for people
to go around we always taught to our
students that you know even Keynes could
get things wrong and there are strong
reasons for thinking that that's
not true but now the same fears have
come back again perhaps with some
justification we'll see another
important economists and other a Nobel
prize-winner Wassily Leontief about 30
years after that started writing about
concerns about machines replacing people
and later on not in 52 but a little bit
later he also came up with a very
evocative image that we might be just
like horses you know in the 19th century
was impossible to imagine the world
without horses because we depended on
them for everything the world would come
to an end without horses and then huge
technological advances internal
combustion engine trams trains and and
better ships came along and transport
totally shifted away from animal power
and horses became you know essentially
unseen in cities and and just a hobby
sort of activity well he said could we
go the same way of the horses so in
order to see whether those concerns that
have been around with us are more apt
today we need to delve into this issue
so this is what I'm going to do and I'm
gonna talk a little bit about a
conceptual framework about what
technologies do in relation to their
interactions with humans and in that
context I'm going to draw a key
distinction it's an abstract distinction
but are useful nonetheless between what
I'm going to call enabling technologies
and replacing technologies and I will
put computers AI and robotics within
that framework once I have given you a
little bit of this frameworks moving
pieces then I will move on to show
various pieces of data about what's been
happening in the US labor market what's
going on to productivity what's going on
to employment to labor share to wages to
wage distribution and to the
occupational distribution of employment
and in that context I'll then come back
to more specific estimates of what the
effects of the rollout of robots in US
manufacturing has done and and then
based on what we have learned from here
I will come back and talk about the
future input
in regards to what it promises for
productivity and what it might hold for
the future of work okay so what do I
mean by enabling and replacing
technologies essentially this is a
distinction that of course is to some
degree abstract and many technologies
you might think might fall within both
categories but I'll show you that many
technologies that are important can be
seen to be much more on the enabling or
much more of the replacing source by
enabling technologies I mean the
technologies that increase the
productivity of labour in the tasks that
day that Labour performs so if you are
putting together a particular model of
an airplane and you come up with a
technology to do that in a better way
that's an enabling technology and
replacing technology on the other hand
does something quite different it takes
away the tasks by automating it so that
humans are no longer necessary
for that specific purpose so therefore
the difference between enabling and
replacing is that enabling increases
augments what humans do replacing gets
rid of the human at least for most of
what is involved in performing a
particular specific task in the
production process so let me give you
some examples of what I mean by that
forced from historical technology and
also then from contemporary technologies
in terms of the first computer I think
people can have very different opinions
about what the first computer was but
one argument is that this mechanism that
you're seeing there is actually the
first computer because it had many of
the features of something that you could
program in order to increase the the the
transmission of knowledge so this is
called ITT rangatira Antikythera
mechanism it goes back to about 200 BC
and it is a device used by a very small
subsection of the ancient Greek society
in order to
predicting the astronomical positions of
stars so it's a clear enabling
technology because what it is doing is
that it's enabling these very skilled
Greek astronomers to do things that they
were not able to do before
in contrast here is another more
computer like technology that has also
been heralded as the grandfather of
modern computers it's a it's called the
jacquard loom it's a power loom that was
introduced by a French engineer and it
essentially automates part of the
textile production the weaving part of
the textile production process and it
has the first use of the punch card this
is one of a series of power looms that
automated the weaving process and took
weavers out of the production process
and it's things actually that are quite
similar to the jacquard loom where being
used until 30-40 years ago so these are
of course ancient technologies but if
you want to sort of think of modern
times you can similarly find many
examples of enabling and replacing
technology and of course many examples
that will be somewhere between the
enabling ended and the replacing
spectrum so one clear example would be
computer assisted design so these sorts
of machines have increased the ability
of design workers to produce very
precise designs very quickly in a way
that augments their skills and abilities
to a to an extent that was not possible
before these computerized technologies
on the other hand the archetypal example
of a replacing technology today is
robotics so this is a picture of a Quinn
dye Factory and what's remarkable here
is that you won't see many workers
there's one there in the background I
don't know what he's doing but this is a
fully automated workplace so that's the
difference between enabling and
replacing the computer assisted design
machine is
gonna work without somebody designing
something so it is enabling that person
to do something more than he or she was
able to do before
whereas here these robots have replaced
workers from the assembly line and of
course you can put your many
applications of AI which I'm going to
talk about later in the talk within the
category of AI so many of the
applications of AI that have not really
been introduced yet but there are in the
process of being introduced where you're
going to have a I prepared paralegal
documents financial predictions tax
accounts decision-making processes are
all in the replacing category and it's
distinction between replacing and
enabling technologies is important
because they create very different
effects on the labor market so why as
economists and here I'm not separate
from the rest of the economist for 20
years I've taught just like the rest of
the economists that Keynes was wrong and
technological change even if it did
bring some disruption would ultimately
lead to both employment and wage growth
why did we think that we thought that
because our framework for thinking about
technologies was very buzzed based on
enabling technologies and enabling
technologies imply one very simple point
about the effects of technologies on the
labor market when a technology increases
productivity it also increases wages
there is no way for enabling
technologies to reduce wages over all
perhaps depending on how you think about
them they might reduce the wages of some
narrow group of workers or change of
organisations in such a way that doesn't
benefit everybody certainly they could
do so to some degree that some people
benefit more than others but overall
wage growth is always going to be a
consequence of that and because wage
growth is going to increase labor demand
the willingness of people to actually
work employment is going to follow the
increases in wages so enabling
technologies thus are
of the sort that will lift all boats
they will tend to benefit workers not
come at the expense of workers that is
not so for replacing technologies
because replacing technologies directly
take away tasks that were produced
previously by workers they create a
first-order displacement effect so
previously there were several workers
who manned the assembly lines of the car
factories now the machines and the
robots come and those workers lose their
jobs that creates a negative effect on
employment and a negative effect on
wages is it the case that display
replacing technologies always have a
negative effect on employment the answer
is also no because in addition to the
displacement effect they create a whole
host of positive influences and in
particular let's think about this in the
context of the car factories that I have
already used as an example imagine that
General Motors now introduces robots in
order to produce cars on its assembly
lines what does that do
well the first or the first impact of
this will be that General Motors is
doing that because robots are cheaper so
if robots are cheaper than workers then
the cost of producing cars goes down and
the production the cost of cars means
that people will want to consume more
cars to the extent that not everything
has been automated there are you know
millions of non production jobs
associated with the auto industry in the
United States as well as several hundred
thousands of tens of thousands of
production work still around related to
auto workers those lay their demand for
labor that performs these non production
and production tasks in the auto
industry is going to increase because
the lower cost of autos is going to mean
people are going to want to buy more
orders
that's one facet of a productivity
effect but there is more the reduction
in the cost of autos means that we're
all richer if we are richer we
just want to consume autos we want to
consume all sorts of other things in
particular we would want to have better
health care better entertainment perhaps
better widgets for our home and all of
these increased demands will translate
into employment effects so therefore for
replacing technologies as opposed to the
enabling technologies there is this race
between the displacement effect and the
productivity effect when will the
productivity effect win out when will it
lose out so that the displacement effect
is greater and technologies destroy jobs
and destroy reduce wages the first one
the first element here is that if the
productivity effect is weak then we are
in trouble and this is actually a very
important point if you read the popular
media the picture that's painted and
it's an interesting picture but a
picture is a that's painted is one in
which we have these brilliant
technologies that can perform everything
so much better than humans can do and
that's why we're all going to be thrown
out of work but if those technologies
are really so great they would also
reduce costs a lot so they would
generate a huge productivity effect
actually what we should be scared of are
not those brilliant technologies but the
soso technologies they replace workers
but they don't reduce your costs all
that much if that's the case you lose
the workers the displacement effect
where the productivity effect doesn't
kick in the second element that needs to
be bear borne in mind is whether our
workforce and I'm gonna come back to
this point at the end again whether our
workforce has the skills that are
complementary to machines if we have the
skills complementary to machines
then the increase in the demand for
labour will be stronger but if all that
we know as workers are to perform form
the tasks that computers can perform or
robots can perform but worse then we're
really thrown out of work so therefore
the two elements that we have to warn
the bane in mind in the age of display
replacing technologies is whether we can
combat the displacement effect with
enough productivity improvements so
brilliant technologies versus social
technology
and whether we have the complementary
skills so in this framework let's now
talk a little bit more about robots and
computers so I think there is no well
accepted definition of what are robots
and what are computers but for this talk
I'm going to use robots as like the
industrial robots that we saw on the car
and I plan is they are automatically
controlled with programmable
multi-purpose machines that autonomously
interact with the world the AI is the
word that sometimes used to refer to the
broad cluster of technologies based on
deep learning an element that Alan
already mentioned that are used for
solving and detecting patterns in in a
continuous fashion on unstructured data
and this unstructured data an
algorithmic approach to AI is actually
quite important because there are some
claims in the literature and by some
very very clever people so they are not
to be dismissed but they are based on
the idea that AI is going to be able to
do exactly everything that humans do and
in fact that was the original model of
AI cybernetics and the artificial
intelligence technologies that followed
on it in the 1970s
originally thought that we could program
machines to think exactly like humans
that led to a total failure and probably
setback the field of AI by about 20
years and then the second wave based on
neural networks algorithmic approaches
to unstructured data deep learning and
various other applications of huge power
of today's computers let take took a
different approach there is no attempt
to replicate the human mind but there is
an attempt to single out tasks and
perform those tasks and generally in the
ai ai domain those are tasks that are
just about information processing now
the importance of that is that if the
world is one in which AI is going to
keep on doing this it's not going to
totally replace humans because it's not
going to replace the human mind
so there is no issue and in fact we're
gonna see that the evidence is not
suggesting that either there is no issue
of AI completely replacing humans but AI
is continuously going to take away from
the tasks that humans were previously
performing and that's going to lead to a
sort of a race between machines and men
which I'm going to talk about now robots
were for a long time
viewed as things that were just gonna be
very very limited in what they could do
because there are a whole host of things
that come naturally to humans that are
very difficult for machines but now this
is for example Baxter it's a robot
that's very good at folding shirts so
that's one of the tasks that people
thought was going to be very difficult
for robots to perform 10 years ago now
it's fairly routine typical applications
of AI that we have seen already quite
important improvements are things like
financial planning tax preparation but
there are also more creative
applications for instance recent work by
several academics at Cornell and Harvard
shows that if you use AI techniques in
order to perform bail decisions they're
gonna do about 25 percent better than
judges in in keeping the same amount of
people locked up for bail but reducing
the crime rate by 25 percent because
judges are just not processing the
information and are making the wrong
decisions so that's just like if snippet
of the types of things that AI is going
to be able to do so let me now come to
the u.s. data so I already sort of
anticipated some of this by saying there
are really big changes and here are two
of those the dotted line there is the
labor share in employment and the dark
line is the employment rate of prime
aged men so if you go back 35 years you
would see that almost 90 percent 95 so
almost 95 percent of prime aged men
would be working to that today that
number is just above 80 so the
employment rate of Man is declining and
that is not unrelated to the fact that
the work that they are doing is being
less and less
compensated and you can see that with
the red dotted line where the share of
labor income in national income stood
around 66 percent about 35 years ago and
now it's just about 56 percent now this
is the aggregate picture but perhaps
more interesting is what's going on to
the level of wages and also to the
distribution of wages so and again the
first way that the economist thought
about this issue was using this sort of
enabling technologies but one strong
implication of the enabling technologies
as I pointed out is that you should not
have these productivity improvements
associated with real wage decline so
here what I'm showing you is the u.s.
wage picture and you are seeing the high
school dropouts the blue workers with
high school degree which are the red
green some college workers with college
degree yellow and those with greater
than college postgraduate degrees the
light blue now look at the beginning of
the picture that's starting in 1963 but
you can go a little bit further back
using other data the pattern is the same
until about 1974 that's the period of
rapid wage growth and wage growth of all
five groups more or less parallel that's
the period of the rising technological
tide lifting all boats so if you were
living through that and some people hear
words you would be in the middle of a
buoyant labor market and a view based on
enabling technologies would just fit
like a glove
but then the picture changes over the
last 35 years we are seeing first slower
wage growth the rate at which these
curves are all increasing even the top
one is slower than what was going on in
the 1960s and early 70s second you are
seeing this fanning out of these
pictures much greater increase in
inequality constant steady increase in
inequality between say workers with
college degree and those without or dork
workers with post graduate degrees and
those were done but most importantly for
this debate between enabling and
replacing technologies you also see that
the three bottom groups
high school graduates high school
dropouts and those with some college are
experiencing quite significant real wage
declines over this period something that
again the enabling technologies
framework says it shouldn't happen so
this is a telltale sign that's something
that's out of the ordinary from the sort
of the simplest textbook model that you
can imagine in fact even more troubling
perhaps to some people is that if you
look at the yellow line yellow curve the
college graduates are not doing that
well they did not experience the initial
decline in the wages that high school
graduates for example did but then they
had a pretty anemic growth and the gap
between post graduates and the college
graduates is increasing steadily over
the last 15 years now these are
different education groups perhaps with
a composition of who is a college
graduate and who's a college who's the
high school graduates is changing so
here is the picture when you just look
at the overall wage distribution so here
the Green Line is the 90th percentile of
the wage distribution the red line is
the median of the wage and the blue line
is the bottom 10% so you see fairly
anemic growth of wages at the median so
US workers are not scoring wage growth
during this period even though
productivity is growing even though the
US is becoming very rich even though we
are seeing this brilliant mind boggling
technologies but even more concerning in
some sense - relative to what we are
used to the middle is doing even worse
than the bottom look at the blue curve
from the 1990 onwards it grows more than
the red curve so the middle is the one
that's most anemic and that is
underscored by this picture also so what
this picture does is that on the
horizontal axis it ranks different
occupations by their skill requirements
or level of wages that's the to actually
turn out to be very similar here I think
it's the real level of wages but if you
do it by skill level is the same also
and then on the vertical axis it shows
how much employment changed in the
indicated occupation for the
relevant decade in particular the red
curve is for the 1980s the blue curve is
for the 1990s and the red curve the
Greek gray curve is for the mm so the
1980s is exactly the pattern that you
would expect this is the period in which
the skilled occupations managers
supervisors engineers economists they're
all increase P Rhian seeing not just
wage growth but they're also
experiencing employment growth employers
want to hire more managers they want a
few more production workers which are in
the middle of the occupations they don't
want any of these occupations that are
very very low and in the scale like
protection services like cleaning stuff
and so on and so forth it's the more
skilled occupations for which there is
the demand is increasing
but the picture changes radically in
2000 which is the blue curve in the blue
curve instead of this increasing pattern
which says more employment growth in the
more skilled occupations you have the
University the u-shape which says that
you have more employment growth at the
bottom and more employment growth at the
top the middle is where you see negative
employment growth so this is the period
where we are seeing many of these
production jobs the assembly line work
disappearing because some of it because
of globalization but a lot of it because
of technology but to compensate for that
there is much faster growth of the jobs
at the two ends skilled occupations are
still growing but the bottom is also
growing what are less bottom occupations
those are the cleaning services low low
skilled health care protection other
menial tasks part of this is that people
who are losing their jobs in the middle
go and Dee skill they take lower skill
lower ranked occupations but the picture
becomes even more striking when you look
at the gray one the 2000s now in the
2000s you have just grows at the bottom
you don't have any growth in the
high-skill occupations you don't have
any growth in the middle but just at the
so we're just producing relatively low
skilled jobs the jobs in the lowest pay
lowest skilled occupations so this is an
alarming picture because it says that
from the age where technology was
complementing and creating jobs for
engineers and production workers the
1980s if you go back earlier 70s will be
the same also you are transitioning to a
period in which first the middle then
perhaps later the top is has ceased to
expand and this is not just a u.s.
phenomenon here is data from the OECD so
you can read the names of the different
countries and what this picture does is
that it shows you changes in the
employment of different types of
occupations in particular the green is
the highest-paid occupations the blue is
the lowest paid occupation and the red
is the 1/3 of the middle occupations
from the beginning of the 1990s to the
mid 2000s and what you see is that in
every country that you have here for
which we have data the middle is
shrinking there are less and less jobs
of the production worker and clerical
type which were the breadwinners for
many families men for men and women is
this the effect of technology well there
are many things going on as I mentioned
there is globalization there are
institutional changes we have a total
cultural and life changes that have been
engulfing the United States and other
countries throughout this period so we
need to look at more carefully at what's
going on to specific technologies and
here I'm gonna just give you a little
bit of a feel for that by looking at the
spread of industrial robots so what I
have done here is I have taken data on
which industries are adopting robots and
then by looking at the local
distribution of employment determined
which sorts of local areas say Flint
Michigan versus Wisconsin or Greater
Boston versus
and Lawrence which are the areas that
are more at greater risk of robots
replacing workers the darker-colored
means those are the places that are more
exposed to robots and you see where the
exposure to robots is greatest it's the
greatest in the industrial heartland of
the United States the Rust Belt to some
degree going way all the way down to on
the on the East Coast corridor under
under on the right hand side I have
shown the same US map but now with
imports from China because whenever you
talk about technology one alternative
explanation that people come up with
what about outsourcing what about
offshoring what about textile jobs or
other jobs going to China and being back
imported back into the United States yes
indeed that's a lot of that going on
also it's also interesting that the
correlation between these two things
imports from China and robots is
actually quite weak that correlation if
you don't put anything else the spatial
correlation would be 0.05 very very low
level of correlation and that reflects
the fact that robots and influence play
things like the auto manufacturers
chemical electronics metal products
whether China imports we're talking of
simple assembly jobs apparel furniture
toys and textile very different
industries and their geographic
distribution is also very different so
then let's look at what's happened
during this period in which robots
penetrated the US economy what's
happened to the employment level of
places that were more exposed to robots
again in a world of enabling
technologies we should see these places
thrive both productivity wise but also
in terms of employment and wages and
this picture here shows that the effect
is actually not very positive at all
places that have been more exposed to
robots have had significant shrinkage in
their employment so the extreme point
there is Flint Michigan that's the one
that's most exposed for example but
you'll see that many other places are
very exposed also and have experienced
rather rapid rollout of industrial
robots and their employment hasn't done
very well
same thing when you
wages wage levels have been not just
stagnant but actually declining in the
areas that are most on the firing line
of robots so therefore I take this
evidence as suggestive that just as in
the discussion that I provided at the
beginning of replacing technologies we
are in the midst of a process where we
have an array of different replacing
technologies industrial robots is just
one example but the oncoming AI
revolution is an even bigger bigger one
and if indeed as appears to have been
the case if these technologies are not
creating a productivity revolution and
I'll talk a little bit about that in a
second and we don't really have the
complementary skills the displacement
effect is gonna win out and we should
experience lower wages and lower
employment and that's what we are seeing
but it also should be added immediately
that the numbers here are not
apocalyptic we're not talking of
millions of people losing jobs so if you
take the numbers that I'm showing you
here it would imply that robots reduced
US employment by one third of a
percentage point so not trivial but
nothing relative to the huge decline in
employment in manufacturing for example
which is more than three percentage
points so during the same period so
we're not talking about the end of job
but we are talking powerful technologies
that may be pushing us in the direction
that we have to deal with these now if
this is the case where will jobs come
from well there are two scenarios there
are two views and I want to talk about
both of these views and these views
relate to what I just talked about the
complementarity issue one view is the
optimistic scenario which starts by
noting that automation is not a new
phenomenon we've been automating we've
been experiencing new technologies
throughout the ages but whereas
automation goes on we create
complementary tasks we find new ways in
which humans are useful we create new
things when the railroads
and replace the horse-drawn carriages we
create a whole host of new occupations
associated with the railroad engineers
conductors maintenance workers finance
tiers and managers in the same way that
when computers come came we created a
whole host of computerized radiology
computer engineers software developers
and and very different versions of many
of the tasks that were manual in advance
so if in this figure what you see is
that if you look at the past the last
the the three decades up to 2007 in the
United States a lot of the work about
half of the employment growth in the
u.s. comes from the creation of new
tasks on the horizontal axis you have
how much of new tasks there are embedded
in a new occupations and you see that
occupations that have more new tasks are
growing more rapidly so this is where
the lever that I talked about which is
creating complementary skills for
technologies is important because one
way in which we can do that is by
creating new tasks that are going to
generate high wage employment
opportunities but there is the
pessimistic view which is not crazy
either because that's very much informed
from the 2000s as you saw in the 2000s
we did not create was the industrial
robots were coming on and automation was
progressing very rapidly we did not
create many new tasks that were
high-paying instead we created a lot
more of these workers who are in food
preparation cleaning protection services
and low skill health healthcare perhaps
the future is going to be one in which
robots and I are gonna take all of the
high-skilled jobs and and then we're
gonna be left with with these jobs for a
very large fraction of the US population
that's a question about predicting the
future but it's also a question about
policy because I think the line that
demmer demarcates these two scenarios is
not a given one is one that depends on
what sorts of skills our workforce has
if our workforce has no skills that can
be in great demand in high wage jobs of
course they will have to go and work in
protection services on food preparation
but with a differently skilled workforce
the scenario could be very different but
a lot of this then comes down to how
much productivity we are generating from
these new technologies as I've already
noted several times if you are in the
world of disability replacing
technologies you need to fight the
displacement effect some degree with the
complementary skills but to a great
degree with these productivity effects
do we have those productivity effects
and here the picture in the popular
press and the discussions that you may
have followed on the web is even more
convenient confusing because on the one
hand there are economists and engineers
and a AI scientists who are predicting
the arrival of infinite wealth because
our machines are becoming so and so are
becoming so productive and for example
Kurzweil singularity pieces and many
other computer scientists and AI
specialists are predicting machines that
can produce machines and can do
everything so efficiently that we can
have the age of plenty on the other hand
we have people such as Robert Gordon who
created an unlikely bestseller last year
with a book that heralded the arrival of
low productivity growth in the next
several decades so which one is the case
well let's first of all look at the data
the data actually is more firmly on
Robert Gordon's side at least at first
sight
here is the productivity growth
multi-factor productivity growth how
much we are increasing our ability to
produce things for when you control for
labor and capital and that productivity
growth was indeed very rapid in the 30s
40s up all the way up to the 70s and
then look at what's going on in the age
of the AI computers and robotics it's
been much slower now people will say
well we're not measuring productivity
and so on and so forth and correctly and
there is some truth to that but a lot of
the problems with measurement applied to
the 50s and the 60s and the 70s also so
that's not a complete explanation so I
think what's going on is that we are
reliving what Bob saw
my colleague at MIT and one of the
founders of growth economics anticipated
in 1987 in a New York Review of Books he
said we can see the computer age
everywhere but in the productivity
statistics and at the time everybody
said this is a temporary phenomenon it's
gonna be another ten years and now it's
been 35 it's been 30 years since Bob
Solow wrote that and we still don't see
it as the previous picture shows so what
is going on the optimistic view is that
still this is temporary and we are
making it much much worse because we are
not counting Wikipedia we're not
counting all the services that Google
provides
and once you count them productivity is
not so bad and it's going to improve but
I think a much more relevant perspective
or at least the one that I would
subscribe is related to the issue of the
complementary skills that I have already
highlighted which is that we are facing
many bottlenecks new technologies
robotics AI require complementary skills
require other technological improvements
so that they can work very well they can
require organizational changes so
imagine your car for example in so many
ways it's superior to the cars that you
were driving thirty years ago but at the
end of the day you can drive it no
faster and it cannot get you from A to B
any faster in fact it will get you from
A to B much slower than you did thirty
years ago because traffic regulations
haven't changed roads are very congested
and there are actually parts of the car
that have not kept up with those
improvements such as tires or other
safety safety technologies that wouldn't
really stand you driving at hundred and
twenty miles an hour so all of those
widgets that have improved the internal
combustion engine and added to the car
they're not used to because there are
other bottlenecks and if you look at
history history really emphasizes the
importance of such bottlenecks and I
will just conclude with this brief
discussion of what the economic
historian Bob Allen has called angles
pose because if you want to compare our
age of wonderful brilliant mind-boggling
technologies that are coming from
corner - another one I think there is no
better candidate than the age of the
Industrial Revolution starting from 1760
in Britain and then later in other parts
of Western Europe you've had these waves
of technologies that people could not
even imagine and started a process of
changing automating improving production
processes all around in the economy and
changing people's lives but what
happened
well productivity growth was actually
pretty slow and for 90 years
there was no wage growth and Bob Allen
calls this angles post this is what
Frederick Engel was motivated by saying
there's not gonna be any wage growth it
lasted for 90 years how come these
wonderful technologies were changing
things so radically and we're not seeing
any wage growth well we can look at one
specific technology and one specific
occupation Weavers well what happened
with Weaver's well one thing what
happened is that when the first power
looms were introduced they did increase
productivity by several fold but at the
same time they also displaced Weaver's
from certain tasks and they were not
adopted in a way that was broad within
the whole economy so some companies made
the switch to the power loom some others
didn't and the demand for Weaver's did
not really increase it took another 50
years for the power loom to spread and
go through several more iterations so
that productivity now increased by 24
and it is only at that point that the
demand for textile workers increased
quite strongly and you start seeing some
wage growth so it really was the
culmination of the technological changes
that led to the whole industry changing
and many complementary technologies and
organizational improvements being made
at the same time but I think even this
understates the complexity of the task
of dealing with the arrival of new
technologies because while this was
happening the power loom was spreading
and was becoming more productive in the
weaving industry the there were many
many more more consequential changes
taking place in the British society for
example starting in eighteen
18:32 britain became a democracy or
started first steps towards democracy
and ultimately extending the suffrage
more and more to universal suffrage both
the men and women in the course of about
80 years in the in the the two decades
following 1832 universal education
started being introduced you labor
unions started negotiating wages in a
way that started protecting workers so
therefore there was a whole slew of
institutional changes that were adopted
and started being adapted to the
technological revolutions that the
British society was experiencing at the
end of the 18th and the beginning of the
19th century
so if looked at it that way we are very
much at the beginning of it and we are
at the very much at the beginning of it
without really having a map about how
the future should look like and I think
that's the most important lesson that I
want to underscore in closing these
remarks I think we are really very much
in the middle of some very
transformative changes and the way to
deal with these changes is to understand
them better to make knowledge-based
quantitatively sound assessments about
what they are doing and what they are
likely to do and change our own
investments our own policy positions and
our own institutions in a way that's
coherent with this picture thank you
very much
I'd now like to introduce Mike Moffat
Mike is a well known economist and
writer who has a special interest in
innovation and its impacts on society he
currently serves at the Government of
Canada first-ever chief innovation
fellow where he's tasked by the
government to advise on the design and
implementation of Canada's innovation
agenda
he's also an assistant professor in the
business economics and public policy
group at the Ivies Business School and
Mike will respond to their own talk and
then the two of them will have a
conversation on these black chairs
followed by a Q as an ace Mike thank you
very much thank you
well first of all thank you for having
me here it's a bit flattering and
humbling to be discussing economics with
one of my intellectual heroes
it's an event honoring one of my
intellectual heroes so so thank you and
thank you for walking us through this
historical context I think this is very
important that we often think of these
issues as being new but they're not
wholly new I mean we've been dealing
with these since ancient Greece as we
saw and I think that historical context
is important for policy makers as we try
and figure out how we should be
responding to these challenges so in my
role as chief innovation fellow there
are two things that keep me up at night
there are two things that I worry about
the first is what if our efforts are in
vain that we simply no matter what we
try to do we can't move the needle in an
innovation you know what happens if we
fail and we could fail because nothing
happens
or we could fail for a variety of other
reasons I'm reminded of a last year
Microsoft decided that it was going to
use machine learning to teach a bot how
to to chat like a teenage girl so they
decided to put this bot on Twitter the
next day the very next day The Telegraph
newspaper had the headline Microsoft
deletes teen girl AI after it became a
Hitler loving sex robot within 24 hours
so you know these things can sort of
blow up for a variety of reasons and I
think the first reason is don't put BOTS
on Twitter but the second thing that
keeps me up at night is what if our
efforts worked too well what if in fact
the Canada's innovation performance
takes off that we we make all the right
moves and Canada becomes very innovative
are we equipped as a country and as a
government to deal with those side
effects you know what happens if we
succeed and we know that there are great
deal benefits
overpotential at the benefits innovation
there are societal benefits health
benefits environmental benefits but
being an economist so I'm going to focus
on the economic benefits now mentioned
that you know there are a few ways to
generate economic growth the first way
is just through capital accumulation you
know more factories more machines more
equipment another way is to simply
increase the size of the labor force and
we we've done that over the last 40
years as we got more and more women into
into the labor force and larger numbers
but basically throwing more inputs into
the economy or we could figure out how
to produce more with the same seether
more widgets or more valuable widgets
with the same level of inputs in the
crude language of growth accounting we
call this total factor productivity or
multipad on the factor productivity
really most of most of that is
essentially innovation and that's how we
get sustained long-term economic growth
is through that type of innovation is
figuring out how to increase our total
factor productivity but that in so doing
we create economic rents or we create
economic profits that go beyond what's
needed to cover opportunity costs so you
know Shawn Peter talked about this quite
a deal and quite a lot in the 1940s but
these ideas I should go back at least to
Karl Marx if not not sooner the idea is
that when we create innovations we
create those economic rents through some
kind of creation of economic power
social and Peter talked about the fact
that you have an innovation it takes a
while for your competitors to figure out
how to duplicate you duplicate that so
that gives you some deal of market power
for a while or that market power could
come from regulations that could come
from intellectual property laws that you
know we give you know this temporary
market power in a way to compensate
innovators for those innovations and
recognize that innovation has a positive
stern ality so we've heard through the
talk the distributional effects that
innovation can have on employment
through both enabling technologies and
sustaining technologies but we also have
to think about the this issue of
economic rents or the economic gains
from innovation because those are going
to have distributional effects as well
and often they're positive they're not
necessarily something we need to be
afraid of innovation can increase the
demand for labor as we've seen in
certain cases it can lower the price of
goods it can it can generate more tax
revenues for governments to spend on
social programs and training however
those rents can also flow
disproportionately to the wealthy
whether to be owners of capital very
high skilled labor
you know c-level executives
well-connected workers or so on as well
economic rents could also flow to
landowners which we've seen in some of
our more innovative Geographic clusters
across North America like in Silicon
Valley so any government grappling with
innovation must also worry about those
distributional impacts must also worry
about how to make that innovation
inclusive in an economic sense in a
social sense in a health sense but also
in an ability to contribute to
innovation systems that are we allowing
everyone in our economy to be innovative
and to contribute to innovative
activities so that's where I'm going to
start our questions so we're going to
discuss for a few minutes and then we'll
open it up to the floor and get some of
your questions so I'm basically is this
my gonna be on that okay so I'm
basically going to get you to do my job
for me how do how do we deal with this
tension between the need to innovate you
know to generate total factor
productivity to generate economic growth
but also the need to be inclusive
I don't think anybody knows fully well
but I think generally the gains from
innovation accrue in two different ways
one is that once we have a new widget
and start using that that's going to
change profits it's going to change
wages and that's what I was talking
about in terms of enabling and replacing
technology I think there's a lot of
difficulty in dealing with these
technologies because many of them are of
this replacing nature
the second is which you have rightly
pointed out and I and admitted which is
that the people who create the
technologies are also getting for some
rents and that's very important in most
cases quantitatively it's smaller than
what it does to the entire production
process and that's why I had not put as
much emphasis on it but you're
absolutely right and in the age of
digital technologies sometimes it's
quite interval with with what's going on
so in some sense Google is both an
innovation company and it is producing
things such as art services
advertisement search products or other
information services so the two are not
easy to separate from each other and I
think in both cases there is no easy
formula to say we're going to make the
outcome of innovation in the inclusive
one precisely because we're not anymore
if we ever work in the land of enabling
technologies but if that's the case we
need to start thinking about policy as
an additional lever in order to increase
the shared nature of the prosperity that
new technologies bring and for that I
think we need to have a longer
conversation I don't know how much of it
I want to start it now but let me sort
of
mentioned sort of three elements and
some of those perhaps we can come back
later
the first one is we need to make sure
that these technologies are implemented
in the right way so that they improve
productivity so I advise I already
emphasized a lot of things flow from
productivity if we are not able to
implement the technologies because of
regulation because of absence of key
types of personnel that are necessary
because of monopolies that prevent them
then we're not going to get the
productivity benefits and we're going to
be hampered by for example in the
robotics area you know us is squeezed in
two ways and the same is perhaps true of
Canada you know as opposed to other
technologies in the digital era like the
ones represented by Facebook from Google
Microsoft and some of the hardware
technologies
u.s. is actually not a producer of
robotics so they are fairly behind in
the most advanced applications of
robotics but on the other hand they're
also using them in various different
ways that are creating pressure on labor
so so it's just a question of how do you
best exploit them and I think you need
to be for countries like Canada and the
United States you really need to be at
the forefront of these new technologies
including robotics the second is that
the point I made about complementary
skills if we have the complementary
skills to new technologies we both
softened blow of them because they're
going to have less of a displacing role
and we can then create wage growth for
the workers that have the complementary
skills but here and this is the one that
requires a bigger conversation is that
we really have no clue because I think
we haven't started having the inform
knowledge based discussion of what are
the skills that new technologies require
the United States and many other
countries are putting a lot of emphasis
on stem and I'm totally
we would dad that's my favorite subject
too but is it really the numeracy skills
that are in shortage when we look at the
rollout of the AI and robotics if the
workers on the factory floor of Ford and
GM had better numeracy skills they would
not have lost their jobs it's not clear
when it comes to AI it's even more
complex because many of the things that
a AI is going to do is going to require
some sort of an human agent to input
information and to market and customize
those products so that might require not
just numeracy skills but a whole host of
communication skills social skills and
various other things it might also
require very much adaptability and
flexibility things that our schooling
system is not very good at instilling in
the students so we need to start
measuring what are the complementary
skills and start having a conversation
about how to change our labor market
institutions including training systems
in order to enable workers if it's
possible at all before they are truly is
too late to make the transition to
having but more importantly for our
students to start investing in the right
sorts of skills and acquired of
flexibility adaptability and the
complementary skills but even that is
not enough there is no guarantee that
you know displacing the replacing
technologies are going to lift all both
if the only you invest in complementary
skills you also need to start thinking
more seriously about how can we do a
better job in terms of our fiscal system
and social safety net in order to
distribute the gains from from new
technologies and I think here we have
some sort of encouraging size that
people are discussing things like
universal basic income and other ways of
redistributing resources and I don't
think universal basic income is
necessarily a great idea but I think
having the conversation about a better
redistribution system is very much
necessary having a better discussion
about social safety net a social safety
net that's not only ensures people and
their children against adverse labor
income shocks but also prepares them for
being reintegrated into the labor market
I think I was a very important thing but
the tendency of course in many countries
is in the opposite direction and us
already has a very weak social safety
net and it is further cutting it down
and in many countries because of budget
deficits and fiscal squeeze those social
safety nets are in danger so I think
there needs to be a renewed discussion
of these issues in the in light of one
of the things that that innovation does
is lower transactions costs and we go
back to sort of the theory of the firm
what why do firms exist it's to lower
transactions I think part of what we're
seeing on sort of the gig economy and
this flexibility is you know perhaps we
don't need firms as much as we used to
because firms again we're a mechanism of
reducing transactions cost first of all
you see that big true and if so do we
need to rethink things like employment
insurance and just and you know job
training based on unemployment
given that the this wall between you
know you're either employed or
unemployed
might not be as distinct as it was 30 or
40 years ago it's very important and
clearly you know what people refer to as
the gig economy for instance as
exemplified by uber is changing the
employment picture and but it's making
the issue of job security and insurance
and no less relevant so I think we
definitely need to have a discussion on
that some of it is again regulatory in
nature you know what counts as the
employment contract and that's going to
have some implications but I think the
more important part is exactly like as
you've pointed out what's the role of
firms and I think here the puzzling
thing is in some sense
that when you think of many of the
technologies based on the internet and
the information age they are
democratizing in nature they open the
platform to many people and and and and
and they make they make transaction
costs lower so therefore many more
transactions could be could be carried
out but at the same time we have never
been as dominated by large firms as we
are at the moment so there is clearly
some amount of what economists call
increasing returns to scale that comes
from dominating information that is
making companies like Facebook Google
Microsoft much much more powerful than
any other company in the history of
humankind so I think one important issue
here is beyond the employment contract
we also may need to think about
regulations where does the competitive
advantage of many of these companies
come from it comes in part from their
technologies but also in large part from
their control of data so is it totally
fine for a company to collect data from
its users and use it in a proprietary
manner or is it the case that in the
same way that we shared many other
resources including rail lines some of
that data should be shared and I think
that's a discussion that that we haven't
started having yet well I see a lot of
people's heard a jumpring wanting to ask
questions so here's where we've got two
mics here and here so come on up if you
want to ask a question and if you don't
because I've got a lot let's go back to
the skill sign so this is I've got a
six-year-old in the two roles so this is
something I think about a lot of okay
what skills do they need because on the
one hand we do hear a lot of stems and
it's like okay well we want to have you
know kids be able to program these
robots and repair these robots and come
up with code but at the same time with
AI and machine learning you know I also
feel like we're getting to a point where
the the these machines may in a sense
become self-healing or one minute one
robot will be able to build the next
generation of robots so first of all is
the parents how do we figure out what
scale should we should be teaching our
kids but also as a school system as a
government
how do we deal with that not really
knowing what the skills of the future
are going to going on and I think I
think that's that's the key question and
and unfortunately I wish I had a much
better answer part of the reason why we
don't have a better answer to this is
because people haven't been asking this
question so we don't even have the data
set or the sort of measurement and the
experiments in order to answer it what
we know is that during this period in
which inequality has been increasing
because of partly because of new
technologies and and transformation of
the workplace we've had soft skills as
we measure in their various data sets
have actually become more and more
valuable so it's not true that during
this time period is the numeracy skills
that have become more rewarded and soft
skills have become less important in
fact if anything soft skills appear to
become to have become more important and
I think what that reflects is what's
going on in the median in the middle of
the wage distribution so clearly if your
children are very very if they have the
chance to be an engineer for Google or
our Facebook that's a great occupation
and they're probably gonna do much
better than anything you can do with
with just sort of the usual sort of
skills working with robots or computers
if you are very at the very top of the
hierarchy in terms of these stem
numeracy skills but for many of the
workers that are gonna make up the bulk
of the wage distribution that
disappearing middle that I was showing
you I think it's a combination of skills
but also it's the ability to deal with
change I think what's going to
characterise the future is they're much
more fluid labor market if you look at
the career of a typical worker in the US
and you said you know who who is the
median worker in the US for example
who's just in terms of how long he has
been in a job and what you the answer
you would have gone in 1980s is that the
typical worker has been in this job for
20 or 20 plus years he's been rising
within the hierarchy of a large company
the to the product that the company
produces don't change perhaps the
management changes there are some
reorganizations every now and then
but it's a relatively safe environment
that safety was valued because
what people sort of nature is and we did
not give them tools for dealing with
adversity or changing their what they're
doing in a very very frequent manner so
therefore that safety was valued even
more but if those sorts of jobs are
going to be more and more scarce in the
future then it becomes more imperative
that we provide the students or the
youth when they are students with the
sort of skills that are going to enable
them to be more adaptable in their prime
years excellent so we've got so we'll go
one two three so keep them short
no no statements you know do you know
order questions masquerades of
statements we have robots in the room
they will take you away if you go too
long and then my name is if anybody
gives you will work for the federal
government something I like to ask is
like yeah a vintage of your expertise in
economics trying to figure out is to
what extent modeling and trying to
predict the effect intelligence and
robotics to what extent would you say
there's somebody working in policy to
what extent should I rely on ask you
very frank on your predictions and
predicts predictions to various public
policy my name is Bryce amass I'm a
freelance journalist and I basically
would love to hear an expansion on why
the universal basic income or the reason
why you don't think it's not necessary
okay ubi
I completely understand right now
interested for example the Danish like
security model could be very interesting
in order to increase social security in
order to have a good living wage but
this is still thinking about social
inclusion of workers
I think only base true wage labor in a
society where this wage labor is
becoming well bit problematic is just
just a curve on the greater college
graduates yes it is increasing but it's
a pain in their self one of the main
factor of inequality right now is what
we call skill-biased technological
change so even with university education
you can end up with acquiring skills
that are just completely not relevant
anymore once you arrive on the labor
market and you end up with the losers
even if you have career in college
education so for me maybe not universal
basic income but having this discussion
how to delink income with wage for that
one that with labor productivity I think
is something absolutely important
question thank you for saying that
nature of the firm's is not only about
reducing transaction cost for me this is
pure nonsense the importance of business
power in place especially in a world you
mentioned in terms of power over control
of data yes absolutely but but when you
look at the regulatory capture right now
between politics and economics so
basically corporate interests being able
to do I'm here I'm here in the robots
I'm kind of scared in terms of the shape
of the corporate landscape emerging out
of this new
of Technology robotics and this
concentrate concentrations control
ization of information
thank you thank you those are great
questions let me I think the last two
are sort of very connected so let me
take those two last and then just
briefly respond to the first question I
think you know we don't have great
models that you can definitely trust in
fact that's what I was trying to
emphasize that if you took a model of
the labor market that you know seemed to
do a real relatively well for the 1970s
and the 1980s and applied to the data
for the 2000s it doesn't work very well
because the nature of technologies is
changing and our ability to know what
the future holds is of course hampered
by two things we don't know what future
technologies are going to be and we
don't know what their implications are
going to be so for example you know very
well publicized paper by to Oxford
academics Frey and Osbourne sort of
created these scores or probabilities or
which jobs are going to get automated
well that's entirely based on projecting
what we know in terms of technology
today well into the future which is very
very fraught and I think you're not
going to you're not going to want to
attach much confidence on such numbers
but even if those numbers were true what
their implications for labor wages
employment that's where you need the
economic modeling and and there are a
lot of uncertainties but the best we can
do is really look at what the sort of
research that I was quickly summarizing
look at types of technologies that are
representative as we representative as
we can be of what the future holds such
as robots or AI and look at what has
happened when they have been rolled out
and again let's know there's no
guarantee that the future will play out
exactly like that and and and my
discussion of the British Industrial
Revolution was exactly that that the
early implications of the power law were
very different and they're later
implications but there is no substitute
for really looking at the data and
trying
understand what the labor market is
going to do in response to these new
technological opportunities in terms of
universal basic income I think that's a
very important question as the debate
well worth having and and I'm not going
to say that universal basic income is
definitely a bad idea but what I suspect
is that there are two reasons why it is
not the best we can do and I think both
of those are important and need to be
debated and talked through more more
seriously and they relate to the second
question that was asked the first one is
that I think economists sometimes think
in a simplifying way that all we care
about is is income and and and and work
is something we do just to get income it
might even eat into leisure time and as
there's some degree to that that's
that's true but also for a vast majority
of people they define themselves through
their work so I think it is a very
dystopian world in which large numbers
of people stay at home and play video
games and just live on a universal basic
income I think it is a very dangerous
feature in the same way that it is very
difficult to get a country in which
nobody pays taxes say like in Saudi
Arabia but then you have to expect them
to be citizens that's not gonna work
very well it's gonna be also very
difficult where people don't do anything
productive what you expect them to do
citizens so that's why I think the more
optimistic scenario is one in which we
find a way of leveraging policy and
technology together to create jobs and I
think that goes to the question that the
sector the last question and that's
better than just providing a handout in
the form of a universal basic income and
then the second thing is that but I
don't doubt that we do need to
redistribute but when we need to
distribute I think universal basic
income is not an efficient way of doing
that because why should we be giving
universal basic income to Bill Gates and
Sergey Brin
I think the
taxes are expensive it's difficult to
raise taxes it's difficult to collect
taxes we should direct the resources to
the people who are in most need which is
the sort of the the driving force of the
classic social you know social safety
net which is that you find a way of in a
way to channel the resources to the
people who are most in need without
creating this incentive and I don't see
any reason for changing that big
trade-off and moving to an Universal
basic income we just need to find the
right way to redistribute and make the
redistribution generous enough that
people can bounce back from adversity
consequences that they will often suffer
fact well we'll take three more
questions one two three and again we'll
keep them
I think tight hi my name is Teresa troll
I work at the Canadian Museum of History
the program interpreter and hostess I'd
just like to point out or to observe
that the old and the new will always
coexist so there will be people engaged
in the nuit technologies and there will
be those who will maintain the older
knowledge base and both are valuable
there's nothing wrong with having
redundant technologies or maintaining
the knowledge of co-working by hand so
if you'd like to comment on those issues
okay
hi my name is Siddhartha Kumar my
question is how does government and
innovation work are they friends are
they I'd like to think so but I'm not an
unbiased observer okay because
innovation while I you know form like
this that show that the government is
encouraging but you know
when we see Ober and then City Hall is
always just laying about the new you
know changing the rules you know
automated car and all that so where does
government and is government innovative
enough to you know face those challenges
will be equipped to deal with them thank
you great question if you got to be
dictator for a day what is a one change
you would make in the u.s. a better year
than made okay well let me start with
the old and the new yes absolutely and I
think that is very important to note and
that's the reason why I don't believe
that robots are going to AI is going to
take away all of the jobs many many
things that humans do and will continue
to do and new ones that they will invent
will be outside the capabilities of
robots and and I don't I think some of
it is old you know by creating a piece
of art or counseling things that are
very much human base that are that have
been going for for centuries are going
to continue and in fact when I talked
about the productivity effect how are
you you know when you increase the
reduce the cost of autos you're going to
want to consume more of everything well
that actually acts off in a non neutral
way and that's what sometimes it's
called in an economics the ball mills
disease but it's actually not a disease
actually quite good thing and what most
disease refers to the fact that
productivity is not going to improve the
same every sector
so if healthcare does not have as much
productivity improvements or if
education does not have as much
productivity improvements as
manufacturing then the prices of those
things is going to increase and those
increased prices are going to attract
more labor in order to increase
quantities in those sectors so therefore
most disease even though the name says
disease it's actually quite a good thing
because it points out how we can create
employment in
relatively high value-added sectors in
an age when there are improvements in
the manufacturing sector about
government and innovation I think that's
a great question and the picture is a
very complex one if you look at many of
the important technologies of our
current age foundational work has been
done in conjunction sometimes with
direct support some live in direct
involvement of the government the
healthcare is the most obvious example
where pretty much no important
innovation has been without funding of
the government but the same is true for
the internet the same is true for
self-driving cars the same is true for
sensors so government's role is
absolutely central however it is also
important to bear in mind that
throughout most of humanity the state's
power has had a much more complex
relationship with innovation many
despots many dictators and some elected
governments have feared technology and
have not always been welcoming to it and
I think part of the reason why it's so
central so critical for us to have an
informed debate about AI and robotics is
because the the the worst case scenario
is not in my opinion that you know
robots are gonna come and destroy the
jobs but the worst case in our little
risk or destroyed work for everybody the
worst case scenario is that we are going
to destroy the robots and if you keep on
doing nothing exactly the same cycle as
we've had for globalization could happen
for robots which is that for
globalization for a long time we did not
make an effort to make the games shared
and that led to a huge populist
right-wing populists often but sometimes
left-wing populist rise that for example
brought brexit and worse brought trump
to power in the United States and now
many of those globalization sort of
treaties are being torn apart and there
are very worrying policy changes in
every dimension from climate to
international cooperation well if we do
the same for robots that we don't really
deal with their consequences I think the
chances that there could be a backlash
against technology is a real one and
we've experienced that throughout
history including during the Industrial
Revolution many times so I think that's
that's that's that's something that we
have to really take into account I think
if I were a dictator for one day I would
want to resign immediately because I
think the only way we can deal with the
problems that we have here is as a
society not with the dictatorial power
and one single individual I think it's
very difficult to make sort of the
democratic system work but I think how
that gives us hope there on pre comment
to end your discussion on good afternoon
my name is barb stylist and I'm the
current chair of the board of the
Canadian stitute for Advanced Research
and I did follow the very big shoes of
David dodge in whom this lecture that we
all participated in today's is named so
I do hope that all of you enjoyed it as
much as I did I think that we've all
learned a lot thank you to to Mike for
his leading us through his views and for
leading us in the in the quite vibrant
Q&amp;amp;A I think for those of you who don't
know see far we bring together about 400
of the world's best researchers Darren
and his girona and his colleagues and
they are from all over the world doing
equally fascinating work and we bring
them into networks that allow them to
share their insights and to build more
and more insights together so this very
secret sauce is creating world's world
knowledge that I think will better man
and you had a little bit of an insight
today and I think as the individual
researchers come together they learn
from one another and I think that's the
sort of catalytic nature of what we do
at CFR that will allow us to continue to
contribute to solving the world's
greatest problems if you'd like to know
more about CFR and stay in touch and to
find out what our fellows are doing I
think many of you will see our reach
magazine on your chairs I encourage you
to read it it tells you how to stay in
contact with us we are delighted to be
here in Ottawa we do events around the
world mainly in Canada though and mainly
in the main centers but it's a great
pleasure to have such an audience here
today I think it's a very diverse
audience from our nation's capital we're
all happy to be here on our country's
one hundred and fiftieth so thank you
for joining us at CFR's lecture in honor
of David dodge and I wish you the best
for the rest of the day thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
