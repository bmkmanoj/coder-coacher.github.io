there are certain questions that keep
science geeks lying awake at night like
what happened before the Big Bang can we
ever come up with one unified model for
physics and when will we finally find
those darn gravitational waves of course
that last question at least was finally
put to rest earlier this year physics
fans can sleep a little easier but the
question still remains what does it all
mean in you strip away the math and the
equations what does any of this tell us
about where we came from
does the cosmos reveal anything about
human nature
my next guest tackles these big
questions in his new book the big
picture on the origins of life meaning
and the universe itself Sean Carroll you
should know him by now he's been on
Science Friday quite a number of times
he's a theoretical physicist at
California Institute of Technology
author of the new book the big picture
welcome back John thanks IRA well why
did you decide to write this book well
in some sense this is a book that I've
been contemplating writing for my whole
life or at least for quite a fraction of
it I've always been one who believed
that physics is fun the big question to
questions of the ultimate nature of
reality are fun but it also is the same
universe that we're talking about when
we do philosophy or biology or
neuroscience all of these things have to
fit together somehow and so this is my
opportunity to see how that happens you
can you coined a term called poetic
naturalism at your perspective and how
physics science humanities nature
everything comes together is that what
you're talking about here poetic
naturalism yeah
naturalism is the idea that there's one
world the natural world and poetic
reminds us that there are many ways of
talking about the natural world so even
though the world is made of particles
and forces at the deep level of physics
it's okay to talk about tables and
chairs as real existing things even
though they're made of atoms and in the
same way it's okay to talk about human
beings making choices and judging things
right and wrong yeah you know when you
when you talk about where we all come
from people have a religious bent to
that did you include religion
this category well I think I talk about
it I am personally not religious so I
try to put forward naturalism as an
alternative that where you can really
understand and think about questions of
meaningfulness from a naturalistic
perspective and I'm very happy if that's
a conversation with people who come from
other perspectives yeah
one of the first ideas you learn about
in physics class is the Big Bang and you
say that the Big Bang is most likely not
even a real event well well I say is
that we don't have any idea what
happened to this purported moment of the
Big Bang cosmologists including some of
my best friends and even including me
sometimes exaggerate a little bit about
what it means we say the Big Bang was
the beginning of the universe talking
about what happened before the Big Bang
is like talking about what was north of
the North Pole but all of that is not
something we understand these are just
hypotheses these are speculations it's
very possible there was something before
the Big Bang so we should be a little
bit humble where we're saying what
exactly was it that went on at that
moment my friend Hoyles created that
term didn't he many years ago he did he
was trying to make fun of the Big Bang
idea of course the Big Bang model which
is really what Hoyle was making fun of
is the general idea that the universe
has been expanding from a hot dense
early state and that's 100% true that
we've established as correct but the Big
Bang event the moment the singularity at
the beginning is something we don't
understand so it's sort of it's sort of
a time as a reference time that we can
use exactly it's sort of the time at
which we no longer understand what the
universe was doing I'm not laughing at
you you are but I mean isn't that what
we're what what we think physics and
physicists are all about is
understanding what was going on then it
is but you know our understanding on the
basis of data and observations does
stretch back to one second after the Big
Bang right and we're now 13.8 billion
years after the Big Bang so we've got a
lot of it covered that that first second
we're still working on it is physics
then in trouble because we don't know
what happened then at that moment or
we're all
of other things that are going on in the
universe like dark energy do we need new
physics understanding physics is not in
trouble because there are still
interesting physics questions to be
asked that I mean physics would be in
trouble if we were done right that would
be that would be bad for the physics
departments we could all change into
engineering or biology departments so
physics is as healthy as you could
imagine a beating mm-hmm our number
eight four four seven two four eight two
five five you can also tweet us at
cipher is CIF RI if you're just joining
us we're talking with a Sean Carroll
author of the big picture on the origins
of life meaning and the universe itself
just just the title sean is like it's
outrageous isn't it outlandish how dare
anyone write all of these things so I I
hurry to point out even though I'm
writing about these topics I do not
actually say how life began how the
universe began or what the meaning of
life is I talk about how to talk about
them we don't know the answers to these
questions yet then we need all do we
need input from all different places
from all different ideas about life so I
think to understand this yeah I mean I
think they all fit together and thinking
about how they fit together is
illuminating and informative I'm very
quick to say if you want to be a good
biologist you don't need to study
particle physics that's not really very
helpful on the other hand if your theory
of biology is somehow incompatible with
what we know about particle physics then
that's a problem if there's an idea
called a core theory it has gravity
tacked on to the standard model can you
explain that a little bit yeah you know
again if you listen to popular
explanations of physics you'll often
hear it pointed out that we don't yet
have a complete theory of quantum
gravity that the rules of quantum
mechanics which are so successful in the
microscopic realm of atoms and particles
haven't yet been extended to include
gravity on the other hand what that
really means is that we don't understand
everything about quantum gravity we
don't understand the Big Bang or black
holes but we do actually understand
quantum gravity in weak gravitational
fields which includes the entire solar
system for that matter so there's no
problem and do
quantum gravity and including gravity in
our best theories of physics here in our
everyday lives let's go to the phones
some interesting questions let's go to
Gainesville Florida hi Joe welcome to
science Friday Joe why you're there
yes Hank go ahead yes I like that's what
does time play into this scenario and
how does infinity and our own mortality
make us think about physics all right
oh that's way we don't have nearly
enough time to answer these questions
you know time is important it certainly
exists and plays in a role in our
everyday lives in the evolution of the
universe we don't necessarily understand
what it is at a fundamental level you
mention infinity one of the things we
don't know is whether the universe lasts
for an infinite amount of time or a
finite amount of time but you also
mentioned our mortality one of the
things we do understand is our lives
lasts for a finite amount of time the
average human lifetime is 3 billion
heartbeats and that's not such a big
number I think that you know we should
take all of one of those every one of
those heartbeats to be a very special
thing I can swear I remember in a past
conversation you telling me that
physicists don't believe there is such a
thing as time no I never said that
you know certainly that I never said ok
people say it all the time and they make
fun of them for saying that so I think
there is time otherwise how would I have
known when to be here for this interview
well you know we were talking we were
talking a little bit earlier about
spooky action at a distance which is
which is another hair-curling idea and
the fact that how can - how can you have
two entangled particles knowing each
other is what they're doing and it's
because there's no distance or time
between them and some other dimension we
we don't know these are great questions
that we're thinking about right now I
mean time exists there's no question
about that but the question is does it
exists like in the same way that
electrons exist that they're really part
of the fundamental ingredients of
reality or does it exist like tables and
chairs exist so they're sort of useful
approximations in certain regimes
physicist John Wheeler I remember
and many years ago when I was a young
journalist talking about quantum
mechanics and he said that the reason
that the universe exists is that is
because we are here to observe it well
you know it's a free country people can
say whatever they want but the anthropic
principle I think it was that I think I
actually have a position that is even
less popular than that one which is that
there is no such thing as the reason the
universe exists I think that reasons why
certain things are true or false are
always relative to some context you know
the reason why I was tired this morning
is because I didn't have my cup of
coffee but the universe if the universe
is everything then there's no context in
which we find it and we might need to be
able to accept the idea that there isn't
any such thing as the reason why the
universe exists it just it just happens
to be here yeah just the kind of thing
that happens now and again mmm the
universe is physics really coming coming
up with a larger ideas about the natural
universe or is it really just mapping
out our own brain and consciousness well
yeah that's that's a dichotomy that
people sometimes put forward idealism
versus realism right is the world a
physical thing that is out there or is
it all just a projection of some ideas
or some thoughts I honestly I've tried
I've spent time I cannot wrap my brain
personally around what it would mean for
the universe to just be a thought or an
idea for me as a physicist who makes up
theories and compares them against the
data I like to think the real world
actually exists and do you think that
we're going to be able to unite gravity
and all the other forces and come up oh
yeah yeah there's no question yeah it
will happen hopefully sooner rather than
later we're working on it
and what's your opinion on string theory
has it run its course and this core
theory gonna take its place
oh no the core theory is sort of the
pedestrian part of quantum field theory
the part that we already understand the
part that has been established whereas
string theory is much more ambitious it
tries to answer that question I said we
don't have the answer to which is what
is the complete
theory of quantum gravity I think that
it's very possible that string theory is
not the complete theory but will help us
get there by giving us some pit pointers
some hints as to what direction to move
in you've really been in very ambitious
as you say in writing this book you've
reached into all different areas biology
metaphysics chemistry that really I'm
sure you had a go study up on were you a
little hesitant to branch out and I was
you know it was enormous fun doing the
research for this book because I got the
knock on people's doors and brilliant
people MacArthur prize winners Nobel
Prize winners were happy to talk to me
and I'm not an expert on chemistry
biology neuroscience philosophy any of
these things but then again I think that
probably nobody is an expert in the
world on all of these things all at once
so why not me is one way to look at it
okay let's go to the phones let's see if
we can go to Jeff in Plano Texas hi Jeff
welcome to science Friday
good afternoon thank you good talk to me
Sean and Ira I showed it was morning if
you've ever heard of and I'm probably
getting this wrong which Roger Penrose
so I'm sure you're familiar with once
stated something about the human mind
and its unique ability to be conscious
thought was what gave structure or maybe
just structure to the universe I guess
you could say I'm not in the grand scale
structure of galaxies and stuff but it
gave the existence to the universe to
you do you have more information on that
or is that something you're aware of
yeah I mean I'm aware of ideas like this
you for a long time one of the things
that we don't understand in physics is
the deep down rules of quantum mechanics
right we know that quantum mechanics
works at the microscopic level we can
put it to use we can make predictions
but there's still the question of what
is it fundamentally saying and for a
long time people were really taking
seriously the possibility that there was
some deep connection between quantum
mechanics and consciousness because part
of the textbook rules of quantum
mechanics put a special emphasis on what
happens when an observation occurs now
increasingly over the years that has
become less and less popular we figured
out how to deal with quantum mechanics
in more traditional ways that make no
special reference to the human observer
but there are still a few holdouts like
Roger Penrose probably the most
respectable and famous among them who
really think that you need consciousness
to explain quantum mechanics and
vice-versa quantum mechanics to explain
consciousness I think it's probably not
the way to go it's certainly declining
in popularity rather than gaining but
you know as long as you don't know the
answers all options are on the table I'm
IRA Plato this is science Friday from
PRI Public Radio International in case
you're just joining us we're talking
with John Carroll author of a great big
new book the big picture on the origins
of life meaning and the universe itself
it's it's gonna take a few more than a
couple of days to read this book and
then you're gonna want to read it again
because there's a lot of interesting
ideas in here what was the most
difficult part about writing this book
for you Sean oh that's a very good
question you know I think that there
there's two obvious answers one is that
there's chemistry in the book I don't
know anything about chemistry I mean I
know more about biology then I know
about chemistry and so it's like now I
know what an ATP molecule is and what a
fatty bilipid is and things like that so
you're having me oh yeah that was fun
and I I don't know if I'll still
remember it a year from now but I I knew
it when I was writing the book but the
other was you know there are people I
disagree with about deep issues about
the nature of reality and I wanted to
give them a fair shake in the book I
wanted to represent their own views
fairly rather than just sort of
caricature in what they believed so I
put a decent amount of effort into being
fair and getting straight how people
would have put forward their own views
and hope even though if I disagree with
them I hope they won't think that I'm
just making straw men out of their
positions physicist Frank will check ooh
very famous Nobel Prize winning
physicist talking about the core theory
said that in the future rather than
talking about physics in terms of energy
someday the laws of physics will be
rewritten in terms of information and
its transformation is everything just
information well everything is the
universe everything is the stuff the
universe is but maybe the best way to
talk about the universe is in terms of
its information contained in different
little part
in particular if you really believe that
quantum mechanics is the right
underlying theory of the world there's
this wonderful burgeoning growing field
of quantum information where we really
describe different parts of the universe
in terms of how much information about
one part is reflected in what's going on
in some other part that's the that's the
miracle of entanglement in the spooky
action at a distance I'm actually
working on finishing a paper right now
where we use ideas from quantum
information and mutual information
between different parts of the universe
to model quantum gravity in a simple way
so yeah I think that's one of the
possible ways things can go of course
we'll have to see how it happens is is
the quantum limited is there something
beyond quantum physics is it's a subset
of something we haven't discovered yet
well I don't know that would be great I
mean that's that's the kind of exciting
possibility that it's thrilling to think
about but right now there's literally no
indication from any experiment whether
thought experiment or real experiment
that something like that must be true so
we're free to think about it but as long
as nature is giving us zero guidance in
that direction the safe bet is just to
still work within the quantum mechanical
framework well it's a safe bet you're
gonna like the the book that Shawn has
written a big picture on the origins of
life meaning in the universe itself Sean
Carroll research professor in the
department of physics at California
Institute Caltech of Technology
well welcome and thanks for thanks for
coming on today always great to be here
thank you we have an excerpt of your
