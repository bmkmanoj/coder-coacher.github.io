coming along Scott's not the only one
who's been looking forward to this talk
I have been looking forward to give
giving this talk and I've been sort of
working toward giving this talk over a
couple of times over this year what I
want to do is I want to give you a real
tour of the past the present and the
future of virtual reality and I want to
show you how the story of virtual
reality is bound up intimately with the
other great transformation in technology
in our lifetime and I think that'll
become clear as I weave the story
threads we're going to start not in 1990
which is where I into the story but
we're actually going to start in 1968
with this gentleman
Ivan Sutherland now Ivan Sutherland
invented what we would think of as most
of interactive computing in the early
1960s but that wasn't good enough for
him and so by 1968 he had to invent
something that he called the ultimate
display that is the first instance of a
head-mounted display it had to use
mirrors because you only had cathode ray
tubes back then and so they had to be
mounted somewhere else and the images
had to be reflected into your eyes and
because head-tracking technology in 1968
was entirely mechanical there was an
apparatus that actually tracked you in
the room physically as you moved so that
this piece was called the sword of
Damocles because it hung above you as
you moved so this is 1968 but all of the
basic elements for what we would think
of as modern virtual reality are there
now a few months after Sutherland does
this and it'll be 48 years ago this
coming Friday something else happened
it's something that is known today and
here's a very simple invitation to the
event it's known today as the mother of
all demos if you've ever seen Steve Jobs
do an amazing demo or anyone else do an
amazing demo of Technology product every
one of them has its roots back in this
one event on Monday afternoon December
the 9th in 1968 a fall joint computer
conference where this man dr. Douglas
Engelbart
demonstrated some stuff he'd sort of
been working on in the lab let me give
you some idea of what he invented well
the first thing that he invented was the
first working hypertext system hypertext
linking things together on a computer
the web is a hypertext system so all the
senate hypertext systems including the
web begin in this moment and because you
had to be able to manipulate hypertext
on screen he invented the mouse to be
able to manipulate the text on screen so
that you could link everything together
now my feeling is that in fact in the 48
years since Douglas Engelbart all we've
been doing is commentary on this demo
all our computer science flows out of
this but what you can see is in 1968
what you have use were virtual reality
and the web in these embryonic forms
being born at the same moment and what
we will see flowing through to this day
and into the future is that they
continue to weave back and forth with
each other all right we come forward to
1985 so virtual reality as we think of
it is still a little bit more than 30
years old that Scott Fischer he was
working at NASA Ames in California
developing systems that would allow
Space Shuttle folks to be able to
practice operations before they actually
did them on flight and so he invented a
virtual reality system to be able to do
that and this has now all of what we
would think of as the modern aspects of
virtual reality head-tracking displays
3d sound and the data glove which was
invented by them as well so you could
track a person's hands just as you would
with a controller on a nut modern VR
system this goes along for a couple more
years and most of that technology gets
privatized by a company called V PL and
the founder of DPL is a man named Jaron
Lanier who's thought by many to be one
of the fathers of virtual reality this
was around the time I started hearing
about virtual reality and I read a very
long interview with Jaron in a magazine
called mondo 2000 that this was in
December 1990 so 26 years ago more or
less this
and there is one wine in that interview
that has stuck with me all of these
years because that line marks a
fundamental transformation point in my
own understanding in in my own career he
said look if you are is not the
television of the future
vor is the telephone of the future he
was putting his market down he said this
is a medium for human communication it
is not really a medium about
entertainment yes you can use it for
that but it's about connecting people
it's about making things happen when I
read that line I kind of lost my mind
because for the five years before that I
had been working in data communications
I had been working full-time making
these things I found that picture this
morning I can't believe it exists that's
called a net modem I was working at this
company called Sheba Corporation Sheba
did something that no one had ever done
before they made a device that made it
possible for you to dial into a network
now that sounds like something that's
pretty bog-standard today because we all
have slow broadband connections at home
but we have them but at this point the
idea that you could have a network at
work and dial in from home and access
the file server and printer oh my god
that was very exciting but this was my
daily work and I was thinking oh my
goodness we could make this we could
bring VR into the home we could make
consumer virtual reality systems and we
could connect them so that people would
be able to connect online and interact
virtually and so I quit my job and I
started a company which I named Ono
Sendai corporation out of William
Gibson's Neuromancer
it was chartered to be the networked
consumer virtual reality company it was
the first consumer virtual reality
company because at the time virtual
reality systems cost hundreds of
thousands of dollars we were trying to
make it cost about a twelve hundred
dollars about the price of an expensive
toy and what we needed to do is we
needed to think very carefully about how
to bring all of the costs down in
virtual reality so we started that by
working on the sensors the most
important sense
a virtual reality system is the sensor
that tracks the orientation of your head
so that when you're looking around in a
virtual world the image is following you
in a one-to-one coordination and it's
doing it nice and quick and the systems
to do that back in 1991 cost fifty
thousand dollars what you're looking at
is the patent that we had on our
solution to that problem that cost $1
there were a lot of other problems that
we had to solve on the way to consumer
VR and we got a little bit interrupted
because another small company came along
and said we're working on consumer VR
that small company was Sega and they
were doing a project that they called
the Virtua VR system it was going to
plug into the Sega Genesis known as the
Sega Master System here in Australia it
was going to run off the CD they were
going to be games on it it was going to
be networked and they absolutely needed
our sensor because it was one of the
core things that would make a VR system
cost not tens of thousands of dollars
but hundreds of dollars and we prototype
the system with them we prototype the
system hang on a minute because I'd
forgotten I have a prop that's the
prototype code that's a Genesis
cartridge I still have this 26 years
later we prototype the system and we
showed it off at the Consumer
Electronics Show in 1993 now what we
showed off at the Consumer Electronics
Show was essentially a miner's helmet
that with a lot of stuff guaranteed onto
it but it was shown in the middle of the
Sega booth and de Paris behind many
walls of security and as you got further
and further into the Sega booth the
booth got darker and darker and finally
you were in this dimly lit room and
you'd have the buyer from Target in and
the buyer from Walmart in and they put
that on and they'd lose their minds and
then they would order several hundred
thousand units for Christmas 1993 and it
never shipped because it turned out that
when they started to manufacture them
and they started to give them to kids
the kids
started to get sick because it turns out
that it's actually really easy to make
someone sick in VR and it's really hard
to give them a good experience when
you're running on an 8 megahertz
microprocessor which was not slow in
1993 but it wasn't speedy either so my
dreams of a consumer virtual reality
system or in some sense drowned in 1993
but that didn't end my work in virtual
reality because while I was working on
the hardware I was also working very
hard on the software because oh no
Sendai was a networked virtual reality
company and so part of my work was to
understand what would happen when you
have hundreds of thousands of people
inhabiting cyberspace at the same time
and the thing that I realized was
there's going to need to be a system a
protocol to be able to arbitrate who
owns what area of space because if you
have a meta verse someone's gonna be
able to say that's my property and
that's your property and you can have
fun over there and I can have fun over
here and I wrote all of that up with
this fellow
that's Tony Parisi he moved to San
Francisco just about this moment in time
this is aa stakin this year because
we're still quite good friends and it
became a very very productive
relationship because I took the work
that I've been doing in networking and
said to my friend Tony hey have you
heard of this crazy new thing called the
web it's a hypertext system and I think
I can take my work in virtual reality
and apply it to that he said ok let's
try it and so we sat down and we wrote
some code over a month and in February
1994 we got off the cyber banana this is
the first web VRML based image it's a
banana because I don't know how to model
I still don't know how to model but I
had a prebuilt model of a banana and if
you want to see it there's the URL so we
got the banana up and running and I I
then realize that in fact the folks in
the web world are very interested in
virtual reality and there's an open call
for anyone who's been doing work on the
web and VR am i right back and I get an
invitation to present a paper at a
little conference that they're having
and so I write up that paper there's the
paper paper the last so it talks about
protocol which I called cyberspace
protocol and it talks about using this
thing called virtual reality modeling
language as a way to be able to show
that the protocol is working it's just a
visualization layer it's just a little
bit of icing on the top to show that you
can actually share all of this space
among tens or hundreds of thousands of
people but what happens is everyone goes
oh my god you've got virtual reality on
the web and VRML becomes a huge thing
and this guy who asked me to write a
little paper and go to his conference
turns out to be Tim berners-lee father
of the web and we're off and running and
now virtual reality has got this weird
second life because of the web because
most of the rest of the VR world had
started to die off it had sued itself in
existence because people would have wars
with patents or the systems were simply
too expensive or the use cases were too
weird now let's talk about some of those
use cases I want to give you two
examples of the kind of virtual reality
we were doing 20 25 years ago the most
beautiful example I know of is something
called the nano manipulator the nano
manipulator is a VR system that is
connected to a scanning tunneling
electron microscope now an atomic force
microscope or STM is essentially a
really really really sharp pin I'm not
making this up running in a vacuum and
what happens is like a television beam
it scans across a surface as it scans
across a surface it can tell you where
the atoms are and it was connected to a
VR system so that it could actually draw
those atoms and it was connected to a
controller so that you could run your
hand across the surface of the atoms
that's fine for you and I but actually
when you give that to a chemist the
chemist starts to understand things
about material science that they could
not understand even when they could see
a photo micrograph of the atomic
structure so you have this relationship
now between the data that's being
presented and the interaction with that
data that is helping people learn things
this is a many hundred thousand dollar
system it was a research project it was
a beautiful thing but of course it
didn't really go far beyond that another
project that was incredible it's called
the virtual NY NSC so it could take all
of the information that was being thrown
at a trader through a Bloomberg terminal
which back at the time was just walls
and walls and walls of text and create a
big virtual environment and they found
that when you did this the trader would
be able to absorb information
approximately 5,000 times faster than
they could if they were using a
Bloomberg terminal I've created a little
chart to show you what that actually
looks like in practice
these were the promises for virtual
reality but again that system required
about a half a million dollars of
computing so even if you were a bond
trader that's probably a big ask and so
virtual reality kind of runs out of
steam at least it looks that way and we
go into what we would call The Empty
Quarter this is about 20 years with this
very little virtual reality taking place
but there are two things that are
happening all along that are keeping the
flame alive one of them is the video
game console because no sooner does VR
sort of fall over then the PlayStation
is released now you have to remember
before the PlayStation no one had ever
seen real-time 3d computer graphics
certainly not in the home real-time 3d
computer graphics are now completely
commonplace we have them everywhere in
the world and they start here when we
were doing all our work in VR real-time
3d computer graphics required a
supercomputer well this is what happened
to that supercomputer and we're now in
something like the fourth generation
with the PlayStation 4 so that's one
thing that happened then that happened
now that's Steve Jobs that is almost 10
years ago it'll be 10 years ago on the
7th of January that the iPhone is
introduced and I've spent a lot of time
analyzing this keynote he's going
through all the features there's only
two minutes of that entire demonstration
that actually matter and it's the two
minutes when he shows Mobile Safari
because the reason everyone in this room
has a smartphone now is because you now
have the web with you wherever you go so
you have access to the entire
information resource that we have spent
the last 20 years collaboratively
building and you have that all of the
time every we're remember how I said
there are threads and they weave and
there's been this interesting feedback
between graphics technology and
smartphone technology and Moore's Law
and it looks something like this so if
you want to think about that 20 year
period that's what Moore's law looks
like we had charted over 20 years but
that's what Moore's law looks like when
you chart it out over how to Raider
looks the systems that we have today are
a thousand times faster than the systems
that we were using when we were doing
our work in virtual reality a thousand
times more powerful and the penny drop
moment for virtual reality was this one
because all of a sudden two engineers at
Google walked up on stage and said hi
we've got $2 in cardboard and lenses and
we've just turned every smartphone in
the world into a virtual reality system
you know this is when the modern age of
virtual reality begins because this is
when we all collectively found out that
all of us already had VR so now it
becomes not a question you know whether
we're going to get VR it's now about
what we're going to do with it
but let's just sort of talk about what
the landscape looks like right now so
sort of this is the timeline there's
more than 10 million cardboards out
there really no one knows how many but
there's this more than 10 million
there's about two and a half million of
the gear of yours which is kind of a
fancy version of a cardboard probably
10,000 holo lenses they're still quite
expensive
it's an augmented reality system so it
mixes the real world I think this is
where things are eventually converging
we have the oculus rift which shipped at
least in part back in April and is
actually only shipping in the rest of
its parts on Tuesday which has been a
bit of a problem for them there's the
vibe and yes big shadow to the vibe I
love a vibe I have a vibe it's an
amazing system I think for professional
class of ER that's the system people
want and then 25 years after I tried to
make it happen on the 13th of October I
was able to go into JB hi-fi and pick up
my PlayStation VR and I now have a
high-end room scale virtual reality
system that is also
Zoomer toy so that for about a thousand
dollars now people can have very high
quality virtual reality experiences and
they've sold about three quarters of a
million of them so far and of course
just on the heels of that is the
daydream VR and remember what I said
this is sort of the full circle because
if the cardboard is the beginning of
that penny drop about every smartphone
being of your system well the daydream
is the completion of that promise but
there's another level here we have been
manufacturing smartphones for 10 years
that means that we have manufactured
billions and billions and billions of
components billions of sensors and
billions of displays all of these
systems are really just rearranged
smartphones is as if you took the pieces
of a smartphone and made them a little
bit differently and all of the modern VR
systems only exist because of smart
phones and smart phones only exists
because there's a web behind them so you
see how these threads sort of run
through so we have this an idea now then
we have this incredible capacity it's in
the palm of our hand we might slap it on
our head occasionally it's going back
and forth so we need to start asking
ourselves what are we going to do with
it we know after 20 years that the web
is about sharing knowledge we know that
every one of us has more access to
knowledge than we have ever had and we
have it more continuously now on any
topic we want because we have the web VR
is slightly different it's that but in a
different key because virtual reality is
really about the sharing of experience
it offers a visceral 'ti it's still
about sharing them note that they're
both still about sharing and that is a
key aspect because everything that we
have learned from the web about to share
about sharing can be imported if we
design it well into virtual reality
when we think about how your systems
work and we need to think about that
because we need to be methodical about
that I've come up with a bit of a system
that I'm calling sensual computing we
have decisions that we want to make we
need to identify the data that's
instrumental in helping us make those
decisions we can then visualize or
really sensual eyes that data because
remember virtual reality is more than
about your eyes it's also about your
ears it's about your hands and maybe
about other senses beyond that and then
it's about interactions and it's about
building a feedback between data
decisions visualizations and
interactions because that feedback is
where we learn it is the point where
experience happens now let me give you
some examples of how that works in
actual practice there's a wonderful app
for the HTC vive called soundstage now
if any of you are electronic musicians
you know that you can take all sorts of
fancy components and you can patch them
together while soundstage does this for
you in virtual reality you can take all
of these components and you can patch
them together so that you can start with
a sound or with a trigger or with a
keyboard with an amplifier and
click-click click-click
and these things can get very
complicated so you now start to have a
system for simulation that is fully
interactive so there is a one-to-one
between you doing something in your
physical body and noticing that there's
an effect associated with it that is an
environment for rapid learning that is
an environment that will help you
rapidly evolve some interesting solution
to the problem that you're looking for
this is the kind of concept that we need
to take and copy wholesale into other
kinds of problems where we're going now
I don't know if any of you recognize
this that's a visicalc visicalc is the
reason that you know about Apple today
it's the only reason because the Apple 2
didn't have a whole lot of reason until
visicalc with
and visicalc is the first spreadsheet
and VisiCalc
changed the way we thought about
computing and it also changed the way we
thought about money and the way we
thought about business and everything we
actually live in the age of the
spreadsheet we may not think about it
but so much of our lives is actually
formulated about the fact that it is
running on a spreadsheet that we can run
the numbers
that's a spreadsheet term that term
doesn't mean anything unless you have a
spreadsheet and so we're about to see
this happen again
but in the framework of virtual reality
and simulation so just as the
interactive age gave us the spreadsheet
the virtual age is going to give us
these wonderful in-depth simulations
that's one view of how the future looks
but if you take a look at that that
really looks an awful lot like a
spreadsheet that someone's just sort of
spread around themselves inside of
virtual reality there's nothing there
that's particularly affecting other than
there's a lot of data being displayed
but it sort of looks like it's on a
screen and that tells me that right now
no one knows anything and it's okay to
say that we don't know anything as long
as we're actually willing to admit that
no one knows anything because where we
are now isn't a point of time when we
can learn rapidly because we have tools
available that will help us learn
rapidly we now have the web now here's
something virtual reality is hard
we need to own that filmmaking is hard
and virtual reality is harder than
filmmaking it's a team process it
requires lots of input yes you can do
simple things fairly effectively but the
big productions the big statements are
going to take time and effort and we
don't have all of the answers yet but
what we do have now that we didn't have
in 1995 is we have each other we have
the five billion people who are on the
web every day now and they're all
sharing information and we can make this
happen if we make a commitment to learn
from each other as we do it and so
that's I think the core of what's
happening in sensual computing now it's
an opportunity for us to learn
about ourselves and to learn from each
other about how to present information
and knowledge and experience in a way
that allows us to be able to make
decisions about it and to bring it full
circle this is a new app you can get for
the vibe called nano one you remember
the Nano manipulator well this allows
folks to assemble molecules atom by atom
just pulling them out of the periodic
table and snapping them together and
creating new structures if I were
teaching chemistry today I'd be throwing
kids in this tell me what you learned
how did you do what happened because
this brings the experiential to
something that has been very theoretical
and this is the first of a new class of
tools that will essentially be
accessible to everyone to help us learn
better so mark you may ask that's all
very interesting but what are you going
to do with virtual reality and remember
I said there there are these threads and
they run together and they continue to
run together the web and VR they're kind
of true sides of the same story and
where I'm going with this is going to
really tie these threads together so you
may all remember I don't know if you
heard there was a little mobile game
that was released in July Pokemon go
which became the most rapidly adopted
mobile anything in history and there was
a certain weekend in the middle of July
and I had a friend visiting from America
and wherever we went because I was
showing my friend Sydney we saw people
playing Pokemon go it was almost magical
because it was sort of like everyone was
in this shared universe that wasn't
quite the universe we were in alongside
that I was very aware that there were
reports showing up in the media about
people playing Pokemon go perhaps in
places where they shouldn't be
for instance ash whit's which seems like
it's a bit of a problem
and something triggered in the back of
my mind I was like oh wait they're
actually using space you know
way that maybe they shouldn't be because
the space is maybe not appropriate but
the space has no way to be able to tell
them that it's not appropriate and
that's when I went wait a minute I
solved this problem 25 years ago and I
did but 25 years ago no one could
understand why I'd solve that problem
after Pokemon go I didn't have to
explain to anyone because it was plain
why I had solved that problem so I took
all of that work and I dusted it off and
I renamed a little bit because you got
to make everything new and shiny and I
created something called the mixed
reality service it's gonna get just a
little bit geeky for you folks there's
something on the internet called the
domain name service the domain name
service is the thing that turns a name
that you type into a browsers navigator
window amazon.com oz postcode conduct au
whatever it might be turns it into a
number of a specific machine on the
Internet so domain name service turns a
name into a number mixed reality service
does something analogous it turns
coordinates into a URL so wherever you
are in the world you can interrogate the
world to find out what the world wants
to say about itself
now Google already kind of does that
with Google Maps but that's all the
stuff that Google cares about which is
not a bad thing but it's incomplete the
world has more to say about itself and
say Google does and what we need to
support all of this is an internet scale
protocol that's very easy and very open
and very free so that anyone can use it
in any way they see fit because they
want space to speak for itself so in
October this was presented to the World
Wide Web Consortium as a prototype for a
spec it's currently going through the
entire process of discussing and it will
be a couple of years before it's
official but it's now on the way to
being able to be part of the structure
of what we need to support a world
well let me show you some of the uses
one of the things that you can do with
mixed reality service is you can put it
into a drone so that a drone knows
whether it's okay to fly over your
building or not or maybe it's okay to
fly over your building in the daytime
but not in the nighttime or perhaps
fireman pops up to a building that's on
fire and wants to get the hazmat
information for that building or perhaps
you're in front of a building that's
closed do you want to get the directory
and it's open hours or perhaps you're
playing a game and you want to know
whether you're allowed to play it here
and on and on and on because the world
can speak for itself it can provide that
information to you but here's the thing
we need this now we may be different
needed twenty-five years ago because we
have spent the last 25 years building a
global information resource and this is
where these threats come back together
again because what's going on is the web
is enormous but the web is walled off
from the real world as it turns out
virtual reality and mixed reality
provide the key to be able to knit the
web and the real world back together
again so the world of 2040 as we go
forward is a world where there isn't a
web at a real world there's an
experience a mixed reality experience of
both of them because the world has got
the capacity to talk for itself and we
have built the tools and the techniques
and the technology to be able to put
those together seamlessly in a way that
makes sense for us at that moment in
time so
some closing thoughts is VR addictive
there is only one possible answer for
that absolutely people talk about
getting lost inside of tilled brush for
hours there's that addiction if people
want to run away from reality we are
building the best possible way for them
to be able to do it and we need to be
conscious of that and we need to be
conscious of the fact that all of the
techniques that we've built into
advertising and gaming to hook people
along are amplified almost beyond
recognition inside of the AR and we have
a responsibility to acknowledge that and
maybe to design systems that lead away
from that can VR be liberating well I
think the answer there is possibly you
can put yourself in someone else's shoes
but it has been pointed out that that
doesn't necessarily mean it's going to
make you more empathetic I think we need
to question the axiom that VR is an
empathy machine it is an experience
machine it can be liberation but that
depends more on the person than it does
on the technology can VR reveal more of
the world to us can it reveal more of
who we are to ourselves
that's up to you folks this is our world
to create and the design decisions that
we make today and going forward shape
the capacities and the stories that we
can tell one of my favorite authors
China Mieville recently said in this
time because let's face it the world has
gotten very weird and more than a little
dark it is up to every one of us to
utopia as hard as we can we need to have
a vision and it's a positive vision for
the future and we need to make that
vision happen that's our job because
that's our legacy
that we will leave for the next 25 years
thank you good afternoon everybody thank
you for coming along Scott's not the
only one who's been looking forward to
this talk I have been looking forward to
give giving this talk and I've been sort
of working toward giving this talk over
a couple of times over this year what I
want to do is I want to give you a real
tour of the past the present and the
future of virtual reality and I want to
show you how the story of virtual
reality is bound up intimately with the
other great transformation in technology
in our lifetime and I think that'll
become clear</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
