listen I'm running out of time let me
get on to the Halloween stories yes the
hell are these to introduce releases you
should want the truth yes ok ok I saw is
actual videos that can opportunity
afterwards where the system is generated
you can get it to imagine thing
innovation spear imagine which is really
new you can give it to learn walking
until you see the system walking and
then just other unit observes walking
and you can accelerate it and then walk
around your screen in a natural way and
then you can get it to move between
different styles and walking so I could
actually move between walking sexy to
work walking and like a John Wayne
cowboy bar a little and then you can ask
it to do both at the same time and
actually comes up with some combination
of them the very very powerful
generative model and it's the same type
of system which also works for
recognition you can get your rig like
characters and we do image recognition
or concept of the things I could show
you this video helped you ok so so if we
evolve human level intelligence I I
think we can almost every scaled up to
be human and what we understand how to
do a machine that has well about human
level intelligence will probably better
understand so designers desirable
calculation X is very reasonable
we have no idea how you we really are in
the dark there is an institute simulator
densitometric intelligence studying this
problem
one of the cool balls has developed some
pro Friendly AI which is a very valuable
safety for humanity no matter how super
tells you now they don't really know how
to do that this is we deceive it it
looks like it's probably going to be
some phones or make some serious riskier
we don't know how system player with the
supply mister
so this is my Halloween scenario
I think in the only three twins we
should have ever flop the act that is
not radical you can build a desktop
machine today with a few of the latest
playing greatest card 1504 group of 15
years we should be a beautiful eyes in
fact even if we slow down our current
programs will be people losing some of
the center
um so better flops
oh I'm Peter Valentine mr. sparkles
available yes so this is one and it took
being here is after it calculations of
evil okay um are we can have powerful
now where this would be for equal work I
think we're already getting there I will
show you the video you can see documents
they do some doesn't preface to talk it
off like it's in the right sort of space
and algorithms and as the rightful
authority to and this is the career I
think this is a key thing to reduce down
the space the possibilities of
reinforcement we need to make a new
block so I put a question mark here I
don't know how it's going to progress
are we going to be at a point in 2020 20
where we can basically provide the same
type of functionality the context
provides for an AI autism we've made a
lot of progress in last ten years so I
think we looks like we're hitting that
reaching through them more if you've got
through his desktop machines with a
petaflop
you can make much bigger networks but
more importantly you can keep a lot more
ideas so all the students and I'm
talking about these Publishing's because
all your great student stuff give their
functions then I get super deep these
are these are the guys donation to drive
along private school they can run a
thousand times many experiments will
they go around a hundred times many
experience in 100 things that are a
hundred times of thing and so that
really speeds up research reject the
wait week to see a results anymore
you can run in different variations any
mirror an hour so you can trial content
that's I think this'll be to get a
speed-up there's quite a lot and we've
already made just the last five years as
we long for risky so I think it's
possible but I got a booty mug on there
also ball of them had a really good
people
if Whitney will stand next to you
hopefully brain reinforcement learning
that's gonna be no good we're worried
was great great progress they're the
people I speak to your speakers going to
be pretty lonesome and we even know
better algorithms than the ones the
brain system using because we could just
take a matrix with verses in the brain
finds it pretty hard so in case is a
workforce with all these things and do
the really good works right so we can
possibly probably do a key to the world
brain and this is the only tool 20 and
this I think is the basic architecture
for an AI you've got the performance to
do it even the powerful elements here
are the abstractions and you have the
underlying resource from the drive home
now I think the consequence of versus
will be many groups the nearly 2020 with
a brain like a gif which is artificial
general intelligence I think it's just a
natural consequence completely if any of
these groups has any significant success
they're going to be trying things on
suit which is free time it is an
inevitable print and it should be
exaflop super computer services one with
18 zeros after and this is a
conservative prediction if you look at
the supercomputer guys a lot of
predicting them safe top 500 of all they
are projecting an exaflop by 2019
what I think is going to happen right we
are already we already had two petaflops
teams petaflops has come in a year and
just about six months after that at 2010
Fox and IBM is already talking to two
groups about how to build with this
extra for fishing we already discussed a
little bit based on the toolkit friends
right so this is the idea that we're
going to he'd be here by the early 2020s
that makes your writing light okay so I
think that this is very reasonable
this is very reason building and effort
if these things are true than this
this is certainly very reasonable that
is very reasonable this is the question
though
what we figure out the algorithms to get
it very possible I don't large I suspect
we might but we're not going to have a
practical theory of freely a heart now
I've spoken to a bunch of people
including microvascular presidents or
single area soup none of them but I'll
be this one which is clicked but they
will have a practical theory of friendly
artificial intelligence in about unified
Norway when I talk to them they say well
we kind of base with is an take longer
than that it's not going to be 2024 for
things are getting crazy all arguing
here we are starting to understand as
almost saying we understand product port
Halla brain works because there will be
a lot of things we won't understand
anything but we're going to look at the
brains we're actually giving an
architecture for the system we know all
these different that's how I connect up
the basic algorithms that have been used
and in some cases quite exclusive in our
agreement so we give a blueprint for
building an artificial general
intelligence illusion quite quickly and
we're going to have to consider public
drivers so that's more Halloween
scenarios that in the early 2020s
we're going to get our Hardware even
have the Xbox in computer we're going to
possibly have the deep bleep mere words
this is a questionable but this is the
book exhibit ruin make the room the
whole thing are we going to get a little
this is a hot area of the money follow a
lot of people coming into this we just
had a big workshop of all time people
the world in against the union law
things happen again this this is this
list provides going to be some
so if this'll takes off we can have
people with bright light.i architectures
plugging the assistance of the extra
floor supercomputers and we have no one
you have dual economies and the VP
system start with maybe they're not that
dangerous maybe they're not gonna take
it a world during the credit but I have
to converge on the types of algorithms
believe that it really should be worried
about
we don't know what we're going to do
council girl it goes on yeah so what we
do about the size of a developer surface
for number two to number five oh yeah
right what can you do about it
you can't slow down this nothing mean
this is a massive global even I found
make the research on trend easy I was
like I don't think you can read speeds
up life is really hard when I assign
that you know they're not going to
develop them
does it go to criticism of their ability
or their to story for like this it's
really really hard
we have no idea how to solve this
problem I don't know if we can really
speed investor because I feel essay is
going to make it easier so you can make
other new programs in pop I mean really
and if you have a how to do this by
Halloween scenario and they tell the
world doubled over</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
