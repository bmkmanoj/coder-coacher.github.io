in this strange interview format as
someone I've talked to for 42 years a
long time so we're rehearsing all sorts
of things that have come up during that
period and I suppose my thought goes
immediately to time I mean you're
everything you've done seems to be like
defeating time in one way or another
being defeated by it normal well I don't
think so I think you've defeated it more
than this be for whatever exam I don't
know whether you remember my office
where I used to have a clock that went
backwards well that would be that would
be a good motif if we wanted one in the
background I think but certainly we're
thinking about second law of
thermodynamics and the mystery of time
direction and our consciousness and our
awareness of the past and so we can only
talk about the past unfortunately it's a
greater disadvantage we have but I was
thinking perhaps he would like to say
something about how your first
mathematical work in the perhaps in the
Cambridge Spanish I'm sure it started
earlier but at Cambridge in the 1950s it
seems to me that so much came out of
that and there are still some puzzles
for you then which are still very much
around now well I started off by doing
algebraic geometry in Cambridge as a
graduate student at st. John's College
and I think I I was misled into thinking
that algebraic geometry was geometrical
and I very soon learnt that it was
basically algebra where geometry was the
thing that I enjoyed and found I could
do most easily so one thing I did was to
develop a notation which will Hodge was
my supervisor originally and Michael
attea was one of the people contempor
the time which is rather terrifying
because I thought all graduate students
were like that and it took me a while to
learn that there was something
particular about Michael but I used to I
developed a notation initially sort of
to handle Hodges lectures because he
gave lectures on differential geometry
and he had these indices all over the
blackboard and it was not the easiest
his were not the easiest lectures to
follow and partly stimulated by that I
developed this notation where tensors
could be represented with blobs with
arms and legs and you can stick them
together to form contractions and so on
so it converted geometric algebraic
problems to do with tensors into
pictures which I could understand much
more easily well that's a whole motif
which I was going to ask you about later
in fact and I'm ways in which you
develop ways of seeing things on the
page and in one's mind that's quite
different from the usual way of formal
notation but also it just strikes me
that I mean you didn't follow the kind
of algebraic geometry of the notes more
abstract kind that's that's been so
enormous since that period I mean there
were tremendous things going on with the
abstraction of mathematics for you you
kept so a geometric viewpoint which must
been very unfashionable really in the
Cambridge of that period I think I was
very unfashionable although if you look
my thesis there's not a single diagram
in it but it was all done using I mean
there were diagrams because I did the
algebra by making these tensor pictures
and like drawing lines and having
notations for symmetries ations and
scoots image relations and things and
how you manipulated these things and
although it was very algebraic what I
was doing it was done in a very
geometrical way but I think this one of
the big things that was important in how
things developed with me was I developed
this general formalism of tensors which
went beyond the normal idea and you
could include things like negative
dimensional tensors
and these turned out to have relevance
to spin in quantum mechanics but one of
the things was I was very mystified by
spinners because they seemed to be
fractional things where you had a square
root of a vector or something like that
and I couldn't understand how you could
do that
and Dennis Sharma who was a great friend
of mine when I was in Cambridge quite
early on he sort of we've got made good
friends and he was a cosmologists who
was very much following the Cambridge
line at that time which was the steady
state model of cosmology was Bondi and
gold and Hoyle were all there these
being the originators of this idea and
Dennis was a strong follower of it which
I found very interesting and intriguing
and philosophically a satisfying picture
where the universe sort of was there all
the time it didn't have a beginning and
the expansion of the universe was
compensated by a new material which was
created continually which I had problems
with later because it was hard to see
how you could combine it with the rules
of general relativity and given the
choice between general relativity in the
steady state model I would go with
general relativity but my friendship
with Dennis was very important to me
because I learned a lot of physics from
him you see I was doing pure mathematics
as a graduate student but there were at
least three courses of lectures I went
to there are a lot of pure courses I
went to which were important to him he I
remember Philip halls courses Sean Sean
Wiley he gave a very nice course on
topology and things like that and but
then I also went to other things which
were not really evident the anything to
do with what my research project was one
of these being a very beautifully done
course by Bondi home in Bondi on
cosmology general relativity and
cosmology which was done with great
flare and
and a wonderful course and another
course equally brilliant in a completely
different way was Dirac's course on
quantum mechanics which was he was all
everything very logical and very
beautifully organized many of my
colleagues said oh well that's just the
same as this book you see so I said well
I hadn't read this book so the elegant
sufferer of what he done came out in
this lecture but it was also important
to me because for some reason I don't
know whether Denis had been talking to
him or or something I'm not quite sure
but but there was a it was a course on
standard quantum mechanics which was the
first term then the next term was to be
on quantum field theory and in this
course he took one week off to talk
about two component spinners and I had
been trying to understand from reading
various incomprehensible books about two
components minutes and they made no
sense to me at all but these I think
it's probably two lectures Dirac gave
and they were just perfect it became
completely clear the whole subject which
is a bit ironic because people think of
Dirac as a four components spin a man
but he in fact understood not only
understood about two component spinners
but he developed his the higher spin
versions of his own equation using this
formula zhim and it seemed to me it was
absolutely the right way to do it so
you've already mentioned I mean I'm
thinking that when I was at Cambridge it
was very much divided pure and applied
and people hardly talk to each other at
all I mean they in my time they're in
separate departments and you had as an
undergraduate you were supposed to
choose which you were and you just stuck
to it there was a real cultural
block there but you just ignored that oh
that's I think I ignored yes well well
Denis was all the time trying to get me
interested in physics he I had a
conversation earlier before I went to
Cambridge about the steady-state
wonderful lectures given by Fred Hoyle
which which there were some issues which
I couldn't quite make sense of and and I
got talking to Dennis who was a friend
of my brothers
I bother Oliver who was at Cambridge a
couple of or several years before me and
so we struck up a friendship with Dennis
at that point so he was trying to get me
to do physics all the time and get me
interested in physics and maybe convert
my subject to physics which I never did
because there were too many and there
was too much in the mathematics that I
was very much involved with an
interested in tensor systems in general
geometry ideas so on and a lot of these
ideas which I should have learnt then
you see one of them in particular was
about sheaf Co homology because well
they used to call them stacks in those
days the theory of stacks you see I
think stack still means something but at
that time is what became what called
Chiefs sheaves I suppose and I was
baffled by the whole thing and it was
only many many years later when when
Michel Lotito made all these things
clear but at the time I realised there
were things that would have been very
useful to me later on had I paid
adequate attention then what did your
was it William Hodge think of your
studying all these different things that
he does he aware I mean I just think too
many graduate students now they'd be
horrified by the idea of studying or
completely different courses not getting
going on publishing the papers of the
right number and though it's different
then but there was also extrange thing
about you see I started off with Hodge
and well there were two other students
one of them gave up quite early
another one was Michael huskin who went
through and did his PhD but then went
into history of science and the other
one was Michael attea and they were all
like that more or less and it was quite
because Hodge suggested at one point
well if he sensed I was a little unhappy
with the very algebraic problem that
he'd set me and so he said well you
might like to sitting in one of the
classes of another school
so that was I didn't understand a single
word of what was going on but that was
Michael Michael too you see and I think
later became very good friends with him
there was another course so I went to
when I was at Cambridge at the same sort
of time as when I went to de rax and
Bondi's course this was a course by a
logician called Steen and I went to that
which I also found it were very
influential and what happened to me
later on because I learnt about girls
theorem I'd vaguely heard about it
before and I find it rather disturbing
you say I think I would have prior to
going to Cambridge believe you know
we're all computers and that's what
thinking is computation or something I'm
mainly because I couldn't think of
anything else and girl or ceramide
vaguely heard of and it was sort of
touted to something which was showed
there were things in mathematics that
you couldn't prove and then when I went
to this teens course it made quite clear
that although you couldn't prove them
using some particular system the mere
fact that you trusted that system is
something you could give give reliable
derive reliable conclusions from that
mere belief in the system enabled you to
transcend the system and you could find
statements which had to be true on the
basis of your trust in the system even
though they you couldn't prove it using
the system so I found that very striking
did you even at that time have some
inkling that there should be some
connection with the physical description
of the brain and of matter generally I
think I did but it wasn't very well
formulated you see I think I probably
did as a result of Steen's course come
to the view because I learned about
Turing machines as well that was all
part of the course so Turing machines
and girdles theorem and the fact
therefore because of this understanding
that seems to transcend any particular
formal system that there must be
something else going on in the brain
which is not of a computational
character and I probably learned from
Dirac's course on quad
Kanaks there again there's a bit of an
irony because I remember the first
lecture I went to he had this little
piece of chalk I think he broke the
piece of talking to or something he's
talking about superpositions you know in
quantum mechanics what if we could do
one thing or another then you could have
super positions of the two and so he
said you could have a superposition of a
piece of chalk over here and over here
and my mind wandered at that point you
see and he I remember him saying
something about energy or something but
but I couldn't understand why this was
an explanation of anything I thought it
must be because my mind had wandered at
that point that I'd missed the point
but it worried me ever since and I think
I did formulates the idea that there was
a big gap in our understanding of the
world in quantum mechanics specifically
and that there probably was some link
between that and and what must be going
on in our conscious thinking but it was
pretty vague and it was only very much
later when I heard a radio talk when
Marvin Minsky and therebut redken were
talking from a very computationally
point of view and I could see well from
that perspective then you I see why
they're taking that view but it seemed
to me ridiculous to extrapolate to that
degree and this was what made me realize
that I had something to say on this
subject which seemed to be different
from what other people had been saying
so I had had the idea that in the very
remote future I would write some book
about trying to get people excited about
mathematics and physics but it didn't
really have a focus but then this thing
said well hush I'll try and describe my
ideas about what's going on in the mind
I suppose we should just in case people
may not be so familiar with the time
scale what we're talking about because
this really only what you're talking
about now was the work which came out in
the emperor's new mind I'm left ahead
yeah and in fact you started publishing
on this in the mid-80s and the book was
what yes
and browsers remind people that the
cosmological pictures you were studying
it from Dennis Sharma I mean it was
hardly hardly anything was known at all
then really it was just the really
comparatively local expansion of the
neighboring galaxies and well I think
people regarded cosmology as just
philosophy or something I mean there was
no reason to believe one thing or
another and it became but it was the
microwave background but that was only
later that was much later so when you
were introduced to it it was a very it
was not exactly a clean slate because
the Hubble expansion was known but
nothing like the detail that's right
today I'm afraid I am jumping around
here you're quite right
but that's just interesting because you
took up subjects who wish they and would
have been comparatively low proof and
the relativity as the subject was not I
was I mean Hermann Bondi put the new
modern ideas Von D was a big influence
yes he gave some radio talks were
extremely good very clear and he he
certainly influenced me a lot now and
put the subject but it was a very
physical way ahead of talking about
things but it was extremely clear I
think I learned a lot also from other
colleagues Felix Pirani in particular
there's somebody who mathematics of
relativity from so I think that's where
we can where you were able to put two of
these otherwise completely disparate
pieces knowledge together which is
understanding of the null geometry and
the spinor representation being relevant
to general relativity and how that was
that's that's something which came out
of the out of geometry and relativity
that yes I think of the order in which
these things I was certainly I got
interested in in the physics and you see
Denis was very he was he knew everything
that was going on in the world of
physics particularly cosmology and
astrophysics and that kind of thing but
he also was interested in the
foundations and we used to he used to
drive we sometimes would go to a
Stratford and go to plays you see
and he would drive in his fancy car you
see at great speed and as you went round
the corners at this great speed he was
seen now that's the action of the fixed
stars you see because he had this marks
principle idea was very strong with him
that somehow what determined the local
inertia was the distant stars and the
galaxies with a sort of marquee an idea
and and if you were wrote though rotated
Newton's rotating bucket you see it's
the reason it bulges at the edges
because the influence of the stars are
sort of pulling it round you see and we
used to have these discussions as we
would drive to or from Stratford and the
idea would be well suppose the stars or
the galaxies got rid of them one by one
they all what would happen to inertia
you see
and so I tended to take this to an
extreme so where you there's nothing
left at the car you see well then would
you feel anything you know that you just
the inertia would be according to this
view fixed by the car itself so I'd go
down say well expose you just had two
electrons you see then how do they know
how they're spinning or one electron you
see well one electron does it know which
way it's spinning or if you have two or
if you have several and so I started
thinking about individual spin systems
where you had no notion of direction it
was only what the total spin was when
they came together and you bring another
one in there's a spin go up or down what
are the rules you see and so I developed
this idea of spin networks from
basically from that idea I hadn't
realized that the spin networks or as
early as that and therefore related to
your well the negative dimensional
tensor and what's the diagram calculus
that you'd worked out that's right that
all that okay me on very early yes and
then you see the connection also between
the dimensionality so this was the thing
that intrigued me very much was how you
have with spin spin they take an
electron or spin 1/2 particle then it's
it's only got two ways it can spin you
see but how many have two ways when it's
got the whole sphere of directions well
that's because of quantum mechanics and
spin up and spin
and all the other spins are combinations
of them and then you see the array of
the complex combinations of two states
which is really a sphere and that's fear
gives you the directions in space well
there you have an intimate relationship
between the three dimensionality of
space and the complex numbers of quantum
mechanics and so this kind of struck me
as something deep in a way and then also
when I started thinking more about thee
I can't quite think of the order of this
relativity picture where you now have
the the light cone and you have the
directions along the light cone or if
you like the sky celestial sphere and
you have the different directions on the
different points on the sphere and then
again it becomes useful to represent
those points on the the Riemann sphere
the complex plane together with infinity
and that sphere is physically a very
natural way of thinking about the
directions in space yeah yes absolutely
you go out in dark night and you see
what we see the past anyway you see if
you a little bit of it but as in space
of course you have a better picture but
somehow thinking of that as as the
complex fear it was a very crucial way
of nailing down the space-time
dimensionality through space and one
time and only then do you get a light
cone which is a complex structure so you
headphone directs two spinners which is
completely contrary to most yeah most
eminent one people would think that he
was weighted to force force spin and the
gammas and everything and yet that gave
you an insight from from quantum
mechanics into space-time and relativity
yeah she's again not the direction one
would naturally think of no I just I
tended to go my own way I think I mean I
was always you see when I was at school
I remember particularly in Canada I was
in Canada during the war yes and I was
extremely slow
and you need my mathematics papers I
wouldn't get very good marks and one in
fact once I got moved down a class
because I was very bad at doing mental
arithmetic but there was a teacher we
had a great insightful teacher mr. stern
net I think he was called and he
realized that if I was given enough time
I might do rather well in the test you
see so he said all right we're going to
have a test today it's the whole usually
we just this this this period and you're
supposed to finish this but I'm gonna
let you have any as long as you like so
I would be working away the next period
would be a play period and people be
outside enjoying themselves I'd be still
plugging away occasionally I go on into
the one after that still working away at
this test and then I would do very well
I would get you know 998 percent what's
something on and it was a huge
difference I think the thing was that I
was not good at remembering things you
see you know Frank didn't have tables or
whatever it happened to be but if I had
enough information so I could work it
out each time you see so I think it was
something I always tried to work these
things out for myself of course that's
not much good if you're trying to do at
school exam but later on it kind of
served served its purpose so I had to
think this through these things on my
own terms rather than learning about
them from a book or whatever it was so I
would guess that if you put forward
these I mean put the particle physicists
of that period wouldn't have being very
interested in in whether is into
spinners or no oh the relationship of SL
to C and this kind of thing but and that
your direction went into into into
relativity but really you had a great
deal that was coming from quantum
mechanics as yes from classical geometry
yes and the background is that is that
quantum mechanics certainly was was a
big influence on me I mean like I don't
know exactly when I firmly thought well
some he's got to be a dun dun about
quantum mechanics that you have to
change the rules at some level I think I
felt that pretty early but I couldn't
put a date to that but nevertheless the
idea that the quantum features very
fundamentally at the level of small
things yes what and what point also it's
just understanding the importance of
null coordinates and the light rate and
the conformal structure and the metric
is secondary and the observation on the
moving sphere in 1959 was it's just such
a it's just a two-page yes working out
of that idea destroys a lot of talk
about people being squashed up when they
move in and there was that sir
and that was and that was not well I
write comes in your publications with
fairly it's it was before I you see I
went to America this was probably and I
went to America in 59 I guess me was in
1958 I went to the conference on general
15 gravitation in Rome or near Paris and
that was shortly after I had been
thinking about spinners and relativity
yeah I where Dennis Dennis Sharma again
you see he was very keen on getting
people together who he thought might
have something to say to each other and
I think I'm a variety 55 was the first
general relativity conference and 58
must have been the second is that I mean
it's very early days yes the first one
was from these Chapel Hill I can't
remember there were there were two and I
can't remember scald the first one I see
Chapel Hill was one and Paris was the
second it wouldn't be a second
comparatively small body of people there
were a lot of people I got to know well
and knew them later on
dead Neumann lots of people it was a big
influence on me but it was important to
me because well I just let me just
backtrack a little bit it would have
been 57 probably I'm not quite sure of
the date but Dennis persuaded me to go
down to King's College London
David Finklestein was giving a talk
about the Swart solution and getting rid
of the singularity or some he said well
that sounds interesting it I wasn't
working on general relativity really
then see I was thinking about these
spinners and so on and he gave a talk
where he showed how you could extend the
Schwarzschild solution to within the
horizon but we now call horizon the
people used to think of the Schwarz of
singularity and he did it in one past in
the future and then showed how to stick
weaves together into what was now called
the cross call extension and this made a
big impression on me but it was chronic
kind of curious because Finkelstein at
that time was his main interest of
generality in mind was in spinners and
playing around things in the small and
quantum mechanics and so on and we in a
certain sense or combinatorial I was
doing spin networks and so I explained
to him about spin networks and he from
then on went on and did combinatorial
things and I picked up and did general
relativity after that so we sort of
swapped roles but I can see how about
word had such little sorts of things he
needs the now coordinates to do that
well it was it was you see there was the
history of it was sort of like this I
meant a lecture and I was very impressed
by how you got rid of this so-called
structural singularity but you still
have this thing out here in the middle
yes so I thought somehow IQ pushed it
from one place but it's still there so I
began to think is there a general
argument to show that singularities have
to be there no I had no mechanism no
nothing to try and tackle this problem
the only thing I had which I'd been
studying with a spinners so I thought
well let me just see how spinners work
to try and describe relativity so then I
did that and I looked at the viral thing
and and it all kind of came out so
beautifully and the viol curvature being
totally symmetric spin there and all
this stuff this was and no one else has
done that felix Pirani did things was
that it was Lou Witten it was his father
who had I didn't know about it
Felix fear I only mentioned there was
this paper by luetin where he had
actually applied
and looked at the inverse there were
some things which weren't quite right in
the paper I looked at it and corrected
that and and did some other things that
he hadn't liked the canonical
representation into four principal
directions and so on and all that stuff
but somehow it all fitted together in a
much more beautiful way than I had
thought and it was as much that as as
David Finkelstein his lecture I think
which dragged me into into studying
general service in a serious way I'd
been interested in it before that I
first interests curiously enough I first
encounter with general relativity apart
from my brother Oliver it's vaguely
describing it to me was a little bit by
Schrodinger it's base time structure
which is really nice little book apart
from the last chapter he goes on to it
and fund the ideas but most of it was a
very beautiful explanation of the tensor
calculus and so on so I learned about
that even for I went to Cambridge but
then picking up things from Felix
Bharani and and Dennis and and so I and
then I went to the Royal Mark conference
which was in 58 yes that's what you say
I think and Dennis very generously he
was one of the he was one of the
principal speakers at this meeting he
said well look I've got an hour's talk
given bit I've got you have half my time
I thought that was extremely generous of
him so I gave my little talk on the on
the spinners I figured with an hour and
half an hour whether it's 40 40 minutes
and I had 20 minutes I cannot remember
it was a rather hurried little talk on
showing how you just translate these
tensor quantities into spinners and how
beautifully it fit in with what did the
ideas of general tivity that was
actually motivated by what became the
singularity theorems and yeah
mid-sixties that was before you'd
actually I mean this was before we
really started on yes well I published
the thing on that on the spinners yes
which is 1960 but then it was more I
went to Princeton I
in two years well a year and a half in
Princeton and Syracuse and I got
influenced by John Wheeler I think on
the idea that you have what may have
been a little after that yes I think it
was that they there was a conference in
Warsaw where I that's where I started
talking about conformal infinity and I
think then in the in the mid 60s early
60s it became clear from the
observations by Martin Schmidt that
there were those were the first
observations of quasars and I remember
wheeler getting very excited about this
and saying look this tells us there are
objects which are really down to the
scale of their shrapnel singularity
before we always used to think oh well
this shot shot so-called singularity
this tiny little thing wouldn't any real
that relevance the physical whatsoever
but here it became clear that there was
something funny was going on where you
really had things which varied they were
they must be sufficiently big because
they're this energetic and they must be
sufficiently small because they varied
within weeks or days of weeks or
something so they can't be too big and
therefore they must be of the sort of
size or that their Schwarzschild radius
was that was what we now call a black
hole and named black hole and emerged at
that stage but wheeler was very
interested in this idea about where the
singularities were generic or not we're
aware of the I mean are you aware of
Oppenheimer's yes 39 yes well this was
something that we were very made a big
point you see with all the various
papers that Oppenheimer was involved in
particularly the Oppenheimer schneider
paper ways just before the war where you
have this collapse very artificial
material sort of dusts and very
artificial and it was exactly
symmetrical and and then he had this
model thick collapsing to a point but it
was regarded by many people as highly
artificial these idealizations wouldn't
apply generally particularly because the
Russians
these were licious and collecting
seemed to have proved that the
singularities were a very special thing
and they would not occur generally now
I'd sort of seen a little bit about
their proof and I couldn't imagine you
could really prove something like this
the way they were doing it so I started
trying to think about this and in other
ways geometrically kind of visualizing
what it would be like inside collapsing
star and trying to convincing myself it
had to be a non-local argument that you
wouldn't be able to prove anything from
purely local considerations and then
there was this idea about what's called
a trapped surface which came about in a
rather curious way well I was talking to
yeah I have a Robinson I was at at that
time I was in backbit College in London
and I've a robe ensign who was a friend
of mine I learned a lot of things about
spinners and self deal things and so on
which became important later in Twista
theory and he was talking about
something completely different politics
probably and and we came to a street and
across the street and conversation
stopped then and then we got to the
other side he started talking again you
see and then when he went he went around
home you see when Murray was going now I
remember thinking at the end of this a
feeling of elation and I couldn't
pinpoint it now why am I feeling like
this you see so I went back to all the
things I've been thinking of during the
day and then I remembered crossing the
street and when I was halfway across the
street a thought occurred to me and this
was evidently this characterization of
of a collapse what we call a trapped
surface that this characterization which
was a global condition and it would
tells you that this star has reached a
point of no return and so when that I
realized that idea I then developed a
pretty well the same day ruff-ruff doubt
a proof that you had to get
singularities but the that's misleading
in the sense that the techniques were
things that I had developed a bit
earlier partly although never published
as an argument going back to the steady
state level because I was interested in
steady state but I also interested in
general relativity and I was trying to
see is it possible that you can have
something like steady state consistent
with general relativity if it was in
exactly symmetrical case you could see
that big problems of energy but if it's
irregular maybe you get away with it but
then I developed an Ag mix it with these
cones and focusing and so on to realize
that there wouldn't help that you would
still be in trouble
I never published that but there was an
argument in the which another thing in
the Royal Society I had to try and prove
something about asymptotics which I
wasted a lot of time but I developed
these techniques I thought I was wasting
a lot of time develop the techniques
which became just what were needed in
the case of the collapsing those ideas
in differential geometry in topology
which you needed there were developed
for the problem of the 50s yes state
which was where she was blast I mean
soon as the Big Bang was just the things
for black holes which were a fantasy in
this in the 50s yeah but so very far
from fantasy no I mean no that's right
well it was purely as how that how the
thing about because the first I went a
lot of the early boredom called the
Texas conferences on relativistic
astrophysics and I went to the first one
which was a lot of the stuff about the
the quasars these these things that Mars
Martin Schmidt had seen and wheeler was
so excited about and so on and and Roy
Kerr at that point had found that the a
solution known as the Kerr solution
which is can be interpreted as a
rotating black hole it wasn't totally
clear at that stage that you could
interpret it that way but this did
become clear and knowledge of these
things was important and in what I did
at that stage they show that you had to
get singularities and extremely general
segments so it's it's no no symmetry
assumed no particular equations of stage
you didn't have to assume the dust that
that Oppenheimer and Schneider had you
could have quite general material as
long as you didn't violate energy energy
positivity here so the obvious thing in
the late sixties was to go completely
into the new realm of general relativity
it's opened up by modern astronomy and
cosmology and was it you do
II started thinking about elementary
particle physics the same time yes yes
it was well yeah they were definitely
the same time but you see these were
things that were nagging at me for a
long time I just couldn't I have to give
an angle but cooking a lot of credit
here because on my earlier trip to the
this is the first trip to the States
where I I went after two first to work
with John wheeler in Princeton and then
I went to Syracuse and I shared an
office with angle that shocking and he
kept on talking about conformal Maps and
the importance of conformal
transformations and how Maxwell's
equations were invariant and for what
reason I wasn't sure at that time but
another thing he stressed was the
importance in quantum field theory of
the notion of positive frequency and
these things stuck with me and they were
very important in the development of
Twister theory partly the conformal
staff to to represent radiation by
squashing infinity down making a
conformal boundary just base time that
was one of the ideas but the idea of the
positive frequency was very crucial to
tricity I remember I made a a new I
wanted some kind of geometry which was
complex in some fundamental way but it
was really trying to describe the world
as we know it as well and had to try and
bring quantum theory in and I made a
huge table with all sorts of topics and
arrows going between them and things
like this and and but the angle burt
thing about the pasta frequency which
nobody in in quantum field theory tends
to stress that at that time it was not i
think they think of it like physics this
is
very very analysis yes so then it's sort
of trivial it's just plus or not I think
it was the combination and
yes of the flurry analysis and the fact
that if conformal things were important
for analysis is not appropriate because
it's not even formally variant
nevertheless the fact that you're
choosing positive frequency as opposed
to negative is confirming event and this
idea of extending so you have your
Riemann sphere again you've got your
function on the equator a real valued
function that's the real numbers on the
equator and then if you can extend your
function into the holomorphic Li into
the north or the south
this gives you positive or negative
frequency now for that's such a
beautiful idea can that be extended in
some global way to the whole of space
time and this was nagging me you see and
I wanted something where you see if you
complexify you don't have splitting into
two halves you see this Riemann sphere
you complexify that circle you've got
the Riemann sphere that's the real part
splits it into two halves and ticket are
they positive and the negative
frequencies or maybe I think it's
negative and positive but never mind and
so I kept thinking well what about
Minkowski space what are you complexify
it doesn't spit anything into two halves
you see but then I remember being driven
from it I think was shortly after the
Kennedy assassination I was in America
you seen that and in in Austin Texas and
the family is respective families this
was the Rindler Santosh parts had gone
down to San Antonio I can't remember
where it was exactly and in the car back
I was pitch-dark was driving me and he's
not very talkative so it's a lot of
silence you see and I began thinking
about this thing that I've a Robinson
had about how you can take a light ray
and somehow push it into the complex and
then you get these funny solutions of
the Maxwell equations which are non
singular and twisting and so I tried to
understand what was going on and then I
realized that these things about the
Clifford parallels
I can't quite remember there I realized
that the yes that the these solutions of
the Maxwell equations must have been
Nile directions along with these
Clifford parallels I vaguely knew I knew
about the Clifford perils already but
the fact that this is what you got I
realize this must be what you got this
configuration so this the twisting of
the lines around these tour in nested
tour I and that configuration which I
sort of known about from the Clifford
parallels when I got home I just
translated all into two components
spinners and it kind of dropped out and
that was twister twister theory and and
then you see you had the two the thing
was split into two half sort of metal
you heard that the real the space of the
light rays and then sort of mild
complexification into these two halves
the right-handed ones and the
left-handed ones and that this was the
analog of the splitting of the Riemann
sphere into two halves it took a long
time before realizing how it really was
that so it was because it needed the
comala G but it's so striking I mean now
the twister variables are used by
physicists but they sends a call it's a
half Fourier transform and I think it's
a completely linear way really nothing
like this geometric characterization and
yet we're going to get away from doing
everything in Mycoskie space we really
need to have some picture of what a
particle is an antiparticle is and so on
which doesn't depend on I mean I don't
know if you we may be coming on to this
really is there are things of that
period which you're worried about which
i think is still very open well it's
very interesting I mean and as you know
we had this group developing ideas of
twister theory and these meetings every
Friday pretty well and discussions
fairly broad ranging discussions on
fares topics and then you almost
single-handedly developed these ideas
are twisted diagrams and and and I will
always admired you how much you you know
you you felt this was a thing to do
you stuck with it well they were your
diagrams but I kept them alive until it
wasn't signed with other people's I was
I'm thinking this you've always wondered
about what a wavefunction really really
is yes and a lot of people don't worry
about this they just write down the
formalism of quantum mechanics yes
linear and so forth but do you like
things that we can see in a sense I mean
I think yeah seeing is is very important
to all you do whether it's the notation
or just the business of light or the
action of consciousness and seeing the
truth of her girdle statement I mean
this is something very important and I
feel you don't think we we can see you
on a wave function is that what I always
worried about people saying oh well
quantum mechanics just tell his pictures
are no use any more sort of fancy just
calculate them and forget about the
pictures but I never was happy with that
I wouldn't wanted to try and picture
anything I could certainly with spin
ideas were spin and so on but sure seem
to be very important to develop the
geometrical ideas as far as one could
but there are certain very odd things
about quantum mechanics well I think as
I wrote in one of my book that shadows
is a mind like their quantum mechanics
has two kinds of mystery I think people
tend to confuse them so the ones I call
the the Zen mysteries which are the
puzzle mysteries which are things which
are true of the world and baffling that
you can understand them I mean we it's
not quite the way we used to think the
world was like spin doesn't behave like
a little cricket ball or something
spinning around a well-defined axis is
something much more subtle going on but
it can be understood and it's consistent
and it makes sense
it makes beautiful sense often and there
are there's the ex mysteries ex ones
were the ones which were paradoxes and
like Schrodinger's cat so you have
quantum mechanics tells you without a
very difficult experiment although not
so nice on the cat you couldn't put it
into a superposition of being dead and
alive and so Schrodinger was basically
showing or look this is what my
shredding shredding this equation is
telling you you
could have is this cat which is dead and
alive at the same time that's nonsense
you don't see cats like that so although
he never quite put it like that it
seemed to me he was saying look there's
something missing there's something in
the theory which is not adequate and
Einstein felt the same way and Dirac is
in that because that's one reason I was
interested to hear it but he was very he
got more you could see on the web there
are some lectures there anyway
explicitly says this and III I have
trouble finding the original quotes that
because I know there are some quotes
which he quite clearly says that the
theory well yes it says in the Bohr
Einstein debates he says well you know
Bohr is normally thought of to have one
these and I think maybe time will tell
what Einstein perhaps did you get that
skepticism from him no right no that
wasn't a feature of what he was a very
reluctant I think to express his in
their opinions you very hard I had a
curious experience once I was asked by
the philosophy department at Boston
University see philosophers like to have
you know talk given by somebody and then
there will be somebody to contradicting
or sizing you see so he they asked me if
I'd like do this you see who was I
supposed to contradict well I think
they'd heard about Dirac commented about
how projective geometry had been useful
in his thinking you see so they had him
and rationally I said oh well okay I'll
make some comment come you can't refute
that because that's absolutely yes so he
gave this talk she directed his talk and
it wasn't very elegantly put during
talk on projective geometry just some
projects don't know physics no read no
influence on his own thinking or
anything it was just a talk on
projective geometry so I'm afraid I
slightly made well I think some of the
owners were hoping you might reveal some
of you in a thinking and then I gave a
little talk since took a leaf out of his
book and gave a little talk on Twista
theory did my version of
- geometry physics but that was slightly
curious but well projective geometry had
a big influence on me because oh yes
actually that's backtracking a bit but
but that really would have seen an
old-fashioned subject in there ya know
time it's something that Victorian yes I
mean that people just dropped out of the
syllabus by that time I think almost all
unit here I just caught it you see we I
went to when I was at University College
London that's where did my undergraduate
work there was in fact geometry was
quite a big part of the syllabus you had
applied mathematics you had sort of
algebra no you prime mathematics
analysis and then algebra and geometry I
think it's like that but the geometry
was significant part of that and there
was a no guy whole ren TL ren who was a
very great purist he started off you
know there were just two axioms you know
anything there's a line through any two
points and if there's a line through
these two points and through these and
it meets their the needs to meet here
thank you
how much could you prove from that you
see occasionally you need another axiom
of it later on but but that kind of like
know everybody I hated it but I rather
liked the course you see I I thought it
was very nice to see these kind of very
primitive ideas developing into a
geometry so there was some projective
geometry which I learnt there which was
quite important my own understandings
here well you brought it back endurance
contest yes and I was just thinking that
it did come from their own experience in
a way it was quite unusual yes so it was
just got caught the tail end of it well
I think there was an
there was another gentleman who came in
after but then it kind of faded away and
got an almost removed from the syllabus
completely and then it swung back a bit
but but it was considered to be
unfashionable and even when you did what
was called algebraic geometry there was
very little geometry and sense and what
you could actually see in it so I didn't
take to that too well although I tried
to put as much in as I could but a lot
of it was translated out when I
translated my diagrams into into some
incomprehensible notation which is I'm
afraid what my thesis in that ended a
path but the geometry was always
important to me but it sort of meant
more into the physics like geometry of
quantum mechanics and relativity
well Roger we've talked about how in the
early days you started thinking about
cosmology when people really knew
absolutely nothing about cosmology at
all there was hardly anything about the
Stars that people would see now it's
completely different there's absolutely
absolutely gigantic amounts of data huge
numbers of people poring over than every
way how but you I think would feel as
some quite fundamental things haven't
really been answered at all I mean the
role of the cosmological constant and
then the origin of the tell me how you
think things stand it well I do I
suppose I must think about things
somewhat differently because the
problems that I've regarded as important
over the years same scant attention
these days well I've always been very
puzzled by the second law of
thermodynamics and the direction of time
and all that and well there's various
things it has to do with which may be
are offshoots and one way or another
like I'm on conscious perception relates
to it but let's leave that aside for the
moment the main thing which is a pretty
obvious thing in a way but which is
almost totally ignored now you see we're
supposed to have this Big Bang origin of
the universe and if entropy which is
this measure of disorder is increasing
with time it is what the second law
tells us that means well okay it's
understandable if I have a glass of
water and I splash it it goes on the
ground and you don't see the opposite
that's entropy increasing you don't see
the entropy decreasing but if you state
this the other way around it's the same
statement but just phrased in the
opposite direction it means as you go
back in time things get more and more
and more ordered entropy goes down and
down and down and where do you get where
you get to this thing called the Big
Bang and what's the best piece of
evidence for the big bang well it's this
microwave back
do you see this radiation coming from
all directions and this microwave
background has one very important
characteristic features notice it's very
early on by the Cobie mission that you
see thermal equilibrium you see this
beautiful spectrum the Planck spectrum
which indicates what you're looking at
was in thermal equilibrium what's not
equilibrium real because it was
expanding but taking that into account
and that expansion is not an entropy
increasing expansion it's adiabatic
expansion and Tolman the American
cosmologists and physicists fully
appreciated that you were looking at
something which was in effect thermal
equilibrium now that is on the face of
it a paradox because surely when you go
back in time if the entropy is going
down and down and down it ought to be
pretty small yet what you see is
something telling you the entropy was at
its maximum now it's never been said you
know this is a great puzzle who says
that well I've been saying but hardly
anybody else not only that that they
don't say that but they said this is
what you expect in the standard
cosmological models if you take
completely random initial state you
that's what you get and that's what you
expect and yeah sure and that when they
saw and Penzias and Wilson saw this
thing
dickie and people would say yeah well
that's what we expected to see it's just
the flash of the Big Bang you're seeing
well what about the entropy how can that
be
well the I think this is a virally here
because people tried to solve the answer
on equations for cosmology and how do
you solve them well you assume symmetry
because otherwise the equation is just
too hard to solve and Friedman did this
he just assume you have a very
homogeneous isotropic universe and now
he was able to solve the equations
Einstein was rather unhappy with his
equations initially but nevertheless he
did it right and sunny agreed with his
mathematics but he thought he thought
there must be something wrong somewhere
but he's curious that that it's these
models we
have being what people have used ever
since and since they use them
it's just think this is cosmology and
the fact that this is such an incredible
assumption it doesn't hit people and
this is where the entropy is low it's
because all the ripples in the
space-time that could have been there
weren't there and they were initially
assumed not to be there because it's the
only way they could solve the equations
but then you get used to the idea
they're not there because those are the
models but why weren't they there all
these degrees of freedoms in the
gravitational free field could have been
there and to see how extraordinary this
assumption is you think of a collapsing
universe which has all the
irregularities which might be their
forms black holes these black holes
congeal the entropy goes soaring up
incredibly now that we have this
bekenstein Hawking formula for the
entropy in a black hole
we now can make an estimate for how big
that entropy is and how improbable the
universe that we actually find ourselves
to be in don't see you might have had
that that puzzle even before the big and
microwave background was discovered
because that was attracted you to the
Hoyle
steady-state model as a way of getting
out of the Freedman it's truly that
thought about the UC I did think about
the second law issue very much in
connection with the steady-state model
but there yeah it was something that
I've learned about but then it seemed
that the problem could be solved with
the picture that they have with the
hydrogen being uniformly distributed and
then as it collapse lumps into stars
that gives you an increase in the energy
it's the right idea because but it's
with the wrong model you see you have a
model with the hydrogen produced
uniformly and as it clumps it produces
these hotspots it's great the action of
gravity yeah gravity reaches hot spots
and the Sun is a hot spot in the dark
sky and it's not the Sun is it's hot the
Sun is bright gives us our life on the
earth because
yes so whole sky was the same
temperatures of Sun it because totally
useless it's the combination of the hot
Sun and the dark sky and that's where
the low entropy resides and that comes
about through gravity so it was this
crucial thing which yeah already when I
was thinking about steady-state I must
have been thinking about that although I
can't quite pinpoint that but that's
true I did I did worry about second law
then but the fact that the Hajin was
dennis sciama think about that too
because that's the sort of thing which I
don't remember yes you should have but
well I wrote this article for the the
Hawking Hawking Israel with the editors
the Einstein centenary volume and this
was I put this long article on about the
study about the second law of
thermodynamics I don't think I had
discussed all those things with Dennis
beforehand but but I didn't have a
particular idea that I had subsequently
yes I didn't know how to characterize
the particular way in which the Big Bang
was special and that really comes out of
studying the conformal structure I mean
that's that's one thing yes yes in the
earlier days he wouldn't've I think as
much importance to as you as well there
were a number of things I noticed very
early on which played very important
roles later on but I couldn't figure out
early see one of them is this fact just
just a curious fact in mathematics we're
talking about four dimensions and we're
talking about space-time for one time
free space and we're talking about the
via curvature none of our curvatures are
conformal curvature so if you have a
metric you don't know what the scale of
things is but you know what angles are
or if you know what the like turns out
that's another way of saying the same
thing that conformal structure tells you
that the light comes out but you don't
know big from small then the
characterization of the curvature is in
this vial curvature Weyl and the barrel
curvature is a measure of the conformal
curvature but it's also in a sense a
measure of the gravitational degrees of
freedom now
in connection with twisters but not
specifically twisters I think is
thinking about it before that because I
was looking at how you write in spinners
the zero rest mass field equations for
all the different spins it was
specifically Dirac and though I had it
all though when he did the zero mass
case for some reason he did in a
different way which I never fully
understood but if you followed up
Dirac's earlier paper and did it for
zero mass that's what you get you have
this particular way of writing the the
different spins and the Maxwell
equations you've just got two indices
dip and then you be the graviton
equation if you like you've got four
indices it's just the same equation
neutrino equation that's just one if you
consider it massless and so the the
gravitational field is two propagates
and there's this wave equation I had
this interesting like slightly anecdotal
things Dirac never talked much but I was
a fellow at John's College at the same
time his direct and they member at one
point
asking him whether I could have a chat
with him about some of his stuff you see
because I knew he was interested in
quantizing done relativity and so he
agreed and so he went off and had this
and I started describing this spin of
stuff to him and I had this equation
this wave equation for me for the for
the spin to feel you seen I said sighs
wondered if this might have anything to
do with quantization using the to spin
associated absolutely he did mister just
the I don't know nobody's actually you
absolutely that's right and so he said
why is this any use of quantities well I
don't know you have to have a
Hamiltonian this company's slightly but
then the other thing yes the other thing
about this equation he said where does
that came he said to me where does that
equation come from I said well it comes
from the Bianchi identities and he said
what are the Bianchi identities and I
thought what we don't know what the bang
you see and here he'd been doing all
this quantization which he obviously
knew them he just didn't know they were
caught the big ya desert is he knew the
contract the contracted ones because of
all and it was curious that I mean I
guess he he somebody who worked very
much in his own too so he knew all these
equations but he had no idea
those were called the Bianchi identities
that's a slight extra story but the
point was this came later but the
realization that you had this
propagation equation which made the
gravitational equations look just like
maximal equations but first it's been -
well it's been well I mean this was done
already about power lien fierce or
something but they didn't do it this way
that is in a much more complicated
looking way if you runs into spinners it
becomes completely obvious but then I
started worrying about the conformal
invariants to these equations and it was
just struck by this curious fact that
that equation is conformally invariant
with a particular weighting conformal
waiting for the spinner and we already
have the interpretation of the file
curvature as being the conformal
curvature and therefore it has another
conformal interpretation so it's a
conformal object but the weighting is
differently you have two different
conformal waiting's and it just strike
me strike me there's something important
here and I had no idea what it was well
so there's only much much later when I
realize it is absolutely crucial in a
certain way which comes to this leaper
heads yes yes well you are asking me
about about the second law and what I
thought was important and this big
problem you see for a long long time I
just thought like everybody else that
the Big Bang to understand it we need
quantum gravity I mean that's that's
this conventional view we need quantum
gravity maybe it's string theory quantum
gravity maybe it's loop quantum gravity
maybe it's this kind of grander gravity
or the other kind of bond of gravity or
twisted quantum gravity but it's called
a gravity no that means to me or meant
to me quantum gravity must be a jolly
funny theory because the singularity you
see one of the reasons you're studying
quantum gravity is to explain the Big
Bang singularity
well you see all see how the
singularities
black holes they're utterly completely
different people used to say well you
know you've got singularities in the
black holes listen to tell you got
singularities in the big bank or sink
that is the Big Bang therefore in the
black holes just the same thing times
getting the other way around but it's
not there utterly different but it's
this entropy thing the singularities in
black holes are absolutely wild the
curvature of vile curvature goes
completely dominates whiles oscillates
all over the place complete complete
madness in the big bang karma so you
could imagine think of the Big Bang is a
great violent thing but it's but it's
utterly regular gravitation degrees of
freedom simply not activated now what
kind of quantum gravity is going to give
you these two utterly different extremes
in the black hole complete domination by
the vile curvature in the Big Bang vile
curvature seems to be zero or at least
very very suppressed okay my review then
was to say oh what quantum gravity must
be a jolly funny theory with the time
not time asymmetric and if we're going
to find quantum gravity here you've got
to put in time asymmetry somewhere you
see so that was my view until well I
guess long ago no it was later nine
years ago I just had this idea I was
thinking about well it took me a long
time to be persuaded when I say a long
time maybe about three years to be
persuaded that the observations of these
distant supernovae made by Perlmutter
Perlmutter and Schmidt and Reese had
convincingly showed that the universe is
accelerating in its expansion and they
it was all sort of touted as being this
totally mysterious thing that nobody
could understand totally unexpected and
I should say but Gunn look at the ho oh
god she looks cosmological constant it's
in all the cosmology books I don't know
why they thought it was mistake why it
should
I think we should explain we're talking
about dark dark energy dark no it's a
very bad name name but nevertheless
what's what people call it and it's it's
there apparently fits in absolutely
perfectly as far as we know now with
what the term Einstein introduced in
1917 for admittedly the wrong reason and
he wanted to static universe well half
of us right in this the only yeah the
only modification you can make that's
generally kind of absolutely yes a term
it's not just a term it is the one thing
you can do to generality without
wrecking it basically yes without
changing it in a radical way that's
right and so often I would take into
consideration in asymptotics the work I
did in trying to live it radiates I'm
squashing infinity down and making
infinity look like a finite boundary and
you can use the conformal in there and
some excellent equations or offi of this
equation that you get through the
propagation of gravitons feel like it
tells you what how to study radiation
field by looking at infinity and I also
knew that if there was a cosmological
constant which was positive this surface
would be spaced like it would be now if
it's not zero cosmological constant time
right if it's negative cosmological
constant fortunately it's not negative
because that causes all sorts of
problems even though the string
theorists seem to like it positive
cosmological constant is a completely
different class of problems I used to
think it had bad features on reflection
it seemed to me they were just unusual
features but now it was absolutely
crucial because I was thinking about the
very remote future and how boring it was
going to be in the very remote for sure
all the black holes eventually disappear
by Hawking evaporation and there's
nothing left of any interest and this
goes on to Eternity but to me eternity
is not such a long time because I'm used
to thinking of compressing it down by
these conformal scalings this is what
defeating time in
yes well your argument is basically I
mean I tend to use this in lectures and
sort of joke but it's a real argument
you know the universe gets so incredibly
boring but there won't be anybody of us
any of us around it'd be bored by us
mainly its photons and you can't there
are more photons very easily and so
photons just go straight into this
boundary and the picture I was having
I'm getting very used to is the idea of
a boundary which you if you've just got
massive things that boundary is like
anywhere else and then the cathodic 'red
to me well you've got a space like
boundary for the Big Bang Maya don't you
put them together so it's an outrageous
thought and I gave lectures on this
usually being careful to call it in that
rageous idea before anybody else said it
was outrageous but as the years went by
I began to think more but I think
originally I would have given it a
reasonable chance have been right
reasonable chance maybe not 50% there's
more substances in that report odds were
candies well you see Paul's hard yes
see Paul Todd I had the thing I called
the viral curvature hypothesis which was
to say that the viol curvature has just
a hypothesis a way of characterizing the
the Big Bang that as you have an initial
type singularity like the Big Bang the
viol curvature should be zero but that's
awkward to say because it's a singular
state what do you mean by a tenth so
when it's singular and so on so Paul had
a much neater way of expressing it which
was to say you've stretched it out it's
stretched out the Big Bang back and form
factor which is something we did all the
time for you know the freedom of models
that was quite a standard thing but to
make that V conditioned on the Big Bang
I think is an important step as Paul has
originally it only makes the vowel
curvature finite doesn't necessarily
zero but as I already knew the infinity
the Warka G must be zero because of the
way these things scales I said before
that because there's a conformal factor
in the scale he must scale a biochemist
zero so if you stick them together the
zero of our curvature must propagate
through to be zero on the next Aeon so I
started playing around with these ideas
half thinking it was completely crazy I
suppose and now thinking is probably
right and we end up with looking for
circles in the sky actually something we
can actually see something to do with
the Mobius transformations on the sphere
well that is it what could be more
beautiful it's well you see I was
beginning I just didn't care immediately
I was trying people to ask me about you
know how could you tell if this is right
and I thought I'm sort of brother
wrongly about gravitational radiation or
something but it was later that I
occurred to me what's the most violent
thing that could happen that we might be
a signal getting through and so I was
thinking of these collisions between
supermassive black holes you see we're
on a collision course with Andromeda the
Andromeda nebula and it has a black hole
which is so forget 20 50 times bigger
than ours and we have a four million
solar mass black hole it's got a bigger
one and they could on our collision
course they might well capture each
other spiral around boom when they
swallow each other up them with one huge
explosion in the form almost entirely of
gravitational waves and these
gravitational waves as I'm used to you
got the boundary they will come and
they'll hit the boundary in a definite
place what will they do when they get
through well because of the scalings
they can't exist as gravitational waves
on the other side they have to scale
down into another form and the equations
tell us that you have to have a new dark
again the word dark isn't very good one
but I think on the conformal cyclic
cosmology scheme which is what I'm
talking about here the acronym or what
you call it CCC is this scheme tells us
that the gravitation the information in
the gravitational waves
propagates across but in the form of
disturbances in this initial dark matter
so you have dark material created and it
will be given the kick by this
rotational wave impulse they actually
have another prediction apart from the
circular features corresponding to the
outgoing radiation yes that is true I
haven't shot it about that well
circularly because yeah I mean it's it's
what I call the initial form of dark
matter because it's massless originally
it has to be massless but the equations
also tell you that you have to grow mass
so that you can't keep massless there's
just an inconsistency so the mass has to
incur it must be tied in with Higgs
mechanisms and so on it hasn't been as
yet properly but I think one has to
understand more about particle physics
how does the Higgs mechanism new the
creation of mass in the early universe
relates to the appearance of mass which
comes in from the equations that you
have here this is another huge area of
your thought really is how conformal
symmetry is broken
yes different ways in which is broken
which we see much more clearly by
expressing things in twisted geometric
terms so you can see the breaking
explicitly but there are always
different aspects to I've always been in
two minds about that yes I saw as the
cosmological constant has changed a bit
because I used to think one of my minds
was that you have the if there's no
cosmological constants you have these
punker a group twisters and that's you
have a sort of exact sequence and the
exact sequence is play a big role and a
lot of homology and twister theory and
so on but if you have a cosmological
constant you don't quite have an exact
sequence you have something which is
invertible and it changes one's attitude
so i think that was a shift because much
of a constant took me a little while to
get used to but with the cosmology it
comes absolutely crucial you can't you
can't do this cosmology without a
cosmological constant so you must have
dark energy as its called
you must have Dark Matter as it's called
because there has to be a new created
scalar material every time you go from
one Eon to the next and so therefore in
all of it is not to pile up it's got to
decay away - so it must throughout the
history of eg on the Dark Matter decays
away which I believe there is some
rather feeble evidence for I don't know
how much to trust it I see must decay
rather than clump together which yes a
bit but they must eventually decay it
must decay yeah otherwise what buildup
yes and then you know just build up for
me on to am and then you won't have to
have a way of propagating so I think
it's got a decay but there are some it's
not the evidence is not very strong but
I heard two bits of evidence one was
from a lecture given by Steven Weinberg
when he seemed to suggest that the
density the the proportion of dark
matter was larger in the very early
universe than it is now
the other thing I picked up on now none
of these things neither of these things
may be right but I just picked up long
because they sort of fit in with what I
was thinking the other one was there are
observations of pair annihilation I
think in in the region near the center
well of positrons I think that's with
this but you see positrons or something
in the region near the center of the
decay products I think there is a view
may not there may be lots of views that
it may be a decay product of dark matter
they would go through they go through it
yeah not photons it's um yeah I don't
have strong views on that but it but it
would it would have to go eventually
yeah so dark matter yes but then the
other thing there's a more recent thing
too it's it may explain a lot of things
you see of course to lots of that's all
the better because there are many things
that could contradict is and if there
are things that contradict it as Maundy
used to say with a steady state model
you see the steady state model is that
it could be contradicted and of course
it was so one has to look out for these
things but there is this
information which was released in March
of this year 2014 about these were
called bicep2 observations where the
claim is what was has been that this is
the smoking gun of inflation I haven't
said anything about inflation but I
should say that in this model of mine
CCC inflation can't be there it would
spoil things
inflation is supposed to have been this
exponential expansion which is supposed
to have taken place in the very very
early stages of the universe
initially the reasons put forward were
ones that I always thought were just
incorrect having to do with the
uniformity of the universe and that only
works if you've got a uniformity there
all right all right
originally it doesn't you can see from
general arguments that can't be an
argument there are good reasons though
kept inflation going one of them being
the scale invariance of the fluctuations
and temperatures that you see in the
microwave background and if you don't
have inflation you did another
explanation so to me in a sense there
was inflation that was the exponential
expansion of the eon prior to us which
is similar to an idea that bennett siano
put forward some years before this
scheme of mine so it's not a bad idea
but they're not much stronger
constraints and what the inflationary I
mean for people who inflation is and
what they can buy ibly well it there be
modes that they claim to see these are
polarization photon polarizations that
are seen and probably due are correctly
seen in in the early universe but the
conclusion that is made is that you see
these things which couldn't arise from
purely magnetic four features they have
to be sort of purely electric they have
to be magnetic they you get curls which
you couldn't have if it was purely
electric now Paul Todd was talking to me
earlier this year about
the problems that there were about the
creation of primordial magnetic fields
and there are difficulties in ordinary
cosmology but where they come from
you apparently see them in magnetic
fields in these voids regions where
there are no galaxies well how on earth
did the magnetic fields come about and
the view seems to be that they must have
been there right from the Big Bang and
those would produce be modes so the idea
is not just that the B modes that claim
are claimed to be The Smoking Gun of
inflation and nothing of the sort
but of primordial magnetic fields and
that those magnetic fields according to
the suggestion that Paul made to me is
that maybe they came through from the
previous Eon which they would on this
scheme because they'd be attached to
galactic clusters and those little
places where the galactic cluster
impinges on the crossover surface you'll
have magnetic fields and then there was
just very recently I was hearing about
these things you see and was very rather
alarmed by the beamers and the fact that
this seemed to be proving inflation so
everybody said since that would disprove
CCC you see inflation can't coexist with
it for various reasons so I'm again
thinking well maybe these are the things
Paul see claiming should be there and
then I emailed my colleague waha Gossage
on who had the person initially who seen
the evidence of these circular features
concentric circular features because
these would be each time there's a black
hole collision and a galactic cluster
there would be boom you see that's one
ring little bit later another one boom
there's another ring and these would
always be concentric because the central
point is where that galactic cluster
ends up has so he was looking for
looking at at least 3 rings where the
variance the variation of temperature
around the ring is lower by a certain
amount than the average and this was the
test we were using to for these things
and he claims to see lots of indications
of these
very nominal isotropic of the sky
certain regions were huge numbers of
them other regions were practically
nothing so when I heard about the
beamers I said well I emailed diocese
where is this region they're seeing
these things can you pinpoint it on the
sky so he put a little ring so it's in
here
and this was in in his Planck map so
this was the recent more recent the old
ones with the W map when he looked at
the Planck map ones and I looked at his
picture nothing whatsoever in there so
oh dear so I look back at the old W map
one's same place and bang there was a
triple of rings right in the middle so
then I emailed by hey and I said well
why don't I see them in the Planck data
C said oh well I'll turn up the volume a
bit didn't say quite like that looking
at slightly lower signals and they're
there they are
absolutely right in the middle more over
moreover if these are Paul Todd's well
if the BMO's really are magnetic fields
and after these rings are really from
that galactic cluster in the previous
Eon it's only just on the edge just from
the geometry it has to be where our past
light cone
it's where the galactic cluster ends up
and therefore the temperature of these
rings must be average even the distant
ones that signals coming towards us and
therefore warmer the close ones signals
going away for us and therefore cooler
the ones which are just on the edge
would be of average temperature I look
at these rings they're right the color
coding is green which means right in the
middle so this is sort of exciting yes
if this is right when we could make
prediction well we make the predictions
anyway but we'll see whether because the
Planck data hasn't come up out yet on
this and so it looks as though we might
make a prediction of the sorts of places
to look for where you should see B modes
because those in if that's right see
this is the second observational feature
of the scheme but nobody pays any
attention to the first one yet it's been
almost completely ignored I mean there
were exciting verifications of this we
had lost not September yes yeah well
with them Christophe Meisner gave a very
nice talk where he explained his
analysis which is quite different from
from Vaheguru John's analysis and he
also saw significant evidence for these
rings yes looked at in a different way
but yes it's the same the same feature
but again or no no attention paid on
some different subject predictions how
do you think things stand on the
evidence for quantum mechanical
dependence of biological structure yeah
the brain there had been some
interesting things in in recent years
yes well you see first I should explain
that you see I wrote my book the
emperor's new mind hoping that by the
time I got to the end of the book I
would have some inkling if quantum
effects could be relevant to action to
brain and I couldn't it was wasn't it
kind of petered out there but it did
have the advantage I mean I thought
maybe I would inspire young people to do
physics or something it was more either
ancient retired people who wrote to me
or else it was somebody in other
scientific subjects and one of these was
Stuart Hameroff who did read my book and
he said well look you may not know about
these things called microtubules that's
just showing my ignorance I never heard
of them at that time these are the
things that in mitosis when the cell
divides you see the chromosomes being
pulled apart and these microtubules are
dragging them apart they play all sorts
of roles in cells generally but they
seem to have a particular role according
to Stuart anyway Stuart Hameroff that
they play a particular role in
consciousness in the brain and his
business professional activity is
putting people to sleep as an
anesthesiologist in Arizona
and so unlike maybe many of his
colleagues who were just interested in
putting people to sleep he's sort of
interested in actually what he's doing
when he's putting people to sleep
so and his idea has been and he tells me
that there is now some good evidence
that this is the case that general
anesthetics do act on directly on
microtubules so these are little nano
scale tubes which are in MIT and all
sorts of almost all cells in the body
and in neurons but the argument is that
they have a different role in neurons
and that they play a central role in
consciousness something very interesting
has come up on with several things one
is some observation about where you
could track where the consciousness kind
of peers what part of the brain is
involved and one thing that always
worried me for a long time about most
explanations of consciousness in terms
of computation or something is why is
the cerebellum not conscious it seems to
be entirely unconscious yet they're
about half as many neurons as in the
brain and far more connections between
neurons in the cerebellum than in the
cerebrum yet the cerebrum seems to be
where consciousness comes about well
these new observations have to do with
these things called
pyramidal cells para para ponerse six a
para para mental cells which are
particularly they're sort of cells which
look like pyramids I suppose but they
don't occur in the cerebellum at all
they occur in certain part of the brain
which is now identified as a major part
where consciousness that's come about
and they are absolutely packed with
microtubules apparently so this is an
inch one interesting development it's
it's alters the picture somewhat but
I've always been wired by why the
cerebellum with all these connections
and so on why isn't that indicate why is
that unconscious but it seems to be it
doesn't have these particular types of
cells and that may be a crucial thing
but the other important development has
to do with the experimental findings of
an urban Bandyopadhyay
who has been doing experiments largely
in Japan with colleagues he's an Indian
doing experiments there and on
individual microtubules where they
measure the resistance with particular
frequencies if either they're very
particular frequencies where thing
becomes extremely conductive in ways
which are quite unlike classical
conduction you see I had the complicated
roundabout route for thinking that
quantum mechanics has to be playing a
role and not just quantum mechanics but
beyond quantum mechanics see it's not
just outrageous but people used to think
of our brain is all wet and messy and
how can you have coherent quantum
mechanics going on there but I'm saying
not only that it's got to be at the
level extended to the level where you
start to see divergence from standard
quantum mechanics now that's totally
outrageous you see but my reasoning came
from the girdle things and saying well
really seems that our understanding
cannot be something of a purely
computational character and it's very
interesting because of course with
tearing it seemed in his early years he
was very I think you would be very alive
to these questions more than people who
thought because he wrote this paper on
ordinal logics and which was trying to
you know going beyond systems yeah I
mean difficult to tell I mean I think
the success of computational methods
during the war really got him going and
I think how much you could go yes in
that direction but he was certainly
worried about the physics is actually
quantum mechanical yeah yeah that's in a
way that other people not exposed to it
but then you see normally one would
think you could you could compute at
least to any degree of accuracy as a
sort of argument Turing himself would
make that what have what the Schrodinger
equation does but then your standard
quantum mechanics you then have to use
the Schrodinger equation only is
probabilistic but then you have to have
a measurement well he was very aware of
the reduction yes that's right they'd be
rule 2 yeah cuz I mean you got that
directly for
von Neumann which is probably also how
are you so but what's interesting is
that now in biology it's not just in
these microtubules because that's been
the Apache has some observations which
do seem to indicate something very
strange is going on in microtubules
which certainly is not classical and how
you explain it quantum mechanically well
that's people don't even know how to
explain high-temperature
superconductivity properly yet so
there's there are lots of things to
understand there but now we know
photosynthesis involves entanglements
want essentially quantum mechanical
effects some things about nothing but
bird navigation is it I think it is
something and sensitivity to magnetic
fields or some of these these things do
seem to tell us that there's a lot more
going on in biology in which you simply
can't explain purely classically part
from part from chemistry which is
already quantum mechanical but you see
I'm saying you've got to have enough
quantum mechanics that it's coherent
across many neurons in a way which
allows sufficient displacement of mass
according to the scheme that I trying to
develop with what do she originally had
a scheme like this and then for
different with different motivations I
picked up on an idea very similar which
is that when insuperable additions if
there's a must enough mass displacement
and then it goes over into a classical
alternatives but this is very round upon
- quantum mechanics people because they
think the quantum mechanics has to hold
in durably at all levels but all
experiments to date have only been at a
level where you don't probe this is root
area so there's experiments hiding in
the wings there - well thank you very
much Roger for getting this time well
time again time is dominating yeah well
it's been a great pleasure for me it's
always a pleasure to talk about these
things and
try to rake up and maybe inspire someone
who's watching this to think it would be
nice who knows</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
