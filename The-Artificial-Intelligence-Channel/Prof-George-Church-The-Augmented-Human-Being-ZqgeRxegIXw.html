encouraged people to worry about a lot
of things but worry in the sense of
taking action doing something about it
and but being cautious as you do
something about it doing safety
engineering so every every field of
engineering has a safety component
eventually so you have civil engineering
aerospace so forth they have huge
amounts of the budget that go to to
safety components and I think biology is
no exception
certainly pharmaceuticals a huge
fraction of the budget for bringing a
new drug to market is not the research
and development that produces the first
prototype drug but it's all the clinical
trials the toxicity efficacy testing so
so I think about this and some of the
technologies as we come up with or are
pretty transformative disruptive and a
good sense and so the more
transformative they are the more
important it is to consider safety
upfront
ideally talk about it before it's on the
streets so counterexample is is the
influence a gain-of-function research
where they brought to influenza some
pretty scary new capabilities and didn't
discuss it with really anybody who could
have modulated or blocked or cautioned
them in their research until they were
ready to publish it which is kind of a
little too late it should have been the
sort of things should have been
regulated before even the first grant
proposal was made much less the first
research or the first paper so some of
the things that we will want people to
worry about that the in a enabling way
these days going forward are
a lot of new applications of the new
technology which is CRISPR we helped
invent that of January 2013 was when it
was first published and but the
applications are even more shocking than
the than the and those papers showed
that you could into that January 2013
the papers basically said that you could
do homologous recombination meaning
precise editing not kind of random
editing but really say if you want us G
to switch to an A you can do that very
efficiently in human stem cells that's
what we said
so CRISPR was of phenomenology since
1987 but it didn't turn into a
technology until 2012-13 and that and
what what it is is a mechanism by which
bacteria protected themselves from
invading viruses by making a molecular
machine that would recognize those
viruses and cut their DNA hopefully
killing or at least disabling the virus
that was then it it seemed like that
might be adaptable to turning it from a
killing machine into an editing machine
but that wasn't that that transition
didn't occur until was a public at least
until 2013 and the way it does it is it
has it's a molecular machine like many
enzymes catalysts are a protein
component and this one has a nucleic
acid component that a relative of DNA
which is RNA and the two will then scan
along your genome or let's randomly
jumping around sometimes revisiting the
same site over and over this it's the
wrong site but eventually it finds the
right site and when it does it
rearranges the double-stranded DNA to
insert the RNA and now making a triple
strand and then the protein cuts both
strands now you've got a broken piece of
DNA which is seems like it's killing
still not not at
but that break allows you to bring in
yet another molecule which is now your
donor DNA which now has the new sequence
that you'd like to swap in it can it can
cause a deletion or an insertion or just
a change of sequence with the same
number of base pairs of G's ace T's and
C's just changing the composition the
order
now that's editing it's just like you
would edit a book or an article you want
to be precise you don't want to just
change G to some random other thing you
want to change it to an A and that's
what we that's the technology that we
happen to demonstrate first we moved it
from bacteria into human a huge jump and
in January 2013 and then many other labs
including ours applied it to many other
organisms basically there's no organism
on a planet that I know of that
somebody's tried that doesn't work in
now which is not true for every editing
nothing and this will editing method you
could say is just a look is just a
little more efficient and a lot cheaper
but that makes it sound like as
increment but every now and then it's a
sufficiently large increment it's
transformative and that's I think most
people that are familiar with it are
classifying it as transforming and for
example when you look at the
applications of it beyond engineering
human stem cells which we showed first
thing it can now you can engineer you
can do gene therapy with a greater
precision therefore that's the most
obvious thing you can a little less
obvious as you can engineer agricultural
species in such a way that many
governments are now classifying it as
not a genetically modified organism this
is a big deal it shouldn't be a big deal
it's it should be a minor bureaucratic
footnote but in fact whether organism is
genetically modified or not
because of people willfully ignoring
scientific studies on safety
they draw this sharp line between Jenna
to be modified and not especially for
foods moat even the most ardent anti-gm
are still protium if it's life and death
like genetically modified insulin where
you grow human insulin and bacteria but
we'll come back to that so so that those
two things are the more obvious ones
which is human gene therapy more precise
and efficient than ever and agricultural
and then becoming less less obvious it's
fewer groups working on it very few is
gene drives which can be used to
eliminate any vector borne disease
malaria dengue Lyme disease as well as
invasive species like rodents are
killing off precious endangered species
on hundreds of islands worldwide and
mainland's that's gene drives and then
transplantation going from pigs to
humans is a-you know million people in
need of transplants it's not limited by
just compatibility incompatibility
between people it's just they're just
not enough people even if we were all
compatible there not enough donors and
so pigs offered that possibility but
there were two problems one is with the
immune incompatibility and the other is
they had endogenous viruses so we've
used CRISPR to solve both of those
problems and then there's a ecosystem
manipulation in addition to gene drives
you can address the isolation of
species elements the territory is
shrinking getting divided by roads and
and other human artifacts farms and so
forth
so that now they become inbred and when
they become in rhythm less
Robus less fertile and that's because
your and that can be found by another
revolution that we've been involved in
which is next generation sequencing or
reading the genome and you can now
insert using CRISPR the proper more
fertile and/or more robust version of
the genes or generate greater diversity
now some of that diversity you can bring
in not only from adjacent populations
that are divided they're separated by
man-made structures but also diversity
from they're separated of time so you
can bring in DNA from the ancients
extinct versions of these animals near
relatives because this amazing
next-generation sequencing is so
inexpensive and powerful that we can
reach back up to 700,000 years into the
past and yet accurate sequences of long
extinct species but with potentially
very valuable lessons for modern
ecosystems right so new technologies do
change our perception of ourselves
it used to be new discoveries as and it
still is it's kind of it's integrating
if you have a new technology like that
telescope it can change it can cause a
discovery about where we where our
planet sits in the universe well there's
the center or not but you can have a
theory you can hit and and and more and
more frequently in the president we have
new technologies and sometimes people
ask me you know why is everybody so
worked up about applying CRISPR to the
germline of humans they're not worked up
particularly about applying it to
germline of animals they just got
approval for
genetically modified salmon in plants
have been genetically modified for many
years now even though some people will
either than some people want the fact is
there's it's a multi-billion dollar
business also why do you buy humans
special we could say well you know we
have a very special system the Food and
Drug Administration for in multiple
countries that that regulate that makes
sure that every new medical technology
well there's a medical device or a
pharmaceutical gets has to be safe and
effective so it does you no good to have
a drug that's safe but does nothing and
nor having one that's very effective but
kills people so so we have that in place
so again what is it makes germline
manipulation of humans special and I
think it's what you were just getting at
the our perception of ourselves is if we
if we feel that we can change any aspect
of ourselves we you know where do you
begin and where do you stop and what
what who sets those rules when you're in
a more primitive phase of the technology
you don't have to ask that question
because it seems so far off and we can
only make minor changes you know we can
you know little nip and tuck you know
cure you know a few vaccines it's not it
doesn't fundamentally change human
nature but if you ever did get a tool
where you could fundamentally change to
a nature to anything you wanted any
hybrid with any animal properties that
you like hybridization with your
inorganic machines it's more intimate
than it is now that's changes our view
of ourselves and I guess that's why
people consider that they they not only
want more caution than ever before which
I would concur they want maybe so much
constant it can never happen and this
and and there are many technologies that
get banned
point or another it's not unusual I mean
railroads were banned because trains are
colliding with one another sometimes in
the middle of towns there was a human
cry at Mount in vitro fertilization it
was pejoratively labeled test-tube
babies you know some kind of scare
quotes around
testitude babies as if that was
intrinsically yucky and unacceptable but
then the incidents in 78 when Elizabeth
Brown was born is a beautiful healthy
baby the first real attempt of brought
the term and and suddenly it looked like
it was 100 percent successful and within
a few years there were millions there no
I think been over five million test-tube
babies now the and then for a while it
was kind of quiet between 78 and and now
it was it came up with recombinant DNA
that maybe recombinant DNA plus
test-tube babies would be a big thing
but it still seemed very far off like it
could be centuries off and what happens
sometimes is sometimes their delays in
technology you know like where's my you
know jet pack or my flying car and other
times it comes faster than we think so
next generation sequencing should have
taken if you drew you know lines of you
know trend lines if it went like the way
computers go which is pretty fast it
should have taken a little less than a
century to arrive and instead it took a
little less than a decade same thing
with CRISPR as a way of doing genome
engineering it you know it it came out
of nowhere I mean it was it was there
was no CRISPR technology in 2000
beginning of 2013 and three years later
it's everywhere it's all over the place
and and it's quite feat it's quite
plausible that we can do genome
engineering so the reason that some of
these technologies arrived so far ahead
of expectations is a mixture of you know
obsessive
a pursuit by engineers answer in dippity
and these are button and I think with
next-generation sequencing a little of
each where my group has been involved in
almost every different way of doing that
shouldn't sequencing ranging from nano
and then a poor sequencing to
fluorescence sequencing to electronic
sequencing like ion torrent and
similarly we've been involved in every
way of doing genome engineering starting
with recombinant DNA with a Amala
endogenous homologous recombination
so-called mega nucleases which one of my
mentors is a graduate student Bernard -
John discovered it was only the first of
the ways of cutting DNA that Christopher
is now the most reason it was also the
first gene drive that he discovered and
then early 1980s yeah so Bernard ozone
was one of my co mentors during my PhD
and and he discovered the first mega
nucleus the first really very specific
cleavage where I would leave once in a
genome and then and then after that zinc
fingers we were involved in the zinc
fingers with aaron klug started a little
company called gen DAC which later
became part of Sangamo and then talent
hal proteins were even easier to program
than Megan nucleus supposing fingers we
were involved in that including one of
my talented postdocs named Fung sang he
and I worked together on talents and
then he started up his own lab at MIT
and then we both started working on a
new foe this new phenomenon called
CRISPR
it like it had been in the literature
for since the 1987 but is only starting
to dawn on groups mainly biochemist like
Jennifer Doudna and Manuel sharpen ta
how you would go about harnessing this
as a as a technology there were a number
of people before of Jennifer Emanuel
Fung and mice and my own labs that that
it established that it was important in
resisting viruses and bacteria but
turning it into the technology of gene
editing I think was non-obvious and in
fact had a good chance of failure for
example we had been trying to adapt
another genome editing genome
engineering strategy which we called
maze so other people called recomand
erring but that really still still after
decades of work only works in e.coli
only works well and e.coli and we have
not been able to transfer it to other
organisms CRISPR on the other hand
serendipitously works in every organism
without major modifications just
tweaking how the component molecules are
produced anyway so Fung's aang and one
of my graduate students look hong
published a paper love was the first
author and in January 2013 side by side
were the one that that that that I did
with first authors Prashant Mali who's
now at UCSD and luan yang who's one of
the key players in the cinah
transplantation work of applying CRISPR
to to getting organs from pigs and then
ever everybody read these papers and
said and it said it looked pretty easy
we've always deposited the tools the
molecular tools to do this in a
nonprofit called add gene and that just
caused it to spread even faster where
people realize that for 50 bucks they
could get in the game
and it was really of all the
technologies that help develop this was
probably the easiest one for people to
adopt next-gen sequencing you haven't
had a big million dollar machine even in
the very early days too
to practice it this you just needed
whatever you already had Plus this
little plasmas you get from from this
nonprofit a gene and then it just just
Fred and the rest is sort of history yes
so getting back to why well why people
should worry about it I mean there's I
think there's these very powerful
applications which is like somatic gene
therapy in adults which people should be
worried about so gene therapy and adults
there's now 2,000 gene therapies where
you'll take a little piece of engineered
DNA put it inside of a viral coat so all
the viral genes are gone and you put in
say a human gene or you can have non
viral delivery but the important thing
is you're delivering it either inside of
a human or you're taking cells out of
the human and putting the DNA in and
then putting it back in but you can do
very powerful things like curing
inherited diseases securing infectious
diseases for example you can edit out
the receptor for the HIV virus and cure
people patients AIDS patients and in a
way that's not dependent on vaccines and
you know multi-drug resistance which has
plagued the hiv/aids story from the very
beginning so it's a you're basically
making a human being which is now
altered augmented in a certain sense so
that unlike most humans they are
resistant to this major plague of
mankind which is hiv/aids so there are
now people walking around who are
genetically modified there are some that
are resistant aids because they've had
their t-cells or they're more generally
their blood cells modified there are
people that there are children that have
been cured blindness by gene therapy no
no none of this is CRISPR but it's it's
in the same vein CRISPR is overtaking it
very quickly and it's instance drafting
behind all the
a willy beautiful work that's been done
with delivery of DNA delivery of genetic
components to patients but their 2000
gene therapies of various sorts in
clinical trials and phase 1 2 &amp;amp; 3
typically phase one is about toxicity
phase 2 is about efficacy and pastries
when you really say is it ready for
market one has been approved it's been
approved in Europe by the EMA not in
America yet it's four it's called globe
era it's for a pancreatitis a look at
disorder it is the most expensive drug
in history it's over a million dollars
per dose the principle could be one dose
per lifetime also it's comparable to
orphan drugs which are rare disease
treatments but it's uh and we can we can
hope that we can bring down the cost
either by going for larger markets to
some of the some of the diseases that
are aimed that are not rare diseases but
there are more common ones these
infectious diseases you know typically
so or the Orphan Drug Act is a way of
encouraging the industry to go after
these very rare diseases by it
permitting them to charge the correct
amount to compensate for the drug
development costs and profit and get
reimbursed for it so so now they're
they're handfuls of orphan drugs and in
fact I think at this point even though
these are very very rare in some of
these diseases are one in a thousand one
a 10,000 100,000 a very rare they
nevertheless are gaining profitability
which is on the order of 30 percent of
the entire pharmaceutical industry so
it's it's now I'm not nobody is sure
whether this is sustainable if we get to
the point where we have
custom drugs basically every person has
their own drug and each of those drugs
cost a half a billion dollars to produce
and we're broke but if we get better at
it and in fact we have if we have a
class of drugs it works really well
where you can use smaller cohorts and
prove it I mean my definition rare drugs
you're using small cohorts sometimes
they're so small you never even make it
to Phase three
for example some of these could you
these hereditary blindnesses you gather
up everybody in the world that you can
find is willing to participate and you
clear them all or most of them and now
you can't move on to face you in the
toxicity try you actually proved
efficacy and you cured them there's
really nobody left in the world to cure
that's a pretty high quality first world
problem to have that happen so anyway
that's all in adults and children
sometimes you have to do it in children
because the the brain is wired up at an
early age and so if you cure blindness
late in life you can make it so the
patient can see the photons can see that
there's something going on that they
didn't see before but they can't
processes they can't say oh that's the
face or that's a person it's just kind
of these blurry or even sharp but on
interpret whole images so if you do it
early enough then they can actually do a
little close to fully functional vision
so you can imagine some developmental
diseases that affect especially those
affect the brain they you might have to
do it as a fetus so there's our there's
already fetal surgery that's done to
catch things but if you have to tinker
with the molecules in the in it you
might want to do it as a fetus or you
might want to do it even earlier and
then you get into this whole business of
whether you can do the germline or not
and and
society doesn't know where to draw a
line is the drop as the line drawn
Jeremy line or is it drawn at the level
of medical significance those if it's
very medically significant it doesn't
matter whether it's in an adult or a
child or a fetus or embryo or a sperm or
egg the in the positive impact is high
enough and there's no alternative but
sometimes people like to draw lines with
a buzzword rather than with a sharp
medical I mean an example is Golden Rice
or the a line I would think should be
drawn between you know medical of versus
non-medical foods so most GM foods I
have to agree with the GM critics don't
really get the average person anything
that they can recognize you go to the
supermarket and there's not that big a
difference between the GM foods and
they're not GM foods terms of price or
quality or anything like that so why why
not object to them you know I mean
anything that will that you can label
you can start an ad campaign that's
effective you can say you know data
chips without cholesterol it never did
have cholesterol but now the labeling
the labeling sells a few more bags of
them so so that makes sense
but then Golden Rice was a tough call
strategically for Greenpeace stay in
some of their associates they could have
classified that as medical like the way
that you would classify GM insulin it's
very powerful and a million lives are at
stake every year due to vitamin A
deficiency and Golden Rice is basically
ready for use in 2002 so it's been 13
years that has been ready and every year
that you delay it that's another million
people dead
that's a mass murder on my scale and in
fact as I understand it that there
there's an effort to bring them to trial
at The Hague
for crimes against humanity you know
maybe that's justified maybe it isn't
but the fact is we have a pretty good
way of addressing this vitamin A
deficiency and nothing else has worked
during those intervening 13 years it's
hard to get thin pills because that's
very expensive these are people that
where they can barely afford rice as
their sole source of calories how are
they gonna afford medicine your green
piece is very well funded they have many
many times more funding than the groups
that are developing the Golden Rice and
they can Lobby the governments to say
it's not safe and then and they can
demand higher and higher levels of
safety testing and then when when the
safety testing starts to look really
good they can go in and and trash the
the plots of land that's growing the
Golden Rice through you know vandalism
as as happened in the Philippines
recently and then and then say well
where's the safety data you know well it
was destroyed by the vandals so there
are many ways you can block development
or or approval of something that's quite
clearly safe so the same thing can
happen with with human germline you
could just treat it the same as other
medical technologies you know artificial
limbs new pharmaceuticals and so forth
they have to be shown be safe effective
or you could draw a line saying if it
has the word germline modification in it
then no matter how safe it is we're
gonna take a less safe method or or no
nothing rather than have this scare word
involved and I think you know I think
that once it's proven to be safe and
effective it will be like in vitro
fertilization it will be very difficult
to deprive people of other of the
technology that's going to help their
children now in all fairness it has to
be there has to be no alternative or
typically in medicine your is not
relative to nothing it's relative to the
various other technologies and in the
case of genome editing or gene therapy
more broadly and the challenge is that
the alternatives are things like genetic
counseling so the parallel revolution of
next-generation sequencing all provides
an alternative for next-generation
genome editing in this case because as
the price is plummeted from 3 billion
dollars to now less than a thousand
complete with interpretation and genetic
counseling
you can stop many of these diseases way
before you need a million-dollar gene
therapy so you can know prioritize who
you're going to date you know if you
have a particular very hazardous or
deleterious carrier status let's say you
have a sax carrier status that's a very
it's a it's a disease that when you have
2 copies from one from each parent the
child is very disabled and usually dies
a painful death shortly after birth
it's something that most families try
that no they're at risk try to avoid but
there many many people who don't know
they're at risk until until they get the
first child and so the solution is for
everybody to know their genome and to
not use it as a way of wasting money on
on hypochondria but of seeing if there's
something very well characterized in
medicine something that's highly
predicted
and and actionable by deciding who
you're going to date and then marry or
it can be done later with slightly more
medical and psychosocial inconvenience
at the stage of prenatal testing
including a revolution that's coming
because in part because the next
generation sequencing called on invasive
prenatal testing where you can test the
fetuses genes by getting a little bit of
blood from the mother so it's a cost of
gene therapy of sorry of genetic
counseling is about a thousand dollars
which can save you a million dollars
later for either orphan drugs or gene
therapy now all these prices will drop
but the point is that at current at
current costs and not only that the many
of these are not there's not a developed
gene therapy that's been approved a
horse or a orphan drug and the anxiety
of hunting down and figuring out what
the genetic problem is after you've
already got symptoms in a in a childlike
developmental delay is is not worth it
even if the prices were identical
so anyway sighs I think that you need to
temper the enthusiasm and concern for
these new technologies with the
alternative technologies for example
genetic counselor oh I forgot to mention
that aging reversal this is a big
project both in my lab and in one of our
startup companies this is not about
wellness or you know drugs that affect
diseases of aging - which are effects
rather than causes trying to get at the
causes of Aging
um and reverse them and there's a fair
enough fair number of precedents for
this in animals but the idea is to to
get it transferred in the humans
reversal of aging I mean some examples
of this are if you take blood from a
young mouse and exchange it with an old
mouse the small molecules
our molecules and cells in the blood
result in a variety of biomarkers of
aging being reversed so you can affect
the faster the vasculature the blood
vessels the nerves
skeletal and cardiac muscles and there
are the measures of these that indicate
that is not just prolonging a very aged
State or makeup going for longevity
you're actually reversing it and this is
a much better target
in any case then prolonging longevity
because a it takes years the decades to
even prove that you've you've extended
longevity and also if you've just if
you've done it on somebody that's quite
old then the economic consequences are
dire I mean it that's that's the part of
your life where you spend huge amounts
on on medicine and and don't improve the
quality of life tremendously so if you
can reverse it to an age where you
essentially don't use any medicine
there's this much more it'll be much
more cost effective it is the whole
point the reason that an academic would
help start so many companies is it is a
way of accelerating the pace at which
technology is transferred from an idea
to an experiment like it might get
published in a paper that has no impact
on society the other than scientists
that read it from a paper to a company
from a company to the market so for
example the next generation of
sequencing technology and I think quite
a few of them now are starting to have
impact in things like non-invasive
prenatal testing they theses some have
said that this is the fastest growing
medical diagnostic in history it's gone
from basically non-existence of three or
four years ago to now millions of women
that have been tested
or not mainly for trisomy so things that
can cause fetal wastage or or severe
medical problems later in life you know
one of the issues with the transition
from academic work to corporate work
that's needed to get it in to have an
impact on society are questions about
scale and and secrecy now one of the
some of the some of the practices in in
academia and small startups and even
large companies are aligned so some of
them are motivated to publish in the
same journals sometimes side by side
because a good high quality
peer-reviewed article isn't it is the
magnet for attracting some of the best
scientists to come join you if you do
everything in total secrecy the very
best science I mean you can always hire
somebody but the very best scientists
still don't know you don't know you
exist they don't they don't really care
deeply but so publishing can happen in
similar ways in companies in academia
another aspect of secrecy is without
patents there would be a lot more
secrecy than there is but patents system
is a way of tantalizing and encouraging
companies to put their ideas and their
inventions in the public domain they
give them a limited monopoly for 20-some
years but only if they have they
described in enough detail that it is
considered enabling enabling
technologies when they're patented
everybody can then build on top of them
some people some people claim that
and if still will be trade secrets but
not nearly as much because if you keep
it secret somebody else patents it then
they win because your secrets are no
longer valuable to you because they can
sue you for infringing their patent even
if you did it first now worldwide its
first file not not first to invent the
fact that you've been keeping a secret
all this time does you no good anymore
in the United States and that's a fairly
recent development so you really have to
file and that was kind of the whole
point some people say that patents you
know are evil somehow and but the
alternative is worse which is trade
secrets which is what will be rampant
otherwise and also the patents don't
stop people from inventing something
except they helped us to invent because
we can look at the bad no that's how
they did it and you can build on top of
it stand on the shoulders of giants the
only thing that prevents you from doing
is doing the same thing that somebody
else did and then making money without
giving them a cut that's that's what
that's what that's what's banned and so
some people say well why would I want to
invent on top of somebody else's
technology because I'm just gonna have
to give it all to them well sometimes
you don't have to give it all to them
you can you can cross license you can
make a deal or they give you something
you give them something or where you're
both enabled it's a case-by-case and it
depends on how much value you add if you
add enough value you could get more than
the original patent which might have
been very preliminary and limited so so
right revive and restore is a you know a
spin-off of the long now foundation
Orion Phelan and Stuart brand have been
championing the merging of some of the
most cutting-edge molecular methods like
CRISPR and next-generation sequencing
with you know very significant needs in
the ecological environmental
conservation movements we have
you know islands that have many of the
world's most diverse and beautiful
species of birds reptiles amphibians so
forth and they're endangered
by invasive species new diseases slight
changes and they're just even a few
degrees change in temperature and shift
the ecosystems faster than the species
can adapt we could just say well let
nature take its course even though
humans are influencing it or we can use
these powerful molecular methods to
track diagnose it and then to take
action with gene drives or with
preparing vaccines enjoyed being a kind
of vaccination that spreads itself for
in the making synthetic viruses so we
can accelerate the processes and CRISPR
vaccines to fight them as we're doing
for the the herpes virus in elephants so
so so revive and restore is largely
about conserving important ecosystems
not just important in some abstract
sense but sometimes in a very practical
human direct human self centered way so
for example in the tundra of Canada
Siberia Russia and Alaska the the
permafrost supposedly terminus is
melting and with it is being could be
released as much as two times the carbon
of all the rest all the forests all over
the world as if they all burnt and
release their carbon dioxide and methane
into the air caused a global warming and
some of the environmental studies for
example from the Zima group have shown
that if you can restore some of the
keystone species that were there not too
just not too long ago that have very
recently left or gone extinct you
lower the temperature by 15 to 20
degrees which could greatly delay or
maybe even reverse the process of
permafrost boy so so some of the
questions that come up with revive and
restore of using cutting-edge molecular
technologies for ecosystem conservation
of preservation some of the same
questions come up this come up with
using these medical oncology zin
medicine which is who gets to choose who
decides are people not being heard or
not being invited to sit to talk I you
know I think you know in all these cases
both medical and environmental there is
um maybe more than ever before an effort
to engage all sorts of citizens you know
regular folks that know no science at
least before they start the conversation
patient advocates environmental
advocates scientists ephesus lawyers
politicians and so forth there you know
many of these meetings have are are uh
presented a video conference on the web
web cast realtime and twitter questions
are encouraged it doesn't mean it's
perfect but at least it's very different
from say the Manhattan Project where the
public was not invited to weigh in on
whether we should for example take a
chance that atmospheric testing would
ignite the atmosphere that was one of
the things that businesses tried to
calculate on their own without any buddy
meddling if it ignited the atmosphere
that would not have been highly
protective to our nation or the world I
think here the idea is to get as many
people thinking about the unintended
consequences as possible and to proceed
cautiously the the quest
who decides ultimately with these kind
of trend transparent and open projects
where it's not being done in secret like
the Manhattan Project is society decides
is we vote with our wallets we vote you
know with the free enterprise system
with our politics the power of the pen
and and it may not be it and in some
cases it's we may change our mind later
and and so there's an emphasis on things
that are reversible that's those get
higher priority but eventually we do
irreversible things certainly could be
very hard at this point to to surgically
remove automobiles from our lives even
though they kill a million people per
year we couldn't just delete them it
would be very hard to go back to
previous agricultural methods because
the early pre agricultural society could
not possibly sustain 7 billion fact
probably even just a couple of
generations back in in crops could not
sustain 7 billion people so who decides
whether a particular species come back
it could be doesn't help human beings
it's a very species chauvinistic way of
looking at it but if them if the
mammoths actually can lower the
temperature of the of the permafrost by
15 to 20 degrees and we don't have a
particularly better way of doing it
let's say with motorized versions of
mammoths and we might do it but
hopefully that will involve many
countries making this decision maybe at
the United Nations level certainly with
gene drives where you're unlike vaccines
were you we have medical professionals
going door to door essentially village
to village gene drives the mosquitoes do
it themselves and you could spread
throughout sub-saharan Africa they don't
respect borders or Wars or any
any other things that would hold back
medical professionals so you probably
want to get the buy-in of all the
nation's not just the ones that are most
desperately in need of the genes to
eliminate malaria well it's a it's a
extraordinarily exciting time for
scientists in particular that was
involved in reading and writing genomes
but it should be an exciting time for
everybody and also a scary time for
scientists and everybody we're an
increasing number of decisions of
politicians CEOs and regular citizens
depend on some technical nuance and
expertise we can no longer say oh well
I'm just gonna vote with my party
it really is let's you know don't
complain about being excluded from a
discussion if you're excluding yourself
from that discussion I think that's the
power of you know the community of
intellectuals that are trying to reach
out to everybody in the world and it's
not it's not intended to be an exclusive
club is it intended to be a conversation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
