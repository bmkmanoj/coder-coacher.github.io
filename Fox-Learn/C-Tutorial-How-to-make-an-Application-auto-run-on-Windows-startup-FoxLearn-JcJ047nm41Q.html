today we will learn how to make an
application on a run on Windows startup
now we will create a button when you
click the button let's save your
application path in the registry the
registry acts as a central repository of
information for the operating system and
the applications on a computer the
registry is organized in a hierarchical
format based on a logical ordering of
the elements stored within it when
storing information in the registry
select the appropriate location based on
the type of information being stored be
sure to avoid destroying information
created by other applications because
this can cause those applications to
exhibit unexpected behavior and can also
have an adverse effect upon your own
application registry keys are the base
unit of organization in the registry and
can be compared to folders in File
Explorer a particular key can have
subkeys just as a folder can have
subfolders each key can be deleted as
long as the user has the appropriate
permissions to do so and the key is not
a base key or at the level directly
under the base keys each key can also
have multiple values associated with it
which are used to store the information
for example information about an
application installed on the computer
each value holds one particular piece of
information which can be retrieved or
updated when required for instance you
can create a registry key for your
company under the key haey local machine
backslash software and then it's up to
you for each application that your
company creates
eet's that he helped the information
specific to that application such as
color settings screen location and size
or recognized file extensions
now you will see your application path
stored in the registry when you open
registry you can use the cleaner
application to view and tools backslash
startup
