learn
sequel is a powerful tool for retrieving
and filtering information from a
database once you become a
syntax with its selects and Frome's and
joins it's somewhat intuitive as well
however sequel commands don't integrate
well with C sharp as you saw
you need the bridge of data adapter and
data set objects to connect the database
query with your application the language
integrated query linked you is the
solution to that problem link you is a
new feature of dotnet that c-sharp takes
advantage of which makes it easier to
work with data
another useful feature of link you is
that you can address a number of
different data sources using similar
syntax
csharp allows you to create classes that
are complex with many different
properties which sometimes are objects
of other classes as well you've also
seen how to create collections of
objects that you can manipulate in
different ways sometimes that complexity
works against you though suppose you
have a class that represents shipping
orders for a warehouse
you could keep a ton of data in such an
object which would make it very
versatile but what if you just wanted to
extract a list of the zip codes where
your customers live for demographic
purposes you could write some code to go
through the entire collection of objects
and pull out just the zip codes it
wouldn't be terribly difficult but it
might be time consuming
suppose you want to find
books in the list that were authored by
Jesse liberty
notice that this class
have a name it doesn't really need one
because you are using it only in this
one spot therefore this feature is
called an anonymous type based on the
Select statement the compiler determines
the number and types of the properties
for the class two strings in this case
and creates the class accordingly
to create expressions that return a
method instead of a single return value
the same query we've been using all
along could be written like this with
lambda expressions
the variable bookie
isn't declared anywhere it can be any
valid name the boolean expression on the
right-hand side is projected onto the
variable which is passed to the where
method to use to evaluate the collection
this method syntax takes some getting
used to and it can be easier to use link
us query syntax but you should know how
to use the alternative
you can also order the results of your
queries and join data from two different
tables in your query you have the same
ability in your link you queries
if you wanted to return the title author
and quantity for a particular book or
books you'd need to join the information
from the two collections the title
property is the common field here it's
the primary key in the book list
collection and a foreign key in the
order list collection the query you'd
use looks like this
although using sequel like syntax with
your in-memory collections is the more
interesting and unusual use of lint q
it's natural to use the sequel like
syntax with sequel databases
as we mentioned earlier when you are
using linq you and sequel you can treat
the database tables as classes and the
columns as members it just requires a
bit of extra work on your part
you probably notice the extra code in
square brackets that's unfamiliar to you
these are called attributes and they're
used in a lot of different places in
c-sharp to provide extra modifiers to
your classes
the IDE changes to show the object
relational designer which is empty at
the moment the second thing is that
several files are added to your project
data classes 1tb ml and two associated
files named data classes one d BM l dot
layout and data classes one designer dot
CS the dot d BM l part as you may have
guessed indicates that this is a
database markup language file which is
really just in XML
language integrated query link you is a
new technology that allows you to query
data sources from within your code
without needing to rely on specific data
translation classes
lenku uses the same syntax with
traditional databases but also other
data sources such as XML files and even
with collections in your application
lenku allows you to issue queries
against collections in your code
returning a subset that's easier to work
with
a link you data source collection must
implement ienumerable and the collection
the query returns must as well
the range variable is used to define the
parameters of the query it can be any
valid c-sharp name and c-sharp will
automatically infer its type based on
the returned values
once you have the innumerable collection
of returned results you can manipulate
them as you would any generic collection
you can use anonymous types and the VAR
keyword in your queries to have the
compiler infer the types in the query
whether simple or complex
you can use lambda expressions in your
queries to define a method for
evaluating the stored data and then
project the results on to a variable
the joint claws can
tonight the data from two different
collections but it has a special syntax
requiring the name of the collection to
join with the field you're joining on in
each collection and the fields that
should be in the return set
link you to sequel classes allows you to
use the link you syntax to query a
sequel database
you need to include a reference to the
system dot data link namespace to use
link you to sequel
link you to sequel allows you to use
attributes on classes so that they
behave like tables and on properties so
that they behave like columns
link you to sequel also features a data
context class that can take a connection
string in the constructor
the object relational designer adds a
visual component to link you to sequel
classes you can drag and drop database
tables directly onto the design surface
and the object relational designer will
supply appropriate backing code for the
classes that represent the data
you can use the automatically created
classes as though they were ordinary
classes in your code simplifying
database access
you
you
a query expression uses declarative
clauses these specify the results we
want not how we are to achieve them to
start we use a query expression on an
array of integers
you
we select elements from an array in
descending order we filter out elements
three in the loop we evaluate the
expression and print the results
you
lenku has a performance cost for example
we count all elements in an array
greater than or equal to 10 with link
you and with a for loop the link you
version is nearly ten times slower for
hot numeric loops link you is a poor
choice
in query languages we express what we
want not how it is to happen the query
language not the programmer is concerned
with the exact implementation details we
call this language the query language
because it is very useful for retrieving
information from databases by
formulating queries or questions
expressed in the language
link you is a powerful feature its
methods and query expressions often
improve the readability of programs and
they sometimes lead to new delayed
superior algorithms
