the dotnet framework is a managed
execution environment that provides a
variety of services to its running
applications it consists of two major
components the common language runtime
CLR which is the execution engine that
handles running applications and the.net
framework class library which provides a
library of tested reusable code that
developers can call from their own
applications the services that the
dotnet framework provides to running
applications include the following
memory management in many programming
languages programmers are responsible
for allocating and releasing memory and
for handling object lifetimes in dotnet
framework applications the CLR provides
these services on behalf of the
application
a common type system in traditional
programming languages basic types are
defined by the compiler which
complicates cross language
interoperability in the.net framework
basic types are defined by the dotnet
framework type system and are common to
all languages that target the dotnet
framework an extensive class library
instead of having to write vast amounts
of code to handle common low-level
programming operations programmers can
use a readily accessible library of
types and their members from the dotnet
framework class library development
frameworks and technologies the dotnet
framework includes libraries for
specific areas of application
development such as asp.net for web
applications a do dotnet for data access
and windows communication foundation for
service-oriented applications
you
language interoperability language
compilers that target the dotnet
framework emit an intermediate code
named common intermediate language SIL
which in turn is compiled at runtime by
the common language runtime with this
feature routines written in one language
are accessible to other languages and
programmers can focus on creating
applications in their preferred language
or languages version compatibility with
rare exceptions applications that are
developed by using a particular version
of the.net framework can run without
modification on a later version
side-by-side execution the.net framework
helps resolve version conflicts by
allowing multiple versions of the common
language runtime to exist on the same
computer
this means that multiple versions of
applications can also coexist and that
an application can run on the version of
the dotnet framework with which it was
built
common language runtime CLR environment
for controlled execution of program code
like a virtual machine executes net
applications framework class library FCL
standard class library for.net
development delivers basic functionality
for developing XML a deonette link you
asp.net WPF WCF WWF silverlight web
services windows forms
you
SDK compilers and tools
you
common language runtime this acts as the
execution engine for the.net framework
all dotnet programs execute under the
supervision of CLR base class library
this is a library of functionalities
which are available to all languages
using the.net framework it consists of
classes interfaces of reusable types
that integrates with CLR portable class
library the portable class library
project in Visual Studio 2012 allows you
to develop and build managed assemblies
that work on multiple net framework
platforms using a portable class library
project you choose the platforms such as
Windows Phone and dotnet for Windows
Store apps to target
you
managed extensibility framework meth MEF
is a library for creating lightweight
extensible applications it allows
application developers to discover and
use extensions with no configuration
required you choose the platforms such
as Windows Phone and dotnet for Windows
Store apps to target dynamic language
runtime this provides the runtime
environment for dynamic languages like
Python etc for executing under the full
control of CLR when Artie when Artie or
Windows runtime api spreads the user
interface elements for building Windows
Store apps and provides access to
Windows 8 or Windows root OS features
when Artie supports development in C and
other managed languages c-sharp and
vb.net as well as javascript and
typescript
you
asp.net this is used to be
internet-based web application Windows
Store apps metro-style apps a Windows
Store app is a new type of application
that runs on Windows 8 devices and can
take advantage of new WinRT api's these
can only be distributed in the windows 8
store desktop apps windows forms a
Windows desktop app his traditional
windows forms application with a new
name software developed for Windows XP
Windows Vista and Windows 7 will be
categorized as a Windows desktop app
when running in Windows 8
examples of Windows desktop apps are
Microsoft Office Families products
notepad etc
you
WPF WPF is used to create applications
with a rich user experience it includes
application UI 2d graphics 3d graphics
and multimedia it takes advantage of
hardware acceleration of modern graphic
cards WPF makes the UI faster scalable
and resolution independent Silverlight
this is a cross-browser web-based
technology which allows designers and
developers to deliver rich Internet
applications our ia embedded in web
pages a deonette this is used to create
data access layer to query and
manipulate data from underlying data
source like sequel server Oracle and db2
etc
linked you this allows you to query the
data from the various data sources like
sequel databases XML documents a do
dotnet datasets various web services and
any other objects such as collections
generics etc using a sequel query like
syntax with dotnet framework languages
like C sharp and VB a do dotnet entity
framework this is used to query and
store data into to the relational
databases like sequel server Oracle db2
etc in ORM fashion parallel extension
this allows you to distribute your work
code across multiple processors to take
advantage of the hardware
you
WCF this is used for building and
developing services based on WS
standards asp.net Web API asp.net Web
API is a framework for building HTTP
services that can be consumed by a broad
range of clients including browsers
Mobile's iPhone and tablets signal our
asp.net signal R is a library that
simplifies the process of adding real
time web functionality to applications
real time web functionality is the
ability to have server code push content
to connected clients instantly as it
becomes available
rather than having the server wait for a
client to request new data
you
WUF this is used to build process
oriented business workflow and rules
engine Visual Studio 2012 the Visual
Studio IDE offers a set of tools that
help you to write and modify the code
for your programs and also detect and
correct errors in your programs using
Visual Studio 2012 you can build Windows
Store EPS desktop apps mobile apps
asp.net web apps and web services
you
managed execution environment controls
the execution of managed net programming
code something like virtual machine like
the Java Virtual Machine JVM not an
interpreter compilation on-demand is
used known as just-in-time
JIT compilation possible compilation in
advance engine
you
execution of the IL code and the JIT
compilation managing memory and
application resources ensuring type
safety interaction with the OS managing
security code access security role based
security managing exceptions managing
concurrency controlling the parallel
execution of application threads
managing application domains and their
isolation interaction with unmanaged
code
supporting debug slaw
profile of netcode
you
CLR executed code is called managed code
represents programming code in the
low-level language MSI l ms intermediate
language contains metadata description
of classes interfaces properties fields
methods parameters etc programs written
in any dotnet language are compiled to
managed code MS il packaged as
assemblies dot exe or dot DLL files
object-oriented secure reliable
you
protected from irregular use of types
typesafe allows integration between
components and data types of different
programming languages portable between
different platforms Windows Linux Mac
OSX etc
you
no protection of memory and type safety
reliability problems safety problems
doesn't contain metadata needs
additional overhead like eg use comm
compiled to machine dependent code need
of different versions for different
platforms hard to be ported to other
platforms
you
CLR manages memory automatically
dynamically loaded objects are stored in
the managed heap unusable objects are
automatically cleaned up by the garbage
collector some of the big problems are
solved memory leaks access to freed or
unallocated memory objects are accessed
through a reference
you
low level language machine language for
the.net CLR has independent set of CPU
instructions loading and storing data
calling methods arithmetic and logical
operations exception handling etc MSI l
is converted to instructions for the
current physical CPU by the JIT compiler
you
net Assembly's self containing dotnet
come
opponents stored in dot DLL and dot exe
files contain lists of classes types and
resources smallest deployment unit in
CLR have unique version number dotnet
deployment model no version conflicts
forget the DLL hell support side-by-side
execution of different versions of the
same assembly
you
metadata in the.net assemblies data
about data contained in the assembly
integral part of the assembly generated
by the dotnet languages compiler
describes all classes their class
members versions resources etc
you
configurable executable net units
consist of one or more assemblies
installed by copy / paste no complex
registration of components different
applications use different versions of
common assemblies no conflicts due to
their strong name easy installation on
installation and update
CTS defines the CLR supported types of
data and the operations over them
ensures data level compatibility between
different dotnet languages eg string in
c-sharp is the same like string in
vb.net and in J sharp value types and
reference types all types derived from
system dot object
you
dotnet languages by Microsoft c-sharp
vb.net managed C++ Jay sharp F sharp
jscript.net languages by third parties
object pascal Perl Python COBOL Haskell
Oberon scheme Smalltalk different
languages can be mixed in a single
application cross language inheritance
of types and exception handling
you
Visual Studio is powerful integrated
development environment ide for dotnet
developers create edit compile and run
dotnet applications different languages
c-sharp c++ vb.net jay sharp flexible
code editor powerful debugger integrated
with sequel server and i is strong
support of web services WCF and WWF
