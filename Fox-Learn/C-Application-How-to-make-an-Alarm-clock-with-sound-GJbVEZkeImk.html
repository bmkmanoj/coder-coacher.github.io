learn how to make an alarm clock
first you need to add a date/time picker
a label and two buttons to form one
label control shows the status of the
timer start button allows you to start
the timer and stop button allows you to
stop the timer
the date/time picker control is used to
allow the user to select a date and time
and to display that date and time in the
specified format the day time picker
control makes it easy to work with dates
and times because it handles a lot of
the data validation automatically
you
you need to declare a system timer it is
a server based timer that raises an
elapsed event in your application after
the number of milliseconds in the
interval property has elapsed you can
configure the timer object to raise the
event just once or repeatedly using the
auto reset property typically a timer
object is declared at the class level so
that it stays in scope as long as it is
needed you can then handle its elapsed
event to provide regular processing
you
you
we will use delegate to update the
status label control from another thread
if you use multi rating to improve the
performance of your windows forms
application you must make sure that you
make calls to your controls in a thread
safe way access to Windows forms
controls is not inherently thread-safe
if you have two or more threads
manipulating the state of the control it
is possible to force the control into an
inconsistent state other thread related
bugs are possible such as race
conditions and dead locks it is
important to make sure that access to
your controls is performed in a thread
safe way it is unsafe to call a control
from a thread other than the one that
created the control without using the
invoke method
now we will set time for alarm clock
