learn how to create and run a unit test
first you need to create a simple bank
account class then create a unit test
the unit test allows you to check that
your code is working as expected by
creating and running unit tests
it's called unit testing because you
break down the functionality of your
program into discrete testable behaviors
that you can test as individual units
visual studio test Explorer provides a
flexible and efficient way to run your
unit tests and view their results in
Visual Studio Visual Studio installs the
Microsoft unit testing frameworks for
managed and native code use a unit
testing framework to create unit tests
run them and report the results of these
tests rerun unit tests when you make
changes to tests that your code is still
working correctly when you use Visual
Studio Enterprise you can run tests
automatically after every build unit
testing has the greatest effect on the
quality of your coupon it's an integral
part of your software development
workflow as soon as you write a function
or other block of application code
create unit tests that verify the
behavior of the code in response to
standard boundary and incorrect cases of
input data and that check any explicit
or implicit assumptions made by the code
with test-driven development you create
the unit tests before you write the code
so you use the unit tests as both design
documentation and functional
specifications
you
you
you can quickly generate test projects
and test methods from your code or
manually create the tests as you need
them when you use intellicus to explore
your dotnet code you can generate test
data and a suite of unit tests for every
statement in the code a test input is
generated that will execute that
statement
you
you
you
you
you
you can change debbik method and run
test again
