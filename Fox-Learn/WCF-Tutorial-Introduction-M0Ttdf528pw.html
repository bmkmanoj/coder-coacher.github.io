you
WCF is a software development kit for
developing and deploying services on
windows WCF is a unified programming
model for building service-oriented
applications WCF is much more it is
literally a better net WCF provides a
runtime environment for your services
enabling you to expose common language
runtime CLR types as services and to
consume other services as CLR types
although in theory you could build
services without WCF in practice
building services is significantly
easier with WCF WCF is microsoft's
implementation of a set of industry
standards defining service interactions
type conversions marshalling and the
management of various protocols
consequently WCF provides
interoperability between services
you
WCF provides developers with the
essential off-the-shelf plumbing
required by almost all applications and
as such it greatly increases
productivity the first release of wucf
as part of dotnet 3.0 provided many
useful facilities for developing
services such as hosting service
instance management asynchronous calls
reliability transaction management
disconnected queued calls and security
the second release of wucf as part of
dotnet 3.5 provided additional tools and
extended the original offering with
additional communication options the
third release as part of dotnet 4.0
includes configuration changes a few
extensions
you
the low figures shows the different
she combined to form WCF
advantage
WCF is interoperable with other services
when compared to dotnet remoting where
the client and service have to be dotnet
WCF services provide better reliability
and security in compared to a SMX web
services in WCF there is no need to make
much change in code for implementing the
security model and changing the binding
small changes in the configuration will
make your requirements WCF has
integrated logging mechanism changing
the configuration file settings will
provide this functionality in other
technology developer has to write the
code
you
disadvantage
making right design for your requirement
is little bit difficult
you
consider the following scenario you are
building a product management system
basic product information such as
product name description and price is
stored in a sequel server database you
have built a front-end application to
work with that data the distribution
center which is in the building next
door manages inventory they have a
server that hosts the inventory database
and a server that hosts the inventory
component you wrote to manage inventory
what technology will you use to talk to
the inventory component from your
front-end application they are on the
same network so you might choose to use
dotnet remoting it is now a year later
your company acquires another company
and decides to merge the two
distribution centers the distribution
center is now halfway across the country
your first thought is to continue to use
net remoting and simply move the
component to a different server
you
however you learned that you also need
to make the inventory component
available to a variety of partners not
all of whom are using dotnet
applications that rules out dotnet
remoting you could use dotnet remoting
for internal clients and web services
for external clients you could stop
using dotnet remoting and use only web
services one of the primary motivations
behind windows communication foundation
is to provide a single model for
building distributed applications if you
built the inventory component as a WCF
service your front-end could communicate
using HTTP
you
the application in the scenario is
connected the leading approach to
building connected applications is
service orientation no doubt you have
heard of service-oriented architecture
so a-- but what is a service-oriented
application a service is a program that
performs a task and that a client
application can communicate with through
well-defined messages to call a web or
WCF service the client passes it a
message which consists of XML the
message will typically include a request
for the service to perform an action
such as retrieve or update the inventory
information for a product if the service
returns data to the client it passes
back a message also consisting of XML
the client and the service need to agree
on what the XML will look like the most
common message format is simple object
access protocol soap soap defines the
format of XML request and reply messages
and how clients and services encode the
data in the messages
you
in object-oriented programming objects
are tightly coupled to call the
inventory component a client application
creates an instance of the component and
therefore controls its lifetime in a
service-oriented application services
and clients are loosely coupled to call
the inventory service a client does not
instantiate an instance of a component
it simply passes a message to the
service and may receive a message in
return service-oriented applications are
loosely coupled all communication occurs
through messages soap defines the format
of messages contracts to find the
contents of messages a service will
publish a contract that specifies what
methods clients can call what arguments
those methods take and what if anything
the methods returned the contract can
also specify security requirements and
whether a transaction is required
a distributed application built with web
services is a service-oriented
application asp.net Web Services ASM X
has been available for building web
services since dotnet was first released
why then do you need windows
communication foundation WCF provides a
number of benefits over asp.net web
services including support for sending
messages using not only HTTP but also
TCP and other network protocols the
ability to switch message protocols with
minimal effort support for hosting
services on hosts other than a web
server built in support for the latest
web services standards and the ability
to easily support new ones support for
security transactions and reliability
support for sending messages using
formats other than soap such as
representational state transfer rest
webservice is a part of WCF WCF offers
much more flexibility and portability to
develop a service when comparing to web
service still we are having more
advantages over web service following
table provides detailed difference
between them
