you
particular instances of a class are
objects the difference between a class
and an object is the same as the
difference between the concept of a dog
and the particular dog who is sitting at
your feet as you read this you can't
play fetch with the definition of a dog
only with an instance
the huge advantage of classes in
object-oriented programming is that
classes encapsulate the characteristics
and capabilities of a type in a single
self-contained unit
class behavior is created by writing
methods sometimes called member
functions a method is a routine that
every object of the class can execute
for example a dog class might have a
bark method and a listbox class might
have a sword method
klas state is maintained by fields
sometimes called member variables fields
may be primitive types and in to hold
the age of the dog or a set of strings
to hold the contents of the listbox
or fields may be objects of other
classes for example an employee class
may have a field of type address
finally classes may also have properties
which act like methods to the creator of
the class but look like fields to
clients of the class a client is any
object that interacts with instances of
the class
when you define a new class you define
the characteristics of all objects of
that class as well as their behaviors
for example if you create your own
windowing operating system you might
want to create screen widgets known as
controls in Windows one control of
interest might be a list box a control
that is very useful for presenting a
list of choices to the user and enabling
the user to select from the list
list boxes have a variety of
characteristics height with location and
text color for example programmers have
also come to expect certain behaviors of
list boxes they can be opened closed
sorted and so on
object-oriented programming allows you
to create a new type list box which
encapsulates these characteristics and
capabilities
to define a new type or class you first
declare it and then define its methods
and fields you declare a class using the
class keyword
instantiating objects to make an actual
instance or object of the dog class you
must declare the object and allocate
memory for the object these two steps
combined are necessary to create or
instantiate the object
the declaration alone
and actually create an instance however
to create an instance of a class
you must also allocate memory for the
object using the keyword new
access modifiers an access modifier
determines which class methods including
methods of other classes can see and use
a member variable or method within a
class
public methods are part of the class's
public interface they define how this
class behaves private methods are helper
methods used by the public methods to
accomplish the work of the class
you
the behavior of a class is defined by
the methods of that class to make your
methods as flexible as possible
you can define parameters information
passed into the method when the method
is invoked
methods can take any number of
parameters the parameter list follows
the method name and is enclosed in
parentheses inside the parentheses you
provide the type of the parameter and
the name that the method will use to
refer to that parameter
you've seen in several places so far in
this book that methods can return a type
or they can return nothing at all if the
return type is void you've mostly used
void methods up until now specifically
main although ritalin is a void method
as well the Constructors you've worked
with do return a value they return an
instance of the class
in fact a member method is invoked
whenever you instantiate an object this
method is called a constructor each time
you define a class you are free to
define your own constructor but if you
don't the compiler will provide one for
you invisibly and automatically
if you do not explicitly initialize your
member variables they are initialized to
innocuous values integers to 0 strings
to an empty string and so on
if you know that certain member
variables should always have the same
value when the object is created you can
initialize the values of these member
variables in an initializer instead of
having to do so in the constructor you
create an initializer by assigning an
initial value to a class member
although you normally set the properties
of your object with a constructor that's
not the only way to do it
c-sharp also offers object initializers
which let you set any accessible members
of your object when you create it notice
that we said accessible which means you
can set public members but not private
ones suppose you have this dog class
with member fields that are public
notice here that the constructor takes a
string to set the dog's name but it
doesn't take away that's fine because
wait is public so you could easily set
it later
with an object initializer though you
can set the public weight immediately
after you create the object
you create an instance of an anonymous
type with a keyword new just as you
would if you were instantiating an
object of a declared class instead of
passing parameters to a constructor
though you use braces and define the
member fields that you want your
anonymous class to contain
you can use the VAR keyword to assign an
instance of that class to a variable
the key word this refers to the current
instance of an object though this
reference is a hidden parameter in every
non-static method of a class there are
three ways in which this reference is
typically used the first way is to
qualify instance members that have the
same name as parameters as in the
following
the fields properties and methods of a
class can be either instance members or
static members instance members are
associated with instances of a type
whereas static members are associated
with the class itself and not with any
particular instance all methods are
instance methods unless you explicitly
mark them with the keyword static
the vast majority of methods will be
instance methods the semantics of an
instance method are that you are taking
an action on a specific object from time
to time however it is convenient to be
able to invoke a method without having
an instance of the class and for that
you will use a static method
invoking static methods static methods
are said to operate on the class rather
than on an instance of the class they do
not have this reference as there is no
instance to point to static methods
cannot directly access non static
members you will remember that main is
mark static for main to call a non
static method of any class including its
own class
it must instantiate an object
using static fields a common use of
static member variables or fields is to
keep track of the number of instances /
objects that currently exist for your
class
you
unlike many other programming languages
C C++ Pascal and so on c-sharp provides
garbage collection your objects are
destroyed after you are done with them
although not immediately after they are
destroyed when the garbage collection
process runs which is determined by the
system
the a disposable interface requires you
to create a method named dispose which
will be called by your clients if you
provide a dispose method you should stop
the garbage collector from calling your
objects destructor to stop the garbage
collector call the static method GC dot
suppress finalize passing into this
reference for your object your finalizar
can then call your dispose method
objects created within methods are
called local variables as we discussed
earlier they are local to the method as
opposed to belonging to the whole object
as member variables are the object is
created within the method used within
the method and then destroyed some time
after the method ends local objects are
not part of the object state they are
temporary value holders useful only
within the particular method
local variable
intrinsic types such as int are created
on a portion of memory known as the
stack the stack is allocated and
allocated as methods are invoked when
you start a method all its local
variables are created on the stack when
the method ends local variables are
destroyed
these variables are referred to as local
because they exist and are visible only
during the lifetime of the method they
are said to have local scope when the
method ends the variable goes out of
scope and is destroyed
c-sharp divides the world of types into
value types and reference types value
types are created on the stack all the
intrinsic types int long our value types
as our Struck's discussed later in this
chapter and thus are created on the
stack
objects on the other hand are reference
types reference types are created on an
undifferentiated block of memory known
as the heap when you declare an instance
of a reference type what you are
actually declaring is a reference which
is a variable that refers to another
object
when you define a new class you declare
its name with the class keyword and then
define its methods fields and properties
to instantiate an object you declare the
name of the class followed by an
identifier for the object much as you
would a local variable you then need to
allocate memory for the actual unnamed
object that will be created on the heap
you do so with a keyword new
you invoke a method on an object by
writing the name of the object followed
by the dot operator and the method name
followed by parentheses parameters if
any are placed within the parentheses
access modifiers dictate which methods
of external classes can see and use a
variable or method within a class all
members of the class are visible to all
methods of its own class members marked
public have no restrictions and are
visible to methods of any class members
marked private are visible only to
methods within the same class members
marked protected are visible to methods
within the same class and methods in
derived classes
if you know the return
a method you can use a method call any
place you would use an instance of that
type
a constructor is a special method
invoked when a new object is created if
you do not define any constructors at
all for your class the compiler will
provide a default constructor that does
nothing a default constructor is a
constructor that takes no parameters you
are free to create your own default
constructor for your class
you can initialize the values of your
member variables when you define them in
your class
object initializers allow you to set the
public fields of an object immediately
after you create the object
anonymous types allow you to create a
class with no name and initialize its
fields immediately the compiler will
implicitly assign types to those fields
you can use the VAR keyword to create an
instance of the anonymous object
though this keyword is used to refer to
the current instance of an object
every non-static method of a class has
an implicit this variable passed into
the method
static members are associated with the
class itself not with a particular
instance static members are declared
with the keyword static and are invoked
through the class name static methods do
not have this parameter because there is
no instance to refer to
c-sharp doesn't
specifically require a finalizar method
in your classes because the framework
will destroy any object that is not in
use
you should provide a dispose method if
your class uses unmanaged resources
local value type variables are created
on the stack when the method ends these
variables go out of scope and are
destroyed
objects are reference types and are
created on the heap when you declare an
instance of a reference type you are
actually creating a reference to that
objects location in memory if you
declare a reference to an object on the
heap within a method when the method
ends that reference is destroyed if
there are no remaining references to the
object on the heap the object itself is
destroyed by the garbage collector at
some later time
you can define a reference to an
existing object by declaring the class
and an identifier and then assigning to
that identifier an existing object the
two identifiers x' now both refer to the
same unnamed object on the heap
