you
the UML is a visual language for
modeling and communicating about systems
through the use of diagrams and
supporting text
you
a manager leads a team that executes the
project each manager has a name and
phone number and may initiate a project
or terminate a project each project has
a name start date and end date each team
has a description and that is all we are
interested in concerning the team
you
the three aspects of UML UML is an
abbreviation for unified modeling
language each of these words speaks to
an important aspect of the UML language
a language enables us to communicate
about a subject in system development
the subject includes the requirements
and the system without a language it is
difficult for team members to
communicate and collaborate to
successfully develop a system model a
model is a representation of a subject
for example to model and Express the
quantity of five the counting language
uses five objects whereas arithmetic
uses the string 5 a model captures a set
of ideas known as abstractions about its
subject without a model it is very
difficult for team members to have a
common understanding of the requirements
and the system and for them to consider
the impact of changes that occur while
the system is being developed
unified the term unify
to the fact that the object management
group OMG an industry-recognized
standardization organization and
rational software corporation created
the UML to bring together the
information systems and technology
industry's best engineering practices
these practices involve applying
techniques that allow us to more
successfully develop systems without a
common language it is difficult for new
team members to quickly become
productive and contribute to developing
a system
you
goals and scope by understanding the
OMGs goals and scope for the UML we can
better understand the motivations behind
the UML the omg's goals were to make the
UML ready-to-use expressive simple
precise extensible implementation
independent process independent
you
history the UML's history consists of
five distinct time periods by
understanding these periods you can
understand why the UML emerged and how
it is still evolving today the
fragmentation period between the mid
1970s and the mid 1990s organizations
began to understand the value of
software to business but only had a
fragmented collection of techniques for
producing and maintaining software
amongst the various emerging techniques
and methods that focused on producing
and maintaining software more
effectively each having its own modeling
languages three methods stood out
you
Grady Booch is bootch 93 method from
Booch 91 emphasized the design and
construction of software systems james
rumbas object modeling technique OMT - 2
method from OMT 1 emphasized the
analysis of software systems
iver Jacobson's object oriented software
engineering oose method emphasized
business engineering and requirements
analysis
the unification period between the
mid-1990s and 1997 the UML 1.0 emerged
James rumba and later Iver Jacobson
joined Grady Booch at rational Software
Corporation to unify their approaches
the standardization period in the later
half of 1997 the UML 1.1 emerged all the
RFP responses were combined into version
1.1 of the UML the OMG adopted the UML
and assumed responsibility for further
development of the standard in November
1997 the revision period the OMG charted
a revision task force
RTF to accept public comments on the UML
and make minor editorial and technical
updates to the standard various product
and service vendors began to support and
promote the UML with tools consulting
books and so forth
the industrialization period in parallel
with the revision period the OMG is
proposing the UML standard for
international standardization as a
publicly available specification pot via
the International Organization for
Standardization ISO the most current
version of the UML specification is
available from the OMG at HTTP colon
slash slash ww omg org
even though the UML is process
independent its authors promote a
process that is use case driven
architecture centric iterative and
incremental by understanding how the UML
is related to process and the type of
process the UML's authors promote you
can better understand how to best
approach learning the UML however any
type of process even one without these
characteristics may use the UML
generally every system development
lifecycle process involves the following
types of lifecycle activities
requirements gathering activities to
capture requirements that define what a
system should do analysis activities to
understand the requirements design
activities to determine how a system
will satisfy its requirements
implementation activities to build a
system testing activities to verify that
a system satisfies its requirements
deployment activities to make a system
available to its users there are many
types of approach for applying these
activities to develop a system
traditionally a waterfall approach has
been applied now an iterative approach
is more common
you
applying a waterfall approach when
applying a waterfall approach life cycle
activities are performed in a single
linear sequence for all the requirements
this often results in the discovery
during testing activities when the
different pieces of the system are
integrated of quality related problems
that have remained hidden during the
design and implementation activities
consider a project that involves ten
requirements
perhaps the generation of ten different
types of reports where each report stems
from a different requirement within a
waterfall approach all the requirements
are captured and analyzed and the whole
system is designed implemented tested
and deployed in this linear sequence
within such an approach the UML may
readily be used to communicate the
requirements and description of the
system
however because activities are performed
in a single linear sequence for all the
requirements the UML models must be
fairly complete at each step
applying an iterative approach when
applying an iterative approach any
subsets of the lifecycle activities are
performed several times to better
understand the requirements and
gradually develop a more robust system
each cycle through these activities or a
subset of these activities is known as
an iteration and a series of iterations
in a stepwise manner eventually results
in the final system this enables you to
better understand the requirements and
gradually develop a more appropriate
system through successive refinement and
incrementally gaining more detail as you
do more and more iterations
you
learning the UML can be quite
overwhelming
in the breadth and depth of the language
and its lack of a process if you don't
know on what parts of the UML to focus
but by understanding how the UML is
related to process you know to focus on
the object-oriented paradigm because it
establishes the foundation for the UML
structural modeling and behavioral
modeling because they allow you to
understand requirements and architecture
other capabilities of the UML in
addition when learning the UML it is
important to focus on the essentials and
understand how to effectively and
successfully apply the UML to model
systems rather than bog yourself down in
trying to learn every comprehensive
aspect of the language
