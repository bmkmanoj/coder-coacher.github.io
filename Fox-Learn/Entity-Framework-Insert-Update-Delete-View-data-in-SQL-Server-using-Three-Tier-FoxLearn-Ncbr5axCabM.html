learn how to create three-tier solution
for entity framework
first we will design a simple UI that
allows you to insert update delete and
view contacts
you
you need to create a new database then
add a contact table to your database
you need to create a new project to
contain your model three-tier design
fundamentally a most famous application
development process which can be divided
into three main levels first level we
will deal with all user interface second
level is the business logic level where
we will apply business rules finally
third level is data access layer in this
level we implement code required to
intact with database and do manipulation
on database
this layer is responsible for handling
database related tasks that is only data
access this data access layer is created
as a separate solution so that the
changes in data access layer only need
the recompilation of data access layer
and not the complete application the
benefit of having this layer as a
separate solution is that in case the
database engine is changes we only need
to change the data access layer and the
other areas of the application need not
be changed and recompiled also the
changes in other areas outside the
solution will not demand for data access
layer recompilation
business logic layer contains all the
calculations and business real
validations that are required in the
application it is also in a separate
solution for the reason that if the
business rules change or the
calculations change we only need to
recompile the business logic layer in
the other layers of the application will
remain unaffected
you
you
you
you
you need to copy the connection string
to your app config file
you
you need to add a binding source to
datagridview
the binding source component serves two
purposes first it provides a layer of
indirection when binding the controls on
a form to data this is accomplished by
binding the binding source component to
your data source and then binding the
controls on your form to the binding
source component all further interaction
with the data including navigating
sorting filtering and updating is
accomplished with calls to the binding
source component second the binding
source component can act as a strongly
typed data source adding a type to the
binding source component with the add
method creates a list of that type the
presentation layer is responsible for
taking the user input showing the data
to the user and mainly performing input
data validation
