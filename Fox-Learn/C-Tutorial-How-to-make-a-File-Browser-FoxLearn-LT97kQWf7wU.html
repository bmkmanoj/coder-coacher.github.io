learn how to make a file browser
you need to add a ListView button text
box label an image list to form one when
you click open button a folder browser
dialog show allow select path then all
files show and ListView control and you
can click on the icon to open any file
you need to change the image size of
image list control image list is
typically used by other controls such as
the ListView tree view or toolbar you
can add bitmaps or icons to the image
list and the other controls are able to
use the images if they require image
list uses a handle to manage the list of
images the handle is not created until
certain operations such as getting the
handle or calling draw are performed on
the image list performing other
operations such as setting the color
depth or image size will cause the
handle to be recreative therefore you
should perform these operations before
you add images to the image list
folder browser dialog class provides a
way to prompt the user to browse create
and eventually select a folder use this
class when you only want to allow the
user to select folders not files
browsing of the folders is done through
a tree control only folders from the
file system can be selected you can also
optionally set the description property
to provide additional instructions to
the user finally call the show dialog
method to display the dialog box to the
user when the dialog box is closed in
the dialog box resolved from show dialog
is dialog result ok the selected path
will be a string containing the path to
the selected folder
you need to add extract icon associated
with the file to image list control
extract associated icon method returns
an icon representation of an image that
is contained in the specified file we
use file info class to get milodon use
the file info class for typical
operations such as copying moving
renaming grading opening deleting and
appending to files if you are performing
multiple operations on the same file it
can be more efficient to use file info
instance methods instead of the
corresponding static methods of the file
class because a security check will not
always be necessary
you
you
we use the process class to process open
file this class provides access to local
and remote processes and enables you to
start and stop local system processes a
process component provides access to a
process that is running on a computer a
process in the simplest terms is a
running app a thread is the basic unit
to which the operating system allocates
processor time a thread can execute any
part of the code of the process
including parts currently being executed
by another thread
