learn how to insert update the late and
view data from database
you
first you need to install Metro
framework from nugget Metro modern UI or
Metro framework brings Windows 8 UI to
dotnet windows forms applications
we will design a simple UI allows you to
insert update delete and view data from
SQL Server
you
you
you should create a new database then
add a student table to your database
you need to set identity is true
autoincrement allows a unique number to
be generated when a new record is
inserted into a table
you need to create a student class to
mapping data returned from SQL Server
you can add an entity state to manage
your object state
you should add a connection string to
the app config file we always use
connection string in forms that we
design but when you design a big
software you should set the connection
string for once and use it in many forms
in this method you use the name of the
connection string instead of the
connection string text every time you
want to change the connection string
just change the main connection string
in the app config file by this method
you don't need to change all of the
forms in your project just change the
connection string in the app config
you need to add a binding source to
Mitch frog read the binding source
component serves two purposes first it
provides a layer of indirection when
binding the controls on a form to data
this is accomplished by binding the
binding source component to your data
source and then binding the controls on
your form to the binding source
component second the binding source
component in act is a strongly typed
data source
you
you
you need to install a warren light from
nugget orm lights goal is to provide a
convenient dry config free our DBMS
agnostic typed wrapper that retains a
high affinity with SQL exposing
intuitive api's that generate
predictable SQL and maps cleanly to
disconnected pocos this approach makes
easier to reason about your data access
making it obvious what SQL is getting
executed at what time whilst mitigating
unexpected behavior implicit and +1
queries and leaky data access prevalent
in heavy ORM
to configure ORM light you need the DB
connection string along the dialect
provider of the our DBMS you're
connecting to
you can use the DB factory to open a
diode net DB connections to your
database if connecting to an empty
database you can use o RM lights create
table AP is to create any tables you
need based solely on the schema
definition of your poco and populated
with any initial seed data you need
