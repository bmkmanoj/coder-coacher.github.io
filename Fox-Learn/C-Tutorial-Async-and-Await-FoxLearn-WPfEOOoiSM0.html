learn how to use a sink and wait
first you need to add a button and text
balls to form one the textbox displays
some messages when you click start
button you can avoid performance
bottlenecks and enhance the overall
responsiveness of your application by
using the synchronous programming
however traditional techniques for ideal
asynchronous applications can be
complicated making them difficult to
write debug and maintain visual studio
2012 introduces a simplified approach as
st. programming that leverages
asynchronous supporting the dotnet
framework 4.5 in the Windows runtime the
compiler does the difficult work that
the developer used to do and your
application retains a logical structure
that resembles synchronous code as a
result you get all the advantages of
asynchronous programming with a fraction
of the effort as synchrony is essential
for activities that are potentially
blocking such as when your application
accesses the wind' access to a web
resource sometimes is slow or delayed if
such an activity is blocked within a
synchronous process the entire
application must wait in an asynchronous
process the application can continue
with other work that doesn't depend on
the web resource until the potentially
blocking task finishes the asynch and
await keywords are the heart of asynch
programming by using those two keywords
you can use resources in the.net
framework or the Windows runtime to
create an asynchronous method almost as
easily as you create a synchronous
method lay synchronous methods that you
define by using a sink and weight are
referred to as a sink methods the
install a sink method will return a
value like total component installed in
a sink methods you use the provided
keywords and types to indicate what you
want to do and the compiler does the
rest including keeping track of what
must happen when control returns to an
away point in a suspended method
some routine processes such as loops and
exception handling can be difficult to
handle in traditional a synchronous code
in an async method you wrote these
elements much as you would in a
synchronous solution and the problem is
solved asynch methods are intended to be
non blocking operations and a weight
expression in a sync method doesn't
block the current thread while the
awaited task is running instead the
expression signs up the rest of the
method as a continuation and returns
control to the collar of the sync method
the asynch and await keywords don't
cause additional threads to be created a
sync method Stoned require multi-protein
because in a sync method doesn't run on
its own thread the method runs on the
current synchronization context and uses
time on the thread only when the method
is active you can use task 1 to move CPU
bound work to a background thread but a
background thread doesn't help with a
process that's just waiting for results
to become available the sync based
approach to asynchronous programming is
preferable to existing approaches in
almost every case in particular this
approach is better than background
worker for i/o bound operations because
the code is simpler and you don't have
to guard against race conditions in
combination with tasks run a sync
programming is better than background
worker for CPU bound operations because
a sync programming separates the
coordination details of running your
code from the work that task 1 transfers
to the thread pool
we will debug the program the most
important thing to understand an
asynchronous programming is how the
control flow moves from method to method
