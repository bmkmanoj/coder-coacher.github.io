you
the c-sharp programming language can be
used for many kinds of applications
including websites desktop applications
games phone apps and command-line
utilities c-sharp has been center stage
for Windows developers for about a
decade now so when Microsoft announced
that Windows 8 would introduce a new
style of application optimized for touch
based interaction on tablets it was no
surprise that c-sharp was one of the
four languages to offer full support
from the start for these metro-style
applications as they're called although
Microsoft invented c-sharp the language
and its runtime are documented by the
standards body ACMA enabling anyone to
implement c-sharp
although there are many ways you can use
c-sharp other languages are always an
option why might you choose c-sharp over
these it will depend on what you need to
do and what you like and dislike in a
programming language much of c-sharp
power comes from the range of
programming techniques it supports for
example
it offers object-oriented features
generics and functional programming it
supports both dynamic and static typing
it provides powerful list and set
oriented features thanks to link you the
most recent version of the language adds
intrinsic support for asynchronous
programming
some of the most important benefits of
using c-sharp come from its runtime
which provides services such as security
sandboxing runtime type checking
exception handling thread management and
perhaps its most important feature
automated memory management the runtime
provides a garbage collector that frees
developers from much of the work
associated with recovering memory that
the program is no longer using the.net
framework encompasses both the runtime
and the libraries that c-sharp programs
use on windows the runtime part is
called the common language runtime
usually abbreviated to CLR because it
supports not just c-sharp but any dotnet
language
the CLR has a common type system CTS
enabling code from multiple languages to
interoperate freely which means that
dotnet libraries can usually be used
from any dotnet language f-sharp can
consume libraries written in dotnet
c-sharp can use Visual Basic libraries
and so on the dotnet framework includes
an extensive class library this library
provides wrappers for many features of
the underlying operating system but it
also provides a considerable amount of
functionality of its own the libraries
built into the framework are not the
whole story many other frameworks
provide their own dotnet class libraries
SharePoint has an extensive dotnet API
and of course libraries do not have to
be associated with frameworks
you
however if you design a new comm
component carefully you can make it
straightforward to use directly from
c-sharp Windows 8 introduces a new style
of API for writing metro-style tablet
applications an evolution of comm called
WinRT and unlike interrupts with older
native windows AP is using when RT from
c-sharp feels very natural in summary
with c-sharp we get a strong set of
abstractions built into the language a
powerful runtime and easy access to an
enormous amount of library and platform
functionality
to understand a language it's useful to
compare it with some alternatives so
it's worth looking at some of the
reasons you might choose some other
language its nearest competitor is
arguably Visual Basic another native
dotnet language which offers most of the
same benefits as c-sharp c-sharp is part
of the C family of languages and if you
are familiar with at least one language
from that group which includes C C++
objective-c Java and JavaScript
Visual Studio offers another language
designed specifically for the.net
framework called f-sharp this is a very
different language from C sharp and
Visual Basic and it seems to be aimed
mostly at calculation intensive
applications such as engineering and the
more technical areas of Finance it is
good for expressing particularly complex
computations so if you're working on
applications that spend much more of
their time thinking than doing F sharp
maybe for you if you have a development
shop full of Ruby experts choosing
c-sharp for your next web application
might not be the most effective use of
the available talent
although c-sharp most superficially
obvious feature is at C family syntax
perhaps its most distinctive feature is
that it was the first language designed
to be a native in the world of the CLR
c-sharp embraces the dotnet framework
both the runtime and the libraries so
these dilemmas do not arise in the
scenario just discussed list has no
rival there is no friction when using
dotnet libraries because they are built
for the same world as c-sharp
that's what compilers usually do and in
fact c-sharp has steadily added its own
abstractions but the first version of
c-sharp presented a model that was very
closely related to the CLR zone model
and the abstractions it has added since
have been designed to fit well with the
CLR
this gives c-sharp a distinctive feel
from other languages
you
this means that if you want to
understand c-sharp you need to
understand the CLR and the way in which
it runs code the CLR is Microsoft's
implementation of the runtime for dotnet
languages such as C sharp and Visual
Basic other implementations such as mono
do not use the CLR but they have
something equivalent
key features of the c-sharp language
include the following component
orientation an excellent way to manage
complexity in a program is to subdivide
it into several interacting components
some of which can be used in multiple
scenarios c-sharp has been designed to
make component building easy and
provides component oriented language
constructs such as properties events and
declarative constructs called attributes
one-stop coding everything pertaining to
a declaration in c-sharp is localized to
the declaration itself rather than being
spread across several source files or
several places within a source file
types do not require additional
declarations in separate header or
interface definition language IDL files
a properties get / set methods are
logically grouped documentation is
embedded directly in a declaration etc
you
versioning c-sharp provides features
such as explicit interface
implementations hiding inherited members
and read-only modifiers which help new
versions of a component work with older
components that depend on it type safety
and a unified type system c-sharp is
type safe which ensures that a variable
can be accessed only through the type
associated with that variable this
encapsulation encourages good
programming design and eliminates
potential bugs or security breaches by
making it impossible for one variable to
inadvertently or maliciously overwrite
another
automatic and manual memory management
c-sharp relies on a runtime that
performs automatic memory management
this frees programmers from disposing
objects which eliminates problems such
as dangling pointers memory leaks and
coping with circular references however
c-sharp does not eliminate pointers it
merely makes them unnecessary for most
programming tasks leveraging of the CLR
a big advantage of c-sharp over other
languages particularly traditionally
compiled languages such as C++ is its
close fit with the dotnet CLR many
aspects of c-sharp alias the CLR
especially its type system memory
management model and exception handling
mechanism
you
for years the most common way for a
compiler to work was to process source
code and to produce output in a form
that could be executed directly by the
computer's CPU compilers would produce
machine code a series of instructions in
whatever binary format was required by
the kind of CPU the computer had many
compilers still work this way but the
c-sharp compiler does not instead it
uses a model called managed code with
managed code the runtime generates the
machine code that the CPU executes not
the compiler this enables the runtime to
provide services that are hard or even
impossible to provide under the more
traditional model the compiler produces
an intermediate form of binary code the
intermediate language il and the runtime
provides the executable binary at
runtime
you
you can write a dotnet component that
on the 32-bit x86 architecture that pcs
have used for decades but which will
also work well in the newer 64-bit
update to that design x64
and also on completely different
architectures such as arm and attend iam
the exact moment at which the CLR
generates executable machine code can
very typically it uses an approach
called just-in-time
JIT compilation in which each individual
function is compiled at runtime the
first time it runs processor independent
JIT compilation is not the main benefit
offered by managed code the greatest
payoff is the set of services the
runtime provides one of the most
important of these is memory management
you
the runtime provides a garbage collector
a service that automatically frees
memory that is no longer in use this
means that in most cases you do not need
to write code that explicitly returns
memory to the operating system once you
have finished using it although c-sharp
close connection with the runtime is one
of its main defining features it's not
the only one
Visual Basic has a similar connection
with the CLR
but c-sharp is distinguished from Visual
Basic by more than just syntax it has a
somewhat different philosophy
runtime interactivity programs can
richly interact with each other at
runtime through their metadata a program
can search for new types at runtime then
instantiate and invoke methods on those
types portability programs can be run
without recompiling on any operating
system and processor combination that
supports the CLR a key element of this
platform independence is the runtimes
JIT just-in-time compiler which compiles
the MSI l code it is fed to native code
that runs on the underlying platform
security security considerations
permeate the design of the dotnet
framework the key to making this
possible is CL ARS ability to analyze
MSI L instructions as being safe or
unsafe
you
simplified deployment and assembly is a
completely self-describing package that
contains all the metadata and M si L of
a program deployment can be as easy as
copying the assembly to the client
computer versioning and assembly can
function properly with new versions of
assemblies it depends on without
recompilation key to making this
possible is the ability to resolve all
type references though metadata simplify
development the CLR provides many
features that greatly simplify
development including services such as
garbage collection exception handling
debugging and profiling
cross-language integration the common
type system CTS of the CLR defines the
types that can be expressed in metadata
and MS il and the possible operations
that can be performed on those types the
CTS is broad enough to support many
different languages including microsoft
languages such as C sharp vb.net and
visual C++ net and such third-party
languages as COBOL Eiffel Haskell
Mercury ml Oberon Python Smalltalk and
scheme interoperability with legacy code
the CLR provides inter operation with
the vast base of existing software
written income and c.net types can be
exposed as comm types and comm types can
be imported as dotnet types in addition
the CLR provides P invoke which is a
mechanism that enables C functions strux
and callbacks to be easily used from
within in a dotnet program
c-sharp favors general
purpose language features over
specialized ones over the years
Microsoft has expanded c-sharp several
times and the languages designers always
have specific scenarios in mind for new
features however they try have always
tried hard to ensure that each new
element they add is useful beyond just
the scenario for which it was designed
one of the goals for c-sharp 3.0 was
that database access should feel well
integrated with the language the
resulting technology language integrated
query linq certainly supports that goal
but Microsoft achieved this without
adding any direct support for data
access to the language version 3.0 of
c-sharp made it very much easier to
process lists sets and other groups of
objects because the new features work
for collections of things from any
origin not just databases
perhaps the clearest illustration
this philosophy of generality was a
language feature that c-sharp chose not
to implement but which visual basic did
in V B you can write XML directly in
your source code
embedding expressions to calculate
values for certain bits of content at
runtime this compiles into code that
generates the completed XML at runtime
VB also has intrinsic support for
queries that extract data from XML
documents these same concepts were
considered for c-sharp as for querying
XML documents c-sharp supports this
through its general-purpose link q
features and does not add any XML
specific support XML star has waned
since this language concept was mooted
having been usurped in many cases by
JSON
you
the most significant new feature in
c-sharp 5.0 is support for asynchronous
programming dotnet has always offered
asynchronous api's I ones that do not
wait for the operation they perform to
finish before returning asynchrony is
particularly important with i/o
operations which can take a long time
and often don't require any active
involvement from the CPU except at the
start and end of an operation the
problem with the more efficient and
flexible asynchronous API has always
been that they are considerably harder
to use than their synchronous
counterparts but now if an asynchronous
API conforms to a certain pattern you
can write c-sharp code that looks almost
as simple as the synchronous alternative
would
although asynchronous support is a
rather specialized aspect of c-sharp
it's still fairly adaptable it can use
the task parallel library TPL introduced
in dotnet 4.0 but the same language
feature can also work with the new
asynchronous mechanisms that windows 8
uses in WinRT the API for writing Metro
applications
Visual Studio is Microsoft's development
environment there are various editions
ranging from free to eye-watering ly
expensive
all versions provide the basic features
such as a text editor build tools and a
debugger as well as providing visual
editing tools for user interfaces it's
not strictly necessary to use Visual
Studio the.net build system that it uses
is available from the command line so
you could use any text editor but it is
the development environment that most
c-sharp developers use so I'll start
with a quick introduction to working in
Visual Studio
c-sharp was initially created
specifically for use with the.net
platform c-sharp is used with the.net
framework which allows you access to a
number of libraries that are
specifically intended for use with
Windows the common language runtime CLR
is the component of the dotnet framework
that allows you to compile and execute
applications written in either c-sharp
or visual basicnet c-sharp is designed
to be simple type safe object-oriented
and high-performance
c-sharp applications consist of human
readable source code written in a text
editor the source code is compiled into
Microsoft intermediate language ms IL
which at runtime is compiled into
machine code a namespace is a way of
grouping the names that you assign to
elements in your application so that
they don't conflict with other names
either yours or those assigned by
Microsoft or other developers classes
are the core building blocks of c-sharp
and object-oriented programming because
they allow you to create new types that
model types in the problem domain that
is that model things in the area you are
concerned with
a method is a named block of code that
performs an action and that may return a
value a comment is a note for the
programmer and does not affect the
running of the application a string is a
set of text characters enclosed in
quotes you can use C sharp to develop
console applications Windows
applications web applications and web
services
