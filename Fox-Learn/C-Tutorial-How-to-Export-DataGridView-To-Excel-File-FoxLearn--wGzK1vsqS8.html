learn how to export data grid view to
excel file first you need to create a
simple UI that allows you to receive
Product data from the Northwind database
then export data from data grid view to
excel file
you
you
you
you
we will use entity framework to retrieve
data from the product table in the
Northwind database entity framework is
an object relational mapper that enables
dotnet developers to work with
relational data using domain-specific
objects it eliminates the need for most
of the data access code that developers
usually need to write you can download
the Northwind database below this video
you need to add a reference to Microsoft
Office enter up Excel assembly
you
you can use progress bar and background
worker to handle export data the
background worker class allows you to
run an operation on a separate dedicated
thread time-consuming operations like
downloads and database transactions can
cause your user interface to seem as
though it has stopped responding while
they are running when you want a
responsive UI and you are faced with
long delays associated with such
operations the background worker class
provides a convenient solution to setup
for a background operation at an event
handler for the do work event call your
time consuming operation in this event
handler to start the operation call run
worker a sync to receive notifications
of progress updates handle the progress
changed event to receive a notification
when the operation is completed and all
the run worker completed event
