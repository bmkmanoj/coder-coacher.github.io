learn how to use long for net
a lot of applications use logging as a
way to store information about performed
operations such data is very useful when
you have to diagnose an issue
logging could be done on many ways but
sometimes it's just easier to use an
existing solution I'd like to introduce
one of many libraries for logging but
quite powerful log4net
you need to install the package log4net
the log4net is a tool to help the
programmer output log statements to a
variety of output targets in case of
problems with an application it is
helpful to enable logging so that the
problem can be located with log4net it
is possible to enable logging at runtime
without modifying the application binary
the log4net package is designed so that
log statements can remain in ship code
without incurring a high performance
cost it follows that the speed of
logging is crucial at the same time log
out but can be so voluminous that it
quickly becomes overwhelming one of the
distinctive features of log4net is the
notion of hierarchical loggers using
these loggers it is possible to
selectively control which log statements
are output at arbitrary granularity you
need to create a new database then copy
the script to create the log table
you
you need to copy the appender
configuration to the app config file the
standard way to set up the log4net
logger is to utilize either the app
config file in a desktop application or
the web config file in a web application
there are a few pieces of information
that need to be placed in the config
file in order to make it work properly
with log4net these sections will tell
log4net how to configure itself the
settings can be changed without
recompiling the application which is the
whole point of a config file
