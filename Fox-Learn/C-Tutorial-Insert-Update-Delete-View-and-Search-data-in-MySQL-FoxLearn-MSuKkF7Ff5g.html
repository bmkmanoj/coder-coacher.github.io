learn how to insert delete update select
an my SQL
first we will design a simple form to
insert update select delete customer
data in my SQL database
you
you
you
you
you
we will use tab order to set order for
all the control the tab order is the
order in which the tab key moves the
input focus from one control to the next
within a dialog box usually the tab
order proceeds from left to right and
from top to bottom in a dialog box each
control has a tab stop property that
determines whether your control receives
input focus
you need to create a new database then
add a new table to the new database you
need to set customer ID column as a
primary key and identity is true Auto
increment allows a unique number to be
generated when a new record is inserted
into a table very often we would like
the value of the primary key field to be
created automatically every time a new
record is inserted
you
you
you need to create a data set then add a
customer table to the data set the data
set which is an in-memory cache of data
retrieved from a data source is a major
component of the a do dotnet
architecture the data set consists of a
collection of data table objects that
you can relate to each other with data
relation objects you can also enforce
data integrity in the data set by using
the unique constraint and foreign key
constraint objects we use the table
adapter to insert update delete data
table adapters provide communication
between your application and a database
more specifically a table adapter
connects to a database execute queries
or stored procedures and either returns
a new data table populated with the
return data or fills an existing data
table with the returned data table
adapters are also used to send updated
data from your application back to the
database table adapters are created with
added asset designer inside of strongly
typed data sets you can create table
adapters during creation of a new data
set with the data source configuration
wizard you can also create table
adapters in existing data sets with the
table adapter configuration wizard or by
dragging database objects from server
Explorer on to the data set designer
while table adapters are designed with
the data set designer the table adapter
classes generated are not generated as
nested classes of the data set they are
located in a separate namespace specific
to each data set
you
you
you can see the connection string
autorad in the config file we always use
connection string in forms that we
design but when you design a big
software you should set the connection
string for once and use it in many forms
in this method you use the name of the
connection string instead of the
connection string text every time you
want to change the connection string
just change the main connection string
in the app config file
you
we will use link you to query data the
language integrated query is a set of
features introduced in Visual Studio
2008 that extends powerful query
capabilities to the language syntax of
c-sharp and visual basic when Q
introduces standard easily learned
patterns for querying and updating data
and the technology can be extended to
support potentially any kind of data
store Visual Studio includes Mankiw
provider assembly that enable the use of
link you with dotnet framework
collections SQL Server databases a do
dotnet data sets and XML documents
