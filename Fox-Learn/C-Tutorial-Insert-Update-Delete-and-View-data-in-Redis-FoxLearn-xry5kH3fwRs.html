learn how to insert update delete in
Reddy's
first you need to install the package
Metro framework the Metro framework
brings Windows 8 UI to dotnet windows
forms applications
we will design a simple UI that allows
you to insert update delete data to
readies server
you need create a simple phone class
with ID manufacturer model properties
you need to add a binding source to
match all grid-view the binding source
component serves two purposes first it
provides a layer of indirection when
binding the controls on a form to data
this is accomplished by binding the
binding source component to your data
source and then binding the controls on
your form to the binding source
component all further interaction with
the data including navigating sorting
filtering and updating is accomplished
with calls to the binding source
component second the binding source
component can act as a strongly typed
data source adding a type to the binding
source component with the add method
creates a list of that type
you
we will add tab order to form one the
tab order is the order in which a user
moves focus from one control to another
by pressing the tab key each form has
its own tab order by default the tab
order is the same of the order in which
you created the controls tab order
numbering begins with zero you need to
install the package service stack
readies this package allow you to
connect your Eddy's server you can
insert update delete and search data
from ready server
you
you
you can use Reddy's desktop manager to
view data readies desktop manager is a
fast open source readies database
management application for Windows Linux
and Mac OS this tool offers you an easy
to use GUI to access your ready Stevi
and perform some basic operations view
keys as a tree create read update delete
Keys execute commands via shell readies
desktop manager supports SSL TLS
encryption SSH tunnels and cloud readies
instances such as Amazon ElastiCache
Microsoft Azure readies cash-in readies
labs
