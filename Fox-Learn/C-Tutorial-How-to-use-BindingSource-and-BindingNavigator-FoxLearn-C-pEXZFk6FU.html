learn how to use binding force and bind
and navigator
first you need to add a datagridview to
form one in a simple user class to your
project and then rebuild your project
and add a data source to the data grid
view control we will use binding source
to add to the data grid view data source
the binding source component serves many
purposes first it simplifies binding
controls on a form too dated by
providing currency management changed
notification and other services between
Windows forms controls and data sources
this is accomplished by attaching the
binding source component to your data
source using the data source property
for complex binding scenarios you can
optionally set the data member property
to a specific column or list in the data
source you then bind controls to the
binding source all further interaction
with the data is accomplished with toss
to the binding source component binding
source provides members for accessing
the underlying data the current item can
be retrieved through the current
property and the entire list can be
retrieved through the list property
editing operations are supported on the
current item through current and the
remove current and edit cancel edit and
out of add new methods now we will add a
binding navigator control to form one
and then set the binding navigator data
forcing the data grid view datasource
the binding Navigator control represents
a standardized way to navigate and
manipulate data on a form in most cases
a binding navigator is paired with a
binding source control to move three
data records on a form and interact with
them
in these cases the binding source
property is set to the Associated system
windows form funding source component
that acts as a data source by default
the binding navigator controls user
interface is composed of a series of
toolstrip buttons text boxes and static
text elements for most common data
related actions such as adding data
deleting data and navigating through
data each of these controls can be
retrieved or set through an Associated
member of the binding navigator control
you can move next record or move forward
record and you can easily delete or add
a new record to datagridview control
