learn how to insert update delete and
view data from SQL Server
you
first you need to install Metro
framework from nugget Metro modern UI or
Metro framework brings Windows 8 UI to
dotnet windows forms applications
we will design a simple UI allows you to
insert update delete and view data from
SQL Server
you
you should create a new database then
add a student table to the new database
we will set identity - student ID column
Auto increment allows a unique number to
be generated when a new record is
inserted into a table we will create
stored procedure to insert update data a
stored procedure is nothing more than
prepared SQL code that you save so you
can reuse the code over and over again
so if you think about a query that you
write over and over again instead of
having to write that query each time you
would save it as a stored procedure and
then just call the stored procedure to
execute the SQL code that you saved as
part of the stored procedure in addition
to running the same SQL code over and
over again you also have the ability to
pass parameters to the stored procedure
so depending on what the need is the
stored procedure can act accordingly
based on the parameter values that were
passed
you need to create a student class to
mapping data returned from SQL Server
you can add an entity state with an
m-type to manage your object state
you
you should add a connection string to
the app config file we always use
connection string in forms that we
design but when you design a big
software you should set the connection
string for once and use it in many forms
in this method you use the name of the
connection string instead of the
connection string text every time you
want to change the connection string
just change the main connection string
in the app config file by this method
you don't need to change all of the
forms in your project just change the
connection string in the app config
you need to add a binding source to
Mitchell grid the binding source
component serves two purposes first it
provides a layer of indirection when
binding the controls on a form to data
this is accomplished by binding the
binding source component to your data
source and then binding the controls on
your form to the binding source
component all further interaction with
the data including navigating sorting
filtering and updating is accomplished
with calls to the binding source
component second the binding source
component can act as a strongly typed
data source adding a type to the binding
source component with the add method
creates a list of that type
you need to install dapper from nugget
dapper dotnet is one of the popular
object relational mapper for dotnet it
is an open source lightweight fast
simple and easy to use o RM it is a mini
ORM framework that is built directly on
top of ABA or net one of the advantages
of dapper is that it is lightweight it
does not cover all the features that in
hibernate or entity framework provides
dapper primarily focuses on simplicity
and performance instead of covering
every use case that entity framework and
in hibernate covers dapper does not
generate the SQL queries like entity
framework but instead lets the
developers were close to SQL it only
mapped the result of the query to the
Poco classes
you
you
you can delete data by SQL command or
stored procedure
you
you
you
now you can add a core project and data
access project to your solution we used
to separate your code
you need to create an interface then add
insert update delete and select method
to your interface an interface contains
only the signatures of methods
properties events or indexers a class or
struck that implements the interface
must implement the members of the
interface that are specified in the
interface definition
you need to install debris from Rajat
again
you can create a property to get your
connection string from app config file
now we will move the code to data access
project
you
you
you need to install Auto fact from
nugget Auto feck is an inversion of
control container from microsoft.net it
manages the dependencies between classes
so that applications stay easy to change
as they grow in size and complexity this
is achieved by treating regular dotnet
classes as components
you
you
