learn how to update an insert data in
database from data grid view
you need to add a button and
datagridview to form one when you click
the Save button your data save into the
database
you
you
you need to create a new database and
phonebook table
you
you need to settie column as a primary
key and identity is true Auto increment
allows a unique number to be generated
when a new record is inserted into a
table very often we would like the value
of the primary key field to be created
automatically every time a new record is
inserted
you
we use the table adapter to insert
update delete data table adapters
provide communication between your
application and a database more
specifically a table adapter connects to
a database execute queries or stored
procedures and either returns a new data
table populated with the return data or
fills an existing data table with the
returned data table adapters are also
used to send updated data from your
application back to the database table
adapters are created with added asset
designer inside of strongly typed
datasets you can create table adapters
during creation of a new data set with
the data source configuration wizard you
can also create table adapters in
existing data sets with the table
adapter configuration wizard or by
dragging database objects from server
Explorer on to the data so designer
while table adapters are designed with
the data set designer the table adapter
classes generated are not generated as
nested classes of the data set they are
located in a separate namespace specific
to each data set
you
you can see the connection string Auto
add in the config file we always use
connection string in forms that we
design but when you design a big
software you should set the connection
string for once and use it in many forms
in this method you use the name of the
connection string instead of the
connection string text everytime you
want to change the connection string
just change the main connection string
in the add config file
you
you
you can use the SQL profiler to monitor
SQL command SQL Server profiler is rich
interface decree and manage traces and
analyze and replay trace results the
events are saved in a trace file that
can later be analyzed or used to replay
a specific series of steps when trying
to diagnose a problem
