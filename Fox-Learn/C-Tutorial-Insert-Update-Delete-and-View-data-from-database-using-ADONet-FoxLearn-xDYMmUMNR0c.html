learn how to insert update delete and
view data from database
first you need to install Metro
framework from logic let your modern UI
or Metro framework print Windows 8 UI to
dotnet windows forms applications
we will design a simple UI MSE to insert
update delete and view data from SQL
Server
you should create a neat database then
add a student table to your database
you
you need to set identity is true
auto-increment allow the unique number
to be generated when a new record is
inserted into a table we will create
stored procedure to insert update data a
stored procedure is nothing more than
prepared SQL code that you save so you
can reuse the code over and over again
so if you think about a query that you
write over and over again instead of
having to write that query each time you
would save it as a stored procedure and
then just call the stored procedure to
execute the SQL code that you've saved
as part of the stored procedure in
addition to running the same SQL code
over and over again you also have the
ability to pass parameters to the stored
procedure so depending on what the
needed the stored procedure can act
accordingly based on the parameter
values that were passed
you
you
you need to create a student class to
mapping data returned from SQL Server
you
you can add an entity state to manage
your object state
you should add a connection string to
the app consus file we always use
connections training in forms that we
design but when you design a big
software you should set the connection
string for once and use it in many forms
in this method you use the name of the
connection string instead of a
connection string text every time you
want to change the connection string
just change the main connection string
in the app concert file by this method
you don't need to change all of the
forms in your project just change the
connection string in the app config
you need to add a binding source to
Mitchell grant the binding source
component serves two purposes first it
provides a layer of indirection when
binding the controls on a form to data
this is accomplished by binding the
binding source component to your data
source and then binding the controls on
your form to the binding source
component second the binding source
component inactives strongly type data
source
you
you need to install ado.net from magic
this package delivers an ad out
netlibrary
provides a fluent interface to throw
some SQL or DDL at your database
compatible with all a do dotnet
providers and as far as they implement
the ato dotnet interfaces correctly
you can add query to retrieve data from
student table
you
you
you can call stored procedure from
stored procedure method
you
you
you
you
you
