learn how to insert update delete and
view data from database
first you need to install Metro
framework from nugget Metro modern UI or
Metro framework brings windows API to
dotnet windows forms applications
we will design a simple UI MSE to insert
update delete and view data from SQL
Server
you
you need to create a student class to
mapping data returned from SQL Server
you need to install entity framework
from nugget entity framework is an
object relational mapper that enables
dotnet developers to work with
relational data using domain-specific
objects it eliminates the need for most
of the data access so that developers
usually need to write entity framework
code first is mainly useful in domain
driven design with the code first
approach you can focus on the domain
design and start creating classes of
ferrer domain requirement rather than
design your database first and then
create the classes which match your
database design code first a POS will
create the data base on the slide based
on your entity classes and configuration
you need to add a connection string to
data context you can define the
connection string in your app config
file we always use connection string in
forms that we design but when you design
a big software you should set the
connection string for once and use it in
many forms in this method you use the
name of the connection string instead of
the connection string text everytime you
want to change the connection string
just change the main connection string
in the app config file now you need to
enable migration for your application by
using the enable migrations command then
you can add migration and update
database
your database and tables will be
automatically created in SQL Server
you can set maximum length of characters
by using data annotation
you need to run at migration and update
database command again
you need to add a binding source to
match our grade the binding source
component serves two purposes first it
provides a layer of indirection when
binding the controls on a form to data
this is accomplished by binding the
binding source component to your data
source and then binding the controls on
your form to the binding source
component all further interaction with
the data including navigating sorting
filtering and updating is accomplished
with talk to the binding source
component second the binding source
component in active strongly cog data
source adding a cut to the binding
source component with the ad market
greets a list of that time
you
you
if you have an entity that you know
already exists in the database but which
is not really being tracked by the
context then you can tell the context to
track the entity using the attach method
on DD set to delete your object you can
set it state to deleted
and
you
you can add an object state to check
your object status
if you have an entity that you know
already exists in the database that to
which changes may have been made then
you can count the context to attach the
entity and set its state to modified
you
you
you
you can remove the object state then
change your code
you
