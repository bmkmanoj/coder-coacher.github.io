learn how to insert update delete and
view data from SQL Server first you need
to install Metro framework from nugget
Metro modern UI or Metro framework
brings Windows 8 UI to dotnet windows
forms applications
you
we will design a simple UI allows you to
insert update delete and view data from
SQL Server
you
you should create a new database then
add a student table to the new database
we will set identity - student ID Collin
autoincrement
allow the unique number to be generated
when a new record is inserted into a
table we will create stored procedure to
insert update data the stored procedure
is nothing more than prepared SQL code
that you save so you can reuse the code
over and over again so if you think
about a query that you write over and
over again instead of having to write
that query each time you would save it
as a stored procedure and then just call
the stored procedure if you execute the
SQL code that she's saved as part of the
stored procedure in addition to running
the same SQL code over and over again
you also have the ability to pass
parameters to the stored procedure so
depending on what the needed the stored
procedure can act accordingly based on
the parameter values that were passed
you
you
you should create a student class -
mapping data return from SQL Server
you can add an entity state with an
m-type to manage your object state
you should add a connection string to
the app confid file we always use
connection string in forms that we
design but when you design a big
software you should set the connection
string for once and use it in many forms
in this method you use the name of the
connection string instead of the
connection string text every time you
want to change the connection string
just change the main connection string
in the app constant file by this method
you don't need to change all of the
forms in your project just change the
connection string in the app on think
you need to add a binding source to
match our grid the bindings first
component serves two purposes
first it provides a layer of indirection
when binding the controls on a form to
data second the binding source component
in act is a strongly typed data source
you need to install dapper from nugget
Gabbar dotnet is one of the popular
object relational mapper for dotnet it
is an open source lightweight fast
simple and easy to use o RM it is a mini
or and framework that is built directly
on top of a bayonet one of the
advantages of Gabbar is that it is
lightweight it does not cover all the
features that in hibernate or entity
framework provides Gabbar primarily
focuses on simplicity and performance
instead of covering every use case that
entity framework and hibernate covers
Gabbar does not generate the SQL queries
like entity framework but instead lets
the developers were close to SQL it only
mapped the result of the query to the
cocoa classes
you
you can delete data by SQL command or
stored procedure
you
you
you can get student ID from output value
you
you
you
you
you
you
you
you should add a core project and data
access project to your solution we will
update our project to three-tier
architecture three-tier architecture
means dividing project in three layers
user interface layer business layer and
data layer where we separate logic data
and user interface in three division
presentation layer is your user
interface layer where you can design
your interface using HTML web controls
Windows controls or mobile controls this
layer only communicates with business
layer business layer is the middle layer
or bridge layer that connects database
layer and presentation layer in this
layer you can write your business logic
or any validation code this layer
communicates with database layer and
presentation layer database layer which
makes the connection to the database
server in this layer you can write
database connection and SQL queries or
stored procedures this layer only
communicates with business layer you
need to create an interface then add
insert update delete and select method
to your interface an interface contains
only the signatures of methods
properties events or indexes a class or
struct that implements the interface
must implement the members of the
interface that are specified in the
interface definition
you need to install dapper to data
access project you can install gapper
from nugget
you
now we will move the code to data access
project we will use data access to
access data from SQL Server you should
create a helper class then add a
property to get your connection string
from a constant file
you
now we will create a business project to
process your business rules
you need to install Auto fact a business
project you can install auto back from
nugget Auto Beck is an inversion as
control container for microsoft.net it
manages the dependencies between classes
so that applications stay easy to change
as they grow in size and complexity this
is achieved by treating regular dotnet
classes as components
from business project you can easily
change data access to any ORM or any
database for example MySQL SQL Server is
this database etc
you
