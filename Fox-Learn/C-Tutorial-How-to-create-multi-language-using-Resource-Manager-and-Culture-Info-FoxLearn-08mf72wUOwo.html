learn how to set the culture and UI
culture for Windows forms globalization
first you need to add a button a
datagridview
and a label to form one your data in
datagridview save to XML file when you
click Save button the label control
shows text with differents language
based on your language setting in the
application
you need to create a data set then add a
language table to the data set this
table will save the data languages and
you can use to generate language
resources
you
to create a resources file create a
resource writer with a unique file name
call add resource at least once call
generate to write the resources file to
disk and then calls close to close the
file
calling close will implicitly call
generate if you do not explicitly call
generate
you
you
you can see the resources file generated
in debug folder
the two cultures values of a visual
c-sharp application determine what
resources are loaded for an application
and how information like currency
numbers and dates is formatted the
resource is loaded are determined by the
UI culture setting and the formatting
options are determined by the culture
setting the first place and application
will search for culture values is the
current culture and current UI culture
properties the current culture
properties default value is the
operating systems user local which is
set in the regional options control
panel the current UI culture properties
default value is the operating systems
user interface language which is the
language of your operating system UI on
Windows 2000 and Windows XP
multi-language addition the current dua
culture defaults to the current user UI
language settings the resource manager
class retrieves resources from a binary
resources file that is embedded in an
assembly or from a standalone resources
file if an app has been localized and
localized resources have been deployed
in satellite assemblies it looks up
culture specific resources provides
resource fallback when a localized
resource does not exist and supports
resource serialization
you can see the label display English
language now we will change from English
language to German language and you can
see the text change thank you for
