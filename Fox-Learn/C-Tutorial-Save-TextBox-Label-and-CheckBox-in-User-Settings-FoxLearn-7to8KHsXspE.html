learn how to save textbox label and
check box and user settings
first we will design a simple UI that
allows you to save data to user settings
starting with the.net framework 2.0 you
can create an access values that are
persisted between application execution
sessions these values are called
settings settings can represent user
preferences or valuable information the
application needs to use for example you
might create a series of settings that
store user preferences for the color
scheme of an application or you might
store the connection string that
specifies a database that your
application uses settings allow you to
both persist information that is
critical to the application outside the
code and to create profiles that store
the Preferences of individual users
you
you
settings that our application scoped our
read only and can only be changed at
design time or by altering the config
file in between application sessions
settings that our user scoped however
can be written at runtime just as you
would change any property value the new
value persists for the duration of the
application session you can persist the
changes to the settings between
application sessions by calling the save
method the application settings feature
of Windows forms makes it easy to create
store and maintain custom application
and user preferences on the client with
application settings you can store not
only application data such as database
connection strings but also user
specific data such as toolbar positions
and most recently used lists
