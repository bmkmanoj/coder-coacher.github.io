learn how to save and retrieve image
from database
first you need to create a new database
and table name is my picture we will
save images in the my pictures table and
retrieve again when you click the load
button on your application
we will set the ID column as primary key
and Auto increment is true Auto
increment allows a unique number to be
generated when a new record is inserted
into a table
you need to add a list view a picture
box and three buttons to form one when
you click open button an open dialog
show allow you select an image file your
image selected shows in picture box
control and when you click the Save
button your data save in the my pictures
table the load button allows you get all
data from my pictures table we will use
entity framework to save and retrieve
data entity framework is an object
relational mapper that enables dotnet
developers to work with relational data
using domain-specific objects it
eliminates the need for most of the data
access code that developers usually need
to write any framework allows you to
create a model by writing code or using
boxes and lines in the entity framework
designer both of these approaches can be
used to target an existing database or
create a new database
now we will add a filename item in
ListView control it allows show file
name data when we retrieve data from
database
you
you
you need to write function convert image
to binary we use to load an image into
memory stream and convert memory stream
to byte array memories streams created
with an unsigned byte array provide a
non resizable stream of the data when
using a byte array you can neither
repent an or shrink the stream although
you might be able to modify the existing
contents depending on the parameters
passed into the constructor
you
to save synchronously you need to use a
sync keyword the method runs
synchronously until it reaches its first
weight expression at which point the
method is suspended until the awaited
task is complete if the method that the
assign keyword modifies doesn't contain
in a weight expression or statement the
method executes synchronously a compiler
warning alerts you to any sync methods
that don't contain a weight because that
situation might indicate an error
we will add all my picture objects into
ListView control we used two for each
loop to retrieve them my picture object
in the list my picture object
you need to write function convert
binary to image we will read all byte
arrays and using the memory stream to
convert binary to image type
you can see the connection string
auto-create we always use connection
string in forms that we design but when
you design a big software you should set
the connection string for once and use
it in many forms in this method you use
the name of the connection string
instead of the connection string text
every time you want to change the
connection string just change the main
connection string in the app config file
by this method you don't need to change
all of the forms in your project just
change the connection string in the app
config
now we will select data from my pictures
table and you can see your data in this
table
