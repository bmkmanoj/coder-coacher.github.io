you
humans are model builders we create
models of the world to manage complexity
and to help us understand problems we're
trying to solve you see models all the
time street maps are models of roadways
Globes are models of the earth atomic
models are models of the interaction of
subatomic particles models are
simplifications there is little point to
a model that is as complex as the object
in the problem domain a good
object-oriented design is an accurate
model of the problem you are trying to
solve
you
look at your computer you do not see
various bits of plastic and glass
amorphous lis merging with the
surrounding environment you naturally
and inevitably see distinct things a
computer a keyboard a monitor speakers
pens paper things more importantly even
before you decide to do it you've
categorized these things you immediately
classify the computer on your desk as a
specific instance of a type of thing
this computer is one of type computer
this particular pen in your pocket is an
instance of a more general type of thing
pens
you
when you define a class you describe the
characteristics and behavior of objects
of that type in c-sharp you describe
characteristics with member fields
member fields are used to hold each
object state for example the state of
the dog is defined by its current weight
and name
the heart of object-oriented design is
establishing relationships among the
classes classes interact and relate to
one another in various ways the simplest
interaction is when a method in one
class is used to call a method in a
second class for example the manager
class might have a method that calls the
update salary method on an object of
type employee this process of
aggregation or composition allows you to
build very complex classes by assembling
and combining relatively simple classes
the.net framework provides a string
class to handle text strings
you
object-oriented programming is built on
three pillars encapsulation
specialization and polymorphism each
class should be fully encapsulated that
is it should fully define the state and
responsibilities of that type
specialization allows you to establish
hierarchical relationships among your
classes polymorphism allows you to treat
a group of hierarchically related
objects in a similar way and have the
objects sort out how to implement the
programming instructions
you
encapsulation the first pillar of
object-oriented programming is
encapsulation the idea behind
encapsulation is that you want to keep
each type or class discrete and
self-contained so that you can change
the implementation of one class without
affecting any other class a class that
provides a method that other classes can
use is called a server a class that uses
that method is called a client
encapsulation allows you to change the
details of how a server does its work
without breaking anything in the
implementation of the client
you
specialization the second pillar of
object-oriented programming
specialization is implemented in c-sharp
through inheritance specifically by
declaring that a new class derives from
an existing class the specialized class
inherits the characteristics of the more
general class the specialized class is
called a derived class and the more
general class is known as a base class
the specialization relationship is
referred to as the is a relationship a
dog is a mammal a car is a vehicle dog
would be derived from the base class
mammal and car from the base class
vehicle
polymorphism polymorphism the third
pillar of object-oriented programming is
closely related to inheritance the
prefix poly means many more fiends form
thus polymorphism refers to the ability
of a single type or class to take many
forms
sometimes you will know you have a
collection of a general type for example
a collection of controls but you do not
know or care about the specific subtype
of each control the important thing is
that you know they all inherit shared
abilities and that you can treat them
all as controls
before you program anything other than a
trivial demonstration program you need
to take two steps analysis and design
analysis is the process of understanding
and detailing the problem you are trying
to solve design is the actual planning
of your solution with trivial problems
such as computing the Fibonacci series
you may not need an extensive analysis
period but with complex business
problems the analysis process can take
weeks or even months
once you've analyzed the problem you
design the solution imagining the
classes you will use and their
interrelationships is key to the design
process you might design a simple
program on the fly without this careful
planning but in any serious business
application you will want to take some
time to think through the issues
you
there are many powerful design
techniques you might use how much time
you put into design before you begin
coding will depend on the philosophy of
the organization you work for the size
of your team and your background
experience and training
you
object-oriented programming helps
programmers manage complexity by
modeling essential aspects of the
real-world problem a class defines a new
type in your program and is typically
used as a representation for a type of
thing in the problem domain an object is
an instance of a class state is the
current condition of an object
you
many classes to find member fields which
are typically private variables visible
to every method of the class but not
outside the class the behavior of the
class is defined with methods which
contain code to perform an action
methods can manipulate the state of the
object and interact with other objects
the three pillars of object-oriented
programming are encapsulation
specialization and polymorphism
encapsulation requires that each class
should be discrete and self-contained
each class should know or do one
discrete thing or set of things
you
specialization is implemented by
deriving more specific classes from
generalized base classes through
inheritance
polymorphism allows you to treat a
collection of objects of types all
derived from a common base as though
each was an instance of that base type
you
analysis is the process of detailing the
problem you're trying to solve
you
design is the planning of the solution
to the problem
you
