learn how to create a crystal report
first we will design a simple UI allows
you to retrieve products data from
Northwind database
we will use stored procedure to retrieve
data from product table a stored
procedure is nothing more than prepared
SQL code that you save so you can reuse
the code over and over again so if you
think about a query that you write over
and over again instead of having to
write that query each time you would
save it as a stored procedure and then
just call the stored procedure to
execute the SQL code that you saved as
part of the stored procedure in addition
to running the same SQL code over and
over again you also have the ability to
pass parameters to the stored procedure
so depending on what the needed the
stored procedure can act accordingly
based on the parameter values that were
passed
we will use entity framework to retrieve
products data from stored procedure
entity framework is an object relational
mapper that enables dotnet developers to
work with relational data using
domain-specific objects it eliminates
the need for most of the data access
code that developers usually need to
write
you need to add a binding force to your
data grid view the binding source
component serves two purposes first it
provides a layer of indirection when
binding the controls on a form to data
this is accomplished by binding the
binding source component to your data
source and then binding the controls on
your form to the binding source
component all further interaction with
the data including navigating sorting
filtering and updating is accomplished
with calls to the binding source
component second the binding source
component in act is a strongly typed
data source adding a type to the binding
source component with the add method
creates a list at that time
you need to create a crystal report then
we will design a simple report to
display products data from Northwind
database Crystal Reports is a business
intelligence application it is used to
design and generate reports from a wide
range of data sources you need to add a
data source dear Crystal report
you
you need to create a print form dialogue
then add a crystal report viewer to your
print form
