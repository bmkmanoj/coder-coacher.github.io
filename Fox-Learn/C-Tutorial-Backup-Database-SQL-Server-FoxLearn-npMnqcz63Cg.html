learn how to backup a database
first we will design a simple UI allows
you to connect to the SQL server then
you can enter database name for backup
you
you need to include in your project for
libraries
the type of device he going to backup
database files or log the SQL database
name you need to backup
keep in mind that the file path you use
here is relative to the SQL Server not
your local file system
leaving the initialized value set to the
default of false we'll create a new
backup item as the last backup set if
you change the initialized value to true
then this backup set will become the
first backup set in will overwrite other
backups that have the same backup set
name
if you use multi breading to improve the
performance of your windows forms
applications you must make sure that you
make calls to your controls in a thread
safe way access to Windows forms
controls is not inherently thread safe
if you have two or more threads
manipulating the state of the control it
is possible to force the control into an
inconsistent state other thread related
bugs are possible such as race
conditions and deadlocks it is important
to make sure that access to your
controls is performed in a thread safe
way the.net framework provides methods
that are safe to call from any thread
for invoking methods that interact with
controls owned by other threads the
invoke method allows for the synchronous
execution of methods on controls whereas
the begin invoked method initiates a
synchronous execution to use these
methods you must declare a delegate with
the same signature as the method you
will be invoking then you can call the
invoke or begin invoke method of any
control on the form by supplying the
appropriate delegate to the method you
want to call
you
