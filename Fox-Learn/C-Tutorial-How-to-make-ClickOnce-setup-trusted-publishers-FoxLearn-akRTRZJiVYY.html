learn how to make click on setup trusted
publishers
click once in a deployment technology
that enables you to create self updating
Windows based applications that can be
installed and run with minimal user
interaction Visual Studio provides full
support for publishing and updating
applications to flight with click ones
technology if you have developed your
projects with Visual Basic and visual
c-sharp you should select your project
is release and select the platform
target for your application when you
publish an applications you need to
create a test certificate signing the
manifests ensure that no one can tamper
with your deployment and download it to
another computer in place of lures you
need to enter the URL that you will
provide when you deploy the application
you should select include for all dll in
the published status column you should
have all of the prerequisites installed
on your computer when you actually
deploy your application to a customer
you will have to select the appropriate
version of the.net framework and windows
installer plus any other prerequisites
you need the prerequisites are installed
the first time the user runs the
application setup program select that
the application should check for updates
check box and then click before the
application starts this will enable
automatic updates you can also specify
support URL and an air URL that users
can go to if they experience
installation problems at a minimum you
must complete the product name and
publish your name in the product name
textbox type the name of the application
shortcut in the publisher name textbox
type the name of the folder that will be
listed on the Windows Start menu in the
suite name textbox type the name of the
subfolder that will appear under the
publisher name click the manifests tab
and then select the creat desktop
shortcut checkbox when the user installs
the application it will create a desktop
shortcut in addition to the shortcut on
this Start menu
you need to upload it to the web server
you can see publisher is unknown to
convict click once trusted publishers
you must always sign the click ones
deployment and application manifests
with a publisher certificate next the
certificate is to sign a click ones
application must be configured in the
trusted publishers certificate store on
the user's machine and finally the
certificate authority that issue the
certificate must be configured in the
trusted root certificate authority
certificate store on the user's machine
when a click ones application is being
launched on a user's desktop the first
time the dotnet framework runtime will
first check to ensure that the
application manifests have not been
tampered with since they were signed
with whatever publishers certificate was
used for sunny if they pass a check the
runtime will then look into the trusted
root certification authorities store and
see if the certificate for the issuer of
the publishers certificate is installed
in that store it will then look at who
the publisher on the certificate is and
see if their certificate is in the
trusted publishers store
when publishing a click ones application
changing the published version property
causes the application to be published
as an update by default Visual Studio
automatically increments the revision
number of the published version each
time you publish the application you can
see publisher is false learn after an
application Trust has been created for a
given application either due to
automatic configuration based on a
trusted publisher certificate or based
on the user being prompted and allowing
the application to install subsequent
versions of the same application will
not need to prompt again unless the
requested security permissions change
we sent icon for the application it will
show on the desktop shortcut
open your control panel you can see the
application installed in programs and
features
if you want to force the user to install
an update select the specified minimum
required version for this application
checkbox and enter the version number
that you are deploying
