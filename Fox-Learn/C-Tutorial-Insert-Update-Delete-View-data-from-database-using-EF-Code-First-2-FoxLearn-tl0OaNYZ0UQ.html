learn how to insert update the late and
view data from database
first you need to install Metro
framework from nugget Metro modern UI or
Metro framework brings Windows 8 UI to
dotnet windows forms applications
we will design a simple UI allows you to
insert update delete and view data from
SQL Server
you need to create a student class to
mapping data returned from SQL Server
you need to install entity framework
from nugget entity framework is an
object relational mapper that enables
dotnet developers to work with
relational data using domain-specific
objects it eliminates the need for most
of the data access code that developers
usually need to write entity framework
code first is mainly useful in domain
driven design with the code first
approach you can focus on the domain
design and start creating classes as per
Eyre domain requirement rather than
design your database first and then
create the classes which match your
database design code first api's will
create the database on the fly based on
your entity classes and configuration
you need to add a connection string to
data context you can define the
connection string in your app config
file we always use connection string in
forms that we design but when you design
a big software you should set the
connection string for once and use it in
many forms in this method you use the
name of the connection string instead of
a connection string text every time you
want to change the connection string
just change the main connection string
in the app config file now you need to
enable migration for your application by
using the enable migrations commends
then you can add migration and update
database
your database and tables will be
automatically created in SQL Server
you can set the maximum length of
characters by using data annotation
you need to run at migration and update
database command again
you need to add a binding source to
Mitchell grid the binding source
component serves two purposes first it
provides a layer of indirection when
binding the controls on a form to data
this is accomplished by binding the
binding source component to your data
source and then binding the controls on
your form to the binding source
component all further interaction with
the data including navigating sorting
filtering and updating is accomplished
with calls to the binding source
component second the binding source
component can act as a strongly typed
data source adding a type to the binding
source component with the add method
creates a list at that time
you need to set entity state to your
object the object context must know the
state of an object to Save Changes back
to the datasource object state entry
objects store entity state information
the Save Changes methods of the object
context process entities that are
attached to the context and update the
datasource depending on the entity state
of each object
