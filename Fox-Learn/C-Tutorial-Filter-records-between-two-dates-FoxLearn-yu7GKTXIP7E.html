learn how to filter records between two
dates first we will design a simple UI
that allows you to filter records
between two dates
you
you
the
you need to install dapper from nugget
Gabbar is a high-performance
micro ORM supporting SQL Server MySQL
SQLite SQL see Firebird etc object
relational mapper z' have been in use
for a long time to eliminate the
impedance mismatch that exists between
the object and data models in an
application Gabbar is an open source
lightweight ORM developed by the Stack
Overflow team that's very fast compared
to other awards primarily because of its
lightweight Gabbar would build keeping
performance and ease of use in mind they
provide support for both static and
dynamic object binding using
transactions using stored procedures and
also bulk inserts of data now we will
write query to filter orders between two
dates
you need to add a connection string to
the at constant file we always use
connection string in forms that we
design but when you design a big
software you should set the connection
string for once and use it in many forms
in this method you use the name of the
connection string instead of the
connection string text every time you
want to change the connection string
just change the main connection string
in the app config file by this method
you don't need to change all of the
forms in your project just change the
connection string in the app config
you need to create an orders class -
mapping data returned from SQL
you
you
you
you need to add a binding source to
datagridview
the binding source component serves two
purposes first it provides a layer of
indirection when binding the controls on
a form to data this is accomplished by
binding the binding source component to
your data source and then binding the
controls on your form to the binding
source component all further interaction
with the data including navigating
sorting filtering and updating is
accomplished with talk to the binding
source component seconds the binding
source component in active
strongly-typed datasource adding a type
to the binding source component with the
add method creates a list at that time
