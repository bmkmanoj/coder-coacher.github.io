you
Christopher Alexander first introduced
the concept of design patterns in civil
architecture in 1977 they were later
adapted to software design the academic
and commercial interest in software
design patterns has grown dramatically
over the last few years and design
patterns have been catalogued by a
number of researchers design patterns
are mostly seen as solutions to software
design issues they are of course not the
only solution to software design and
they should not be used to the exclusion
of all others component based design
software architecture aspect-oriented
programming and refactoring also have a
place
you
viewed against the larger backdrop of
software engineering design patterns can
be seen to present some of their own
challenges traceability the traceability
of a design pattern is hard to maintain
when programming languages offer poor
support for the underlying patterns the
physical implementation of a design
pattern in a programming language can be
scattered across a number of classes and
thus hard to trace reusability design
patterns are used and reused in the
design of a software system but with
little or no language support developers
must implement the patterns again and
again in a physical programming language
a design pattern does not give a
developer the same benefits that a
component does which can encapsulate
behavior and be reused as is
you
Ritt ability some design patterns have
several methods with trivial behavior
without good programming tools it can be
tedious to write all this code and
maintain it once again more compact and
powerful language features can alleviate
the programmers burden maintainability
using multiple patterns can lead to a
large cluster of mutually dependent
classes mutually dependent classes can
lead to maintainability problems when
implemented in a traditional
object-oriented programming language
current research is investigating how to
transform design patterns into reusable
artifacts so that developers won't have
to implement the same patterns over and
over
in 1997 Bertrand Meyer defined
reusability as the ability of software
elements to serve for the construction
of many different applications
in the context of design patterns a
specific language feature a language
library or a component could solve the
pattern implementation reusability
problem
meijer goes on to state that a design
pattern is component I zabal if it is
possible to produce a reusable component
which provides all the functions of the
pattern and that a successful pattern
cannot just be a book description it
must be a software component or a set of
components
you
design patterns offer a number of
benefits as they do the following
promote design reuse form a common
vocabulary and improve communication
within and across software development
teams improve documentation help
developers restructure a system
regardless of whether it used them
upfront
explicitly capture knowledge that
experienced developers already
understand implicitly facilitate
training of new developers transcend
programming language centric viewpoints
exploit and bring out the best in
programming languages
