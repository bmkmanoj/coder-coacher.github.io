am venket this is part 55 phase beador
tech review tutorial in this video we'll
discuss about implementing custom
sorting and paging in a grid view
control that does not use any data
source controls now before proceeding
with this video please watch parts 47 48
and 54 in parts 47 and 48 we discussed
about implementing custom sorting
integrity control that does not use any
data source controls and in part 54 we
discussed about implementing custom
paging in a grid we control that does
not use any data source controls in this
video we are going to modify the example
that we discussed in part 54 to include
custom sorting as well so at the end of
this video you know we should have a
grid view control that is custom
suitable and payable okay so please
watch part 54 before proceeding with
this video because this is continuation
to part 54 so obviously if we have to
enable sorting as well within the grid
we control then the first thing to do is
to obviously modify the stored procedure
that we discussed in part 54 so at the
moment if you look at the stored
procedure that we used in part 54 it has
three parameters the first two are the
input parameters page index and page
size and the third parameter is an
output parameter which gives us the
total number of rows now if we have to
sort the data and then get the required
number of rows then we need to have at
least two other input parameters for the
stored procedure you know basically the
first parameter is going to be the
column by which you want to sort the
data so if I click on employee ID then
we want to sort it by employee ID if I
click on gender column then I need to
sort it by gender column so to convey
that information which column on which
column the end user has clicked we need
to have an input parameter to the stored
procedure and then remember we can also
solve the grid we control in both
ascending and descending order so to
convey the sort direction we need to
have another parameter so first let's
include those two additional input
parameters for the stored procedure the
first one is going to be sort expression
which is going to tell us by which
column the data should be sorted and
is going to be of type and vector size
50 and the next input parameter is going
to be sort direction and that is also
going to be of type and vehicle size 50
okay
now at the moment if we look at the
implementation of the stored procedure
you know we are ordering the data by
employee ID always look at this
we are using this order by Clause as
part of this row number function okay
and in the previous session we discussed
about why we are computing the row
numbers okay now every time it's
actually sorted by employee ID but
instead of that hard-coded column name
there I'm going to use the sort
expression and sort direction to sort
the data based on those two input
parameters okay so I'm going to get rid
of that hard-coded employee ID there and
then you know I'm going to use these two
input parameters so case I'm going to
use case statement now if you're new to
case statement we discussed about this
in the sequel server video R series so
please watch a video from that video
series so van case when this sort
expression look at that we are saying
order by and we are using a case
statement so when the sort expression is
equal to employee ID and sort Direction
is
ass and a then we want to order the data
by you know employee ID column right and
the case statement and then I want to
look at this short direction is under
ascending so I want to sort the data in
ascending order okay on the other hand
when sort expression is employee ID and
sort Direction is descending then we
want to sort by employee ID bar in
descending order okay now we have just
done this for employee ID column but
keep in mind we have to do it for the
rest of the columns as well you know
name gender and City columns and just to
speed things up I have this code already
implemented okay so it's it's just a
copy-paste of the same kind of code all
right so let's format this properly so
if you look at this when sort expression
its name and saw Direction its ascending
then we are sorting by name in ascending
order okay similarly for gender and City
columns okay
so that's the first change that we need
to do so let's alter the stored
procedure so plus f5 command completed
successfully so we have changed the
stored procedure now let's quickly test
this look at this at the moment you know
the stored procedure has got five
parameters and again we have tested this
in the previous session if you look at
this at the moment you know this testing
code to test the stored procedure only
has three parameters so we need to
include you know the parameters for sort
expression and sort direction as well
now let's say when the end user has
clicked on the name column the data
should be sorted by name in ascending
order and then we should get the first
three records you know if the page size
is three so let's see if the stored
procedure is returning us the correct
set of the data that we need so if I am
on page one of the grid view control
then the page index will be zero so page
index is zero and the page size is three
now what is going to be the short
expression when I click on name column
short expression will be name so name
and then when I click it click on it for
the first time we want to sort the data
in ascending order so you know the sort
expression I mean the sort Direction
parameter is going to be ascending okay
and then let's retrieve you know just to
compare our data so select star from TBL
employee order by you know name column
in ascending order so that's the query
and this is this piece will test our
stored procedure so let's execute both
of them so if you look at this now look
at that this is from the query when the
data is ordered by name Dave David Jamie
that should be the first set of three
records returned by our stored procedure
notice this we get the correct set of
records now when I go to the second page
I should get you know John Mark and Mary
records you know by the stored procedure
so let's actually change the page number
to one and then execute this look at
that I get the correct set of records
John Mark and Mary here four five six is
John Mark and Mary okay so the stood
procedure is working as expected so the
next thing to do is obviously since we
have modified the stored procedure you
know we have to modify our data access
layer as well which is going to invoke
the stored procedure so if you look at
this data access layer it's invoking the
stored procedure at the moment we only
have three parameters here within the
data access layer so let's modify this
code to include the rest of the two
parameters sort expression and sort the
reaction so let me copy and paste this
twice and if you remember the parameter
names here are one is sort expression so
let me copy that and let's specify the
sort expression as I mean the parameter
name is sort expression and let's also
call this parameter
sort expression copy that
change the references okay and the value
obviously where is the value going to
come from the value will have to come
into this method as another parameter so
we have to include the two additional
parameters so one is the sort expression
and the other one is going to be sort
direction so both of them of type string
okay so that's sort expression let's
copy the parameter and that is going to
be the value for the sequel parameter
and then the next one is going to be
sword direction so let's copy that so
the name of the parameter is sword
erection and let's change the object
name as well
let's change the references and the
value again is coming into this method
as another parameter which is sort
direction so let's specify that here
so sort direction so that's the change
for data access layer so we we included
the stored procedure with two input
parameters and then we modified the
stored procedure the data access layer
to pass the values for those two
parameters so at the moment if you look
at this we change the employee data
access layer so obviously this employee
data access layer is being invoked in
our code-behind file as well so if you
look at the code-behind file obviously
we'll have some compilation errors here
because get employees method now it
expects five parameters but we are only
passing in three we'll fix that in a bit
but then first let's go ahead to the
grid we control at the moment look at
the column headers within the grid we
control we don't have sorting enable so
we want to enable sorting okay and to
enable sorting what we need to do is all
we need to set is allow sorting to true
okay now since we are using custom
sorting here now we are not using any of
the data source controls another thing
that I want to do is again as I told you
please watch parts 47 and 48 we
discussed about implementing custom
sorting and aggregate control without
using any data source controls and in
those videos we discussed about using
custom attributes okay so let's go ahead
and use two custom attributes on the on
this grid view control basically custom
sort field and custom sorted Direction
attributes which are going to be used in
order to determine by which column we
want to actually sort the data and in
which direction okay so on the script we
control I'm going to specify custom sort
fail
and then I'm going to specify that as
employee ID so by default you know I
want to sort it when the grid we control
first loads I want to sort it by
employee ID column and let's call this
custom sort direction and I want to sort
this in ascending order so I'm going to
set it to ascending so these two
attributes custom attributes alright so
now let's go ahead and change you know
the employee data access layer
references so if you look at this
employee data access layer this get
employees method at the moment you know
we are passing only three parameters so
we get those compliation errors so let's
go ahead and fix those compilation
errors okay so obviously within the page
load event if it's not a postback
meaning when the grid view control loads
for the first time you know we want to
sort the data by employee ID column okay
so obviously here if you look at the
employee data access layer the first
parameter is the page index the next
parameter is the page size and the third
parameter is going to be look at that
sort expression so where do I get this
sort expression from now don't you think
we can actually use the custom sort
field attribute of this grid view
control to do that
you know when the grid we control first
renders we want to sort it by employee
ID so here I am going to specify I grid
v1 dot attributes of what is the
attribute name custom sort field so I
want the value of that attribute where
the end user has specified by which
column he actually want to sort the data
the first time okay so that's going to
be my sort field and then your sort
direction that's the next parameter so
our sort Direction is going to come from
sort Direction attribute so let's copy
the attribute name and use that within
our code behind fire
okay so we fixed one reference of that
get employees method let's bring it to
the other line okay so let's actually
copy this because we need to fix it at
other places as well okay when I you
know click the paging button even at
that point of time I am going to use the
sort fail and this is going to be custom
sort direction
okay so let's go ahead and run this and
see if it works as expected obviously
we'll have some errors we'll fix them as
we go but let's run this and see what is
happening at the moment with the changes
that we have made so obviously the first
time in the grid we control renders look
at that it's sorted by employee ID now
let's say I want to sort the data by
name column let me click on this name
column and see what's going to happen
look at that I get an error what is it
saying
the grid view grid v1 fired even sorting
which wasn't handled again we discussed
about this in parts 47 and 48 so when we
try to sort the data the grid we control
raises the sieve and sorting and that
needs to be handled so let's go ahead
and generate an event handler method and
to do that the easiest way is get to the
properties of the grid we control click
on the events icon and then we should
have sorting event so let's double click
on the event to generate the even
handler method
okay now let's implement the sort
agreement but then before that I need a
private method to do something so I have
that already you know implement and let
me copy and paste this again we
discussed about this private method in
our previous video sessions you know in
parts 47 and 48 okay let me quickly go
over this code so if you look at this
you know the sort grid view method what
is it doing it's taking in three
I mean basically four input parameters
the grid view that we want to sort you
know in our case it's going to be grid
v1 and then grid view sort event
arguments object so if you look at the
this sorting even handler method it gets
in those two parameters sender is
nothing but the grid view one control
which we are sorting and grid view sort
the event arguments object you know this
grid b1 underscore sorting even handler
method already receives those two input
parameters so we are going to actually
use this private method inside this even
handler method so we are going to call
that private method in this event
handler method okay so if you look at
this sort grid view so it has got those
two objects as parameters and
and I have two other output parameters
or direction and sort fear as I told you
we discussed about this method in detail
in paths 47 and 48 so if you haven't
watched them that those parts please
watch them before proceeding with this
video so what we are doing here is we
are basically initializing the two
output parameters sort direction and
sort field here with the value from this
grid view sort even two arguments object
so it has got sort expression property
which we are using to initialize sort
fear and sort Direction property to
initialize sort Direction output
parameter and then once we are done with
that now we are checking okay if the
grid we control dot attributes look at
that on the grid we control we have two
custom attributes current sort field and
current sort direction if they are not
equal to null if both of them are not
now and if short-field this what feel if
that is equal to the current sort fear
then what we are doing we are checking
the direction and if the direction is
already ascending so if the data is
sorted by a specific column in ascending
order and if the end user has clicked on
the same column again then we want to
set the sort direction to descending on
the other hand if the current sort
direction is not ascending then we know
it is descending meaning the previous
time it was sorted in descending order
and now we want to sort it in ascending
order and then finally what we are doing
we are updating the current sort field
and sort direction attributes of the
grid we control okay and obviously what
we need to do is the current sort
direction look at this sort direction
enum it returns as the complete name but
we don't want to store the complete name
in this custom attribute instead we want
to store those ASC and des see you know
the words so that's why we are comparing
that okay you saw a direction ascending
if that's the case use ASC otherwise we
know it will be descending in which case
use des a and then what we need to do
now will actually use the shortcut view
control I mean method the private method
within our event handler method
yeah again I have that code already
implemented let me copy and paste that
within the event handler method so this
is straightforward again so I am
creating two variables here one variable
of type sought a direction enum and I'm
initializing that to ascending and
another one is sort filled and
initializing that to an empty string and
look at what I am doing here I'm
actually calling of a private method
which we have just created and passing
in that private method grid v1 because
that's the first parameter and the
second parameter is the gridview
sort event arguments object so we are
passing that in and then the sort
direction and sort fear those are the
output parameters you know which we need
to pass into this method which are going
to receive you know by which column the
grid we control is sorted and in which
direction okay so once we get our sort
direction obviously we need to convert
that into ascending or descending
because you know sequel doesn't sequel
server doesn't respect the complete
words in order by Clause ascending and
descending instead we we need to use AAC
or DES a and then finally what we are
doing we are invoking the get employees
method of data access layer passing in
you know the page index the page size
sort expression and sort direction and
then the output parameter and then we
are data binding the grid we control and
data binding the repeater so pretty
straightforward code now if you have
followed pass 47 48 and path 54 this
should be very easy to understand so
let's save everything now let me go
ahead and run this and see if it works
as expected so when the grid we control
Enders the data should be sorted by
employee ID in ascending order okay and
that's what happens here
so I go to page number two look at that
four five six and seven eight now let me
actually sort the name by name look at
that the data data changes when I sort
by name on the first page we have Dave
David and Jamie and I go to the next
page look at that Pam Mike Pam David
and on the third page look at this we
have a problem here it's not working as
expected
so I sorted by name column let's see why
it's not working so somewhere you know
we have you know the attribute names may
not be correct so let's check that so
there are two beat names here a current
sort field and currents or direction and
let's check in the code-behind file oh
we are using custom sort field and
customs or direction those are the
attribute names that we are using here
but then within the code-behind file we
are saying the attribute names are
current sort fear so let's actually
change them to the right are names
so current sort field and the other one
is going to be current sort direction
let's copy that and paste that here
let's run it now and see if it works so
now we have an error here SP get
employees by page index expects the sort
expression which was not supplied so
when it's trying to execute the command
it is throwing an error let's say why we
are not passing in this or direction
okay again that could be where you know
we are calling that because if you look
at on the page load event what we are
doing we again using custom sort field
and custom sort direction so instead of
that it has to be current sort field and
currents or direction so let's fix that
so current sort fear and that has to be
current sought direction
so even here it has to be current short
fear and current south direction
all right so let's go ahead and run the
snap so the data should be sorted by
employee but let me click on name column
look at that the data is sorted by name
in ascending order I click on the name
column once again
look at that it's sorted in descending
order and I get you know the last set of
I mean data sorted by name in descending
order and the first set of three records
I click on the last page look at that
David and Dave there in the last page
now if I sort it by gender on the first
page look at that I get the two females
and then male if we go to the last page
only males so we can sort it by columns
we can page through so when we page
through the data is first sorted you
know by the column that we have
specified and gets the correct set of
Records based on the page that we are on
all right on this slide you can find the
