video we'll discuss what is WCF and why
should we use WCF to watch WC f WC f
stands for windows communication
foundation it's released as part of
dotnet 3.0 WCF is Microsoft platform for
building distributed and interoperable
applications first let us understand
what we mean by distributed and
interoperable application so what is a
distributed application in very simple
terms a distributed application is an
application where parts of it run on two
or more computer nodes distributed
applications are also called as
connected systems let's now look at an
example look at this diagram here FF
application is running on one machine
and the web service that this web
application is consuming is running on
another machine so this is a connected
system if you have watched part 7 from
the asp.net web services tutorial in
that video we have developed an asp.net
web application that consumes a weather
web service the web application that we
have developed is running on my machine
but the weather web server is that this
web application is consuming is running
on another machine that's present
somewhere in the world so that is a
connected system there now let's look at
another example of a connected system we
may have an enterprise web application
with these tears presentation business
and data access and each of these tears
may be running on a different machine
now you may be wondering why would
somebody break down an application into
different tiers and why would they
deploy those tiers on different machines
that's basically to improve the
scalability of the application first let
us understand what we mean by
scalability scalability means as the
number of users increase you don't want
the performance of the application to
degrade okay now if you have a few
visitors to your application then
probably you can deploy all of the tiers
on a single machine because single
machine can handle the request from few
users but then if you are expecting
hundreds and thousands of users
obviously to handle the requests from
all of these users you know you need
more Hardware more
processing capability so what you do is
you deploy your tears on different
machines and these different machines
has got their own processors and memory
so basically they will be able to handle
more requests because the presentation
logic is running on one machine business
logic is running on a separate machine
data access logic on a different machine
so instead of having all this logic
running on a single machine if we deploy
them on different machines obviously
they will be able to handle more
requests without degrading the
performance so your application will be
better scalable now let's turn our
attention to understand the motivation
for building distributed applications
why would somebody want to build
distributed applications there are
several reasons for this I have listed
two of them here one of the reasons
could be that an enterprise application
may need to use the services provided by
other enterprises for example an
e-commerce application may be using
PayPal service for payments
there are hundreds and thousands of
websites today that sell products when
we purchase products from the website at
the time of checkout you may have
noticed on the checkout page that you
can pay for the items that you have
purchased using PayPal so when you click
on that button what's happening there
the vendor web application there is
actually connecting to the PayPal
servers so basically the web application
itself is running on the vendor web
server but a PayPal service that that
application is talking to is running on
a PayPal web server so that's a
connected system there again and another
reason why we Mable the distributed
application is for better scalability
and we have discussed what we mean by
scalability just now the same example
all right
now let's understand what we mean by an
interoperable application an application
that can communicate with any other
application that is built on any
platform is called as an interoperable
application we know that Web Services
are interoperable and why our web
services are interoperable because they
use open protocols and message formats
web services use HTTP protocol and XML
message format any client any
application built on any platform can
understand these protocols and open
standards so obviously web services are
interoperable but dotnet remoting
services are not interoperable now if we
have to use a dotnet remoting service
then both the client and the server has
to be built using a dotnet now what
technology choices did we have before
WCF to build these distributed
applications we had several of them
actually we had Enterprise Services
dotnet remoting Web Services MSM Q and
there are a few others as well so in
spite of having so many technologies to
build distributed applications
why did Microsoft come up with tab UCF
so why should we actually use WCF let's
understand this with an example let's
take this scenario let's say we have two
clients and we need to implement this
service for them so the first client is
using java application to interact with
our service so for interoperability this
clients want messages to be an XML
format
and the protocol to be HTTP so to
satisfy this first client requirement we
would end up implementing a web service
so web services use HTTP protocol an XML
message format and we know that XML over
HTTP offers interoperability so the
requirement of the first client is math
so we have a web service there now let's
say the second client has said he wants
binary message over TCP protocol now
it's the same service exactly the same
service but he just want a different
protocol and a different message format
now to satisfy the requirement of this
client we end up writing a dotnet
remoting service and remoting is a
different technology altogether so it's
it has a completely different
programming model to that of web
services so now the developer has to
learn a different technology because the
client has different needs he wants
different message format and different
transport protocol but the service
itself is the same the application logic
data access logic everything
is the same it's just that the messages
has to be for this client in binary
format and the protocol has to be TCP
for the first client the protocol has to
be HTTP and the message format has to be
XML so to satisfy these two client
requirements we ended up developing a
web service and the removing service
okay which means developers have to be
familiar with both of the technologies
so Microsoft thought that this is not a
good situation for their communication
technologies framework to bien that's
why to unify and bring all these
communication technologies under one
roof
Microsoft has come up with a single
programming model that's called as WCF
windows communication foundation so WCF
is going to unify everything that is
remoting web services Enterprise
Services and then MSM queue all the
other communication technologies that we
have already today so now let's actually
see how the service is going to change
if we use WCF look at this with WCF we
have a single service and then to
satisfy the requirements of the
different clients we have exposed
different endpoints for the first client
he wants XML message format or HTTP
protocol so there's one endpoint you
know which is going to transmit messages
in an XML format and using HTTP protocol
and to satisfy the requirement of the
second line we have configured another
endpoint which uses TCP protocol and
binary messages okay
so here we don't have to change the
application code to configure these
endpoints all you do is in a
configuration file you specify or
configure your endpoint now let's say we
have a third client then he wants XML
message over TCP protocol to satisfy
that client requirement all we do is we
expose another endpoint so basically we
have got a single service but then to
satisfy the requirements of different
clients we are configuring different
and points so this is a web service this
is a dotnet remoting service so with a
single WCF service we are able to
achieve both the things not only that
there are several endpoints that we can
configure and several bindings as well
we'll discuss all this end point
configuration binding configuration
later video session but for now you
might have understood you know what WCF
is and why should we be using it so with
the WCF there's really no need to use
dotted voting or web services or
Enterprise Services or MSM queue we can
basically achieve all of those using WCF
and simply configuring endpoints in part
two of this video series will discuss
implementing a web service to exchange
messages in XML format using HTTP
protocol and we will also discuss
implementing a removing service to
exchange messages in binary format using
TCP protocol along the way we'll get a
feel of how different these technologies
are and in part three we'll discuss
implementing a single WCF service and
configuring different endpoints to
support different transport protocols
and message formats that's it for today
