questions and answers video series in
this video well discuss displaying
database tables metadata in an asp.net
web form notice that here within this
sample database at the moment we have
got two tables departments and employees
and here is what we want to do we want
to design an asp.net waveform with a
drop-down list and a grid view control
on that the drop-down list should
basically display the list of all
available table names within the sample
database and then once we select a
specific table within the drop-down list
for that selected table we want to
display its metadata in a grid view
control so basically we want to display
the list of all available columns within
that table and their respective data
types as you can see here so let's see
how to achieve this obviously the first
step here is to create those two tables
so let's flip the sequel server
management studio so here is the sequel
script to create those two tables and if
you notice I already have this database
sample and within that I have created
those two tables
I'll have the script available on my
blog in case you need it so that's the
first step the second step is to
basically create a stored procedure
which is going to retrieve the list of
all table names from sample database and
for that purpose we are going to make
use of this information underscore
schema door tables that sequel server
provides so let's flip to sequel server
management studio so basically let's see
what is there in that information
underscore schema or tables notice that
whatever tables we have within the
sample database are listed here
employees and departments and notice
this column right here table type you
know it says base table now it's very
important that we use the where clause
and filter on that column so where table
type equals base table why because if
you have a view you know that view will
also be listed here okay and we don't
want to display views within the
drop-down list so that's why we need to
filter on table type let's actually look
at that in action so for example let's
create a simple view here so let's say
create view and let's call
few simple as let's select the current
date and time using ket date function
and let's give it an early as let's say
today's date for example so we have that
view created now look at this if I don't
use the ver class and if I select
everything from information let's go
schema or tables notice that the view is
also listed here and table type it says
view if we use the where Clause then we
only get tables okay and within the
drop-down list we just want to display
the list of all table names so we just
need to retrieve table name column from
information underscore schema door to
balls so instead of star let's say table
underscore name and let's create stored
procedure so let's call this create prot
let's give it name SP get all tables as
begin so we have a stored procedure
there which is going to give us the list
of all available table names so let's
quickly execute that to make sure it
works as expected so that's one stored
procedure you know for the drop-down
list to list all the table names you
know we are going to make use of that
stored procedure which we had just
created now we need another stored
procedure you know which is going to
retrieve the specific table metadata
once we select a table from the
drop-down list you know we want to
retrieve metadata of that table and here
is the stored procedure which can do
that so we'll call it SP get table
metadata and obviously this needs to
have an input parameter the table for
which we need to retrieve metadata so
let's call it table name and then we are
going to use information underscore
schema columns that's provided by sequel
server and we want column name and data
type from that view so and we are using
the filter here where table underscore
name equals whatever input parameter
that we are passing so let's quickly
create that stored procedure as well so
select star from
information and score schema dot-coms so
basically this contains all the columns
that are available within our database
okay so basically we don't want every
column okay we just want the column name
and the respective data types okay and
we need to filter because you know we
want to retrieve it for the selected
table so we're going to make use of the
stable name column so we are going to
filter on table name column so we're
table name equals whatever we are going
to pass to this stored procedure as a
parameter and let's call it table name
and we don't want every column we just
want column name and data type so column
name and data type create procedure
let's call it s peek at table metadata
as begin and and obviously this stored
procedure needs a parameter so let's go
and call it at table name and this is
going to be of type and we're care and
let's specify the length as 50 so a
simple stored procedure there I'm not
sure we if we have actually executed
this command to create the stored
procedure so we have executed that
already that's why we get that error so
let's go and execute this one and let's
quickly test this to make sure you know
we get on the data that we expect so
let's copy departments table here and
then pass it as a parameter and then
let's execute this we should get in
other columns that belong to the table
and the respective data types okay so at
the moment we have caught the two stored
procedures that we need now let's go
ahead and design our application so
let's
creating new asp.net empty web
application and let's call it demo
tables and to this web application let's
add a webform and we want to drag and
drop a drop down list
first of all let's set the style
attribute here and let's set font family
to area all right let's drag and drop a
drop down list control and basically for
this drop down list we want to set Auto
post back equals true why because
whenever we make a selection you know we
want the drop-down list to automatically
post back to the server and let's go
ahead and generate the you know selected
and exchanged even handler all right now
we also need a grid we control so let's
drag and drop a grid view control onto
the waveform and to make it look nice
let's auto format that and choose this
colorful scheme okay now let's go ahead
and generate two bound columns and to do
that II click on the grid view tasks
pane and click on edit columns we don't
want to auto-generate fields so I'm
going to uncheck this box and we are
going to add two bound fields okay so
the first bound feel so basically we
want to display column name and datatype
right so let's call the header text as
column name and where is this boundary
going to get its data it's going to get
the data from this column underscore
name column because we are going to call
the store procedure to retrieve specific
table metadata so that will be our data
field so column underscore name
and the next bound field header text is
going to be data type and data field is
going to be data underscore type because
that's how the stored procedure is
returning the column name right let's
click OK and let's get to the
code-behind file and here we need to
write some ATO dotnet code so let's
bring in the required namespaces we need
a system configuration to read the
connection string from web config file
we need systems or data and we need
system dot data dot sequel client
namespace and within web config file we
need to define our connection string so
let's go and specify that connection
strings and let's add a connection
string let's give this connection string
in name let's call it sample DB CS for
connection string so here this server is
going to be local server so dot and
database is going to be sample and we
are going to make use of integrated
security so let's set that to true all
right so that's our connection string
and within the code-behind file first
let's write our you know a private
function you know which calls this
stored procedure SP get all tables so
let's go ahead and write that function
private and let's let this function
return data table let's call this get
all tables
and here we first need to read the
connection string from web.config file
so we're going to make use of
configuration manager class so
configuration manager dot connection
strings of what's the name of our
connection string it is sample DB CS so
let's copy and specify that here so we
want that connection string from web
config file once we have the connection
string that's going to create the sequel
connection object passing in the
connection string that we have retrieved
from web config file so once we have our
connection object let's go ahead and
create an instance of sequel data
adapter and let's call it da so new
sequel data adapter and here we are
going to use this overloaded version
where we specify the command text at
string and the sequel connection object
that we want to use so here we want to
execute this stored procedure SP get all
tables so let's copy the name and pass
it as the command that we want this data
adapter to execute and the connection
object is going to be this connection
object that we have just created and
then let's create a data table instance
so data table let's call it data table
equals new data table and then let's
invoke the fill method of the data
adapter which is going to automatically
open the connection execute the stored
procedure retrieve data and populate
this data table with the data that it
has retrieved so pass n data table and
finally what we want to do is return
that data table so return data table
okay so this private function is going
to retrieve the list of all available
table names from the database so if not
is postback so within the page load
event whenever the page loads if it's
the initial get request we want to call
this function so here we have our
drop-down list one so drop-down list one
dot data source equals get all tables so
this function is going to return a data
table which we are setting as
data source for the drop-down list and
we are going to invoke the data bind
method okay so let's go and run this and
see if it works the way we expect it to
work so basically at this point this
drop-down list should display both the
table names that is departments and
employees notice that we have a problem
that basically says systems or data or
data review and that's basically because
we have not specified what is going to
be the drop-down list data text field
and data value field we need to specify
that so let's go ahead and specify that
so data text field is going to be so
basically if you look at the stored
procedure SP get all tables it's written
in only one column that is table name
column so that is going to be our data
text field and similarly data value
field is also going to be the same thing
so data value field okay and another
thing that we want to do is you know
notice that at the moment it's
displaying two rows meaning I think the
first one is for departments and the
second one is for employees but along
with the table names we also want to
display you know a prompt there within
the drop-down list or something like
select table and to do that I'm going to
dynamically insert a list item to the
drop-down list so drop-down list dot
items
dot insert so we want to insert a list
item so let's pass a new list item and
list item is going to have text and
value here text is going to a select
table and value is going to be minus one
and in a bit you will understand why we
are setting the value for select table
as minus one because we are going to use
that to determine you know if the user
has selected any of the tables or if it
is select
okay so basically if you look at this
insert method we also need to specify
the index position where we want to
insert this new list item so we want
that to be the first list item so the
index position is going to be 0 all
right with these changes let's run it
one more time and notice that we have
both the tables there the next step is
obviously when we select employees table
we want to display employees table
metadata with it would be control so
let's go ahead and write another private
function you know to invoke the other
stored procedure that we have so let's
make a copy of this and let's call this
get table metadata and to this we need
to pass table names so let's call it
table name so we are going to pass a
parameter all right
so we first need to read the connection
string from web config file create the
connection object data adapter instance
and then to this data adapter we need to
specify the stored procedure that we
want to execute in this case we want to
execute this stored procedure SP get
table metadata so let's copy that and
pass it as an argument and this is the
connection object over which we want to
execute the Stroop seizure and if you
notice the stored procedure is expecting
an input parameter so we need to pass
that as well so data adapter dot select
command dot parameters dot add so we
need to add a parameter so it's
expecting sequel parameter object to be
passed so let's create a new instance of
sequel parameter and for a sequel
parameter we need to specify the name of
the parameter and its value so what is
the name of this parameter it's called
at table name so that's what we are
going to pass here and we also need to
specify the value so what is the value
going to be the name of the table that
the user has selected and that is coming
into this function as a parameter so
that's what we are going to pass here
all right so we added the parameter
there and then we are creating a new
instance of the data table and we
filling the data table with the data
that's retrieved after executing the
stored procedure and finally returning
the data table okay and what we need to
do here is within the drop-down list
selected index changed
so whenever the selection within the
drop-down list changes that's when this
event handler will be executed so here F
drop-down list 1 dot selected value look
at this if it is not equal to minus 1
okay meaning the user has selected you
know a table other than select table
okay so if the user has selected table
that's when we want to call this private
function get table metadata so let's go
ahead and call that so get table
metadata and to this we need to pass the
name of the selected table within the
drop-down list and how are we going to
retrieve that drop-down list 1 dot
selected value should give us that okay
and whatever we are going to get you
know from this method we are going to
set that as the data source for our grid
view control so will be 1 dot data
source equals that and invoke data bind
ok so these changes let's go ahead and
run this and see if it works as expected
okay select the table it should post
back and notice that we have an error
here procedure a function SP get table
metadata expects parameter at table name
which was not supplied so why is that if
you look at the code they're actually
supplying the parameter it is expecting
that is at table name the reason for
that is because we need to tell the data
adapter that the Select command is a
stored procedure and the way we do that
is the dot select command the command
type equals command type dot strips here
now you may be wondering okay ah also we
are executing stored procedure but we
are not telling the data adapter that it
is a stored procedure and it's working
fine here why is it not working clear
that's I think because here we have a
parameter and here we don't have a
parameter so if you are passing a
parameter to the stored procedure then
we need to specify the command type
otherwise it's not going to work and we
have just seen the error that we have
ran into so with that change let's go
and run this now and let's select a
table so look at that employees table
has those columns and those are the data
types departments table has got those
columns and those are the data types but
if I select select table look at that
it's not you know clearing whatever
that's present in the grid view control
inspite of posting back to the server
that's basically because it's retaining
those grid view values from the view
state so to clear them when we select
select table option from the drop-down
list all I'm going to do is grid view
have control has got this enabled view
state property so I am basically going
to set that to false so enable view
state at the moment it's true by default
so let's set that to false let's run it
one more time now I select employees
employees metadata there if i select
select table notice that nothing gets
displayed we select departments
departments metadata there so quite
straightforward so here are the data
here is the script to create those
database tables stored procedure to
retrieve all tables information and this
is the stored procedure to retrieve
specific table metadata and then we have
created an asp.net web form you know
dragged and dropped a drop-down list
control configured that configure the
grid view control and then these are the
two private functions which are going to
call the stored procedures that we have
written and within the page load event
we are going to call you know that
private function which is going to call
this stored procedure and within
drop-down you know when the selected
index within the drop-down list changes
then we are calling the other private
function which core private function
which is going to invoke this stored
procedure and this how that code looks
all right that's it for today thank you
for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
