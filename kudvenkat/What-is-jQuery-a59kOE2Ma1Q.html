this video we'll discuss what is jQuery
and why should we use jQuery so what's
the equity jQuery is not a new
programming language jQuery is built on
top of JavaScript in fact jQuery is a
lightweight JavaScript library that
simplifies programming with JavaScript
according to jQuery calm website jQuery
is a fast small and feature-rich
JavaScript library it makes things like
HTML document traversal and manipulation
even handling animation and Ajax much
simpler with an easy-to-use API that
works across a multitude of browsers
with a combination of versatility and
extensibility jQuery has changed the way
that millions of people write JavaScript
we already have JavaScript so why should
we use jQuery or what are the advantages
of using jQuery over raw JavaScript one
of the greatest benefits of using jQuery
is that it is cross browser meaning when
we write JavaScript using jQuery we
don't have to worry about is this code
going to work in IE 7 is it going to
work in Google Chrome is it going to
work in Safari we don't have to worry
about all those browser compatibility
issues all that is taken care by jQuery
for us so when we write JavaScript using
jQuery we can be assured that it is
going to work across all browsers so the
greatest advantage of jQuery is that it
is cross browser jQuery is a lot more
easy to use than raw JavaScript we'll
look at examples of using jQuery nor
upcoming videos and you will realize how
easy it is to achieve that using jQuery
overusing raw JavaScript jQuery is
extensible jQuery simplifies and has
rich Ajax support in upcoming videos
we'll see how to implement Ajax using
jQuery and along the way we'll see how
simple it is jQuery has large
development community and many many free
plugins for example within your
application if you want to implement
autocomplete text box you can either
write code for that from square
you can use one of the three jQuery
plug-in that is readily available a
plugin that is already developed tested
and proven to be working so when you
have plugin like that why do you want to
reinvent the wheel why do you want to
invest the time and effort to do the
same thing again instead simply use that
free plugin that's available there are
many many such free plugins available
and there is excellent documentation on
jquery.com website not upcoming videos
we'll see how to use the documentation
now let's see how to use jQuery in our
application now to use jQuery within
your application all you have to do is
navigate to jquery.com website download
the relevant jQuery file and reference
that just like any other JavaScript file
within your application so when we
navigate to jQuery com notice that we
have this download jQuery button once we
click on that we go to the download page
and notice on this page we've got two
versions of jQuery jQuery one dot X and
jQuery 2 dot X so what is the difference
between jQuery one dot X and 2 dot X if
you want to support Internet Explorer 6
7 &amp;amp; 8 versions then use jQuery 1 dot X
whereas if you don't have the need to
support ie6 7 &amp;amp; 8 and if you want to
target just the modern browsers then use
this jQuery 2 dot X the size of jQuery 2
dot X is smaller than jQuery 1 dot X
because all that backward compatibility
code has been stripped off from jQuery 2
dot X so this tends to be a little
leaner than jQuery 1 dot X and if you
look at either of them notice that we
have a compressed and uncompressed
versions and if you look at this
compressed version notice that you know
all the white spaces have been removed
variable names have been shortened to
keep the size of this file small so this
minified or compressed version is
suitable for production use whereas if
we look at this uncompressed version you
know this piece of code is much readable
because we have the white spaces and
meaningful variable names are used now
we require this for development because
if there are issues we want to be in a
position to read this javascript and we
want to be in a position to debug it
so for development use the uncompressed
version for production we usually use
this minified or compressed version so I
have already downloaded you know both
this jQuery 1 dot X and jQuery 2 rod X
files and let's see how to use them in
our application let's slip to Visual
Studio so here I have a button control
now what we want to do is assign a click
event handler to this button first let's
do that using raw JavaScript and then
we'll see how to rewrite the same thing
using jQuery so window dot onload so
when onload even fires we want to
execute this function so basically what
we want to do is document or get element
by ID if you want to get this element
which has an ID of button 1 dot and to
that button we want to add an event
listener and if you look at this
addeventlistener method it has got three
parameters the first parameter is the
type of the event so the type of the
event is clicked and the second
parameter is the event listener method
so first let's go ahead and write a
function let's call this click handler
and all this function is going to do is
alert the message saying jQuery tutorial
so the second parameter for
addeventlistener
method is going to be the function the
event handler function and the third
parameter is boolean parameter used
capture this parameter is really used
and I'm going to set that to false all
right if you look at this add event
listener method this is not supported in
ie8 in the earlier version so this piece
of code is not going to work in ie8 and
early versions let's look at that in
action so let's run this now so at the
moment my default browser is Google
Chrome so this works in Google Chrome
look at this when we click the button we
get the alert but let's navigate to this
URL within ie so at the moment the
version of ie that I have is ie 11 so
when I click this it works in IE 11 but
let's change the browser mode to IE 7 by
launching the developer tools so let's
change the mode to IE 7 and look at this
the moment we do that we get a message
saying that this ad even listener
property or method is not supported
right so with IE 8 in earlier versions
we have to use a different method which
is attach event so we have to first
check if document dot add even listener
if this method is supported then do this
if that is not supported then we know
that the browser is beta ie 8 or earlier
versions in that case we want to use
document or get element by ID instead of
add event listener they are going to use
attach event function and with attach
event you know you have to use
Deonne prefix with the event name so if
it's click event you have to specify on
click and then the even handler function
we don't require this third parameter
with attach event all right so let's
save these changes let's reload in IE so
at the moment we are running an IE 11
mode it works let's change the browser
mode to IE 7 and look at this we don't
get the javascript error so if we click
this button we should get the alert
jQuery tutorial ok so at the moment it's
working across all browsers but look at
the amount of code that we have to write
here okay just to add a click event
handler to this button control this is
the amount of code we have to write now
let's see how to rewrite the same thing
using jQuery so we have to reference the
jQuery file since we want to support ie8
and earlier versions I am actually going
to use jQuery 1 dot X within my
application let's actually copy both of
them and paste them within our project
so let's paste them here so they are
added to a root directory so let's drag
and drop them within the head section so
I am adding a reference to 1 dot X file
because we want to support ie8 in the
earlier versions as well alright so
instead of all this we are going to use
jQuery now now look at this as we have
added that you know there should be a
jQuery function now so jQuery to this we
pass the document object and then we
call ready function so what is this
ready function going to do it's going to
ensure that the Dom is fully loaded
so the browser document object model is
fully loaded and you know the script can
start modifying the elements if required
ok so dot ready and this is where we
write our JavaScript so we want to
execute a function
just like how we did with window dot
onload okay so we're going to open a
bracket so here we have an anonymous
function that we want to execute when
the document object model is fully
loaded so jQuery we are passing the
document object to the jQuery function
and then we are calling the ready method
this ready method will ensure that the
dome is fully loaded and the script can
start modifying the elements within the
Dom okay so what do we want to do here
we want to attach even handler to this
button control so jQuery now you know in
rajala script to get a reference of this
button we use document or get element by
ID now I want to get this element by ID
with jQuery we use something called ID
selector will discuss more about
selectors in our upcoming video for now
understand that you know hash button 1
this is equivalent to saying document
dot get element by ID button 1 ok so
hash symbol here in jQuery is called as
ID selector so we want to get an element
with the ID button 1 that's what this
piece of code says and then when the
click event occurs on this button
control we want to execute some piece of
code and we're going to specify that
using an anonymous function so I want to
execute a function then we end that with
a semicolon and here we specify you know
what we want to do when that click event
occurs on that button control so all we
want to do is alert the message saying
jQuery tutorial all right so look at the
amount of code that we have to write
with jQuery now let's go ahead
save this
and run it so when we click this we
should get that message jQuery tutorial
now let's go ahead and check if this is
going to work in IE as well so let's fly
it up internet explorer and let's
navigate to the same page click the
button it works let's change the browser
mode to IE 7
and let's click this button notice that
it works now it's working in IE 7 here
because if you look at the jQuery we are
using its jQuery one door text so ie 6 7
&amp;amp; 8 all these versions are supported now
let's actually remove this and instead
use jQuery 2 dot X remember with jQuery
2 dot X we will not have support for ie
8 in the earlier versions so let's close
that save the changes fire up ie let's
change the browser mode to IE 7 and
let's navigate to this URL so let's copy
that
and let's navigate to that URL and look
at that we get an error okay so if you
want to target IE 8 in earlier versions
as well then use the equity 1 dot X but
if you don't want to target them and
just want to target IE 9 and later
versions and the other modern browsers
then use jQuery 2 dot X versions so with
raw JavaScript this is the amount of
code that we have to write to attach a
click event handler to the button
control but with jQuery this is the
amount of code now look at the you know
how less the code is and we don't have
to worry about cross-browser issues
because all that is taken care by jQuery
for us and here we have some important
points to remember now here notice that
we using jQuery you know as the name of
the function instead of that you know we
have dollar in jQuery okay so this
dollar is shortcut for jQuery okay so
you can either use dollar or jQuery
whatever you prefer
commonly most people use dollar and this
ready function insures that the dome is
fully loaded and our script can start
manipulating the elements within Dom and
look at this - you know to ensure that
the dome is fully loaded we have to
write dollar we pass you know to that
function jquery function we pass the
document object and on that we call the
ready function we can either write all
these ok or if you look at you know we
have three lines here all these three
are equivalent at the moment we're using
this syntax dollar by passing the
document object and on that we are
calling the ready function you can
either do that or you can do this you
know without passing the document object
you can simply call the ready method so
something like this so I can get rid of
that save this and because that's reload
this click the button it should still
work but the second option is not really
recommended you can use the third option
as well which is even shorter so to the
dollar you know to the jQuery function
you just specify the handler that you
want to execute so I can get rid of all
this together so now within this
parentheses we specify the handler that
we want to execute an anonymous function
and what this function says is find a
button with ID button 1 and then when
the click event occurs execute this
piece of code okay look at how small the
code is with jQuery thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
