venket this is part 57 of asp.net
grid-view tutorial in this video we'll
discuss about exporting grid view data
to Microsoft Excel and ferd we'll be
using this table TBL employee for this
demo now I want to retrieve this data
from this table and then display that
within the grid view control and then
underneath the grid view control I want
to have two buttons export to excel
export to word so when I click this
button export to excel then I want to
export the data that is present in this
grid view into an excel worksheet
similarly when I click you know another
button export to word which we don't
have at the moment I want to export this
data from the grid we control to a
Microsoft Word document obviously to
achieve this the first thing to do is to
write the ad or dotnet code to retrieve
data from this table and then display
that within the grid view control so
let's flip to visual studio let's drag
and drop a grid view control onto this
web form
let's auto format this lets choose brown
sugar screen now let's drag and drop a
button control and let's the text on the
button control to export to excel so go
to the properties of the button control
and change the text to export to excel
now let's double click this button
control to generate the event handler
within the page load event now we need
to write ad or dotnet code to retrieve
data from this table and then display
that within the grid view control and
that we discussed about ad or dotnet in
a very great detail in radio dotnet
video series so please watch those
videos first to speed things up i have
this code already implemented so let me
copy and paste that here so within the
page load event if not is post back
meaning if this is the initial get
request of the webform then use the
configuration manager class read the
connection string from web config file
and store that connection string in this
variable and using that connection
string be a building a signal connection
object look at the sequel command select
star from TBL employee we are passing
this sequel command as a parameter to
this equal data adapter object we are
going to execute this command using this
connection object and then look at this
we are creating it
data set object and then we are invoking
the film method of the data adapter
object to fill the data you know into
this data set after we execute this
command then we are setting the data set
as the data source for the grid view
control invoking data bind method okay
so if we run this application at the
moment you know the data will be
retrieved from TBL employee table and
then displayed in the grid view control
now when we click this button export to
excel we want to export the data that is
present within the grid view control
into an excel worksheet okay so anytime
we want to send something to the client
now here we want to send the grid view
data to the client in in an excel sheet
so we need to you know do that using the
response object for example let's say I
want to write cookie information on to a
client computer which object do I use I
use the response object okay similarly
here we want to send that the excel I
mean the grid view data in an Excel
format to the client so I have to use
the response object for that so let's
flip to visual studio so within the
button click event I'm going to use the
response object the first thing that I
need to do is call the clear or clear
content method now the clear content
method is going to clear any content
from the response buffers know if there
is any other content within the response
buffer that will be cleared when you
invoke this method and the next thing
that I want to do is I want to append
some information to the response header
that's going from the server to the
client okay so to the HTTP response
header I want to add some information so
what is that information going to be now
I want to tell you know - the response
object the data that I am going to send
you know that has to be opened up you
know using Microsoft Excel and you know
I have to specify the name of the excel
file now to specify the name of the
excel file now I'm using a response
header called content disposition so
content -
disposition so I'm using this HTTP
response header to specify the name of
the you know excel file
that I'm going to send to the client and
to do that I have to say it's an
attachment semicolon and then file name
is equal to whatever name that you want
to give to your excel file so here we
are you know storing employee's
information so I'm going to specify the
name for my excel file s employees dot
XLS Excel files have an extension of dot
XLS so I'm using that extension here
so that's response you know dot append
header so to the header you know of the
response object you know we are using
this content-disposition header which is
basically used to raise you know specify
the file name for our excel file and the
next thing to do is to specify the
content type you know the mime type
basically so using content type property
so on the response object specify your
content type our content type is nothing
but application /xl so it's an excel
data ok so those are the three things
that we need to do on the response
object after that I'm going to create
instances of two classes here you may
not understand why we are using those
classes at the moment but don't worry
that will be clearing just a bit so I'm
going to use a class called string
writer this class is present in system
dot IO namespace so let's go ahead and
import that system dot IO so its string
writer class so let me create an
instance of this class string writer in
a bit you will understand how we are
going to use this class and then I'm
going to create another class HTML text
writer class again in a bit we'll
understand how we will be using this
class so HTML text writer I am going to
call the instance as HTML text writer is
equal to new HTML text writer and look
at the constructor of this class it's
expecting an object of type text writer
but then look at what I am going to pass
to the constructor of this class I'm
going to pass this
string writer object but then you know I
don't get any compilation errors look at
this the constructor expects a text
writer but I'm passing string writer
that's because if you look at the string
writer object if I go to the definition
string writer class inherits from text
writer class so we can pass a string
writer to this HTML text writer you know
class as an inherited type in a bit
we'll understand how we are going to use
these two classes okay
so those are the two objects I need and
then the next thing we have to do here
is where is our data present our data is
present in grid view control and then
what is the ID of this grid view control
its grid view one so the idea of the
control is grid view one so now what I'm
going to do is grid view one dot I'm
going to invoke a method called render
control and look at the you know method
it's expecting an object of type HTML
text writer do we have an object of that
type yes HTML text writer object I have
here so I'm going to pass this object to
this method now what is this going to do
look at this render control method look
at the intelligence
it says outputs server control content
to a provided you know system dot v dot
u Y dot HTML text writer object so you
know the content of this grid view
control will be written into this object
okay so what is the content that is
going to be present in this grid we
control the employee data not only this
employee data the grid we control will
also contain you know the HTML of the
table cell table row etc okay so this
HTML text writer object will have both
the content and the controls HTML okay
so that's why we have used this HTML
text writer object so the entire content
and the HTML will be returning to that
object and now what I'm going to do I am
going to say response dot write and then
I am going to use the string writer
object so response dot right
greater dot to string and then finally
I'm going to say response to at the end
okay so that's all you know the code
that we need to export data to excel so
look at this the surrender control
method is going to render the content
and the HTML you know to this object
HTML text writer and look at this HTML
text writer it is actually taking in
this string writer object as a parameter
so you know now whatever content and
HTML that we have in this object is now
converted into a string format and
stored in this object and then what I am
doing with that object I am converting
that to string representation using the
to string method and then passing on
that to the right method of the response
object which is going to write that to
the client and in the response header we
specified that the name of the file is
employee dot XLS so this data will be
returned into the excel file and we are
ending the response which means
everything will be flushed out the
response has ended okay so let's go
ahead and run this and see if it works
as expected
so when the wave form loads as you might
expect the data should be retrieved from
TBL employee table and then displayed
within the grid we control but let me
click this button see what's going to
happen ah look at the error we have an
error stating control grid view one of
type of grid view must be placed inside
a form tag with run it is equal to
server now let's actually go back and
see if our grid view control is present
inside a form tag yes it is look at this
the grid we control is here and it's
present inside this form tag with run it
is equal to server attribute then why am
I getting this error that's because of
the surrender control method so the
surrender control method you know causes
the confusion it makes a dotnet think we
are dynamically rendering a control
outside of the form tag okay so
obviously to fix this error all we need
to do is we need to override a specific
method called verify rendering in silver
form so you don't have to remember that
name by heart but then look at this the
moment I say override
and then I press space then it's going
to show me all the methods that can that
I can override so there is a method
called verify rendering in silver form
and then all I need to do is you know
just overwrite that method I don't have
to provide any implementation here so
this method confirms to.net runtime
environment that though we are rendering
controls dynamically they will be
rendered as part of you know a
server-side form okay so that's it let
me go ahead and run this now and see if
it's going to work as expected
okay let's click them this report export
Excel look at that I have this employees
dot Excel XLS let's open that and we
should have our employees data but then
we are going to get a warning message
here look at this the file you are
trying to open employee's stored Excel
XLS is in a different format than
specified by the file extension verify
that the file is not corrupted and it's
from a trusted source before before
opening the file do you want to open
this file now now when I click on this
warning yes look at that
I have the file opened okay so why am I
getting that error message I mean it's
not an error message it's a warning
message the warning message is a user
notification function that was added to
Microsoft Excel 2007 so the warning
message can help prevent any unexpected
problems that might occur because of
possible incompatibility between the
actual content of the file and the file
name extension okay and if you want to
resolve this error we need to edit the
registry of our operating system now you
can find those instructions here
in this Microsoft article here so if you
want to get rid of that error you need
to edit the registry and to do that you
can make use of this article here I'm
not going to go into the details of
editing registry right now but then if
you look at you know the output here
within the grid we control I mean we got
the output but then look at the
formatting you know it it is actually
applying the background color to the
entire row of the header as well as the
data rows now
don't want to you know I don't want the
colors to be spread across the entire
worksheet I only want those background
colors to be present just you know where
we have the data okay so to properly
format this you know obviously you can
apply styles to your grid view control
as well look through the header row
apply whatever styles you want for these
cells in the header row similarly do the
same thing for you know the data rows as
well and just to speed things up I have
this already implemented so let me copy
this and paste that within our you know
good behind file here so look at the
code what am i doing I'm saying grid v1
dot header row to that you know on the
header row we are using the style
property and we are adding a style of
background color you know that's the
style background color I am setting it
to FFF meaning I am setting it to white
color all red green and blue all the
three colors I am setting it to ffff and
FF which means you know it's a white
color and then I'm looping through each
cell within the head header row and then
for each table cell I am setting a
background color of a five five one to
nine that's nothing but I picked up the
color number from the header row style
here look at the header rows time that's
what is the header row style when we
applied you know that Auto formatting of
brown sugar the header row color number
is that one so that's what we are
specifying here for the header row and
then look at this for each a data row
for each data row I'm looping through
each data row and each data row has got
cells within them so the first for each
loop loops through each row and then the
inner for each loop is going to loop
through each row I mean each row cells
and then for each cell within the data
row we are setting a background color of
F F F 7 e7 which is nothing but you know
the roof style background color here so
I just picked it up from the auto
formatted HTML that we have here
and that's it so if I am going to run
this now and then when we export it to
excel this time it should be properly
formatted the formatting should be
applied only for the data part so let's
open that so we get the warning again I
open that look at that you know the
colors are applied just to the grid we
control all right fine now we have seen
how to export this data to excel let's
say how to export it to Microsoft Word
to do that all I need to do is let's
drag and drop another button control
here and let's set the text on the
button controller to export to word and
let's double click that to generate even
handler method so what I'm going to do
I'm going to copy this entire content I
mean the code that we have in export to
excel click event handler and paste that
in this button to click even handler
which is going to export the data to
Microsoft Word okay now I'm going to
make only two modifications the first
modification here is instead of the file
extension XLS I am going to change that
to dot do say and then here the content
type instead of Excel I'm going to say
word that's it let's go ahead and run
this now and see you know if it's going
to export the data to Microsoft Word
document all right so let's click on
this button export to word look at that
I have a word document there I click on
the word document it opens up word and
we should have this grid view data
within Microsoft Word look at that it
works exactly as expected all right so
in this video we have seen how to export
data to excel as well as to Microsoft
Word all right on this slide you can
find resources for asp.net c-sharp and
sequence of interview questions that's
it for today thank you for listening
