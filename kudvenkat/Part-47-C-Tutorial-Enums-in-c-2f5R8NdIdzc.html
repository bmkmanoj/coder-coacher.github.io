wrinkled this is about 47 in this
session we will learn the concepts
related to enums in part 45 we have seen
why enums are required and in part 46 we
have seen an enum in an example now if
you haven't watched those videos already
I would strongly encourage you to do so
before continuing with the session now
from path 45 and 46 it's very clear that
if a program uses a set of related
numbers then it's better to replace them
with the enums because enums make your
program more readable and more
maintainable let's quickly recap what we
have seen in part 45 and 46 in part 45
we have written a program and we had a
customer class and in that customer
class did gender was actually was
actually an integer type so what is the
problem in doing so so gender was
actually one I mean zero means unknown
one means male and two means female now
if you look at the program on the left
hand side this particular customer
object that we are creating it if you
look at the gender for mark is he male
female or unknown how do we know that
unless and until you check the
documentation what at 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 mains and
some in terms of gender you will not be
able to tell that so this piece on the
left hand side suffers readability but
if you look at you know the same program
rewritten using genders in the right
hand side by looking at the you know the
object you can clearly say okay marks
gender is male whereas Mary's gender is
female you don't have to refer back to
the documentation because your gender
enum here is giving that symbolic names
like male female unknown which makes
your program now more readable and also
at the same time more maintainable no
matter how complex your program grows
you know it has better readability now
and it will be better maintainable as
well and same is the case with the
switch method that we have written okay
on the left hand side it uses the
integer datatype
k zero case one case two so case one
what is this processing for is it for
gender male female I don't know how will
we know that unless man till you check
the documentation you will not come to
know about it but on the other hand on
the right side the the switch method is
actually operating on the gender enum
and by looking at the labels here okay
this written unknown is for an unknown
gender and this returned mail or
whatever processing statements that you
can have here are for you know gender
male so obviously from these two
examples it's very clear and evident
that using enums
and there are a set of related integral
numbers makes your program more readable
and more maintainable in this session
what will actually look at is what are
the various concepts that are related to
enums
okay now we know that enums are nothing
but enumerations
and enums are actually called as
strongly typed constants okay now that's
the reason why an explicit is an
explicit cast is needed whenever you
want to convert from enum type to an
integral type and vice versa let's see
what we mean by that now we know that in
part 45 and 46 we have created an enum
gender in them so let's go ahead and
create that public enum gender now let's
say we have an unknown and male and then
female now if you look at this this is a
very inner now if you don't specify
anything if you if you create an enum
like the standards using the defaults
meaning the underlying data type of this
enum is actually integer okay and the
values for these enum members actually
start at 0 okay now let's say for
example I want to get the values of the
scene um how do I do that actually with
in the.net framework base class base
class library we have a class called
enum class so if you look at this this
is actually
class when I right-click on that and say
go to definition I have two methods one
is kept names and the other one is kept
values now for the get names method if
you pass an enum type it will return you
the names okay
similarly for get values if you pass the
enum type it returns you the values that
the enum contains now an enums default
underlying data type is integer and the
value actually starts at 0 so unknown is
0 male is one female is 2 okay now let's
say I want to retrieve those values and
print them and to do that we can use the
enum class and on that enum class we
have a method called get values if you
look at this we have a get values method
and if you look at what it is expecting
it's actually expecting it type to be
passed in okay now type can be your
class your enum structure anything but
here we want to get the values of all of
our enum so we pass the gender type now
gender is actually the name of your enum
to get the type of this gender enum then
what you have to do is you have to use
the type of so type off and if you look
at this type of method what it does is
it actually returns the type of this
gender which in our case is an enum
gender in am okay and if you look at the
return type of this get values method
it's an array
what are they specifically it's an
integer array because why the default
underlying type for this gender is an
integer so integer let's say values is
equal to and what you need to do is you
need to convert this to integer as well
and here array as well and all you can
do at this point of time is loop through
the values and print them so for each
int
value in values you can actually say
console.readline
value so if I run this program now you
should see the value starting at zero
one two okay similarly if I want these
symbolic names for those zero one and
two what I can't basically do is instead
of using get values I can use cat names
function so let's see that how to do it
so instead of get values I will say get
names and you know that get names is
actually returning a string array so as
it is returning it's actually get names
so get names returns a string array it's
not an integer array so we need to
remove that and here we will call it a
string array and we will give the name
of the array as names and what you
basically can do here is loop through
that string collection so for each
string name in names we will print the
names of each element of the enum
so now if we run this it should print
enum values and the enum names okay now
we know that the default underlying type
for this enum is an integer now is it
possible to change that absolutely you
know you can use any of the integral
data types you have for example I want
this to be short of course you can do
that now the default underlying type of
this enum is short the moment we do that
and let's go ahead and run this
look at this unable to cast the object
of type gender to type system dot n 32
because we know that here the underlying
type of the scene um is shot not into
anymore so what you will have to do here
is typecast that too short otherwise you
will get you know a compiler error
similarly this has to be a short array
and this is a short as well and that's
it now if we run this program you know
the output will be exactly same but we
are using a smaller data pipeline now
short instead of an integer okay because
we know that genders will not have more
than like four five values unknown male
female or not specified whatever the
list you want it it won't exceed beyond
ten so it's better to have this molester
datatype that's possible just to
preserve some space in the memory when
your program executes so now what I want
to tell here is that it's possible to
actually change the underlying type of
an enum you just put the coulomb and
then the underlying type to which you
want to switch to instead of using the
default integral data type and similar
it's also possible to customize the
value that an enum contains for example
we know that the default value starts at
zero but can I change it to one of
course now the moment you put one there
what actually happens is you don't have
to specify the values for the other type
I mean for the other members so what's
going to happen now the the runtime will
automatically provide to the to this
male and three to female so let me run
this so one two three unknown one male
two and female three similarly if you
want you can actually say okay I don't
want this to be true anymore I want that
to be five and this one to be twenty
three is that possible absolutely so one
5:23 so it's possible that you can
customize the underlying data type and
the values that your inner members carry
they don't they don't have to be in
specific sequence they can
be any allowed value for that datatype
now you may be wondering okay now can I
go ahead and put a very big number like
this now this is not possible because
the short data type has a maximum value
that it can hold now definitely this
number is much bigger than you know the
short data type so if I try to compile
this I will get a compile error saying
cannot implicitly convert type long to
short so this number is something much
bigger than short so it cannot be
converted to B yeah you know to hold in
this data time so we get a compiler
error and if you are curious on how to
know what is the maximum value that the
short data type of can hold just right
click on that go to definition there
will be a max value property I mean
constant if you look at that the maximum
value that it can hold is three two
seven six seven so obviously the maximum
value that you can provide is three two
seven six seven now if you want a much
bigger value change the underlying type
to something else maybe in too long
whatever a much bigger data type okay
now if I run this it should work without
any issues because this is a maximum
value but on the other hand if I make it
seven six eight
that's something beyond a short data
type can hold so if I compile that I'll
again get the same message cannot
constant value three two seven six eight
cannot be converted to short okay so
another thing as far as enums are
concerned to keep in mind is that we
know that it's possible to customize the
underlying data type and the values
these members now and to get the names
and values of enums we use the get names
and get values static methods that are
present in enum class now this enum is a
class which has got the static methods
on the other hand we have this enum
keyword which we actually use to create
enumeration so understand the slight
differentiation between enum with
capital E which is a class and enum with
small E
the keyword which we use to create
enumerations
the class actually contains the static
methods which can help us operate on the
enumeration datatype in order to
retrieve the names and to retrieve the
values okay now in terms are called a
strongly typed constants and there are
two reasons why they are called a
strongly typed constants one reason is
let's say for example this is a gender
enum now can I do this can I create a
gender let's say let's comment out this
lines because this is not required
anymore
so let's say gender gender is equal to
can I do this maybe three okay let's put
this back to you know better sequence
one two and then three
now we know that enum gender has values
of one two three and what is the
datatype short but let's leave it to the
default integer datatype okay so now we
know that gender is actually containing
the underlying type of gender is an
integer and I'm trying to assign an
integer value to gender and look at this
there is a red squiggly cannot
implicitly convert type into agenda so
the compiler is complaining this integer
3 cannot be converted to type gender an
explicit conversion exists are you
missing a cash so it's asking if there
is an explicit cast go ahead and do that
because compiler cannot implicitly do
this conversion for us so that's why
they're called though the underlying
type of the enum is an integer
you know the underlying types and and
the enums are not implicitly
interchangeable okay you cannot assign
directly the value of an integer to an
enum or and the vice versa is also true
you cannot assign an any an enum to a
variable of type integer
so in order to make this work what you
actually need to do is perform the
explicit cast so now if we compile this
it will compile so on the status bar
bill
ceded now the YC versa is also true for
example let's say int number is equal to
I cannot say gender dot may be unknown
is this possible again now we get a
compiler error saying that cannot
convert type gender to end implicitly an
explicit conversion is required so
probably you have to use you know
something like convert or to end 32 or
an int typecast operator and it should
work now okay so that's one of the
reasons why a an enum is called as a
strongly typed constant though the
underlying types is an integer
you know the underlying type and enums
are not implicitly interchangeable and
explicit cast is needed to convert from
enum type to an integral type and vice
versa and also along the same lines an
enum of one type cannot be implicitly
assigned to an enum of another type even
though the underlying values of their
members of the same so what do we mean
by this now we knew that we have let's
comment this out to the time being now
we have this gender enum similarly let
me create another UNAM public inna and
let's call this a season enum and we
know that there are three different
seasons let's say winter which is equal
to 1 and maybe spring which is equal to
2 and summer which is equal to 3 now if
you look at these enums for both of
these the underlying type is integer and
the members contain 1 2 3 1 2 3 the same
values now since these are the
underlying types are the same can I do
this can I say let's actually get rid of
these ok can I do this gender gender is
equal to a season dot let's say winter
can I do this you cannot do this you
know we know that the underlying type of
gender is an integer
unlike
type of year season is also integer but
in spite of that can we do this now in
order for that to be possible then what
you have to do is you have to perform
the explicit cash now this is possible
okay so for these reasons enums are
called as strongly typed constants okay
so in terms of strongly typed constants
hands an explicit cast is needed to
convert from enum type to an integral
type vice-versa and along the same lines
an enum of one type cannot be implicitly
assigned to an enum of another type even
though the underlying values they're
members are the same and we have also
seen that the default underlying type of
an enum is integer the default value for
the first element is 0 and gets
incremented by 1 automatically but if
you want to change that you can change
it is possible to customize the
underlying type and values contained by
the enum members and enums are value
types they are not reference types we
know that you know classes interfaces
delegates these are reference types
whereas trucks enums and some of the
built-in types are value types so
whatever are the differences between
value types and reference types these
are also applicable to the you know
between enums and the classes and the
enum keyword all small letters is
basically used to create any relations
whereas enum class contains the static
get values and get names methods which
can actually be used to list in um
underlying type values and names we have
seen an example of that we have seen how
items make our programs more readable
and maintainable and we have also seen
you know the default underlying type for
an enum is an integer and the value
starts at 0 but it's possible to
customize that so if I want to change
the underlying type to short all you do
is put a colon and then specify your
data type in this case it is short but
you can have any of the other numerical
data types
I am also customizing the values to
start from 1 now they don't have to be
in specific sequential order as long as
the values are the valid values for the
like data type it is possible but
whereas this program will not compile
the last piece will not compile because
three to seven six eight is much bigger
than it's bigger than what a short data
type can all and for any data type for
any numeric data type if you want to
find out the minimum value and maximum
value that that data can hold you can
use the max value and min value
constants that are available or defined
on that data type on this slide you can
