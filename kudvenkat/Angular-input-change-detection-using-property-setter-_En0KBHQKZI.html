in this video we will discuss how to
detect and react when an input property
value changes using a property setter
this is continuation to part 34 so
please watch part 34 before proceeding
in a previous video we discussed how to
detect and react when an input property
value changes using the ng on changes
lifecycle hook in this video we will
discuss doing the same but using a
property setter instead this is the same
application that we have been working
with so far in this video series notice
at the moment when I click this view
next employee button we cycle through
the list of available employees and as
the input property value is changing we
log the name of the previous employee
and the current employee to the console
and at the moment we are doing this
using the ng on changes life cycle hook
now let's see how to do exactly the same
thing but using a property setter
instead since we are no longer going to
use the own changes lifecycle hook let's
delete the code related to it
so the file is clean let's also remove
own changes from the import right here
now let's include a private backing
field for this input property I'm going
to name it underscore employee the
underscore here indicates that this is a
private field and obviously the type for
this is going to be employee now we are
going to modify our input property to
include a getter and a setter to read
from and write into this private field
if you have any experience with
object-oriented programming languages
like C sharp then this pattern should be
very familiar to you
now let's include a set of first let's
leave the input decorator on its own
line and move the rest of the code to
the next line to include a setter we use
the set keyword and the let's name or
setter employee the same name as our
input property now whenever we pass an
employee object using this input
property into this component this
we'll be called and the employee object
will be passed into the setter as a
parameter so I'm going to name the
parameter Val and obviously we know the
object that is coming into the setter is
of type employee so let's set the type
of the parameter to employee now let's
set this parameter Val as the value for
a private field underscore employee so
this dot underscore employee equals well
let's format this code a bit save our
changes and then take a quick look at
the browser to see what we've got
notice the employee details are not
displayed and we've got couple of errors
and look at what this error says cannot
read property Department of undefined
we know the department properties on the
employee object but at the moment is
complaining employee object is undefined
that's because this template is not able
to read from our input property and the
reason it's not able to read from the
input property is because it doesn't
have a getter it only has a setter
meaning we can only write into this
property but we cannot read from it so
for the template to be able to read from
our input property we should include a
getter
to include a getter for our input
property we use the gate keyword the
name of the Gator is the same as the
setter which is employee and that this
Gator is going to return an employee
object so the return type of the Gator
is employee and all this Gator is going
to do is return what we have in this
private backing field underscore
employee so return this dot underscore
employee notice now all the errors are
gone and we are able to see the employee
details when we click this button we are
able to see the next employee details so
every time we click this button the
input property value is changing and
when the input property value changes we
want to detect that and log the previous
employee name and the current
employee name to the console just like
how we did it with ng own changes so
every time the employee object has
changed this seta of our input property
is called so here we write the code to
intercept the input property value
change first let's log the previous
employee name to indicate that they are
logging the previous employee name let's
include this literal text previous and
to this we want to append the previous
employee name keep in mind first time
previous employee is null so we have to
check if there is null in our private
backing field
underscore employee so if it is not now
then what do we want to do we simply
want to log what we have in our private
backing field name property if it is
null then we want to log the word now
now all that is left is to log the
current employee name to get the current
employee name we can use this incoming
parameter Val so to this little text
current let's append at the current
employee name notice now we have the
previous and current employee names
logged to the console since this is the
first time or input property value is
changing the previous employee name is
now and every time we click this button
notice the previous and current employee
names change accordingly one very
important point to keep in mind is this
line which retrieves the name of the
previous employee should always be
before this line that's because what is
this line doing here it's updating our
private backing field underscore
employee with the new value that is
coming into our setter so if this line
is after this line of code then both the
previous employee name and current
employee name will be same let's
actually look at this in action notice
now both the previous and current
employee names are the same
every time we click the button the same
thing happens so that's why it's very
important this line is before this line
so we have seen two approaches to
intercept and react to input property
changes so the obvious question that
comes to our mind at this point is
what's the difference between these two
approaches and when to use one or the
other we'll answer both these questions
in our next video thank you for watching
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
