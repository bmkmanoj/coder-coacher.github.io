this video we'll discuss the difference
between select and select many methods
with examples let's flip to visual
studio so here I have a new console
application all I have done so far is
create this student class this is the
same class that we worked with in the
previous session notice the subjects
property is a collection of strings now
what we want to do is print all the
subjects of all the students on the
control screen we can achieve this
either by using select or select many
methods first let's look at achieving
this using the Select method so let's
flip to visual studio so within the main
method we're going to make use of
student plants and we will invoke get
all students static method which is
going to return us the list of student
objects so from the list of this student
objects we want to just retrieve the
subjects property of every student so
I'm going to first use select function
to achieve that and then specify our
lambda expression X such that just
retrieve subjects property now here
subjects property is in our returning
list of strings and if I hover the mouse
over to select extension method notice
what this method is returning it's
returning i enumerable of list of string
so it's like list of list of strings so
let's use a variable of type I a new
mobile of list of string and let's call
this result so at the moment here within
this result variable we are going to
have you know list of list of strings so
in order to print the subjects of all
the students we will have to use two
nested for each loops so the first for
each loop is going to loop through the
list of you know list of strings so list
of string let's call this string list n
result
and then we are going to use another for
each loop to loop through each string
that we have within the string list and
then print the value that is there
within that string so for each string
let's call it STR n string list console
dot write line write the value out to
the console so now when we run this as
you might expect all the subjects of all
the students will be printed out now
let's see how to achieve the same thing
using select many method so instead of
select I'm going to make use of select
many method and the lambda expression
stays the same right now when I hover
the mouse over select many look at what
is what it is returning it's written in
just ienumerable of strain it's not
returning i enumerable of list of
strings right so with select many we are
not getting list of you know list of a
given type instead we are getting a
single list of you know in this case
list of strings so what is select many
going to do it's going to flatten list
of a given type into a single sequence
right so in this case the type is string
so it's going to flatten all the four
string arrays into one string array okay
that's why we are getting here you know
one ienumerable of string array so let's
store that and ienumerable of string
let's call it result and then since
there is going to be just one collection
we just need one for each loop to loop
through all the strings that we have
caught within this result so let's go
ahead and print it onto the console so
let's run this the output should be
exactly the same thing so in short what
is the difference in this example select
method returns list of list of strings
so obviously to print all the subjects
of all the students
we will have to use two nested for each
loops but on the other hand select many
method flattens queries that returns
lists of lists into a single list so in
this case to print all the subjects we
just have to use one for each loop
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
