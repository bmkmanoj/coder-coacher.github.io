this video we'll discuss why use master
pages it's common for a website to have
a consistent looking behavior across all
the pages in the web application it's
common for a website to have a website
header
some kind of navigation menu website
footer and a main section this is the
section that changes on a page-by-page
basis to have a layout similar to the
one that we have seen on the previous
slide across all our pages without the
use of master pages there are two
options in asp.net option one copy and
paste the required HTML across all pages
in the application to speed things up I
have already implemented that HTML so
let's copy that HTML
let's now flip to visual studio here I
have a blank asp.net webforms
application within this webform one dot
aspx let's paste the copied HTML let's
now select the entire HTML press ctrl K
and a D to format it properly to achieve
this layout we have used HTML table so
notice that we have an HTML table here
where we have set font family to area
and the table is going to contain 3 TR
so this is the first year second TR and
third TR so within this table notice
that we have caught 3 TRS and notice
that within the first year we have only
one TD and the width of that a TD should
span across the width of two TDs to
achieve that we have said call span of
the TD in the first TR - - and we have
also said this style attribute we have
set width through 800 pixels high to 80
pixels this is the background color and
we have center align the text and this
is the text that is displayed in the
header and within the second TR we have
got two TDs
this is the first TD
and this is the second @td notice the
width of the first TD is much lesser
than the width of the second TD okay so
within the second TR we have got two TDs
this is the first TD which displays that
text menu and again for this TD we have
set the style attribute height is set to
500 pixels this is the background color
and notice the width
150 pixels and the width of second TD is
650 pixels because that is the main
section of the layout which is going to
change on a page-by-page basis and the
final TR has got only one TD and the
width for that one TD is planning across
the width of two TDs so within the final
TR we've got only one TD asset called
span - - there's the background color we
have center align the text so very
straightforward HTML here all right now
let's go ahead and run this
so when went from one renders we should
have a layout similar to this one okay
now let's say we want to have this
similar layout on all of the pages in
our entire application and let's assume
our application is going to contain 200
waveforms now if we want to have this
layout on all of the 200 waveforms then
we need to copy this HTML on all of the
200 platforms so what are the drawbacks
of copying and pasting this HTML on all
of the pages within the application here
are their first of all we will have lot
of duplicated HTML on every page and
number two if we have to change
something in the common layout we will
have to make that change in all the
pages which is time-consuming and
error-prone for example if we want to
change the website header to my website
header we have to change that text on
each and every page where we have copied
and pasted this HTML which is time
consuming and
error-prone alright the second option is
to implement the layout using user
controls so what we basically can do is
create a header user control a menu user
control and then a website footer user
control and then we can use those user
controls on each and every web form what
are the disadvantages of using the user
controls to achieve this layout here are
they first of all we will end up with
complicated HTML and CSS if we have to
design the layout similar to the one
that we have seen on the previous slide
using user controls and number two all
the user controls have to be manually
added on each and every page of the site
ok so again there is a manual element
there that's why the best approach to
have a consistent look and feel across
all the pages in a web application is to
use master pages in our next video we'll
discuss master pages that's it for today
thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
