tutorial in this video we'll discuss the
significance of update check property
this is continuation to part 18 so
please watch part 18 before proceeding
update check property of column
attribute Clause is used to determine
how link to sequel detects concurrency
conflicts let's understand this with an
example let's flip to visual studio this
is the same example that we worked with
in the previous video session let's go
ahead and run the application we did not
explicitly set any values for this
update check property so at the moment
we are running the application with the
defaults for that property now let's go
to sequel server management studio and
then fire up sequel profiler let's
connect to the local server and let's
run a new trace now let's click this
deposit finder dollars button and let's
go back to sequel profiler and look at
the update query that is generated let's
copy this and actually paste it within
sequencer management studio so you can
see it much better now look at the
weight loss within the weight loss all
the three columns of this accounts table
are involved in detecting concurrency
conflicts so that's the default behavior
by default all the columns of that table
will be involved in detecting
concurrency conflicts now in your
project you may have a requirement where
you want to exclude some of the columns
you know from detecting concurrency
conflicts if that's the case that's when
we use update check property explicitly
so let's see how to set this property
let's flip to visual studio so let's go
to sample dot DB ml file so here we have
this account entity representing this
accounts table and all the three
properties represent those three columns
in that accounts table now what we want
to do is exclude this account balance
column from detecting concurrency
conflicts if that's the case right-click
on that account balance property select
properties and then within the
properties window notice that we have
update check property and that's the
default value look at this by default it
is set to always meaning
always include the column that this
property represents in detecting
concurrency conflicts and if I drop this
list down notice that it has got three
values always never been changed now
let's set this to never when we set this
to never we are saying never include
this column and detecting concurrency
conflicts there is another value here
when change this means only when the
value of this property is changed that's
when use that you know property or
column that property represents in
detecting concurrency conflicts so we
have a fine-grained control here and we
can set this update check property you
know for each of the properties of that
entity okay so at the moment we are
setting for account balance update check
to never let's save these changes now if
we go to the sample dot designer dot CS
file this is where we'll have the code
for account entity so if we scroll down
we should have a class representing
account and within this class we should
have properties representing account
number account name our account balance
so here we have account number and here
we have account name and account balance
now if you look at account number
account name and account balance all
these properties notice that all of them
are decorated with column attribute and
if you look at the column attribute for
account balance notice that we have a
value set explicitly for update check
property and that is set to update check
never so what is this update check this
is actually an enum and it has got all
these three values and we just discussed
what they mean so for this property we
have set explicitly the value for update
check property but if you look at the
other three other two properties we
don't have update check property now
these two properties are using the
defaults of that update check property
okay so with all these changes let's go
ahead and run the waveform once again
let's actually clear the trace and let's
click this deposit $500 button once
again now let's look at the update grade
that is generated so let's copy that now
look at the very laws so within the very
last now we have just account number and
the account name account balance is not
included in the where clause
so it's excluded from detecting
concurrency conflicts so that's the
significance of this update check
property
now this enum update check enum is
present in system dot data dot link
mapping namespace now we also discussed
that the default is always this means by
default all the columns will be used to
detect concurrency conflicts thank you
for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
