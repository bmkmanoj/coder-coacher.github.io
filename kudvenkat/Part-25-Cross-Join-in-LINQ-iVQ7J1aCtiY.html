this video we'll discuss implementing
cross join and link curls join produces
a Cartesian product that is when we
cross join two sequences every element
in the first collection is combined with
every element in the second collection
the total number of elements in the
resultant sequence will always be equal
to the product of the elements in the
two source
sequences the on keyword that specifies
the join key is not required with cross
join let's look at an example let's flip
to visual studio so here I have a new
control application to which I have
already added department and employee
classes within the department class
we've got two departments and with an
employee class we've got five employees
let's cross join these two collections
so within the main method let's create a
variable to hold the result so we want
to cross join employee's collection with
the departments collection so from E in
Android get all employees from the in
department dot get all departments we
are not going to make use of the on
keyword because this is a cross join so
instead we are simply going to select
these two objects the employee and
department objects using a new anonymous
type now let's use a for each loop
and what we want to do is print the
employee name and the department name so
console dot write line v dot e so e here
is the employee object and the name
property should give us the name of the
employee let's print a tab space and
then the name of the department so V dot
D here is the department object again
the name property should give us the
name of the department let's run this so
look at the output notice how many
elements have we got here here we have
ten elements that is the Cartesian
product of the number of elements that
are present in employees and departments
collection notice that every element
from the employee's collection is
combined with every element within the
departments collection now let's change
this query slightly let's actually take
this departments collection make it the
first collection and then the employees
the second collection so let's run this
now and look at the output it's slightly
different from what we had in example
one in this case every element from the
departments collection is combined with
every element in the employees
collection but the add at the end of the
day the total number of elements is
still ten that is the Cartesian product
of the two source sequences now here we
are using sequel like syntax to
implement cross join let's see how to
implement cross join using extension
method syntax
now when it comes to extension method
syntax there are two ways that we can
implement cross join we can either use
select many extension method or join
extension method first let's see how to
use the select many extension method so
employee dot get all employees this is
going to give us the list of employees
which we want to cross join with
departments collection so the first
parameter that I'm going to pass here is
the other collection that I want to
cross join with employees so what is the
other collection it's departments so
department dot get all departments so we
for every employee object right now we
want to join that with the
Department or object and the second
parameter is the result selector so what
do you want within the result within the
result we want the employee object from
the employees collection and the
department object from the departments
collection so we are going to get let's
say e and D we want to project that into
a new anonymous type and within the
anonymous type you want those two
objects a and D so here we are
implementing cross join using select
many extension method let's run this now
and look at that we have a cross join
there every element that the employees
collection is combined with every
element within the department's
collection now let's see how to rewrite
this using join extension method a joint
extension method has got different
parameters so the first parameter here
is the other sequence the other sequence
is Department dot get all departments
and then the other parameter the second
parameter is the outer key selector now
for this what I'm going to say is e such
that we are simply going to return true
and the inner key selector the inner
sequences departments so I'm going to
say D such that true ok so this
condition is kind of going to be true
for every element and within the result
selector what we want we want this EECOM
D to be projected into a new anonymous
type so within the anonymous type we
want a and D so here we are using the
join extension method to implement cross
join so let's run this and notice that
we get the identical output
that's it for today thanks for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
