Frank ed this is part 44 of a spirit and
grid-view tutorial in this video we'll
discuss about sorting a grid we control
that uses sequel data source control
let's flip to visual studio
let's drag and drop grid view control
onto the waveform let's auto format this
lets choose brown sugar scheme now we
will be using table TBL employee for
this demo to retrieve data from this
table I'm gonna make use of Sigma data
source control so let's fill up Visual
Studio drag-and-drop sequel data source
control and let's configure this now
let's select the connection string click
Next select table TBL employee we want
to retrieve all the columns from this
table so select star from TBL employee
click Next test a query finish now let's
associate the sequel data source control
with this grid we control and look at
this the moment I do that I get this
option enable sorting but before we
select that let's actually inspect the
grid view controls HTML notice that at
the moment the HTML of this grid view
control does not have allow sorting
attribute on that okay let's flip this
waveform to the design mode and notice
the headers of the grid we control they
are not rendered as hyperlinks but the
moment I'm going to select this checkbox
enable sorting notice what happens to
headers they are now rendered as
hyperlinks meaning and users can click
on those columns to sort the data all
right and then another important thing
to keep in mind is once I have selected
that option enable sorting look at this
all it has done is it has set this
attribute on the grid view control all
of sorting is equal to true that's all
there to it let me run this now when the
waveform renders as you might expect the
headers within the grid we control will
be rendered as hyperlinks upon which we
can click to sort the data based on that
column for example at the moment let's
click on the city column header and
notice that the data is sorted in
ascending order now what happens if I
click on that column header once again
look at this the data is now resorted in
descending order
meaning if you click the first time it
gets sorted in the ascending order if
you click the second time it's going to
get sorted in descending order okay so a
grid we control that is sortable in both
the directions is called as
bi-directional sortable grid we control
now if we have to sort a grid we control
you know that gets its data from a
sequel data source control we don't have
to write even a single line of code all
right and if you look at this grid we
control at the moment we can sort the
data based on every column but let's say
in your project the requirement is that
you don't want to allow users to be
sorting the grid we control on maybe
gender if that's the requirement all you
need to do is look at this every bound
column has got another attribute called
a sort expression so for example let's
say I don't want to sort by gender all I
need to do is for that gender bound
column you know just remove the sort
expression and you're done so let's get
rid of that one let's run this now as
you might expect you know the gender
column now is not rendered as hyperlink
meaning I cannot click on that meaning I
cannot sort data by that column it's so
simple all right
on this slide you can find resources for
asp.net c-sharp and sequence of
interview questions that's it for today
thank you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
