venket this is part 1 1 7 of asp.net
video series in this video we'll discuss
about assigning an image to the
composite custom control in visuals for
your toolbox in parts 112 to 116 of the
asp.net video series we have discussed
about building asp.net composite custom
controls and adding them to visual
studio toolbox in these parts we have
discussed about building this composite
custom calendar control when we added
this custom calendar to the visual
studio toolbox you know look at the
image that is associated with this
control it's a very generic image in
this video we'll discuss about
associating a custom image with this
particular composite control now to
achieve that we can use toolbox bitmap
attribute this attribute is present in
system detroying namespace and there are
two ways we can use this attribute one
way is we can actually associate the
image of an existing control now in
which Visual Studio toolbox we have got
several controls already the built-in
controls that's provided by dotnet
framework now let's say for example I
want to associate the image that is
associated with this asp.net calendar
control where you know with this custom
calendar is it possible absolutely we
can make use of this toolbox a bitmap
attribute class so let's flip to our
custom controls project so within this
custom controls project we have this
custom calendar dot CS file within which
we have the complete code for this
custom calendar ok alright so here we
have this toolbox attribute
toolbox data attribute along with that
I'm going to use this box bitmap
attribute now this attribute is present
in system drawer drawing namespace so
let's go ahead and import that first
so using system dot drawing
so we are going to use tool box bitmap
attribute and if you look at this
attribute it has got three constructors
the first constructor takes an image
file which you know the part of the
image file we are not using an image
file at the moment we are using you know
we are going to use the image of an
existing asp.net control so I'm going to
make use of the image of this calendar
control now remember all these controls
are actually classes okay so calendar
control is actually a calendar class now
if we have to use the image that is
associated with this calendar control or
calendar class all you need to do is in
the custom controls project you know
specify this toolbox which map attribute
and then I'm going to use this second
you know
version of the constructor which expects
the type to be passed okay so to get to
retrieve the type I can make use of type
off keyword and then since I want to use
the image that is associated with the
calendar control so I specify the
calendar class there that's that type of
calendar which is going to return the
type of that class that's it we are done
so it's just one line that is required
on the other hand if you want to use the
image of another control maybe you know
drop-down list you just specify type of
drop-down list that's it let's go ahead
and rebuild this project now let's flip
to visual studio I mean the asp.net web
application project and let's go to the
custom controls now I want to remove
this custom calendar and we first get
rid of that within the page
okay let me also quickly go into the
project and check in the bin folder and
then remove it from there so custom
controls let's delete that from there
and now let's get rid of this from the
toolbox so choose items and then let's
remove it custom calendar okay
that's gone from there so let's go ahead
and riad the control so choose items our
project is present in C Drive so click
browse navigate to C Drive and the name
of the project is custom controls
project and within that in the bin
folder debug custom controls tor DLL and
look at this as soon as I select that
you know custom controls project we have
the custom calendar and I already see
the icon here so obviously when I click
OK I'm going to get that here custom
calendar simple and straightforward ok
so that's one way of use using this
toolbox bitmap attribute ok we can
associate the image of an existing
control ok and another ways if we have
our own image a custom image that we
have made and if we want to associate
that even that's possible all you have
to do is use another you know
constructor that's available let's
actually look at this I actually have an
image here in the images folder in C
Drive I have an image called
custom calendar icon dot BMP ok look at
the image one thing to keep in mind is
the image height and width need to be 16
by 16 pixels and we can very easily
create this using Microsoft Paint
program and to do that click on the
start button let me quickly show you how
we can very easily create images using
that so now in the run window type
mspaint click OK that should open up
Microsoft Paint I want the image
dimensions to be 16 pixels in height and
16 pixels in width and to you know
change the width of the image I can go
to the properties of the image and then
here I can set you know the height and
width and pick
so I want that to be 16 by 16 I click
okay so it's a very small icon there and
let's say for example I want to fill it
with some color maybe so I fill it with
some color and then I can put some text
using this text box there and then
whatever you want to put okay basically
you can create an image of your choice
very easily using this image paint or
using Photoshop you know alright so once
I have this custom image then we can
very easily associate this using the
other overloaded constructor of this
bitmap toolbox bitmap class so the other
version I have is you know which expects
the image path remember the image is
present in C Drive images folder so let
me copy that and then I'm going to use
the verbatim literal and specify the
path C colon backslash images backslash
and custom calendar control dot BMP
let's copy the name and paste it there
okay so we are done with this now all we
have to do rebuild the solution so Bill
succeeded on the status bar let's flip
to the asp.net web application project
where we are testing it all we need to
do is remove that and re add a reference
to that assembly which should you know
show that custom image instead of the
asp.net no built in asp.net calendars
image here so let's go ahead and remove
that custom calendar click ok so that's
gone there I click on that choose items
and then navigate to that folder C Drive
custom controls bin-debug custom
controls click that look at that I got
my custom image pretty straightforward
all you have to do is use this toolbox a
bitmap attribute in our next video will
will discuss about the differences
between user controls and custom
controls in fact this is a very
important interview question as well so
please stay tuned on the slide you can
find resources for asp.net c-sharp and
sequel server interview questions that's
it for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
