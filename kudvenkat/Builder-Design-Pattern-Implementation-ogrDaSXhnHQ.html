2 will of the design patterns tutorial
in this session we will do a quick recap
of previous session and will discuss how
to implement the Builder design pattern
we strongly recommend you to refer to
the previous parts of the tutorial
before proceeding in the previous
session we have implemented the business
requirement of configuring the systems
allocated to the employees without using
any design patterns now let's assume
that we have a new requirement of
choosing the system configurations based
on the computer type that we need to
build let's say we need to choose
different type of configurations for the
laptops and desktops that are allocated
to the employees for example a laptop
user can choose touchscreen as a
configuration whereas desktop users can
configure keyboard and mouse as
discussed earlier the current
implementation which we adopted in the
previous session becomes complex and
complicated if we do not choose any
creational design pattern over here in
our case since we are building the
system configuration in a step-by-step
process build a design pattern suits our
requirement first let's see how we can
migrate the current code to the Builder
implementation once it is achieved we
will address the additional requirements
as mentioned here let's now switch to
visual studio and implement the solution
using our previous working example let's
start decoupling the computer system
class that we have built in the previous
session of Builder design pattern first
let's create a folder under this web
project a new folder and name this
folder as builder let's create another
folder under this builder folder add new
folder and name this folder as product
the end product that we are going to
build is the computer system and we have
already created computer system class in
the previous session
let's move this computer system class to
this product folder let's create another
folder under the Builder folder a new
folder and name this as I builder which
holds the interface is related to the
Builder design pattern let's create add
new item and let's add an interface and
let's name this interface as I system
builder since we are building the system
configuration we are choosing the name
as I system builder on another node to
simplify the Builder design pattern
explanation and to match the explanation
with the representation diagram that we
have used in the previous session and
following this folder structure however
please feel free to come up with your
own way of defining the classes based on
your requirement the main purpose of
this AI system builder is to build the
system in a step by step process and
finally it should return the object once
it is built let's say while building the
system we need to add memory so let's
create a method interface method white
add memory let's pass the parameter as
memory let's create another method to
add drive size white a drive which I
accept the drive size as the input
parameter once the builder builds both
of the required configurations ad then
we need to return the build system which
is our computer system so let's add
another method which returns computer
system and named this method as gate
system let's now switch to the computer
system and eliminate the constructor
with parameters and change these private
properties to public so that these are
set from the concrete builder classes
has changed this to public let's also
remove this underscore Ram and rename
the
as RAM and let's set the properties for
this ramus get and set so that it
becomes a public variable let's also
change this to public and rename the HDD
Desai's remove the underscore and assign
get and set properties for this let's
now add concrete builder classes which
implements the PI system builder right
click on this builder folder and new
folder and name this folder as concrete
builder let's add a class add new item
choose a class and name this class as
desktop builder let's add another class
add new item choose the class let's name
this class as laptop builder let's
inherit the interface I system builder
which resolved this issue by using the
dot builder dot i builder
let's also implement the interface
methods implement interface the purpose
of this laptop builder is to build the
system configurations and return the
computer system which is being built so
let's create a computer system object
computer system object and name it as
laptop since we are building a laptop
equal to new computer system in the a
drive let's say a laptop dot HDD size
equal to size let's assign the
properties for the laptop for memory it
will be laptop dot ram equal to memory
once these two configurations are
let's return the laptop here return
laptop let's now switch to the desktop
builder and implement the I system
builder to make the things faster I have
already implemented the I system builder
in the destroyed builder class the only
differences we are building a computer
system which is a desktop over here and
we are retaining the desktop once the
configurations are built now as per the
enhancer requirement let's say we need
to provide an option to add keyboard and
add Moses the configurations for desktop
and we need to add touchscreen as a
configuration for a laptop let's switch
to the I system builder notice that
adding memory and drive are the common
configurations for both desktop and
laptop let's add few more methods to the
I system builder to address the enhancer
requirements for desktop let's say we
need to choose the type of keyboard and
mouse which would be either wireless or
a regular USB mouse so let's add those
methods as void add keyboard and which I
accept string type as the input
parameter let's also say add void add
Mouse which I accept the type of the
Moses input parameter let's now add
another method void add that screen with
input parameter a string enabled it says
whether the touch screen is enabled for
the laptop or not let's now switch to
the desktop builder I notice that I
system builder is showing a compilation
error so let's fix this error by
implementing the missing methods now in
the add keyboard we need to assign the
keyboard type to assign the keyboard
type for the computer system
let's switch to the computer system and
add properties to the computer system
the properties would be string keyboard
add another property string mouse and
let's add another property string
touchscreen let's now switch back to the
desktop builder and assign this
properties here let's say desktop dot
keyboard equal to type of the keyboard
let's also do the same thing for add
Moe's as well desktop dot Mouse equal to
type of the mouse now that screen
doesn't make any sense further desktop
builder so let's just do a return here
let's now switch to the laptop builder
to make the things faster
I have already implemented the new
methods of the I system builder in this
laptop builder notice that have added
touchscreen as a property and using a
written statement for keyboard and mouse
as it doesn't make any sense using
keyboard and mouse for a laptop builder
let's create another class that controls
the way builder is executed in some
situations building a product has to
follow specific steps and the class that
directs the specific way of execution is
called director let's create a folder
called director that builds the system
using I system builder and the
collection of parameters that's being
passed let's create a folder in a class
right leg and new folder and call this
folder as director and let's add a class
right click add new item and call this
director class as configuration builder
let's add a method build system with AI
system builder and name-value
collections as the input parameters to
make the things faster let me copy the
code which have already written from my
notepad the AI system builder is an
interface which represents either the
laptop builder or desktop builder in the
runtime whereas the name value
collections are the configuration chosen
for these concrete builder classes from
the front end note that we are building
the system in the configuration builder
let's switch to the computer system and
remove the build method that we have
created in our previous session to make
the things faster have created two views
for laptop and desktop under the
employees view folder along with the
common configuration such as RAM and
hard disk I have provided an option to
choose that screen in the laptop view
whereas in the desktop view I have
provided an option to choose keyboard
and mouse types you may be wondering why
we need to create two new views to
answer that it's not mandatory to create
two new views and we can leverage on
creating these two system types as
partial views and embed them in the main
build a system view however to make the
things simple have created two new views
now on submit click we are submitting
the views to their respective
controllers let's switch to the
employees controller to make the things
faster notice that I have already
enhanced of the build system action
method which we have created in the
previous session the build system will
return the respective views of desktop
and laptop based on the system type
allocated to the employees I have also
added two new action methods which are
build app top and build a stop let's
take a closer look at and inspect the
code of the build a stop action method
that have already created notice that in
the first step we are retrieving the
employee
details and in the second step we are
creating the instance of the system
builder which would be the desktop
builder or laptop builder in our case we
are creating it this table builder here
in the third step we are creating the
director object and passing the concrete
builder and the form collection which is
a configuration chosen from the
respective view the director is
responsible to build the system and once
that is done in the fourth step we are
returning the computer system which has
the details assigned as the properties
at the end we are saving the
configurations to the system
configuration details column of the
employee table let's now run this
application and see these changes in
action let's choose employees tab let's
click on build system of Sebastien who
has got desktop notice that the moment
we click on the build system it is
presented with the desktop view let's
choose the memory 16gb drive as founder
GB Mo's as a wireless mouse and keyboard
as a regular USB keyboard let's click on
create look at that we have successfully
built the configuration of the apple
desktop which is allocated to Sebastian
let's do the same thing with Andrew who
is the manager let's click on the build
system look at that we are presented
with the laptop view let's now choose
the memory as I 8 GB and the drive as
500 GB now let's choose touch enabled as
yes let's click on create
notice that we have successfully built
the system configurations of Andrew who
is a manager and whole set dell laptop
with this we have successfully addressed
the requirement by using builder design
pattern I hope now you got familiar with
the Builder design pattern let's now
switch to the Builder design pattern
representation diagram notice that the
product in the left part of the diagram
corresponds to the computer system
whereas the builder corresponds to the I
system builder class
we have created two concrete builders
which are our desktop and laptop
builders which corresponds to the
concrete builder in the left-side
configuration builder is the director in
our case and is represented in the left
part of the diagram in the next session
we'll discuss how to implement fluent
builder and we'll also discuss the
differences between Factory and the
Builder design pattern thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
