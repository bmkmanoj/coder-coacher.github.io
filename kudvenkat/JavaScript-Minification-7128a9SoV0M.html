in this video we'll discuss what
javascript minification and the benefits
we get towards javascript minification
javascript minification is the process
of reducing the script file size by
removing comments extra white spaces and
newline characters that are not required
for executing JavaScript code javascript
minification may reduce the size of the
file by 30 to 90 percent the
minification process will not change its
original functionality in any way what
are the benefits of javascript
minification
the javascript file needs to be
downloaded to the client machine before
the browser can execute your javascript
code let's understand what we mean by
this statement here we have an HTML page
with three buttons when we view this
HTML page in a browser this is how it
looks like when we click this button get
browser name and version it displays the
browser name and version when we click
get current month it is placed a current
month get current week date displays the
current weekday all this is achieved
using javascript now notice when we
click this button get browser name and
version the call and get browser info
JavaScript function when we click get
current month we are call and get
current month function get current week
day we're calling gate current weekday
function where are all these functions
present notice within the head section
we have a script reference we are
referencing an external javascript file
with named J's file dot J's
this is present in our project folder
and this javascript file has got all
those three JavaScript functions notice
we have great current weekday get
current month and get browser info now
when a client makes a request to this
page HTML page one dot HTM along with
the pages HTML it also needs to send
this javascript file JS file dot GS so
this javascript file
need to be downloaded to the client
machine so the client browser can
execute the JavaScript functions right
so that's what this is
statement means the javascript file
needs to be downloaded to the client
machine before the browser can execute
your javascript code since javascript
minification reduces the size of the
file we have these benefits reduced
download time less bandwidth consumption
of your website reduced javascript time
as well because all the commons extra
white spaces and newline characters are
removed multiple javascript files can be
compressed into one minified javascript
file this means there are now reduced
number of HTTP request to your server
which in turn reduces the load on the
server and allows more users to access
your website let's say within our
application we've got four different
JavaScript files
this means this client browser have to
make four different HTTP requests to
download all those four files now if we
combine all those four JavaScript files
into one javascript file and if we
minify that then the client browser
needs to make just one HTTP request
which means that it's less load on the
server that means the server can now
process more requests now let's look at
the process of javascript minification
there are several tools available as you
can see here now there are also several
websites that provide online javascript
minification and here is one such
website now when we visit that website
so we can paste our javascript text here
and then minify it so let's go to our
javascript file
so before we minify that let's open the
project folder in windows explorer and
if you look at the size of this half
file notice that the size is one point
six six claw bytes right so now let's go
ahead and cut this entire javascript
file from this file and paste it within
this text box so now if you look at this
javascript code it's very readable
because you have caught comments if god
you know white spaces newline characters
so it's easier on the
it's easy to read now let's go ahead and
minify it notice that this is how the
minified version looks like now this is
not easy to read it's not easier on the
eyes it's not easy to debug as well
okay we'll look at that in just a bit
now look at the statistics here the old
version of our script had 17 100
characters the new version has only 741
characters and if you look at this new
version notice that it has removed the
comments it has removed the unnecessary
white spaces and the newline characters
now let's go ahead and copy this and
paste it into our script file notice
that all over three functions are
present in just one line okay let's save
this let's go back to our script file
size and if you look at the size now
notice that it's only 847 bytes so there
is less data to be downloaded onto the
client browser so the performance of the
page will be much better now let's check
you know let's reload this page and see
if it continues to work the same way
look at this when I click I still get
you know the browser name and version we
still get the current month we still get
the current week day so the
functionality is not changed in any way
what are the disadvantages of javascript
minification we have just seen that
readability is lost and debugging can be
difficult because we don't have comments
all the extra white spaces and newline
characters are removed however keep in
mind if there is a production issue it's
very rare for someone to debug directly
on the production server so for
production purposes we'll use minified
version you know for performance reasons
and if there is a production issue and
if we need to debug it we will be
debugging it on the development
environment so within your development
environment you can have non minified
version so non minified version is going
to provide better readability deep
is easier but on production we won't be
reading the code directly on the
production server so you know have the
non minified version there so you have
better performance and anytime you want
to debug your production issues you have
the non minified version the development
environment thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
