this video well disk is binding menu
control to web dot sitemap file using
sitemap data source control this is
continuation to part 157 so please watch
but 157 from the asp.net tutorial before
proceeding with this video in part 155
we discussed binding menu control to an
XML file using XML data source control
it's also possible to bind a menu
control to web dot a sitemap file we
discussed sitemap files in our previous
session in fact if you recollect from
the previous video session we added this
web dot sitemap file to the project that
we have been working with so here is
that website map file that we added in
the previous session and we discussed
this XML in detail in the previous
session so that's the first step and the
second step is to drag and drop sitemap
data source control so this control is
capable of reading data automatically
from web dot sitemap file so let's flip
to visual studio let's actually drag and
drop a sitemap data source control let's
actually drag and drop that next to the
menu control and the sitemap data source
control is present on the data tab
within a toolbox so notice the name of
the control it is sitemap data source
which is going to read data
automatically from web dot sitemap file
we don't have to specify any other
attributes that's going to happen
automatically if there is a web dot
sitemap file within your project all
right so the final step is to associate
this menu control with the sitemap data
source control but if you look at this
menu control at the moment this is
actually getting its data from database
okay and we have written that ad or
dotnet code within the code behind file
of this master page so let's comment
this private method get' menu items and
we are calling that method within the
page load event so let's go and comment
this line as well
so we have removed that hoop now now
let's configure this menu control to
actually use this data source control
and to do
that we're going to use this data source
ID attribute and that should be equal to
the ID of site map data source control
so this is very straightforward here we
have this sitemap file
you know this sitemap data source
control is going to read data from that
file automatically and then we have set
the data source for this menu as the
sitemap data source control so this menu
now is going to get its data from web
dot sitemap file so let's actually run
this and see if it works as expected
okay so we are getting something here
look at that we have dummy root here so
where is this dummy root coming from if
you look at our sitemap file that's what
is the root node here and that's what is
being displayed you know as the root
element within the menu and then
underneath that we have got home
employee employer and underneath them we
have respect to links but then within
our application there's no reason why we
are displaying this tomato we want to
hide that so how we are going to achieve
that simply set this attribute on site
map data source control so what's the
attribute show starting node set that to
false let's flip to visual studio within
master page we have the site map data
source control show starting node equals
false so basically we are telling don't
show the starting node sass implies that
let's run this and see if that is going
to work as expected look at that it
works now as expected all right that's
it for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
