this video well disk is using asp.net
validation controls with recapture
control this is continuation to part 166
so please watch part 1 66 before
proceeding if you have a validation
summary control on the page and if the
recapture control fails validation it
automatically displays the error message
in validation summary control so all you
need on the page is the validation
summary control where you want the error
message to appear so let's look at this
in action let's flip to visual studio so
this is the same example that we worked
with in the previous video session now
immediately after this table row which
contains our submit button let's include
another table room and then within that
another TD and let's set call span
equals 2 and then within this TD let's
include a validation summary control and
let's set for color attribute to red so
the error messages appear in red color
with these changes let's run our
application so the waveform is taking a
bit longer to render here and let's
click this register button notice that
the validation error message the
verification words are incorrectly
displayed within the validation summary
control now notice here we have a second
validation error message so where is
this coming from this is coming from
this label control so if you recollect
from the previous video session within
the submit button click event handler we
are checking the page is valid or not
if the recapture control has failed
validation this property is going to
return false in which case the control
will get to the else block and here we
are setting that message validation
failed you know as the value for the
text property of the label control now
since we have a validation summary
control displaying the error message we
no longer require this else bar so let's
get rid of that and let's rerun our
application and let's click the register
button and notice that we only get the
error message within the validation
summary control now let's see how to use
a custom validated control with
recapture control so here is what we
want to do we want to display a red ass
track next to the recaptured control so
this red asterisk is going to tell us
which field on the forum has failed
validation and the detailed error
message will be displayed in the
validation summary control so let's see
how to achieve this so the first step
here is to actually include a custom
validator on the page next to the
recapture control and look at the custom
validator configuration here we are
setting text equal stars so that's what
will be displayed when the recapture
control fails validation and then we are
setting color to red and here we are
specifying the server-side function that
needs to be called so using this own
server validate attribute so this is the
method that gets called to validate you
know the recapture control so within the
server-side method by using the East
valid property to check whether if the
recapture control has failed validation
now recapture here is the ID of the
recapture control and each valid
property is a boolean property which is
going to return true if it has succeeded
validation otherwise false and we are
setting that you know as the value for
each valid property of server-side
validate event arguments object okay so
those are the two steps required to
speed things up I already have the
required HTML for this custom validator
already typed so let's copy that let's
go back to visual studio and then on the
web form so here we have our recapture
control within this TD so here let's
actually include a table and then
include it TR and then let's include two
TDs one TD for the recapture control and
another TD for the validation control
that is the custom validator control so
let's copy this recapture control
and put this inside this DD all right
within the code-behind file we need to
have that server-side validation method
and again have the code already type so
let's copy that
all right so with these changes let's
run the application and when we click
register notice that we get a red
airstrip next to the recapture control
and the detail error message within the
validation summary control thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
