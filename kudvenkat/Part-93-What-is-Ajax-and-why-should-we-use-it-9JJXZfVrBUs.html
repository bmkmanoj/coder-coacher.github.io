this video we'll discuss what's Ajax
advantages and disadvantages of using
Ajax applications that are out there
that are currently using Ajax and when
to use Ajax this is continuation to part
92 so please watch part 92 before
proceeding with this video
so what's ajax ajax stands for
asynchronous JavaScript and XML AJAX
enabled web applications to retrieve
data from the server asynchronously
let's understand this term
asynchronously first let's understand
synchronous request response cycle let's
say we have a client-server application
and then I have a button on a form and
let's say the button click event handler
takes 10 seconds so in a synchronous
request response cycle when we click the
button a request is sent to the server
and the server is going to ten-second
takes and 10 seconds to process that
request so while the server is
processing the request the client is
blocked and waiting for that response to
be sent back to the client as the client
user interface is blocked the user
cannot do anything with that application
so basically here in asynchronous
request response cycle the user
interface is blocked while the request
is being processed by the server so that
is synchronous request response cycle
whereas in a asynchronous request
response cycle the client makes a
request and then the client is freed up
immediately so while the server is
processing the request the client is not
blocked the client is not waiting for
the response to come back instead in an
AJAX enabled web application on the
client we will have a JavaScript
function waiting and listening for that
response to come back but then the
client itself is freed up so if the end
user wants he can issue another request
so the application remains responsive
while the requests are still being
processed by the server as soon as the
silver completes processing and when the
response is sent back to the client the
JavaScript method that's waiting for
that response to come back will
automatically update the UI so in an
asynchronous request response
the applications are more responsive
because they are not blocked and waiting
for the response to come back and these
AJAX enabled web applications allow
partial page updates that is only the
related section of the page is updated
without reloading the entire page let's
understand these partial page updates
with an example so this is the
application that we have been working
with in the previous session now look at
this you know this page is already
loaded so we have this HTML here now in
a in a non Ajax application if you click
on a button for example what's going to
happen the page will be posted back to
the server and then the entire HTML will
be reloaded once again as a result will
have a screen flickers as well okay but
then within an AJAX application look at
this when I click on the stop 3 link we
get the top 3 students and only this
portion of the UI is updated not the
entire page so as only a portion of the
page is updated these are called as
partial page updates let's actually
prove that with Ajax we get partial page
updates and to prove that so within the
index page I'm going to print the
current date and time so just below this
HD h2 tag I'm going to print the current
time and let's use day time object so
day time dot now is going to give us the
current date and time but we are only
interested in time so let's use two long
string method and then let's use an HTML
break there okay so let me copy this
same piece of code and then paste that
within the student partial view so just
about this table tag I am going to paste
this alright let's go ahead and run this
now so when the page first loads look at
this this is the current time 1949 52
now when I click on this top 3 link look
at this this time it's not going to
change so I click top 3 we get the top
three students and look at the time 1950
oh five okay
when I click bottom three again only
this portion is updated
you know look at this time this has not
changed so with Ajax we get partial page
updates and the partial page updates you
know the amount of traffic that's
exchanged between the client and the web
server is also reduced because we are
not reloading that the entire HTML only
the HTML that is relevant to that
section of the page is exchanged between
the client and the server all right so
what are the advantages of ajax ajax
applications are non-blocking and we
just discussed that as ajax requests are
asynchronous the users doesn't have to
wait for the request processing to
complete even while the request is still
being processed by the server the
application remains responsive and the
user can still interact with the
application when the request processing
is complete the user interface is
automatically updated but this is not
the case with synchronous requests the
user interface is blocked and the user
cannot do anything while the request is
still being processed at the server side
and with Ajax we also get better
performance and reduced network traffic
Ajax enables an application to send and
receive only the data that is relevant
as a result that is reduced traffic
between the client and the server and
because of that we also get better
performance and there are no screen
flickers and again because of partial
page updates you are not reloading the
entire page only the data that is
relevant to that request in response is
exchanged between the client and the
server and only a portion of the page is
updated and as a result we don't have
screen flickers so what are the
disadvantages of using ajax ajax request
cannot be bookmarked easily now look at
this I have already bookmarked this
request so let me go ahead and get rid
of that bookmark first so let me open up
the browser and delete this bookmark
that's already there right let's
navigate to the index view let's
actually run this once again
so let's click top three so we have top
three students here now let's say I want
to bookmark this page so in Google
Chrome we click on that star and I'm
going to bookmark that so now if I open
another browser window look at that I
have the bookmark so when I visit that
bookmark what do I want I want you know
a page like this to be loaded you know I
want top three students I mean to be
displayed but then look at this when I
click on this I get this one I don't get
top three so Ajax requests cannot be
bookmarked you won't get the data that
you actually bookmarked look at this
here I bookmark you know this page which
is displaying top three students but
when I clicked on that bookmark you know
I don't have those top three students I
have to again click on this link and
Ajax relies on JavaScript so if
javascript is disabled on the client
browser Ajax applications won't work
naturally and these are harder to debug
as well because of asynchronous request
response cycle so if there is a problem
and you have to debug the problem you
know Ajax applications are slightly
complex to debug and search engines like
Google Bing Yahoo etc cannot include
Ajax pages in their search index and
what are the applications that are out
there that are currently using Ajax many
websites like Google Facebook all of
them uses Ajax for example you know
search engines like Google Bing YouTube
Yahoo etc they use Ajax to implement
autocomplete feature for example if we
go to google look at that as we start
typing here are for example difference
you know we get autocomplete feature and
how is this implemented this can be very
easily implemented using Ajax okay
similarly Bing Yahoo even in YouTube you
have this autocomplete feature and Gmail
also uses Ajax to implement autosave
feature now if you are composing an
email if you are composing a lengthy
email
you know whatever content that you type
into that email gets automatically saved
okay so if there is a power loss and if
your system has shut down you know the
data that you have type is is retail
because it's automatically saved okay so
to implement autosave feature again we
can use Ajax and Gmail also uses Ajax to
implement a remote validation for
example if we go to Gmail we have that
create account button so when I click on
this create an account button and let's
say here I use username could Bankhead
so this username is already used I'm
using this so look at this as soon as I
type
you know tab away someone already has
that username try another how are we
getting this validation error again by
using Ajax so similarly Facebook also
use Ajax to load data as you keep
scrolling down in your Facebook page
okay and we discussed this remote
validation in parts 89 90 and 91 in the
asp.net MVC tutorial
okay so Ajax is generally used to
implement features like auto complete
auto save remote validation etc in our
upcoming videos we'll discuss
implementing these features that's it
for today thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
