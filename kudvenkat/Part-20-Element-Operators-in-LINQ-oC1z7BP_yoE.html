video we'll discuss element operators
all of these standard query operators
belong to element operators category in
general element operators retrieve a
single element from a sequence using the
element index or based on a condition
all of these methods have a
corresponding overloaded version that
accepts a predicate using which we can
define the condition let's look at these
operators one by one with examples first
there are two overloaded versions of
this method the overloaded version that
does not have any parameters simply
returns the first element of a sequence
so here we have an integer array called
numbers which contain numbers from 1 to
9 and notice that we are executing the
first method against that number
sequence which will simply return the
first element from the sequence the
first element here is 1 so the output
will be resolved equals 1 this exact
same program with in visual studio here
when we run this as you might expect we
get the output result equals 1 now what
do you think is going to happen if we
execute this method against an empty
sequence it's going to throw an invalid
operation exception so if the sequence
does not contain any elements then first
method is going to throw an invalid
operation exception so let's remove
these elements from this sequence and
now when we run this notice that we get
invalid operation exception and look at
the exception message it states sequence
contains no elements now there is the
other overloaded version of this first
method now we use that other overloaded
version when we want to find the first
element in a sequence based on a
condition so notice that you know here
we have two overloaded versions one
overloaded version does not take any
parameters the second overloaded version
takes a parameter called predicate now
let's say for example we want to find
the first even number from this sequence
if that's the case then we specify a
condition here we know that a number is
said to be even
when it is divisible by two okay so this
expression will be executed against each
element any element you know any first
element that matches this condition
that's what will be returned by this
method so here number two is the first
element that satisfies this condition so
that's what we will get back result
equals two now again this overloaded
version is going to throw an exception
if the sequence is empty again look at
the message and valid operation
exception or even if the sequence
contains elements but if none of the
elements satisfies this condition again
we are going to get invalid operation
exception but this time look at the
exception message it says sequence
contains no matching elements so first
or default now this method is very
similar to first except that this method
does not throw an exception when there
are no elements in the sequence or when
no element satisfies the condition
specified by the predicate instead a
default value of the type that is
expected is return so let's understand
what we mean by the statement a default
value of the type that is expected is
returned now let's put back those
numbers here within this array now when
we call this first or default against
that numbers collection just like first
it's going to return the first element
in this case you know we get the output
result equals 1 now what do you think is
going to happen if the sequence does not
contain any elements now if we execute
the first method then it will throw an
exception but as first our default it's
not going to throw an exception instead
it's going to return the default value
of the type that we are expecting now
what is the time that we are expecting
here first of all notice that we are
executing this method against the
numbers array and the type of numbers
array is integer so when we call first
or default it's going
return an integer type and the default
value for the integer type is 0 because
integer is a value type and the default
value for integer is 0 so this method is
going to return 0 but it will not throw
the exception so when we run that notice
that the output is result equals 0 now
for all reference types the default
value is now but for value types you
know the default value depends on the
actual underlying type for integers it
is 0 for boolean it is false
etc now we have this method called last
this method is very similar to first
except that it returns the last element
of the sequence last our default again
this is very similar to first or default
except that it returns the last element
of the sequence let's look at element
add so this method returns an element
that is specified index if the sequence
is empty or the provided index value is
out of range then an argument out of
range exception is thrown so let's look
at that method so let's put back those
numbers within this sequence so element
at so we want the element that let's say
for example index position 1 so index
position start from 0 so 0 1 so at index
position 1 within the sequence we have
number 2 and that's what we will get and
we run this result equals 2 now if the
sequence does not contain any elements
and when we run this we will get
argument out of range exception and
let's say there are elements so there
are two elements but I am giving index
two since the index position starts with
0 1 so the maximum index position is 1
but we are specifying the index as 2
again we are going to get that same
exception index out of range exception
so that is element add now element at
our default this is similar to element
at except that this method does not
throw an exception if the sequence is
empty
all of the provided index value is out
of range instead a default value of the
type that is expected is returned let's
look at single this method is very
interesting now again there are two
older versions of this method the
overloaded version that does not have
any parameters return the only element
of the sequence so anytime you are
expecting a sequence to contain just one
element that's when this method is
extremely useful okay so here notice
that this number sequence contains one
element and when we call single we are
going to get that only element of that
sequence so the result in this case will
be one so let's say within the sequence
we have that one element now when I say
dot single and when we run this as you
might expect result will be result
equals one okay now what do you think is
going to happen if the sequence contain
two elements is going to throw an
exception okay invalid operation
exception sequence contain more than one
element and and we will also get an
exception of the sequences empty so you
know the single method is going to
return the only element of the sequence
the second overloaded version of the
single method is used to find the only
element in a sequence that satisfies a
given condition so again there are two
overloaded versions of this method so
one overloaded version does not take any
parameters the other overloaded version
takes a parameter called predicate now
let's say we want to find that the only
element within this sequence which is
divisible by two okay now in this case
there is only one element number two
which satisfies this condition so when
we run this we get that output result
equals two now what do you think is
going to happen if there are two
elements that matches this condition
again we are going to get that invalid
operation exception or if no element
matches this condition again we are
going to get that invalid operation
exception okay so an exception will
be thrown by the single method if the
sequence does not contain any elements
or if no element in the sequence
satisfies the given condition or if more
than one element in the sequence
satisfies the condition single or
default now this method is very similar
to single except that this method does
not throw an exception when the sequence
is empty or when no element in the
sequence satisfies the given condition
but keep in mind just like single this
method will still throw an exception if
more than one element in the sequence
satisfies the given condition default if
empty now this is very useful method if
the sequence on which this method is
called is not empty then the values of
the original sequence are returned okay
so here let's say we have numbers 1 2 &amp;amp;
3
now here the sequence is not empty now
when we called default if empty now look
at the return type it returns a
enumerable event unlike other element
operators you know this method is
actually returning a sequence back
ienumerable of integer so let's actually
store this in a variable called result
and now let's use a for each loop for
each where I n result what we want to do
is print the value of I to the console
so now when we run this as you might
expect will get values 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 okay so
but on the other hand if the sequence is
empty then this method returns a
sequence with the default value of the
expected type now what is the default
value of the expected type here it's you
know basically integer so the default
value is 0 so now let's say for example
we make this sequence empty okay if it
is empty then the default value of the
type we are expecting will be returned
it will be put in ienumerable in a
sequence and then we'll get that back so
when we run this the output will be 0
now there's the other alert version with
the parameter that allows us to specify
a default value so default if empty
there are two overloaded versions one
overloaded version does not take any
parameters the other one takes you know
a default value since we are invoking it
on an integer array now you know the
default value that we have to supply
will be of enter type now let's say the
default value is hundred okay and now
the sequence does not contain any
elements so as you might expect you know
the output will be 100 because that's
what will be returned you know in a
sequence so now notice that hundred now
on the other hand if the sequence
actually contains elements then those
elements will be returned that's it for
today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
