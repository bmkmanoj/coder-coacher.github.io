in this video well discuss different
ways of defining functions in JavaScript
one of the ways to define a function is
by using function declarations and tags
this is the standard and most common way
of defining functions in JavaScript here
we have two examples of defining a
function using function declarations and
tags in the first example notice that we
are defining the function first and then
we are calling the function so here we
have add numbers function to which we
are passing two parameters first number
second number we are adding them
together the sum is stored in this
result variable and finally we are
returning that result variable here we
are calling the function passing 10 and
20 as the values for first number and
second number parameters respectively we
are storing the return value of that
function in the sum variable and finally
writing the value in the sum variable to
the document object so in this example
we are defining the function first and
then we are calling the function in this
example notice that we are making a call
to add numbers function before its
definition so a call to the function is
present before it is defined so let's
see if these two examples are going to
work the same way so here we have this
add numbers function defined first and
then we are calling the function the
passing 10 and 20 as the values for the
parameters so when we run this we expect
30 to be printed now let's move the call
to add numbers function to the top of
the page so here we have the function
call present before the function
definition so is this still going to
work the same way let's look at that
notice that it still works as expected
so how is it working we have the
function definition after the function
call so the function call is present
before the function definition so how is
it working it's working because in
JavaScript there's a concept called
function hoisting what is meant by
function hoisting at runtime by default
JavaScript moves
all the function declarations to the top
of the current scope that means at
runtime this piece of code will be have
the function defined this will be
automatically moved to the top of the
page so by the time this line is
executed it already knows about this add
numbers function so it works as expected
so that's called function hoisting and
because of function hoisting JavaScript
functions can be called before they are
defined so in both of these two examples
we are defining a function using the
standard function declarations and tags
another way to define a function in
JavaScript is by using a function
expression a function expression allows
us to define a function using an
expression typically by assigning a
function to a variable there are three
different ways of defining a function
using a function expression here we have
an example for anonymous function
expression so let's look at this in
action so here we have this add numbers
function so this is called as name the
function that's because this function
has got a name that is add numbers I'm
going to remove the name so this is
anonymous function what is anonymous
function anonymous function is function
that does not have any name and I'm
going to assign this anonymous function
through a variable let's assign this
function to this variable add so this
line is an expression and this function
is an anonymous function so this all
together is called as anonymous function
expression and to call this function we
have to use this variable add so here
I'm going to type add and notice that
the moment I open parenthesis the
intelligence shows the parameters that
this method expects first number second
number let's pass 10 and 20 run this and
we expect 30 to be printed there we go
functions defined using a function
expression are not hoisted what does
that means that means if we move the
call to this function to the top of the
page is this going to work so here we
are creating a function using a function
expression and we are calling this
function before it is defined so here we
have the call to this function and we
are defining the function here okay
so let's throw in a breakpoint here and
run this in debug mode and notice that
when I have the mouse over I it says ad
is undefined so functions defined using
a function expression or not hoisted
that means function defined using a
function expression can only be called
after it has been defined but remember a
function that is defined using a
standard function declaration can be
called both before and after it is
defined here we have an example for
named function expression so let's look
at this in action so let's create a
function to compute the factorial of a
number so function and let's name this
method compute factorial and to this
let's pass a parameter number if the
provided number is less than or equal to
one so factorial of any number that is
less than or equal to one is one so we
are simply going to return one if the
number is greater than one that's when
we need to compute the factorial so in
that case we are going to return number
x calling the same method that is
compute factorial method and then
subtracting one every time from the
number so this is a very simple program
to compute the factorial of a given
number now notice this function it's
just like any other function that we
create using the standard function
declarations and tax and this is a named
function because this function has
the name now I'm going to assign this
function play variable so let's create a
variable called factorial so this line
is an expression because we are
assigning a function to a variable and
this function is a named function so on
together
this is a named function expression okay
now look at this this function has got a
name that is compute factorial now to
invoke this function can't I just use
that name compute factorial let's look
at that in action so let's call compute
factorial and let's say we want to
compute the factorial for number five
and whatever result it returns let's
store it in a variable let's name it
result and then let's write the value of
that variable to the document object and
let's throw in a breakpoint here run
this and see what's going to happen
notice that it says compute factorial is
undefined so what does this means so
here we are defining a function using
named function expression and this name
that is compute factorial this name will
be available only inside this function
look at this we're calling compute
factorial inside the method with the
same name but to refer to this function
outside of that function you cannot use
that name if you want to call this
function outside of this function you
have to use this variable factorial
let's use that name factorial and let's
run this factorial of 5 is 120 so it
should print 120 there we go so here we
are creating a function using named
function expression the name of the
function that is compute factorial is
available only within the same function
if we try to use that name outside of
this function we get that undefined
error and this syntax is useful for
creating recursive function so what is a
recursive function that recursive
function is function that
itself notice that here compute
factorial is calling itself so we are
using this named function expression
syntax basically to create this
recursive function so here we have an
example for self invoking function
expression so let's look at this in
action so here what I'm going to do is
wrap this entire code you know from here
to here in a bracket and then inside
that parenthesis what I'm going to do is
look at this is the moment I open after
this closing curly brace
the moment I open parenthesis look at
that it says compute factorial the
intelligence shows that it expects
number parameter so let's say we want to
compute factorial for 5 and then I'm
closing the bracket so we are passing a
value for this number parameter okay so
what's going to happen is when we run
this this piece of code will be executed
okay and whatever result this code
returns that will be stored in this
variable so let's actually rename the
variable to result and then let's write
the value that is present in that
variable to the document object so when
you run this this code will be
automatically invoked and the rip result
will be stored in this variable and we
are writing its value to the document so
when we run this we should get a value
of 120 printed there we go so this is an
example for self invoking function
expression and the self invoking
function expressions have got different
names so they are called immediately
invoked function expression because they
are executed immediately when we run it
we don't have to call it explicitly it's
also called as self executing anonymous
function or self invoked anonymous
function thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
