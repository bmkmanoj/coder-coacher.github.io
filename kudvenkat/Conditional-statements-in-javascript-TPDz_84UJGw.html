in this video well discuss different
conditional statements that are
available in JavaScript JavaScript code
is executed in a linear fashion that is
from the first line to the last line if
for some reason you want to interrupt
that flow and execute certain statements
only if certain condition is met then we
use conditional statements javascript
has got these conditional statements if
if-else if-elsif-else switch and ternary
operators ternary operator is actually a
shortcut for if-else statement let's
look at a few examples now let's flip to
visual studio so what we want to do is
from the user to enter a number so we
are going to make use of this prompt
function so what is this function going
to do it's going to display a script
prompt dialog box to the end user into
which he can enter the number so this
function has got two parameters the
first parameter is the message that we
want to display to the end user so we
want to display to the user this message
please enter a number and the second
parameter is the default string just in
case if the end user did not enter any
number into the textbox then what do you
want as the default back we want a
default string which is an empty string
now whatever number the end user has
entered into the prompt dialog box that
will be returned by this prompt function
in text format so let's convert that to
a number and for that we are going to
make use of number function so whatever
this prompt function is going to return
we are passing that to this number
function and this function is going to
convert that into a number format and
let's store that in a variable and let's
call that user input now let's use the
if statement here if user input is equal
to one so if that condition is true then
we want to display to the end user you
are
number is one now let's make three
copies of this condition if user input
is equal to two then we want to print
this message your number is two if user
input is three then we want to print
this message your number is three now if
user input is not equal to 1 and user
input is not equal to 2 and user input
is not equal to 3 so if it's not equal
to 1 2 and 3 then we want to print a
message saying your number is not
between 1 and 3 all right so let's go
ahead and run this program and see if it
works the way we expect it to work
now let's go ahead and enter number 3
click OK
so it should display the message your
number is 3 now let's reload this
waveform and enter number 7 and we
should get the message your number is
not between 1 &amp;amp; 3 so what is this
program doing we ask the user to enter a
number we read that and this prompt
function is going to return that as text
and this number function is going to
convert that to a number and we are
storing that in this variable if the
user number is 1 then this condition is
true so it will print this message and
then there's the program terminator
after that now it's going to check this
condition as well is user input is equal
to 2 now that will be false so it will
not execute start statement and then it
will come and check this condition again
so that condition will not be through
true and finally it will come and check
these conditions and they are not true
either and then the program terminates
but if you look at these conditions
these conditions are mutually exclusive
meaning if these condition is true then
it is impossible for this condition or
this condition or these conditions to be
true at the same time right so these are
mutually exclusive meaning
if the number is one it cannot be two it
cannot be three and this condition
cannot be true okay so there is no
reason to check these conditions if this
condition is already true and that's
when we use if-else if-else okay if user
input is equal to one do this else if
user input is equal to two do this else
if user input is equal to three then do
this else do this now it will come to
the else part
only if any of these conditions are not
true so if the user input is not one or
two or three then it is definitely not a
number between one and three so it is
going to come to this else part so there
is no reason again to check these
conditions here so we can get rid of
those conditions
so now what is going to happen if the
user enters number one it comes here it
checks okay is one is equal to one that
is true it prints this message and the
program will terminate it will not check
again all these three conditions so from
a performance standpoint this version of
the program is much better than the
previous one so anytime you have
mutually exclusive conditions make sure
you use if else if statements rather
than multiple if statements in our next
video we'll discuss switch and ternary
operators thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
