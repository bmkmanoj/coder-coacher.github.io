tutorial series on Java in this tutorial
we are going to learn about while and
do-while loop constructs in our previous
tutorial we have learnt:about for loop
construct I hope you have understood
that construct properly and done some
assignments on that in this tutorial we
will also continue to talk about break
and continue jump constructs let us
understand what is why loop while loop
is another construct in Java that allows
you to repeat a block of code depending
upon the evaluation of a condition so
when the condition is true the block of
code gets executed the why loop in Java
is entry control group by entry control
loop I mean that the condition is
evaluated first if the condition is true
then only the execution of statements
happens if the condition is false the
statement never get executed this means
that the loop gets executed 0 or more
times the loop keeps executing till the
condition becomes false also it is the
responsibility of a developer to not to
forget to ensure the termination of loop
let's see this knowledge in action
assume that I need to print a line made
up of Asterix symbols and I want to
implement this using the void while loop
so what I can do is I can create a new
method public static void main void
print line and then here what I can do
is I can have an integer number of ash
tricks let's I 150 Astrix on each each
line and then I will use a while loop
first time here I say that execute this
while loop
till this variable is greater than equal
to zero and in every iteration I will
ensure that this variable is declared
and then I would also like to print this
variable asterisk on the same line and
when all the 50 symbols are printed then
I would like to finally print a new line
so now let's call this print line so
when I execute this I expect a straight
line of 50 astrick symbols so this was a
very simple example of why loop where we
used while construct to print a strict
sign for 50 times and in every iteration
we have used a variable number of
Asterix whose variable value has
decremented in each iteration there is
another loop looping construct which is
do-while loop
it is little different from while loop
let's understand why loop again in while
loop the entry point is the condition
gets evaluated if it is true then only
the statements get evaluated or executed
if the condition was false then it
directly exits from the loop in do I
loop we have a set of statements
followed by a do keyword and then we
have a while condition followed by a
semicolon this is essentially a exit
controlled loop statements gets executed
first here and then the condition gets
evaluated first time if the condition is
false initially the groups will get
executed at least once if the condition
is false initially the loop will get
executed exactly once but I think it's
the point is that
do statement do a statement gets
executed one or more times so this is an
exit controlled loop let's see this in
action so what we would like to do is we
will use the knowledge of our previous
tutorials and we will use users input
here so I can say that let me create a
scanner using system dot in stream and
then let me write a do loop so the do
loop what it would do is it will take a
input from the user this input is
consumed using scanner dot next int if
this input is let's say less than equal
to zero then we will try to say that
it looks like user is not interested
seems you were not interested so let's
also ask user to enter some value enter
a number and we'll ask him that you can
you know press -1 to exit so what we are
asking in is you enter a number you
enter -1 to exit if your number is less
than equal to 0 I will print seems you
are not interested if the number is e1
so to check whether the number is even
what I can do is I can use the modulo
operator I can say that if input % is 2
is 0 then you entered an even number so
we can say that if this was not the case
we can say you entered and odd number
and then the condition is exit
controlled and you say that while input
is not equal to -1 keep on continuing
this loop now since variable input is
define inside do block therefore it is
not available we can define it outside
and now it should be available let's
execute this and see
so this is our output control window if
I type a number letter seven he says
that you entered an odd number if I
enter safe
he says you entered an even number if I
entered minus one
he says that seems you are not
interested and then it just exists exit
the program so this was our do-while
loop there are times when you need to
you know exit out of a construct which
may be a for loop or dua loop or a while
loop in that scenario you use the break
construct break helps you to get out of
the loop it can it puts the control
immediately to the next statement after
the loop and then breaks out immediately
out of that current mode of iteration
also note that just like for loop while
loop do-while loops can also be nested
but a break statement only lets you exit
to the innermost loop let's see this in
action so I can I can create a new class
the class name is a break demo and in
this class I create a main function and
let me have a less talk number and let's
let's say I have numbers 1 2 3 5 8 13 21
etcetera now I can I can use a for loop
here to say I want to search a number
number two be first next I want to
search number 13 then I can say that
into I is equal to 0 R is less than
number start length and I plus plus and
then I can say that if numbers I is
equal to number to be searched then in
that scenario found it should be printed
and we would just like to break from the
loop note that here we have shown you an
example you think for do the similar
construct using while loop would be lets
say I want to have an infinite loop
something like Y is true here and let's
say the assumption is that whatever
number of you're searching is always
existing then in that scenario what you
could do is you can have a condition
here which is true at least once and
then in this you can have your break
this will ensure that your while loop
exits on a condition which becomes true
sometime in this scenario where we were
having a list of numbers and we want
white rate of fixed number of times
therefore we have to use a for loop and
it makes more sense but this break as a
construct can be used as any loop of our
loop or a while loop or a do-while loop
you also saw this break
the key word being used in switch cases
now let's try to execute this program
here it says that it has found it let's
say this 13 number didn't exist so the
program will terminate without printing
anything so a break statement
essentially helps you to exit from the
loop and move the control out of the
loop to the statement just following the
- similarly there is another construct
called continue continue allows you to
stop the current iteration well where it
is it stops the current iteration and
then it doesn't stop execution of the
loop it moves to the next iteration it
helps in ignoring certain iteration
let's take an example again what we can
do is we want to find number of number
of specific characters let's say if I
have a string of strength I can say this
is a long long strings now it is in the
strength I can use I can I can write a
code saying that for int I is equal to 0
is less than string dot length and I
plus plus and I can say that if string
dot I can second check the current
character I can say that if a single
carrot I is equal to oak then then I
need to count the number of o's I can
say int number of o's is initially zero
and then whenever I find number of all I
just increment it and then I just
continue from here and then finally I
print number of course is now let's see
the number of o's in this thing the
number of OSS - so it is able to count
they rate there will be more statement
here which would have been executed when
the current character was not o let's
let's imagine that we want to you know
say this is not o so in this scenario
you will see that when we execute this
program you will observe that this is
not all gets printed for everything
except the actual O's so in order to
check this whether it is getting
executed or not
let's also print here's something like
that tells you that if there is some O
which was found so
so we can say that when we execute it
two times
Oh was found and whenever this Oh was
found at that point this is not Oh was
not printed right so the basic idea of
using the continue statement is as soon
as continuous found the current
titration just get stopped there and the
next iteration is continued this
continued jump statement will help you
to ignore certain iteration and then
continue with the next iteration of the
loop this is very very useful so in this
tutorial we learnt about while and
do-while statement we also saw how to
use the break and continue statements
