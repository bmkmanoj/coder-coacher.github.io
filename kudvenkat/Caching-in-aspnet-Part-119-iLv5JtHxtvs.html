am venket this is part 1 1 9 of asp.net
video series in this video we'll discuss
about cashing in asp.net cash improves
the performance and scalability of an
application caching is the technique of
storing frequently used data or pages in
memory let's understand caching
practically with an example let's flip
to sequel server management studio we
will be using this TBL products table in
this demo so let's go ahead and create
this table and this table has got three
columns ID name and description of the
product and let's go and insert some
sample data into this table using this
insert script and finally let's go ahead
and create the stored procedure which
simply returns ID name and description
columns from TBL products table ok and
now since this is a very simple table
with 4 columns within that I mean with 4
rows within that when we execute the
stored procedure the stored procedure
will be executed in less than a second
look at the time it took less than a
second now in real time we may have
tables with huge amounts of data and we
may be joining multiple tables so the
queries before they actually return data
they might take some time so obviously
to introduce some artificial query
processing times I'm going to use wait
for delay in sequel server so there's
something called wait for delay so we
are intentionally blocking the execution
of this stored procedure for you know
certain duration
I want to block it for 0 overs 0 minutes
and 5 seconds okay so basically hours
minutes and seconds so we are blocking
the execution of this stored procedure
for 5 seconds so let me go in and alter
the stored procedure ok so now if we
execute the stored procedure as you
might expect it's going to take at least
5 seconds look at this it's still
executing query 3 seconds 4 seconds
until it's 5 seconds we won't get the
data back ok so now let's go ahead and
invoke the stored procedure from an
asp.net web application
so let's flip to visual studio on this
web form let's go ahead and drag and
drop a grid view control which can
display the data from TBL products table
okay and then let's go ahead and auto
format this so that it looks a little
better and then along with the data I
also want to print the server-side time
and client-side time okay and to print
the server-side time I'm going to have a
label control here so let's drag and
drop a label control onto this waveform
and let's get rid of that default text
label okay alright so what we basically
want to do is in this grid view control
we want to invoke that Stewart procedure
and display the data from TBL products
table and just to speed things up I have
this ad or dotnet code already typed
again in this video we're discussing
about caching we discussed about a do
net in a do dotnet video tutorial and
sequel server concepts like creating
tables executing stored procedures etc
in sequence of a video tutorial if
you're new to sequel server and you know
ad or dotnet I strongly recommend to
watch videos you know in sequence of a
video tutorial ad or dotnet tutorial
that can be found at the link that you
can see here on the slide ok so now
let's go and copy this ad or dotnet code
which is simply is going to execute this
SP get products stored procedure that we
have just written ok so if you look at
this area dot not code it's pretty
simple and straightforward all we are
doing is reading the connection string
from web config file so within web
config file we are reading this DB
connection string you know connection
string and then storing it that in this
variable connection string which we are
then using to create a signal connection
object and we are using sequel data
adapter object to execute this SP get
product stored procedure which we have
just returned and we are telling the
command type a stored procedure and
creating a new data set
filling that data set with the data I
know that we get after executing this SP
get product stored procedure and then we
are setting the data set as the data
source for the gridview
invoke the data bind method and finally
I also want to set the text of this
label one control so if you look at this
on on on this waveform we have this
label one control you know on which I
want to print the current date and time
on the web server and to do that I'm
setting text property of this label to
date/time dot now which is going to give
me the current date and time on the web
server and then convert that to string
okay so we have the date and time from
the web server but on the client machine
how do we retrieve the date and time on
the client machine now we know that HTML
and JavaScript they get executed or
interpreted on the client machine on the
client browser okay so obviously to
retrieve the current date and time on
the client machine I can use the
JavaScript code ok so here within the
aspx of this waveform I'm going to spit
you know JavaScript code here next to
client time now look at this on the
server side if you want to write
something to the response stream how do
we do that we use the response dot write
method
similarly if you want to write something
using JavaScript then I can use the
document object of JavaScript in all of
the browser so I'm going to use the
document object and then this document
object so before that we actually have
to specify that we are going to write
some script here so I have to use the
script tag so whatever we write within
this closing an opening tag is going to
be JavaScript so I'm going to use the
document object and the write method of
document object to basically write the
current date and time so the next
question is how do we retrieve the
current date and time on the client
machine using the date function the date
JavaScript function that's it we are
done okay now if you are wondering what
is this client time and server-side time
it's actually very simple to understand
now look at this let's say I am at the
moment in London and I am accessing
Gmail Gmail let's say the web server of
Gmail is in North America okay so when I
request the login page of Gmail you know
the code associated with that login page
is executed the server-side see shop
code that's executed you know on the web
server that's in North America so there
might be a different time at the moment
and then that you know whatever HTML is
generated on that web server that's then
sent back to the client who is sitting
in London ok so on my client machine on
my laptop
you know this HTML and JavaScript gets
interpreted and executed and then I want
the time to be you know printed whatever
time is on my current machine that's the
client time and whatever the time on the
web server is the server-side time so
obviously this date time dot now will
will calculate the date and time on the
web server whereas this date function
you know the JavaScript code which
executes on the client machine is going
to retrieve the current in date current
date and time on the client machine ok
so now let's go ahead and run this so
obviously as you might expect
you know this page is going to take at
least five seconds to render why because
the stored procedure is taking at least
five seconds and look at this when I
request this waveform you know there are
lots of things that are happening on the
web server first an instance of this
waveform should be created then it has
to execute the you know the process the
page events you know here we only have
page load event but in a reality you may
have button click event drop-down list
selected in the exchange the event
several events so all the page level
events have to be processed
you know the seidio dotnet piece piece
of code should be executed which in turn
has to execute the stored procedure
retrieve data from the database you know
create other objects that are required
generate the HTML and then send that
HTML back to the client so every time we
make a request to the web server you
know there are a series of events that
has to happen
and obviously some of those could be
time-consuming in this case you know
executing the stored procedure is a
time-consuming process you know it's
taking at least five seconds so my
request processing now is at least
taking five seconds and look at the
current date and time on the server and
on the client on the server it's 1954
and on the client also it is nine ten
fifty four okay now again if I make
another request for this platform let me
open another tab and I make another
request now it's going to take at least
another five seconds because it has to
process all those events again okay look
at that now it and all the time is 1309
twelve six I mean nine twelve sixteen
and similarly nine twelve sixteen here
okay now let's see you know how to cache
this waveform and what happens when we
cache it okay so to catch the waveform
all we have to do is use the output
cache page directive okay so I'm going
to use the output cache director okay
and this output cache director has got
two mandatory attributes duration this
duration attribute controls how long
this platform is going to be cached okay
for now I'm going to set the duration to
thirty meaning this waveform is going to
be cached for 30 seconds and then there
is another mandatory attribute called
vary by param okay for now I'm going to
set the value for this parameter to none
okay so when do we use very very param
and watch the purpose of that vary by
pattern is basically used to cache
multiple responses of this waveform now
if you're not sure why do we need to
cache multiple responses we will
understand that in our next video
session okay for now and just understand
that vary by pattern is used to cache
multiple responses in our next video
session we'll discuss about how and when
to cache multiple responses for a given
wave form the duration attribute
obviously controls you know the number
of seconds that this waveform has to be
cached in this case since we have said
this value 230 it's going to be cached
for 30 seconds
now let's go ahead and request this
waveform now we don't have this waveform
won in cash so obviously now if I you
know request this waveform when I press
ENTER the webform has to be processed
all the events have to be processed the
HTML is generated and obviously it's
going to take at least five seconds okay
and then when that HTML is sent back a
copy of that HTML is also stored in the
memory in the web server memory so now
look at this since we have cached this
for 30 seconds if I request this
waveform now look at this as soon as I
press enter the response comes back
within less than a second that's because
the response for this waveform one dot
aspx now is cached on the web server
so when I make a request for that
waveform one dot aspx what's going to
happen it's not going to execute all
this piece of code again okay it's
simply going to return you know whatever
HTML that is cached in the web server
memory okay
so we get the same HTML back and how can
we prove that we got a cached response
back very simple look at this let me
close the first window there okay so
this is the first time when we made the
request look at the current date and
time the server time is 9 14 10 seconds
and the client time is also 9:40 I mean
client time is 9 14 11 seconds but then
the second request that we made is look
at the silverside time it is still 9 14
10 but whereas the client site time is 9
14 26 okay meaning the server side time
didn't change
okay that's because whatever was the
time when we first requested this page
it's the same time 9 14 10 okay that's
because a response for this waveform was
cached so the waveform the second
request when we made a second request
for web form 1 dot aspx we got the
response that is cached and this piece
of code didn't get executed again so it
didn't recompute the server-side time
but whereas the client-side time gets
updated every time why because when the
HTML that is sent back to the client the
HTML and JavaScript the
our script will get executed on the
client so every time the client time
changes but within those 30 seconds the
service time doesn't change but now
since that 30 seconds would have been
allowed you know this webform would have
been removed from the cache so now if I
copy this and then make another request
it's going to take at least you know
five seconds to process this waveform
okay because the initial response from
the cache is remote so now if I open the
webform
I know if I make another request and
then let me make another request and
let's make another request so I'm doing
all these requests within 30 seconds let
me paste that okay so look at that look
at the suicide time so this is the first
request we made 916 30 seconds that's
the server-side time and the client-side
time is also same 9/16 30 but the next
request I made at 916 37 but look at the
silver side time nine sixty and thirty
okay nine sixteen thirty in the other
requests but keep looking at the client
time it keeps changing every time and
this is at forty seven now if it is nine
seventeen at the moment then if I make a
request
you know this response for webform one
would have been removed from the cache
because why the duration would have
expired thirty seconds is the time we
want to cache this but after that any
time you know if somebody makes a
request then the waveform is going to be
reprocessed so now it would have
definitely been nine over nine sixteen
so if I make a request for the waveform
it will be reprocessed once again
because the cached response is removed
after thirty seconds so now I get a new
server date and time nine seventeen
fifty but if I make another request
within the next 30 seconds I'm going to
get the cached response look at that
nine seventeen fifty but look at the
client time nine eighteen and the first
time it was nine seventeen fifty okay so
hopefully that makes it clear that you
know this waveform is cached for 30
seconds
so how did we catch the waveform we used
the output cache attribute with the
duration attribute do this duration is
equal to 30 meaning this waveform is
going to be cached for the next 30
seconds so when any user requests this
platform for the first time the web
server will process the web forum events
execute the stored procedure retrieve
data from the database create objects
generate HTML and send that HTML to the
client browser and retains a copy of
that response in the memory for the next
30 seconds and any subsequent requests
during that 30 seconds receives the
cached response okay
after the cache duration has expired
after that 30 seconds has expired the
next request for the waveform has to be
processed and and you know all that
events has to be processed again and
then generate a new response which is
then cached for another 30 seconds so
this waveform is processed by the server
once every 30 seconds at the most okay
so in this video we discussed about how
to cache a waveform using the output
cache directive and we have seen the
usage of duration attribute in our next
video we'll discuss about caching
multiple responses for a given wave form
and we will see how to use this very by
param on this slide you can find

server interview questions that's it for
today
