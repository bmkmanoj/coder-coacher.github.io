this video we'll discuss how to add even
handlers to dynamically created elements
let's understand this with an example
let's design a page that looks like this
I already have the required HTML notice
that here we have a button with ID bTW
and ad and the value for that is add a
new list item and then we have an
unordered list with two list items if we
view this page in the browser this is
how it looks like now what should happen
is when we click this add a new list
item button we want to add a new list
item to the unordered list that we have
here so let's see how to do that so
first we should find this button with
that ID BTN add so within our jQuery
ready function find the button by ID and
on click of the button we want to
execute a function so this is a function
that we want to execute when the click
event occurs so what do we want to do
when the click event occurs we want to
add a new list item so let's create a
variable let's name this new list item
equals let's create a new list item so
li new list item and let's close the
list item and what do we want to do we
want to add that new list item to this
unordered list so let's find that
unordered list using the jQuery element
selector and let's use the up in method
and pass the new list item to this
append method
alright so let's save the changes reload
the page and when we click this add new
list item button in a look at that new
list item gets ordered added to that
unordered list now what we want to do is
when we click on any of these list items
we want that list item to slowly fade
out okay so let's see how to achieve
that so when a click event occurs on the
list item that's when we want to do so
what we can do is we can say okay give
me all
list items and we want to bind a click
event to all of the list items so click
and when that event occurs we want to
call this function and what we want to
do is you know we want that list item to
slowly fade out and let's specify the
speed as 500 milliseconds so the fade
out is going to happen in half a second
so let's save the changes let's reload
this page and look at this let's add a
couple of new list items and when I
click on the existing list item this
list item was already there look at that
when I click on that that slowly fades
away but look at the list items that we
dynamically added when I click on this
list item that is dynamically added that
does not fade out why is that
that's because look at this this piece
of code will be executed when the page
loads right when the document is ready
so you know at that point when the
document was loaded whatever the list
items that were there on the page to all
those list items we have bound a click
event handler function but not to the
list item that we are dynamically adding
at runtime right so that's the reason
why this new list item does not fade out
many when we click on that okay so for
them to fade out what we can do is we
can wrap this using the jQuery wrapper
and then associate you know a click
event handler for that so click we want
to call a function and what do we want
this function to do the same thing you
know slowly fade out
all right so let's go ahead save the
changes reload this page and look at
this when we click on the new list item
even that fades out now and the existing
list items also fades out okay so the
example is working as expected we are
able to add you know click event handler
to dynamically added list items as well
but what is the problem with this
approach the problem with this approach
is that we are binding a click event
handler to every list item that means if
you have 500 list items within this
unordered list then imagine what's going
to happen you will have 500 click event
handlers in memory which may negatively
affect the performance of your
application so this is not the best
thing to do because you know if you have
thousand list items there will be
thousand click event handlers in memory
ok so there's a better way of doing this
so what we can do is we can actually
bind the click event handler to the
unordered list
what is the unordered list that's the
parent for all the list items ok so when
the click event occurs on the unordered
list call this function that's what we
are saying ok but then what I'm going to
do here is use you know this select a
parameter so first we specify the event
and then the second parameter is the
selector for select a parameter I'm
going to specify a lie so what does that
mean here when the click event occurs on
any of the list item the list item
itself does not have a click event
handler okay so what happens if a
element in the hierarchy does not have
an event handler the even gets bubbled
up so when the event of the list item is
bubbled up that will be handled by its
parent in this case the unordered list
the unordered list has got a click event
handler ok so that is going to handle
the list items click event and this
keyword here refers to the element that
actually triggered the event in this
case the list
so the list item is going to slowly fade
out okay so this is much better now
since we are attaching the click event
handler you know to the unordered list
that is to the parent there will be only
one copy of that even handler function
in memory irrespective of how many ever
list items you have even if you have
five thousand list items there's going
to be only one copy of this even handler
function in the memory okay so this is
much better from a performance
standpoint this also means we can
simplify this code also okay now there
is no need to associate the click event
handler to the element that we are
dynamically adding we can simply add
this new list item so let's copy that
and we can get rid of all this code and
on click of the button all I want to do
is add this new list item to this
unordered list okay now we are not
adding a click event handler and that's
fine because you know the chain does not
need to have the click event handler
when you click on that new list item
that is added even that click event gets
bubbled up to its parent in this case
the unordered list and the unordered
list has got a click event handler so
it's going to handle that ok so let's
look at this in action so let's save the
changes let's add a couple of list items
look at this when I click on the
existing list item that fades out the
new list item that fades out as well ok
the most important thing to remember
here is this selector ok now whatever
selector you specify here the event of
that element gets bubbled up to the
parent that we are specifying here ok
now for example if I specify the
selector as li : even then only the
click event of the list items that are
present in even index position will be
bubbled up and handled by the parent so
let's look at this in action let's save
the changes let's reload this page and
let's add a couple of list items now
look at this this first list items is
present
in index position zero so that's even
and the second one is index position one
that's odd look at this when I click on
the first list item it fades out but not
the one that is present in odd position
the next one should fade out look at
that but the one after that doesn't fade
out no matter how many times you play
but the one after that should fade out
okay so this selector is the most
important thing and here is that example
that we just discussed thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
