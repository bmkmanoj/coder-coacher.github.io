in this video well discuss two while
loop in JavaScript
this is continuation to part 16 in part
16 we discussed while loop in JavaScript
let's understand do-while loop with an
example let's flip to visual studio this
is the same example that we worked with
in the previous video session this
program prompts us to enter a target
number and for example if we provide 10
as the target number it's going to print
even numbers from 0 till 10 and then the
program terminates now what we want to
do is put this entire program in a loop
and then after it prints the first set
of even numbers we don't want this
program to terminate immediately we want
this program to prompt with another
question do you want to continue yes or
no and then if the end user provides SS
the answer for that question then it
should again prompt us to enter the
target number and for example let's say
we enter 20 as the target number then
this program should print even numbers
from 0 till 20 and then it should prompt
us again with that question do you want
to continue yes or no and then if we say
yes again it should prompt us to enter
the target number so it should be in
that loop as long as we say no to that
question that is do you want to continue
yes or no the moment we say no that's
when the program should terminate so
let's see how to achieve that using it
too while loop so after it prints the
first set of even numbers then we want
to ask the user a question do you want
to continue yes or no for that we are
going to use the prompt function so do
you want to continue yes or no
and then the user is going to provide an
answer for this question so let's create
a variable to store that answer and
let's actually name it use a choice and
initialize that to an empty string and
we'll store the response from the user
in this variable user choice now when we
ask this question to the user do you
want to continuous or no the user can
type anything they want instead of yes
or no if they do that then we want to
alert the message saying in value choice
please say yes or no okay if they type
anything else apart from yes or no then
we won't allow that message so if user
choice is not equal to yes and user
choice is not equal to no then we know
that they have typed something else
apart from these two choices yes or no
in which case we want to alert the
message saying invalid choice please say
yes or no okay so we want to repeat
these statements until they provide a
valid response that is yes or no if they
type any other response then we want to
keep asking do you want to continue yes
sir now okay so we want to do all this
while user choice is not equal to yes
and user choice is not equal to now
let's quickly test this so first it
should prompt us to enter the target
number we enter 10 as the target click
OK so it's going to print even numbers
from 0 till 10 notice that it prompts us
do you want to continue yes or no and
then if we type test for example and
click OK
notice that it says invalid choice
please say yes or no once I click OK on
that then it is going to again prompt us
do you want to continuous or no now if
we type yes click OK at the moment you
know the program terminates because you
know after we provide a valid choice the
program terminus there is nothing else
to do okay now what we want to do is if
the user says yes then we want to prompt
the user you know with this question
again please enter your target number ok
so we want to keep doing all this as
long as the user says yes to this
question do you want to continue ok so
I'm going to use another do-while loop
so do all this while user choice is
equal to yes
let's see if this works the way we
expect it to work so please enter your
target number okay and then we enter 10
click ok prints the UN numbers from 0 to
10 do you want to continue yes or no now
if we type some garbage like this test
click ok it says invalid choice please
say yes or no and now if we say yes
click OK look at that please enter your
target number and now if we enter 20 and
click OK it prints the even numbers from
0 till 20 and then it is asking us do
you want to continuous or no if we type
no click OK the program terminates and
we achieved all this using do-while loop
now the reason why we are using 2 while
loop here is because we want you know to
print the even numbers at least once so
first you know we ask the user to enter
the target number we print the first set
of human numbers and then we ask the
question do you want to continue a sir
now ok so we want this stuff to be done
at least once that's why we're using a
do-while loop and do-while loop is
guaranteed to execute at least once
because with do-while loop we are
checking the condition at the end ok
so all these statements will be executed
at least once and then it checks the
condition ok now there is a small
problem with this program now you know
it's asking us to enter the target
number and then it prompts us do you
want to continuous or no now let's say
for example I you know type all small
letters yes and click OK look at that it
says invalid choice please say yes or no
ok you know we have typed yes ok that's
a valid choice but the reason why it
says is invalid choices because the
comparison is case sensitive ok so the
comparison here is case sensitive and if
you don't want that compassion to be
case sensitive convert the response from
the user either to
or lowercase and then compare it with
the corresponding case so what we can do
is whatever response that we get to this
question that is yes or no let's convert
that to an uppercase using to uppercase
function so now yes or no will be you
know all capital letters and then we
compare that with capital yes and
capital no we need to do that even here
and here
so let's run this now please enter your
target number let's enter 10 click ok so
it prints even numbers from 0 till 10 do
you want to continue now I type small
letter y capital e small yes click OK
now look at that
it doesn't say invalid choice it's
asking us please enter your target
number and the 20 click OK 0 till 20 now
do you want to continuous or no I type
small letter n capital letter O and
click OK it should still work it should
still terminate the program so with
while loop we check the condition first
and if the condition is true statements
within the loop are executed and that
process is repeated as long as the
condition evaluates to true with a
do-while loop you know it checks the
condition at the end of the loop we had
just seen that this means the do-while
loop is guaranteed to execute at least
one time in general do-while loops are
used to present a menu to the user
what's the difference between a while
loop and do-while loop in JavaScript
while loop checks the condition at the
beginning whereas the do-while loop
checks the condition at the end of the
loop
this means do-while loop is guaranteed
to execute at least once whereas while
loop is not and this is the example that
we just looked at thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
