this video we'll discuss the three form
layouts provided by bootstrap here we
have a login form at the moment we
haven't applied any of the bootstrap
styles to this form here is the HTML
required for this form notice we have
got two developments within each
development we have got a label and a
textbox control this textbox is for the
user name and this textbox is for the
password we also have the submit button
at the moment this form is not looking
very pretty let's see how to make this
pretty using bootstrap bootstrap
provides three form layouts vertical
form layout is the default one it also
provides inline form layout and
horizontal form layout first let's
discuss the vertical form layout here is
what we want to do we want to create a
vertical form that looks like this in
the vertical form the labels and their
associated form controls are stacked on
top of each other
notice on this form we have the label
user name stacked on top of user name
textbox
similarly the label password is stacked
on top of password text box we also have
the login button there are two simple
changes that we have to do to this HTML
to create a vertical form layout the
first change is on these two
developments that wrap the label control
and their associated input control on
these developments I am going to use
form group class let's do the same thing
for the other development that we have
here the second change is on the form
controls themselves so on these input
elements I am going to use form control
class let's do the same thing for the
password input element let's save our
changes and when we reload the page we
get the vertical form notice the labels
are stacked on top of their associated
form controls at the moment this button
is not looking very pretty it's using
the browser defaults let's apply
bootstrap button classes so on this
button I'm going to apply BTN and BTN
default class
now we should have the button Styles
applied as well at the moment we are not
displaying these placeholders notice
within the username text box we have
login username as the placeholder
similarly the password text box has
login password as the placeholder to get
those placeholders I'm going to use the
placeholder attribute so the placeholder
for login username text box is going to
be login username
let's do the same thing for the password
text box so for this is going to be
login password let's save our changes
and when we reload the page we get the
placeholders as well at the moment these
form controls are spanning across the
entire width of the parent element there
are several ways to limit the width of
these form controls one way is to use
the predefined bootstrap grid classes so
at the moment we are using call X is 12
class so all these form controls are
going to span across the entire 12
available logical units let's restrict
the width to three logical units within
the 12 available logical units by using
call ld3 class now when we reload this
page notice the width of these form
controls are restricted as expected next
let's discuss creating an inline form
layout in an inline form layout the form
controls are placed side by side next to
each other as you can see here to create
an inline form layout there's one simple
change that we have to do to this HTML
and that is using form inline class on
this form element so when we save our
changes and when we reload this page we
should get an inline form but we are not
that's because for an inline form the
viewport should be at least 768 pixels
wide but here we are viewing this form
on a large screen device so obviously
the viewport should be definitely
greater than 768 pixels but why are we
not getting an inline form that's
because in this case we are restricting
the viewport of this form by using call
lg3 class instead if we use call
g12 the viewport is going to be
definitely greater than 768 pixels so
when we reload this page notice we get
an inline form where all the form
controls are placed side by side next to
each other but as I start to resize the
browser window look at what happens when
the width falls below 768 pixels look at
that the form reverts to its default
layout which is the vertical layout but
then the moment it crosses that 768
pixels barrier it reverts to the inline
form layout finally let's discuss
creating a horizontal form layout in a
horizontal form layout the label
controls are on the left and their
associated form controls are on the
right in a single line as you can see
here there are a few changes that we
have to do to this HTML to create a
horizontal form layout first I'm going
to delete this development and its
closing tag instead of using form in
line class let's use form horizontal
class and then on all these label
elements we're going to use a different
class and that is control label let's do
the same thing with this label as well
finally we are going to use the
bootstrap predefined grid classes to
layout these form controls we want this
label control to be two units wide in
the available 12 logical units so I am
going to use call sm 2 class let's do
the same thing with this label as well
since the label is 2 units wide we want
this textbox to be 10 units wide and to
achieve that I'm going to place the
textbox inside it development and on the
development we are going to use the
bootstrap grid class so let's use call
SM 10 so the label is 2 units wide
the textbox is 10 units wide let's do
the same thing with this text box as
well so let's use a development
and on this also we are going to use
call SM 10 class at this point let's
save our changes and when we reload this
page notice the labels and their
associated form controls are aligned
properly but this button is still on the
Left we want this to be just below the
password button so I'm going to wrap
this button inside a development and on
the development let's use the form Group
control just like how we have used form
group with the other elements that we
have and we are going to use another
development and move the button inside
this development and on this development
we are going to use the bootstrap grid
classes so we want this button to be ten
units wide but we want to push it two
units to the right so I'm going to use
call SM offset to so it's going to push
two columns to the right with those
changes when we reload this page notice
now we get a horizontal form layout now
we will see the horizontal form layout
you know on a large screen on a medium
screen on a small screen but as soon as
we fall into an extra small screen size
like a mobile device look at what's
happening
it's reverting to the default layout
which is the vertical form layout if you
want this horizontal form layout even on
an extra small screen size like a mobile
phone you know use call X s classes
instead of call SM classes so that's the
horizontal form layout thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
