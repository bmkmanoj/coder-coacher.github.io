this video we'll discuss how to write
jQuery case-insensitive attribute value
selector let's understand this with an
example we've got three developments
here and look at the title attribute
value for each of the developments is
the same thing div title the only thing
that is different is the casing of
letters so for the first div we've got a
mix of both uppercase and lowercase
letters for the second div all letters
are in uppercase and for the third live
all letters are in lowercase and look at
the jQuery code here so this is
basically telling find all the
developments which have got the title
attribute and the value of the title
attribute must be equal to div title so
for all such div elements we want to
include a three big cell solid red
border so when we execute this code look
at what we get we get a red border only
around the first development but not
around the second day of and third day
why is that that's basically because by
default the comparison is going to be
case sensitive so let's see how to make
this comparison case insensitive let's
flip to visual studio so this is the
same example that we have seen on the
slide and when we reload this page look
at that we get a solid red border just
around div one element so let's see how
to make this compassion case insensitive
to achieve that I'm going to first
remove this value from the title
attribute so what is this going to do
this is going to return us all
developments which have got the title
attribute it doesn't really care about
what value they have got as long as a
development has a title attribute it's
going to include that in the collection
that will be returned so from that
collection what do we want to do we want
to filter out all those elements which
it does not have title attribute value
equal to div title ignoring the case so
for that I'm going to use the filter
method and when this filter method is
called we want to execute some code so
I'm going to use an anonymous function
and inside this anonymous function we
want to return dollar this so what does
this a keyword refers to here this
refers to an item that is within this
collection so this collection is going
to contain all developments that have
title attribute and this keyword refers
to such an element and what we want to
do here is retrieve the title attribute
value so this attr function I'm going to
pass the name of the attribute okay so
this is going to return the title
attribute value and what we are going to
do with that value is we are going to
convert that to lowercase and then
compare it with lowercase div title so
let's copy this string and paste it here
so to convert a selected string in
Visual Studio to lowercase you can use a
keyboard shortcut and it is control you
now if you want to convert all the
letters to uppercase there is a keyboard
shortcut as well and that is ctrl shift
you all right so what is this going to
do this is going to give us only those
elements which have got a title
attribute and the value is div title
ignoring the case okay so let's save
these changes and when we reload this
page we should get a solid red border
around the three developments and for
example if we change this to one div
title and when we reload this we should
not have a border around every element
now let's look at another example let's
see how to make this attribute contains
a selector case-insensitive
what is attribute contains selector name
star equals value we discuss this in
detail in our previous video session so
let's understand this with an example
again we have the three developments and
all of them have got the title attribute
and if you look at the value all the
attribute values contain this substring
div and look at the code on the right
hand side so this is basically telling
find all the developments which have got
the title attribute and the value of the
title attribute must contain this
substring div and if you look at the
value of each of the development you
know they contain that substring there
but then the casing is different and as
a result of that look at what we get
only a red border around the first
development but not for div 2 and dip 3
so let's see how to make this attribute
contain select a case insensitive so
let's flip to visual studio so do title
star equals
dev and let's remove the filter function
so basically here verifying all
developments which have got the title
attribute and the title attribute must
contain this substring div so look at
this when we reload this page we only
get a red border on the first
development so let's see how to make
this attribute contains value selector
case-insensitive okay so I'm going to
remove this value and we're going to use
the filter method just like how we did
in the previous example so let's include
an anonymous function so within this
filter function we are going to use a
regular expression return so in
JavaScript or jQuery be included regular
expression in two forward slashes so
what is our regular expression going to
be this string tip now we want the
comparison to be case insensitive so I'm
going to use this flag I okay so this
eyes says another comparison has to be
case insensitive dot so on this regular
expression object I am going to call
this test method and then to this test
method we have to pass a string and the
string is going to be our attribute
value so dollar this dot attr and we
want to retrieve the title attribute
value so what is this doing so this is
basically telling you know retrieve the
title attribute value of the given
element within the collection and if
that title attribute value contains this
word div ignoring the case then we want
to return all such elements and for all
such elements we want a three pixel
solid red border so now here the
comparison is going to be case
insensitive so when we reload this look
at this we should get a border around
all the three developments okay because
all of them have caught that substring
okay now let's remove this tea from here
so this title attribute value now
doesn't contain div substring so when VD
load this page we should not have a red
border around that development now let's
look at another way of rewriting this
here way including our regular
expression into forward slashes we can
either do that or we have this regular
expression function constructor we can
use that as well okay so let's see how
to use that regular expression function
constructor okay so here I'm going to
use take a little expression object and
look at this this has got two parameters
the first parameter is the regular
expression itself which is div and then
the second parameter is the flags okay
we want the comparison to be case
insensitive so I'm going to specify that
flag I and this function constructor is
going to return us a regular expression
object and on that map object we are
calling this test method so when we
reload this the behavior should be
exactly the same thing and here our
dividuals to do keyboard shortcuts to
convert a selected text to uppercase or
lowercase thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
