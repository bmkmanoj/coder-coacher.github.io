this video we'll discuss how to control
the height and width of bootstrap form
controls here we have the list of
bootstrap classes that help us control
the height and width the form controls
to control the width of the form
controls use the bootstrap grid classes
to control the height of the form
controls use input LJ or input SM
classes to control the height of the
form controls and associated labels on a
horizontal form use form group LG or
form group SM classes let's look at a
few examples now let's flip to visual
studio here we have got a form with two
form groups within the first form group
we have a label and a text box and in
the second form group we have a label
and a select element if we view this
page in the browser this is how those
form controls look like notice the form
controls span the entire width of the
container now what we want to do is
limit the width of these form controls
we can achieve that simply by using the
bootstrap predefined grid classes let's
see how to do that I'm going to wrap
this form group inside a row so for that
let's create a development with class
set to row and let's move this closing
div element right here and then on this
form group I'm going to use call XS 3
grid class this is going to limit the
width of these two form controls to 3
columns in the 12 column bootstrap grid
system let's do the same thing with the
other form group that we have here so
let's wrap this inside a row and on this
form group let's use call XS 3 grid
class let's save our changes and when we
reload this page notice the form
controls are now three columns wide
within the 12 column bootstrap grid
system as expected the height of the
form controls that we see here
is the default height to control the
height of the form controls we may use
input LG or input SM classes at the
moment we are not using any of these two
classes so the height that we are
getting here is the default height to
set a larger height use input LG class
let's look at that in action so on the
input element right here along with the
form control plus I am also going to use
input LG class LG stands for large and
on the select element also here I'm
going to use the same class input LG
let's say our changes and when we reload
this page notice the height changes as
expected to set a smaller height use
input SM instead of input LG class let's
look at that in action so instead of
input LG I'm going to use input SM and
let's do the same thing here let's save
our changes and when we reload the page
notice the height changes as expected
finally let's discuss how to control the
height of the form controls and their
associated labels on a horizontal form
first let's convert this vertical form
to a horizontal form to convert this to
a horizontal form the first thing that
you need to do is use form horizontal
class on the form element we don't need
this row so I'm going to delete it
we don't need this call X s3 class on
this form Group Dave so I'm going to
delete that as well and then on this
label element I'm going to use control
label class and we want this label to be
one unit wide so let's use call XS one
class and then let's wrap this textbox
inside another development with class
set to call XS 3 so this is going to
make the textbox control three columns
wide in the 12 column bootstrap grid
system so label is one unit wide and
this textbox is three units wide let's
do the same thing with the other form
group that we have here so we don't need
the row I'm going to delete that first
and we don't have to use this call xs3
class right here and on the label we are
going to use control label class and
since we want this label also to be one
column wide let's use call XS one class
and then let's wrap this select element
inside a development with class set to
call X s3 that's going to make the
select element three columns wide let's
save our changes and when we reload this
page we should get a horizontal form as
expected now the height that we see here
is the default height to set a larger
height for the form controls and their
associated labels we use form group LG
class let's use that class on the form
group that we have here so along with
the form group class we're going to use
form group LG class let's do the same
thing on this form group as well let's
save all changes and when we reload this
page notice now the height of the form
controls and their associated labels
change as expected to set a smaller
height instead of using form group LG
use form group SM class let's save our
changes and when we reload the page the
height changes as expected thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
