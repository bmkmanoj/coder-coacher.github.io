this video we'll discuss how to create a
simple animated progress bar using
jQuery animate method here is what we
want to achieve when we select a
percentage from this drop-down list and
when we click this start animation
button notice that the progress bar
slowly fills till 90 percent and the
value is also displayed on the progress
bar now when we select 20 notice that
the progress bar slowly read each to 20
percent let's see how to create this
animated progress bar using jQuery
animate method so with no body section
we need that text select percentage and
then we need a drop-down list to select
the percentage for the end user so let's
include a select element let's give it
an ID let's call this TD L present H and
here we need options for values from 10
to 100 so option value 10 and we want to
display 10 similarly we need options for
values from 20 to 100 in the interest of
time I have already typed the required
HTML so let's copy and paste it here so
that should give us the drop-down list
next we need a button element so input
type equals button let's give it an ID
let's call this my button and the value
on the button is going to be start
animation and then we're going to have
two HTML break elements and then we are
going to have two developments notice
here we actually have two developments
the outer div has got a light gray color
and the inner div has got red you know
background color so I'm going to create
two nested div elements here so DIF this
is going to be our outer div so I'm
going to give it an ID of out of there
and I'm going to set the style attribute
so basically we want the background
color to be light gray so to get that
I'm going to use this color code hash II
I'm going to use ease
times so that should give me light gray
color and the height of this one is
going to be 20 pixels and the width is
going to be 500 pixels and let's also
include a padding of 5 pixels okay so
that's our outer div and I'm going to
have another def so this is our inner
div and the idea of this one is going to
be in a div and again for this one I'm
going to set the style attribute and for
this background color is going to be red
and the height of this one is going to
be 19 pixels and width is going to be 0
pixels initially and we want the font
color itself to be white and notice you
know we are displaying the percentage in
the center of this inner div so let's
use text align attribute so text align
Center so that is our inner div element
so we have two divs nested within each
other so let's save the changes and when
we reload this HTML page 1 we should get
the UI that is similar to this one now
when we select a percentage and when we
click start animation we have to slowly
fill that progress bar so what we are
going to do is increase the width of the
inner div element okay so with a jQuery
ready function I'm going to create a
function let's call this animate
progress bar okay and to this function
we are going to pass percentage
completed
now I'm going to find the development by
ID so the ID of the development I mean
the inner development is in a div so
let's find the inner development and on
that we are going to call animate
function and what do we want to do we
want to increase the width of the inner
div element okay so increase the width
so we want to increase the width of the
inner development to whatever percentage
that we pass into this function right so
for example if we pass 90% then we want
to increase the width of this inner
development to 90% of 500 pixels so the
width of the outer development is 500
pixels so we want to increase the width
of the inner development to 90% of 500
pixels so to get that I'm actually going
to multiply 500 with the percentage
completed parameter and then divide that
by 100 so that is going to give us the
percentage right so that's what is the
width of the inner div is going to be
and then we want that increase to happen
or the duration of let's say 3,000
milliseconds so we are going to call
this function when we click the button
right because that's when we want the
animation to happen and the button
element also has got an ID so let's find
the button by ID my button is the ID and
when we click the button we want to call
a function so when we click the button
we want to call this animate progress
bar function and we don't want to
hard-code the percentage values instead
we have a drop down list which is going
to display these percentage values so we
want to you know select the value from
the drop down list and the drop down
list has got an ID DDL percentage so
animate progress bar and let's find the
drop down list
to buy ID and then get the value that
the user has selected using Val function
all right so let's save the changes
let's reload this HTML page 1 and look
at this when we select 90% and we click
start animation notice that it slowly
fills 90% okay and at the moment we only
have the progress bar we don't have the
percentage value so now let's see how to
include that percentage value on that in
a development so to include the
percentage value within our animate
progressed power function I'm actually
going to create a JSON object and this
JSON object is going to have one
property counter and I'm going to
initialize that to one okay and on this
I'm going to call animate function and
what we want to do is increase the count
of value from 1 to whatever percentage
we are passing to this function so if we
pass in our 92 this parameter then we
want to count this counter value from 1
till 90 and then display that value
within the inner div element okay so we
want to increase the counter value from
1 till 90 but we don't want to hard-code
the value like that instead I'm going to
use the same parameter
okay so animate method we are passing
the JSON object it's going to count from
1 to whatever percentage completed a
value that we pass into this function
okay and that's going to be the count is
going to be animated so now I'm going to
use another JSON object so we can pass
the options that we want to this animate
method so I'm using the second JSON
object to specify the duration so
duration is going to be 3,000
milliseconds so this should match this
value here because both of them should
happen at the same time okay so duration
should be 3,000 milliseconds
and I'm also going to specify another
options tab and I'm going to specify an
anonymous function here so what we want
to do here is find the inner development
so that's the ID of the inner
development and I'm going to set the
text of the inner dev and I'm going to
set the text to the value of this
property no counter and to that I'm
going to append percentage okay so what
is this step option here now look at
this when we call this animate function
for example when we pass let's say 10 as
the value for this parameter so this
counter value is going to be increased
from 1 till 10 so it first increases
from 1 to 2 so that's one step of the
animation at that point you know this
function will be called so for every
step of the animation this function will
be called and what are we doing in this
function we are finding the inner
development and setting its text the
value of the counter so when it
increases from 1 to 2 that value will be
displayed within the inner div element
similarly when we increase it from 2 to
3 you know that value is going to be
displayed so for every step of the
animation this function will be called
and we are displaying that value within
the inner div element so let's look at
this in action so let's save the changes
let's reload this page and look at this
when we select 70 for example and when
we click start animation notice that we
get the value you know from 1 till 69
point whatever now we don't want those
decimal numbers so let's round it in
order to 70 and to do that I'm going to
use this math dot seal function so math
dot 0 so this is going to round the
value to the nearest integer so instead
of decimals we are going to get integers
now so let's save the changes reload
this page and look at this and I select
90
a so it counts till ninety and when we
select for example 30 it slowly retreats
to 30 thank you for listening and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
