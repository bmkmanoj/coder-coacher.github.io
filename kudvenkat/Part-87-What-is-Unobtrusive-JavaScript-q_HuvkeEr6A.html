this video well disk is true Co and
unobtrusive javascript if you have been
following along with this asp.net MVC
tutorial to enable client-side
validation in asp.net MVC application we
need to turn on two keys within the web
config file we need to set client
validation enable to true and
unobtrusive JavaScript enabled it to
true so first let's understand what we
mean by unobtrusive javascript first
let's look at an example that uses
obtrusive javascript and we'll see how
to convert that obtrusive javascript to
an unobtrusive javascript when we
navigate to this edit view notice that
we have a Save button here
now let's say for example when I move my
mouse over the Save button I want to
change the background color of the
button to red and when I move the mouse
away from that button we want the color
to be gray
let's see how to achieve that using
obtrusive JavaScript so let's flip to
visual studio let's open up this edit
view and then we are going to write some
JavaScript code so let's include a
script tag set the type equals text
slash JavaScript and language to
JavaScript so we're going to write some
JavaScript here so I'm going to write a
function you can give it any meaningful
function name I'm going to call this
mouse over and then to this function I'm
going to pass a control ID so what is
this function going to do it's going to
find the control which has caught that
ID and to find that control I'm going to
use this method get element by ID I'm
going to pass it the control ID and
obviously this get element by ID
function is going to return a reference
for that control so I'm going to store
that in a variable called maybe control
and what we need to do here is to set
the background attribute I mean
background color for the control so
control dot style dot background
color equals let's say for example I
want to set it to red color okay
similarly I'm going to have another
function and let's call this maybe Mouse
out and let's set the color to gray
right the next step is to you know
invoke this functions so let's navigate
to the submit button on mouse-over so
then that even happens what do we want
to do we want the in work of a mouse
over function so let's copy the name
mouse over and we need to pass the ID of
the control okay so let's invoke this
function here so we need to pass the ID
of this control so let's include an ID
maybe let's call this BTN submit and
let's pass this ID to this function and
similarly on Mouse out when this even
happens we want to invoke our Mouse out
function so let me copy this and let's
change the name of the function to Mouse
out
alright let's save everything let's go
back to our editor view and reload this
alright look at this when I mouse over
we have the red color as I move away we
have gray color but then the JavaScript
that is present here is obtrusive
JavaScript look at this this javascript
code is now intermingled with the HTML
markup that we have so the structure of
our website I mean the HTML markup and
the behavior you know both of them are
intermingled let's see how to convert
this obtrusive JavaScript into an
unobtrusive javascript okay first of all
the first step is to add a JavaScript
file so let's add a new item let's add a
jscript file and let's call this maybe
custom JavaScript it will give it any
meaningful name you want and then within
this JavaScript code I mean JavaScript
file they are going to write some
JavaScript code we're going to convert
this JavaScript code this obtrusive
JavaScript into unobtrusive javascript
and we're going to make use of jQuery
for that purpose okay so we're going to
write some jQuery code here so let me
drag and drop this jQuery file all right
so dollar function
so what do we want to do we want to find
a control that has got an ID of BTN
submit okay in jQuery the ID selector is
pound symbol
so let's include the pound symbol and
the idea of the control is BTN submit so
find that control and then once you find
that control on I mean mouse-over so
when this event occurs what we want to
do we want to execute another function
okay so what do we want to do basically
we want to change the background color
of this button so button submit dot I am
going to use CSS function for that and
we can specify any CSS property um style
that we want for example I want to
change here background color so
background color I want to set that to
red okay so let's make a copy of this
one similarly when Mouse out event
happens what we want to do we want to
change the background color to gray okay
so we have included some JavaScript code
here I mean jQuery code basically that's
present in the next another file right
now look at that we have separated the
JavaScript okay so obviously you know
find this control and then when mouse
over event happens change the background
color to red and similarly for this
control when Mouse out even happens
change the background color to gray okay
so the behavior is present in this
javascript file now all right now the
next step is to actually reference this
javascript file within our edit view so
let's go back to the edit view and then
drag and drop this custom javascript
file and let's change this to use the
tilde syntax so till indicates the root
directory of the project within the root
directory we have
scripts folder and then we have custom
JavaScript and that's what this part
says all right so since we have you know
the JavaScript code now present in a
separate file you know we can get rid of
this JavaScript code that's present
within the view so let's go ahead and
delete this and we can also delete
whatever code we have here
look at this here we are hooking up the
function with its event we can get rid
of this as well all right so let's see
if this let's go back to a view and
reload this and the behavior should be
the same on mouse-over red color
onmouseout we have grey color but then
look at this on overview now we don't
have any traces of JavaScript it's clean
HTML markup all our JavaScript now is
present in a separate JavaScript file so
what is unobtrusive javascript
unobtrusive javascript is a JavaScript
that's present from the I mean that is
separated from the websites HTML markup
so this unobtrusive javascript resides
in its own file so basically we are
separating the structure of our website
from its behavior the HTML markup is
present in your view the Java Script
which represents the client-side
behavior is present in a separate file
and what are the advantages of using
unobtrusive javascript there are several
of them the first one is obviously
separations of concerns that is the HTML
markup now is clean without any traces
of JavaScript on that view
obviously this means page loads faster
it is also easy to update the JavaScript
code as all the JavaScript logic is now
present in a separate file and we also
get a better caching support because all
the JavaScript is present in a separate
file which can be cached and accessed
much faster on this line you can find a
link to YouTube playlist where you can
find c-sharp video dotnet asp.net
sequence of an MVC playlist in this
playlist all the videos are arranged in
a logic
sequence which could be useful to you
that's it for today thank you for
listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
