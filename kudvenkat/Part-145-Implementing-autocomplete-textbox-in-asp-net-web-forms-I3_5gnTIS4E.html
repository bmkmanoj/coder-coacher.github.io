this video well disk is implementing
autocomplete text box in an asp.net
webforms application using jQuery
autocomplete widget and the web servers
will be using this table TBL students
within this demo it is the sequence clip
to create this table and populate it
with some sample data
I'll have the script available on my
blog in case if you need it we want a
wave form to look like this when it is
rendered we basically want to retrieve
all the students that are present within
this table TBL students and then display
them within the grid we control as you
can see here we also want to provide a
search interface for example if I type
letter M within the search text box we
want to list all the student names that
start with letter M and then if we
select a student name and then once we
click the search button we want that
selected student to be displayed within
the grid we control so let's see how to
achieve this using the equity
autocomplete feature and the web service
first let's set up our application to
use jQuery autocomplete widget and to do
that navigate to jQuery UI web.com
click download link so this should list
all the jQuery UI widgets by default all
of the pages are selected click this
checkbox to deselect and then we are
interested in autocomplete widget so
let's select that and notice that all
the dependencies are also automatically
selected and now scroll all the way to
the bottom click this download button
the required jQuery files and the CSS
files will be downloaded their will be
downloaded in a zip format we need to
extract them so I have already extracted
them and then once you navigate to the
folder you should see you know folder
structure like this we are interested in
these two folders j/s and CSS folders
within the J's folder we have the
require that jQuery files so we are
interested in this jQuery file and the
minified jQuery UI file so let's copy
these two and move them to the scripts
folder so let's paste in there and we
also need this hisses files so let's
go back to this jQuery folder and then
let's expand open CSS folder within that
UI lateness and we are interested in
images and this minified custom CSS so
let's copy them and move them to the
Styles folder okay at this point we have
set up our application to use jQuery
autocomplete widget the next step is to
write a web service so this web service
is going to be responsible for
retrieving the matching student names ok
so let's go ahead and add a web service
so right click on the project name
within the solution Explorer add a new
item and we want to add a web service
and let's call this student service
click Add so this should add a web
service and we're going to write some ad
or dotnet code so let's go and import
the required namespaces so we need a
system data we need a system dot data
dot sequel client and we need system dot
configuration and we want this web
service to be called though from
JavaScript and if that is the case we
need to uncomment this line so let me
uncomment this and look at this so if
you want your service to be callable
from JavaScript then you need to
decorate that with the script service
attribute ok now this method is going to
return matching student names ok so I'm
going to call this method get student
names and what are we going to return
student names list of matching student
names so basically it's the return type
is going to be list of strings
all right so now let's write the area
not net code to retrieve matching
student names but before we do that we
need a stored procedure and then for
example you know you type letter M what
should happen all the student names that
match that start with letter M should be
retrieved so we're going to have a
stored procedure it's going to have one
parameter and that parameter is going to
contain the letters that we have typed
here and that stored procedure is going
to return us the matching links so let's
go ahead and implement that store
procedure so create procedure let's call
it SP get matching student names and
let's call the parameter at student name
this is going to be of type in we're
care as begin end and within the body we
want to select just the name of the
student from TBL students table fare
name like whatever we are passing into
the stop seizure has a parameter and we
need to append the wildcard person date
symbol because we are using like here
okay so let's go and create the stored
procedure f5 and let's quickly test this
to make sure it works as expected so for
example if I pass letter M let's see if
this works
so plus f5 look at that I get the
employees whose name start with letter M
all right so let's go and implement our
web service here so first of all we need
to retrieve the connection string from
web config file and if you look at the
web config file here I have already a
connection string with name DBC s which
is pointing to you know local
installation of sequel server and we are
using windows authentication okay all
right so let's go ahead and read the
connection string and to do that we are
going to make use of configuration
manager class dot connection strings of
what is the name of a connection string
DBC s and retrieve the connection string
with that name
and let's use a using statement and then
create a sequel connection object the
advantage of using using block here is
that we don't have to explicitly call a
closed method on the connection object
it will be automatically closed for us
so sequel connection equals new sequel
connection and we want to create a
single connection object using the
connection string that we have just
retrieved from web config file the next
step is to create the sequel command
object so sequel command CMD equals the
new sequel command and our sequel
command is actually a Stewart procedure
so this is the name of the stood
procedure so let's copy that and move it
right here and the next parameter is the
connection object so on using which
connection object do you want to execute
the stored procedure disconnection
object we are going to pass that as the
second parameter and since the command
object is executing its tool procedure
we need to tell that to the command
object using command type a property and
this stored procedure expects a
parameter and what is the name of the
parameter at student name so we need to
associate that parameter with the stored
procedure so let's create a parameter
object so signal parameter let's call it
parameter equals new sequel parameter
and we're going to use this overloaded
version of the constructor where it
expects the name of the parameter and
the value okay so what's the name of the
parameter at student name so let's pass
that there and we are we going to get
the value from the value for this
parameter is going to come into this
function as a parameter so let's call
this string student name so let's pass
that as the value for this sequel
parameter and the next step is to
associate this parameter object with
this command object and to do that we
are going to use parameters property of
the command object and pass our sequel
parameter object to this function okay
and all that is left out now is to open
the connection and execute the command
so
sequel data reader Rd R equals command
dot execute reader so what are we going
to get back we're going to get list of
students back so we need to return list
of those student names back okay so
first of all let's go ahead and create a
list of string let's call it student
names equals new list of string and to
this list let's add the name of the
student so we need to loop through the
result set and to do that we're going to
make use of while loop so loop through
the sequel data reader and while you are
reading from the reader retrieve name
convert that to string and then add that
to the list
so student names dot add so once we are
done looping through and adding the
students to this list what we need to do
we need to return that student list back
so return student names so we have just
implemented our student service and
let's quickly check if it works as
expected so let me run this by pressing
ctrl f5 so this student service should
have one method get student names so
once we click that it expects a
parameter that's a for example I pass
letter J as the parameter invoke and
notice that we get to students whose
name start with letter J okay
so our web service is working is
expected the next step is to invoke this
web service from our web form one dot
aspx first of all we need to design over
form like this ok so we need at this
word name and then a textbox and then a
button control and then a grid view
control so let's go in and design over
web form so name
we need a textbox control so let's go to
toolbox and let's drag and drop a
textbox control and let's give it a
meaningful name let's call it txt
student name and we need a button
control so let's drag and drop a button
control and let's give this a name let's
call it BTN I mean an ID let's call it
BTN submit and the text on the button to
submit okay and then let's include a
gridview control let's include an HTML
break and then a grid we control grid we
control should be on the data tab so
let's expand that drag and drop a grid
view control and let's give this it
could be control a meaningful ID let's
call this gb students ok so now we need
to write some JavaScript here so if we
run this now we should have the
interface that we see here a text box
button and a grid we control okay
there we go so now we need to write some
JavaScript basically to implement
autocomplete feature okay so we need the
script and CSS files so we need this CSS
file jQuery custom CSS file so let's
drag and drop that there and we also
need these jQuery files so let's drag
and drop them in that order okay so
we're going to write some JavaScript
here so let's use script tag set the
type to text slash JavaScript and the
language is going to be JavaScript okay
so let's write some jQuery code here so
dollar function
okay so we want to implement
autocomplete for this text box control
right so we need to first find the text
box control and to find the text box
we're going to make use of ID selector
so dollar ID selector in jQuery is pound
and then you know to get the client ID
of this text box control I'm going to
use client ID property and to use that
I'm going to use angle brackets
percentage equals that's the name of the
control I'm going to use a client ID
property to get the client ID basically
okay so for this text box we want to
implement autocomplete feature so we are
going to invoke this autocomplete
function but this function expects
several options and the most important
option is the source option the source
option is going to tell you know what
data it has to display okay so basically
where are we going to retrieve the
source data from we are going to
retrieve that using this web service
this web service has got this method
which is going to return us the matching
names okay so the source for this
autocomplete feature is going to be that
web service okay so and we are going to
invoke that using Ajax and to speed
things up I have already typed that code
so let me copy that and paste it here
and it's straightforward code we'll go
over that in just a bit so here we are
specifying the source option for this
autocomplete feature and you know
basically the source is going to be a
function which has two parameters
request and response and we are going to
invoke the get student names method
within student service toward SMX web
service using Ajax okay so this is the
URL of this web service that we need to
invoke get student service toward ASM x4
slash get
student names so let's actually make
sure we don't have any errors in the
name so the name of the method is get
student names and the web service is
going to be student service dot ASM X
let's piece that there okay
and if you look at this get student
names method it expects a parameter so
obviously we need to supply a value for
that parameter so we are we going to get
the value for that parameter farm so we
need to specify that we're going to get
that from the request object so this
request object has got this term
property you know from that term
property we are going to retrieve that
okay so we are going to pass that as a
value for this parameter so what's the
name of the parameter here student name
so the second line here is the parameter
value okay and we're going to invoke the
sketch student names function using post
request and the data type has to be
jason and the content type has to be
jason and then obviously when we execute
this function there could be two things
happening you know either it has
successfully executed and return the
jason result otherwise they could be an
error okay so if jason data is
successfully returned then what do you
want to do with that json data you know
so this is the JavaScript function that
I want to execute in case if the JSON
data is successfully returned okay so
what are we doing here we're basically
retrieving that data and passing it to
the response okay so basically here the
confusing thing is why are we using this
a dot d now one thing to keep in mind is
that asp.net Ajax library uses a wrapper
around JSON formatted data to prevent
jason hijacking if this is too confusing
at the moment don't worry we're going to
discuss jason hijacking in a later video
session in great detail for now
understand that to retrieve data from
jason formatted data we use a dot d okay
now you know to this object you can give
any meaningful name you want for example
you can call it
result so within this result object to
retrieve the json data you have to use
you know dot d and that is to prevent a
json hijacking that's how a wrapper
around json formatted data is
implemented within asp.net Ajax which we
will discuss in detail in a later video
session alright so if at all if there is
any error executing that function then
we are going to just player you know
alert this message there is a problem
processing your request ok so at this
point everything that should be working
as expected so let's go ahead and run
this if we have implemented everything
then autocomplete should work so for
example when I type letter M look at
that I get the matching student names so
if I plus letter J we get the matching
student names now when I set the student
click Submit nothing happens we need to
implement that search code so that is
again straightforward so with the newer
web form so within the page load event
we're going to write some ad or net code
so let me actually copy these namespaces
and paste them within the web form okay
let's also copy this area dot net code
so that we don't have to and we'll keep
typing it so here I'm going to have a
private function what let's call it get
student data
and obviously this is going to have a
parameter string a name maybe let's call
it student name so when we select a
student name and then click Submit we
only want to display the matching
student name our student within the
gridview control okay now another thing
is when we first load this waveform you
know we want to display all the students
with liquid B control so for that to
happen so this student name could be now
at that point so when the waveform first
loads the student name could be now okay
in which case we want to load all the
employees all these students basically
so first of all let's create a stored
procedure to get all these students so
create a procedure let's call it SP get
students again this is going to have a
parameter at student name so let's pass
that and this parameter can be now so
I'm making this optional by specifying a
default value as bacon and so what I'm
going to do is copy this and paste it
within this procedure so we not only
want the name we want all the columns so
I'm going to say star from dbl students
wear name like whatever we have within
this parameter or that name I mean at
student name parameter could be now in
which case we're going to retrieve all
the students so let's create the store
procedure look at that if I just execute
that without passing any value for the
parameter I get all the students in case
if I pass for example let J and I get
only that students whose name starts
with letter J all right so let's go
ahead and invoke the stored procedure so
basically what are we doing here by
reading the connection string from
web.config file we want to create a list
of students or we don't even need a list
because we are going to bind the output
directly to the grid we control so
we have the connection string we are
creating the sequal connection object
the command is actually the stored
procedure as we get of students so we're
going to pass that here and we're going
to execute this command using this
connection object the command type is
stored procedure and the stored
procedure expects a parameter and the
name of the parameter is student name
and we're going to get the value for
that parameter using this method
parameter okay but then one thing to
keep in mind is that this parameter can
be null
okay so if that is the case we first
need to check if string dot is null or
empty so if this parameter so if this
parameter is not null are empty then
create a parameter object associated
value with that and then add to add it
to the command object okay and then open
the connection execute the command we
don't even need this while loop so let's
get rid of that what we're going to do
here is what is the name of our grid we
control GV students the data source for
this is going to be the reader object
and we are going to invoke data bind all
right
so we have the flight private function
so when the page first loads if it's not
a post back then we want to invoke this
get at student data function and then we
are going to pass null for the student
name because when the waveform first
loads you know we want to display all
the students within the grid we control
in that case student name is going to be
now okay now we have a button control on
the waveform so when we click that
button control you know we want to
display the matching students okay so in
that case we're going to call again this
get a student data function but then we
are going to pass the student name so
where are we going to get the student
name from txt student name a textbox so
dot text property should give the give
us that all right that's it
so let's go ahead and run this now when
the page first loads we will get all the
students displayed within the grid we
control and look at this the moment I
type letter J we have autocomplete I
select in a student you know student is
displayed I type M I get out to complete
if I just submit look at that I get all
the students whose name starts with
letter M alright that's it for today
thank you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
