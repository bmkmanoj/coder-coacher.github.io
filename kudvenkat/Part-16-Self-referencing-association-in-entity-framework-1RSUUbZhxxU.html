in this video we'll discuss self
referencing Association entity framework
with database first approach let's
understand the self referencing
Association with an example we'll be
using this employees table for this demo
this employees table is a self
referencing table that's because to get
an employee's manager name we take the
manager ID column value and look up that
value in the employee ID column of the
same table for example to get Jones
manager name we look up the manager ID
column value which is five here and then
we look up that value in the employee ID
column five is lhara
so Jones manager is lhara so this table
here is a self referencing table now
when we use entity framework and when we
generate an entity model based on this
table we will end up with an employee
entity as you can see here notice that
there is a self referencing Association
that's automatically generated and there
are also two navigation properties
employees one employee one let's look at
this in action so obviously the first
step here is to create this table itself
which I have already done and here is
the sequel script that can do it
now let's flip Visual Studio here I have
an empty asp.net web application project
to this project let's add an ad or net
entity data model and let's call this
employee model and we want to generate
our model from the database we'll select
that option and click Next and give the
connection string a meaningful name
let's call this employee DB context and
click Next so this should connect to the
database and retrieve all the tables
views and stored procedures so let's
select this employee's table and let's
give this model namespace a meaningful
name let's call it employee model and
click finish so this should generate the
employee entity based on the self
referencing employee's table notice that
there is a self referencing Association
here and there are two navigation
properties now if we right click on this
employees one navigation property and go
to its properties look at that the
multiplicity or
of the employees one navigation property
set to many so this property of the
employee object is going to give us you
know multiple employees who are direct
reports of a manager so basically using
this navigation property we are going to
get all the subordinates of a given
manager ok and if you look at this
property right here employee one
navigation property and if you go to its
properties look at the multiplicity it
is 0 or 1 now if you take an employee an
employee may or may not have a manager
for example if you look at the data that
we have right here you know Laura you
know has one manager similarly mark has
one manager but it's look at been he
doesn't have a manager why he's the
super boss so he doesn't have a manager
but you know employees in general
directly report to one manager typically
an employee has got only one manager
super boss doesn't have a manager so the
relationship here is I mean the
multiplicity here is 0 or 1 so this
property is going to return an employee
who is a manager but then look at the
names that entity framework has
auto-generated for these navigation
properties now these doesn't really make
sense now if we have to write some code
based on these navigation property names
then that code will not be readable and
in the longer term you know it will not
be maintainable as well let's actually
look at that in action let's say for
example we want to generate you know an
output like this we want to display
employee name and their respective
manager name on a web form so to achieve
this what we would do we would drag and
drop it grid-view control and then we
write some link queries so let's
actually flip to visual studio so to
this project let's go ahead and add a
web form
and let's drag and drop agreed we
control let's first of all set style
attribute here let's set font family to
area let's drag and drop the grid view
control on to the waveform and let's
sort of format this and choose colorful
scheme alright now let's get to the
code-behind file so so far what we have
understood is that employee is one a
navigation property is going to give us
you know the direct reports or the
subordinates and employee 1 and
navigation property is going to give us
the manager employee ok
so within the code-behind file we have
grid view one control so we are going to
set its data source properties so data
source equals we have the employee
dbcontext which is generated first let's
create an instance of employee dbcontext
let's call it employee dbcontext equals
new employee dbcontext and then we are
going to use the DB context object and
it has got obviously employees property
which is going to give us all the
employees now based on that list
now this employees ok you know we have
among these employees list that is
returned we have employees as well as
that is subordinates as well as managers
now we want to produce this output that
you see here employee name and their
respective manager name so to achieve
that and what I'm going to do is I'm
going to you know this link expression
that we are writing here will be
executed on each employee object within
this collection so what we are going to
do here is select a new anonymous site
so new type and let's convert those you
know whatever new types that we generate
to a list and that is set as the data
source for the grid we control and let's
n work data bind ok so now in this
anonymous type what do we want we want
two columns and in two properties
basically employee name and manager a
name so employee name
equals so we have the employee object
here so employee object dot employee
object has got employee name property
which is going to return us the name of
the employee and then we also need
manager name so let's call the property
manager name so within the anonymous
type that we are building you know we
are going to have two properties
employee name and manager name so
managing them how are we going to get
the manager them so this employee object
or the employee entity has got employee
one navigation property remember the
multiplicity on that navigation property
is 0 or 1 so typically in many an
employee has 1 or 0 managers right so
that is the property navigation property
which is going to return the manager of
a given employee so we have the manager
employee object and we are going to use
employee name property of it which will
return us the manager name of the given
employee now with these changes let's
actually run this and see what output we
get ok notice that we are getting the
output that we expect employee name
manager name now if you look at what we
have on the slide for Bend there is no
manager and it displays this text super
boss so how to get that text that's
straightforward here manager name if
this employee one what is it returning
it is returning the manager of an
employee but there could be employees
who does not have a manager in which
cases employee one property that is the
employee one navigation property is
going to return null so if this EMP dot
employee one if that is going to be now
right then we want the manager name to
be something like super boss he doesn't
have a manager so let's call you know
the manager I mean let's set this text
for the manager name column ok for that
employee and then if it is not now
then obviously we are going to employ
one navigation property and then
selecting the employee name so with this
change let's go ahead and run this so
there we get the output that we have
seen on the slide now if you look at
this code okay is this readable in the
first place what is this employee one
means right I mean the names that entity
framework has given to these navigation
properties they're not really meaningful
but entity framework has done its best
in order to give those names so but we
can rename them to you know some
meaningful names so let's slip to
employee model here so employee is one
this is going to return us all the
subordinates so let's call it sub
ordinates and this navigation property
right here employee one this is going to
return a manager of an employee so let's
call that manager okay
let's save these changes and then once
we go to the code-behind file obviously
we are going to have compilation errors
because this employee entity no longer
has this employee one navigation
property instead we have renamed that to
manager so if employees manager is now
that means we don't have a manager for
that employee in which case we want the
manager name to be super boss on the
other hand if there is a manager then we
want that managers employee name okay so
now if you look at this code this code
is more readable and obviously it's more
readable it would be more maintainable
as well okay so let's run this and see
if we get the same output so the output
is the same but now we have you know
meaningful names for those navigation
properties and another thing that I want
to show you is when you go to the
properties of this self referencing
Association notice that there is a self
referential constraint and obviously
here employee's table is mapped to
itself so here the principle is employee
is stable and the dependent you know it
has given
employee is one which means it's same
instance of that table and the principle
key here is employee ID and dependent
property is manager ID okay that's it
for today thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
