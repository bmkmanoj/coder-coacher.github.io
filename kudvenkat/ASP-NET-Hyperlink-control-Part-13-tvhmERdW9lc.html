venket this is part 13 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll learn about
the properties methods and events of an
asp.net hyperlink control the asp.net
hyperlink control is used to create a
link to another web page let's look at
an example here I have a simple asp.net
web application project let's drag and
drop the hyperlink control from the
toolbox to get to the properties of the
hyperlink control select that right
click and select properties so we knew
that a hyperlink control is used to
create a link to another web page so
obviously when you click the hyperlink
you are going to another web page so you
will have to specify to which you will
have to go to when you click that
hyperlink so navigate URL is the
property that we use for that purpose
so this is the most important property
of the hyperlink control so let's say I
want to navigate to presume techcom so
HTTP colon four slash four slash
presumed techcom here we are actually
navigating to an external website it's
also possible using the hyperlink you
can navigate to another page within your
application and to do that click the
ellipsis button which will display all
the web forms within your application
now currently in our application we only
have one web form so that's listed here
but then if you have more than one web
form all of them will be listed here
and then you can select the form web
form to which you want to navigate to
when you click this hyperlink alright so
now let's go ahead and run this so the
web page should be rendered with the
hyperlink control but the first thing
that you will notice is that the
hyperlink does not have a meaningful
name so you if you want to give the
meaningful name to the hyperlink control
then there are two ways to do that one
is you can actually type that link name
between the opening and closing tags of
the hyperlink control or you can
actually use the text property so text
is equal to let's say click here to go
to
plus I'm tech website so now when we
learn des that meaningful name should be
displayed instead of that generic
hyperlink you know text so when we click
this now we shouldn't be navigated to
presume techcom now observe that we are
we are being navigated in the same
vendor we will see later how to change
this behavior all right so so far we
have seen two important properties of
the hyperlink control the text property
which is basically used to specify the
link text that we show to the user
navigate URL the URL of the page to
which the user will be sent to when they
click that hyperlink now at times let's
say I want to instead of displaying the
text hyperlink I want to display an
image is that possible with the
hyperlink control absolutely all you
have to do is use the image URL property
ok so now if you look at this it's
displaying this text I don't want that I
want an image to be displayed so
obviously if you want an image to be
displayed you will have to include that
image within your application so I have
an image here so I want to copy this
image into my application so let me copy
that and let's create a new folder so
that in that folder we can have all of
our images so let me call this images
folder and I'm going to copy this image
into that folder so paste it so now I
have this image which I want to show
instead of this text so go to the
properties window of the hyperlink
control and select the image URL click
the ellipsis button go to the images
folder and you should see that image and
I select that click OK so now look at
this instead of the text it's actually
showing that image there now if you flip
to the source mode look at that image
URL is equal to there is a special
character here the tilde character until
the character within asp.net has got
special meaning ok
it indicates that it indicates the root
directory of your web application
project so
here the root directory for our web
application project is control stem oh
so this till symbol is saying okay go to
the root directory of this web
application project from there find the
images folder and within the images
folder find this presume tech dot PNG no
matter where you are in the folder
hierarchy if you include till the
character you are telling your
application to go to the you know web
application root directory and then from
there you are specifying the path all
right so now when we run this instead of
the link text it will display the link
image and obviously when we click click
that we should be navigated to presume
techcom so image URL the URL of the
image that will be displayed for the
link if you specify both the text and
the image URL the image will be
displayed instead of the text okay so
the image URL property will have higher
precedence over the text property okay
so and if for some reason the image is
not available then the text will be
displayed as a backup so let's say you
know for some reason maybe somebody
deleted this image or you know we have a
animated name that's not present within
our web application project now if we
learn this since we don't have that
image with that name you know the link
text the hyperlink text will be used as
a backup there in fact the text will
also be used as a tooltip in the
browsers which will be which will
support tooltip property so that's the
image URL now target this is very
important and useful property now so far
let's put this back to the right image
name so so far you know when you click
the URL so this is the window when I
click this URL the target web page
actually opens up in the same window now
let's say I want that to be opening up
in a new window how do I do that using
the target property
so we can use the hyper length target
property
and you specify the target as blank so
when you specify the target as planned
the target webpage will actually be
displayed in its own window so now when
we run this and when you click on the
hyperlink look at this the target
webpage is actually opening up within
its own window so target if target is
not specified the webpage to which the
hyperlink is linked will be displayed in
the same vendor if you set the target to
underscore blank the webpage will be
opened in a new window so these are all
the properties that the hyperlink
control you know supports and methods
there is a focus method just like how
the text box radio button and check box
control supports the focus method the
hyperlink control supports it in the
same way for example if you want the
hyperlink control to receive the focus
as soon as the webpage loads then you
can call this method on that hyperlink
control so here we just have the you
know hyperlink control but let's put an
image a text box there so that we know
the difference so I have a text box
there and let's go to the page load and
Here I am saying hyperlink 1 that's the
idea of the hyperlink control and on
that I am calling the focus method so
obviously when the page loads so let's
run this so look at this when the page
loads the hyperlink control is actually
selected in the sense it has the focus
now if I press ENTER it's going to open
automatically I don't have to move my
mouse and then click on that since the
hyperlink control is actually receiving
the focus on the page load you can just
press ENTER and the target web page will
be opened in a new window since we have
set the target to underscore blank so
that's the focus method and then events
no events specific to hyperlink control
are present actually so to find out the
events of the
in control we can select the hyperlink
control go to the properties and click
on that lightning pool symbol look at
this all these are the regular control
level events but as far as the hyperlink
is concerned it doesn't have any
specific events on it so on and then
remember you know this hyperlink has got
several properties all these properties
we have seen how to set them during the
design time okay but then it's also
possible to configure them you know at
runtime using the code okay so here I
can say hyperlink 1 dot negate URL you
can specify all these properties
dynamically as well and in addition to
these standard you know these hyperlink
properties all the other standard you
know asp.net control properties are
available so if you go to the properties
window now if you want to change maybe
the font color since we don't have a
text here the font color doesn't really
make sense but if it's the text then you
can change the font color font size you
know all those standard properties that
are available to every asp.net control
are also obviously available to the
hyperlink control so you can change the
font for color and all that alright on
this slide you can find resources for
asp.net c-sharp and sequence of
interview questions that's it for today
thank you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
