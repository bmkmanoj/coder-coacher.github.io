this video we'll discuss how to check if
an event is already bound using jQuery
first let's understand why is it
important to check if an event is
already bound if you want to prevent
attacking even handler multiple times
then you'll have to check if an event is
already bound let's see what's going to
happen if we attach even handler
multiple times
let's flip to shoe studio here we have a
button element with ID BTN with no
jquery ready function let's find the
button element let's use the jQuery on
function and associate click event
handler so when we trigger the click
event we want to call this anonymous
function and all we want this function
to do is display this message saying
button clicked so let's make a copy of
this notice at the moment we've got to
click event handlers attached to the
same button element let's run this and
when we click the button as you might
expect we get the alert twice that's the
first one that's the second one that's
because we have attached a click event
handler twice to the same button element
so let's see how to prevent that from
happening to prevent that from happening
let's first detect if click event is
already bound to the button element so
to detect that the click event is
already bound to the button element in
jQuery we've got a function called
dollar dot underscore data and look at
this function the first parameter is the
element parameter so this parameter
specifies the element for which we'll
have to check if a given event is
already bound okay and remember this
element is the raw Dom element and not
the jQuery object now when we do
something like this dollar hash BTN so
what is this going to do this is going
to find this button element wrap that in
a jQuery object and return that jQuery
object back so what we have in this
jQuery object variable is actually a
jQuery object and not the raw Dom
element now if you want the raw Dom
element then you can use this gate
function so this is going to give us the
raw Dom element so let's create a
variable let's name this
raw Dom element equals whatever this get
method returns and let's pass this raw
Dom element to this data function and we
want events data so let's specify that
so this data method is going to return
as some even data let's do that in a
variable let's call that event object
now if we don't have any event you know
attached to the button element then in
this case this button this data function
is going to return nothing so this
variable event object will be undefined
so we have to check if that event object
variable is not equal to undefined if
it's not equal to undefined then we know
that we've got some events attached to
the button element and specifically we
are interested in checking if the click
event is already bound so I'm going to
say if event object dot plate not equal
to undefined okay if that's the case
then we know that we already have the
click event handler attached to the
button element so in that case we're
just going to say click event already
exists else let's say click event does
not exist okay now look at this we
already have a click event handler at
actually here so when we run this we
should get this alert saying click event
already exists so let's go ahead and run
this and look at that it says click
event already exists on the other hand
if we commenters and when we run this
now look at that click event does not
exist so this else part it's going to
come to the else part if the click event
does not exist so what we can do is we
can actually put this code
in that L spot right here and let's
uncomment that so now when we go ahead
and run this you know click even does
not exist it's going to add a cyclic
even handler and when we click the
button it says button click now on the
other hand if you have the same piece of
code you know somewhere up here that
means if you have already attached the
click event handler so this is going to
add as a click event handler in this
case it's going to come to the if block
display this message and then it's not
going to attach another click event
handler so when we run this we should
get that alert click event already
exists and when we click the button we
should get only one JavaScript alert
saying but intellect all right now at
the moment we are passing only one event
or we are associating only one event to
the button element let's actually use a
JSON object and associate multiple
events
let's associate first a click event so
when we trigger the click event we want
to call this anonymous function and
let's display a message saying button
clicked and similarly we want to
associate mouse over and when mouse over
event occurs let's say we want to change
the background color of the button to
hello and to do that let's use the CSS
function and the property we want to
change is background color and let's
change that to yellow all right so now
let's make a copy of this one and let's
associate 'mouseout event as well
so onmouseout let's change the
background color to white okay so now
we've got three events attached to the
button element okay
so let's actually throw in a breakpoint
here and let's run this in debug mode so
at the moment I'm using Internet
Explorer so we can debug the script look
at this
when I press f10 since we have got three
events attached click mouse over mouse
out this event object will contain
information about that three events
click Mouse out mouse over
first of all event object itself it's
not undefined it has got some data
within that and since we have click
mouse over and mouse out events attached
to the button element so that the event
object contains information about them
click mouse out mouse over all three of
them are not equal to undefined as well
so if click is not equal to undefined
then we know that click event is already
bound to the button element similarly if
you want to check if mouse over you know
it's already bound or not you can use
mouse over not equal to undefined okay
on the other hand let's actually stop
debugging now if we comment all these
then we don't have any events at all
attached to this button element so since
we don't have any events attached this
data function is going to return nothing
okay because we don't have any events
data so this variable event object
should be undefined so let's run this in
debug mode once again look at this when
I hover the mouse over event object it
says undefined since its undefined it's
going to the else part and it's going to
display this alert click if and does not
exist so let's press f5 and look at this
click event does not exist now one
important thing to keep in mind as this
is jQuery way of detecting F click event
is bound to a button element in this
case now since this is jQuery way this
only works if you have attached click
event handler using jQuery this will not
work if you have attached even handlers
using raw JavaScript or by using HTML
element attributes let me explain what I
mean so at the moment you know we don't
have any click event handler attached we
know how to add a click event handler
there are several ways of doing that in
jQuery we can use the shorthand
functions we can use on function or a
bind function etc now another way to
attach click event handler is by using
element attributes so element has got an
attribute on click and we can specify
the function that we want to call when
the click event occurs so here we are
using element attributes let's create a
function here let's actually name this
click Handler and let's display the
talat saying button clicked and now we
want this to call this function when
click event occurs so here we are
associating click event handler to the
element using element attribute now look
at this when we run this we are still
going to get a message saying click
event does not exist so this code that
we have here I will only work if we have
attached even handlers using jQuery ok
and since here we are attaching the
event handler using element attribute
that's why it says so but when we click
the button we get that we get that alert
button clicked because there is a click
event handler so this is one way that I
think like event handlers by using
element attributes we can also use the
raw JavaScript to attach event handlers
right so let's find the button element
so let's call this variable button
element equals we can use raw JavaScript
document or get element by ID and the ID
of the button is BTN and let's use that
button element and use the function add
event listener and we want to associate
click event handler and the function
that we want to call is click handler
that is this function right so here
again we are attaching click event
handler using raw JavaScript but this
code will not detect that ok so let's go
ahead and run this
time look at that we'll get the alert
saying click even does not exist but
then when we click the button look at
that there is an even handler and this
code is not able to detect that because
we are associating click event handler
using raw JavaScript here now another
way to prevent attaching even handler
multiple times is by using jQuery off
and on methods let me explain what I
mean now if your goal is to just attach
click event handler once you don't want
to bother you know to detect if the
click event is bound or not your
ultimate goal is to attach only one
click event handler to a given element
for example in this case button then
what you can do is use off-and-on
methods so let me show you what I mean
so find the button element using the ID
selector and I'm going to call off
function first and what is the purpose
of this off function it's going to
remove the even handlers now I want to
detach or remove any click even handler
you know that exists for the button so
it's going to remove all click event
handlers and then I'm going to use own
function and then associate click event
handler and when click event is
triggered we want to call this function
let's say alert button click
all right so at the moment we don't have
any even handlers attached so let's make
a copy of this get rid of this off so
now here we are attaching a click event
handler using own function but here we
are calling off so it's going to remove
any click event handlers even if we do
it like three times you know if we don't
have this look at this when we run this
we will get alert three times right look
at this when we click the button button
clicked first second and third because
we are attaching the click event handler
three times but if we have this code
this off method is going to remove all
those click event handlers for that
button and this on method will add just
this one click event handler so when we
run this we only get one alert button
clicked that's it
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
