this video we'll discuss what extension
methods are and how to implement
extension methods this is the definition
of extension methods according to MSDN
we'll come back to this definition in
just a bit first let's look at an
example links standard query operators
like select where order by etc all of
these are implemented in innumerable
class as extension methods on the eye
and numerable of T interface to do this
example right here numbers here you know
this is of type list and here within
this list we've got numbers 1 to 10 and
notice within the second line we are
calling we're method this we're method
is not defined within the list class
it's actually implemented as an
extension method in ienumerable of T
interface now in spite of this method
not belonging to the list class we are
still able to call it as though you know
that belong to list class so how is this
possible it's possible because this
where' method is implemented as an
extension method on ienumerable of t
interface and then list of T implements
ienumerable of T so that's why this is
still valid so now let's look at an
example of implementing extension
methods let's flip to visual studio so
here I have a new console application
this is what we want to achieve let's
say I have a string called STR name and
it holds a value of pledging so what we
want to do is extend the string class
meaning we want to be able to call a
method on this string instance something
like change first letter case ok so we
don't have such a method within the
string class so at the moment we will
definitely have a compilation error so
what should this method do now this
method should basically change the case
of the first letter if the first letter
is in lowercase it should change it to
uppercase if it's an uppercase it should
change it to lowercase ok so we want to
be able to extend at the string class so
we want to
store the result in another string let's
call that maybe result okay so we want
to be able to achieve something like
this so let's see how to make it
possible using extension method now you
know obviously if we want to achieve
that the first thing that comes to our
mind is to add this method to the string
class but if you look at the string
class we don't own this class it
actually belonged to dotnet framework so
that's not possible and the second
alternative that comes to our mind is
why don't we create a base class and
then define this method there and then
make a string class inherit from it
again that's not possible because we
don't own this string class the third
alternative is to create a wrapper class
or a helper class so let's actually add
to this project a class file and let's
call it maybe string helper dot CS so a
class name is going to be string helper
so let's make this class public and this
class is going to have a method and
let's make it static method and this is
going to return a string and let's call
it you know the same name what we have
here change first letter case and this
is going to take an input parameter of
type string and let's call this maybe
input string now what is the
responsibility of this function it
should change the case of the first
letter within the string that's passed
to this method okay so if the input
string dot length if that is greater
than zero then we know for sure you know
there's at least one character within
that string that's when we want to
change the case of the first letter
otherwise if the length is zero or if
the string is now simply return the
input string and to speed things up I
have already typed the required logic so
let's copy and paste it right here
okay so if you look at what we are doing
here we are basically converting the
input string whatever is coming into
this function into a character array and
then we are taking the first character
from that array and then we are checking
is it an upper case using EES upper
function so this function is going to
return true or false if it is true then
convert that letter to lower case using
to lower function otherwise if it's not
upper then it is in lower case if that's
the case convert it to upper case okay
so one line logic right there and then
what we are doing we are taking that
entire character array and creating a
new string and returning that back okay
so pretty simple logic there now so we
have a helper class here so it's going
to work but the problem is we cannot
still use this syntax right here because
change first letter case is not present
within the string class that's why you
will not be able to call it as though
it's an instance method belonging to the
string class okay so how to call or how
to use this function to be able to use
this function we have to use this class
name so we have to do something like
this so let's comment this so in this
line right here we use that string
helper class which we have just written
and then we call that method change
first letter case and then we pass our
input string which is STR name and let's
quickly print out the output and see if
it works as expected
so it should change letter P to capital
letter okay so it's working as expected
but but we are still not there yet we
want to be able to do something like
this okay so we want to be able to call
this change first letter case as though
you know it's an instance method defined
within the string class okay to achieve
that we need to turn this method into an
extension method and to turn a method
into an extension method you know there
are two simple things that we need to do
the first thing is make this class
itself the string helper class itself a
static class that's the first change and
the second change is what is the type
that we want to extend here we want to
extend the string class okay so that
should be the first parameter within
this function and that's the case here
and then another thing that we need to
do is we should precede the type name
which is string in this case with this
keyword okay so those are the two
changes so we have our original function
we are adding static keyword to these
the class itself and we add this keyword
you know this keyword should precede the
type that we are extending and the type
that we are extending should be passed
as the first parameter to this function
if you have other parameters you can
pass them as well but then they have to
be you know something other than the
first parameter your first parameter has
to be the type that you're extending and
this keyword has to precede the type
name okay so with these two changes we
should now be able to use let's comment
this one right here
the syntax so when we uncomment this
look at that we don't have any
compilation errors and another thing to
notice look at this when I plus dot look
at that
intellisense shows up that method but
with a different visual flu look at the
symbol right here you know you have a
downward pointing arrow so that what
indicates that it is an extension method
whereas to care array is a regular
instance meth
that is defined within the string class
but whereas this one is an extension
method okay that symbol indicates that
so now if we pass STR name you know as
the we don't have to pass STR name
because that's going to be acting as an
instance method so what it is going to
do is change the string first letter to
an uppercase in this example so let's go
ahead and run this look at that it has
changed it okay so that's how the
extension methods are implemented now
this is now an extension method does
that mean if we try to use this wrapper
class tile syntax will it give us a
compilation error not really in fact
behind the scene what actually happens
is when you have this piece of code
right here okay this this syntax will
actually be converted into wrapper class
styles and acts and then the method will
be invoked okay this extension methods
you know this is just a syntactic sugar
to make the life of developer easier
okay
now this also means whatever extension
methods that we have within system dot
length namespace you know we should
still be able to use them using this
wrapper class syntax style isn't it
because they are indeed extension
methods right so let's look at an
example so let's take this right here
so here we have list of numbers 1 to 10
and here we are using we're extension
method to retrieve only even numbers
from that list
so let's actually use a for each loop
and then print each number so let's say
for each end let's call it even number
in those even numbers collection what we
want to do is simply print even number
okay so let's go ahead and run this and
see if we get only the even numbers so
there we go we get only the even numbers
now this where method this is actually
defined in enumerable ienumerable of T
interface that's an innumerable class
okay
so now we should be able to use the
wrapper class you know style syntax iya
so instead of this one I should be able
to tell enumerable so this enumerable
class is present again in system dot
link namespace so enumerable dot we're
okay but we need to specify I mean we
need to pass the source you know of the
numbers to this function as the first
parameter what is the source this
collection right here so let's pass that
to this where method and then the second
parameter is the code that we want to
you know X be executed so this look at
this here we are using wrapper class
style syntax iya so let's go ahead and
run this now and look at this we get the
same output right so but you know this
link extension methods they make the
developer life much easier because we
are using them as though they are
instance methods on the list class okay
all right now if we go back to the first
slide this is the definition of
extension methods according to MSDN
extension methods enable you to add
methods to the existing type without
creating a new derived type recompiling
or otherwise modifying the original type
and if you recollect what we have done
that's what we have essentially done we
have extended the string class you know
without modifying it
okay with the help of extension methods
and extension methods are a special kind
of static method you have seen that this
extension method is actually a static
method within a static plus which allows
us to be you know calling them as an
instance method on the type that we are
extending in this case we have extended
string time for client code if that is
written either in c-sharp or Visual
Basic there is no upper end difference
between calling and extension method and
the methods that are actually defined in
a type alright that's it for today thank
you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
