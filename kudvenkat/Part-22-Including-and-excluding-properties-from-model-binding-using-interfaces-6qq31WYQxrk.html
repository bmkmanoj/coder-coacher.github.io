in this video we'll discuss including
and excluding properties from model
binding using interfaces please watch
but 21 before proceeding with this video
in part 20 we have seen how to include
and exclude properties from model
binding by passing a string array to
update model method and in part 21 we
have discussed achieving exactly the
same thing but using the bind attribute
in this video we'll see how to use
interfaces and achieve the same thing
the first step is to create an interface
notice that here we are creating an
interface with name I employee and look
at the list of properties that we have
got here we only have ID gender city and
date of birth we don't have the name
property so this interface is going to
specify all the properties that we want
to include in model binding since we
don't want name property to be involved
in model binding we have excluded that
property from this interface and the
next step is to make the employee class
inherit from that interface in a bit
we'll understand why this employee class
and this interface I employee has to
relate to each other through inheritance
and the final modification is to edit
under scope post controller action
method that is present in employee
controller class notice that here you're
passing an ID parameter to this function
this ID parameter is going to receive
the ID of the employee that we are
editing and using that ID we are loading
the existing details of the employee
from the database so at this point this
employee object you know is going to
have the data of the employee before
data modification so the ID name gender
City date of birth all these properties
will have the existing data that's
loaded from the database and then the
most important step is the call to this
update model function notice that here
we are passing in the interface type and
this interface has only got these four
properties it doesn't have name property
there so this update model will
automatically invoke the default days
MVC model binder which is going to look
at these properties and then using the
posted form values it's going to update
only those properties that are present
within this interface so the model
binder is not going to touch the name
property the name property will remain
the same even if the posted form
contains a value for the name property
and then we hand that employee object to
save employee method which is going to
save the details of the employee to the
database table and then we are
redirecting the user to the index action
which is going to list all the employees
there let's actually make this changes
so let's flip to visual studio so our
employee class is present in our
business layer project so the first step
is to create the interface so here we
have this interface I employee and
notice the properties we don't have name
property because we don't want to
include a name property in model binding
and then the next step is to make this
employee class inherit from that
interface I employee now let's go to our
employee controller and let's pass ID
parameter so using this ID we have to
load the employee details the existing
employee details from the database table
so we are going to make use of this
employee business layer object so I'm
going to get that single employee where
the ID matches with the ID that we are
passing in and then I'm going to create
an employee object here
at this point we will have the existing
details of the employee loaded from the
database table okay and then I'm going
to call update model function look at
that and then I can specify the type
okay
so I'm going to say pass in my I
employee interface here so the default
asp.net MVC model binder at this point
is only going to update the properties
that are present in this I employee
interface and then we pass the employee
object look at this it's expecting and I
employee type but what object are we
passing employee object and what is the
type of this employee object its
employee class
I mean employee but then since employee
class and the interface are related
through inheritance you can pass it as
an inherited type so that's why this
employee class and this interface has to
relate to each other through inheritance
so at this point all the properties of
the employee will be updated except the
name property the name is going to you
know contain the existing data of the
employee even if the posted form is
going to contain a value for that name
property and then we are checking the
model state if it's valid we are handing
that object to save employee method
which is going to save the employee
details to the database table and we are
redirecting the user to the index action
so with these changes let's go ahead and
run this and see if it's going to work
as expected so let's navigate to
employee controller index action let's
fire a fiddler
let's click on edit let's delete the
requests that are already there and
let's save this so that we'll have a
post trick vessel this is that post
request let's click on the composer tab
let's drag and drop this post request
here and then here we can change all the
properties let's say I want to change
the name at the moment look at this for
this employee name is XYZ so let's go
ahead and change that to maybe ABC and
gender at the moment it is female so
let's change it to male and city is
Chennai let's change it to London and
now let's go ahead and execute this so
at the moment it is the name is XYZ but
we have changed that to ABC and we
executed this and even gender and city
we have changed so let's refresh this
page and see if the data is changed look
at that only gender and city are changed
but name you know is untouched okay so
it's possible to include and exclude
properties using interfaces as well so
there are several ways to include and
exclude properties from model binding
depending on the requirements and
project architecture we can choose the
approach that best fit our needs on the
