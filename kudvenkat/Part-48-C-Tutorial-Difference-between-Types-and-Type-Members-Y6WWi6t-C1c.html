linkit this is part 48 in this session
we'll understand the difference between
types and type members and we'll also
see how to organize the goal with
regions let's look at an example now in
this example you can see a class called
customer and within this class we have
three private fields ID first name last
name and to encapsulate these private
videos we have three public properties
ID first name last name and we also have
a simple method get full name which
returns its strength so what is this get
full name doing concatenate in the first
name field last name field with a space
in between them and returning the full
name of the customer okay now so in
short this customer class has got three
private fields three public properties
and one method and since these reside
within this class we can call them as
this class members on the other hand you
can also call them as this type members
okay
in general classes structures enums
delegates interfaces these are called as
types for example if you create an
instance in the customer class customers
c1 is equal to new customer c1 is an
instance of type customer so in general
your classes structures enums interfaces
delegates these are called as our types
and fields properties and methods which
usually reside in these types are called
as type members and it's very important
to understand the slight difference
between these two because most of the
articles on the internet refer to them
without actually telling what what they
mean by them okay
so understand this difference types and
type members types means your classes
structures in terms interface delegates
whereas type members means fields
properties constructors methods that
usually reside within these times
and in c-sharp there are five different
access modifiers private protected
internal protected internal and public
we will be talking about these access
modifiers and I'm very greeted in a very
great detail in the next session but
here the reason why I mentioned them is
because access modifier rules are
different for types and type members
okay
type members which are you field
properties constructors and methods can
have all the five different access
modifiers whereas the types themselves
can have only two of the five access
modifiers which are internal and public
you cannot have private protected and
protected internal on it type so if
you're creating a class structure enum
you cannot you know have the private or
protected or protected internal access
modifier for these classes or structures
or enums okay but as I told you we'll be
talking about access modifiers in a
great detail in the next session okay
another little feature that we have got
within Visual Studio is Fijians using
gradients you can actually organize your
code a little better okay so for example
if I want to collapse all my private
files into one region I can do that so
hash region fi eld s so to create a
region you use the hash symbol and the
region keyword and then followed by any
name that you want to give to your
region and then to specify that the
region ends here
you use end region and if you look at
that the moment we have done that it
gives us a little plus y plus sign and
you can nicely collapse that similarly
you for your public properties you can
have another region
so hash region properties and you can
end your region here
so properties region and there and
another region for methods and you can
end your method region so you can toggle
I mean you can actually collapse the
regions using that plus sign and it
looks a little clean okay so if you just
want to concentrate on your properties
you know that all properties are going
to reside in this region and look at
that when I move my mouse that the
intellisense choose me yeah you know in
that a little window showing all the
property similarly feels and the methods
okay and actually you can either do it
manually by collapsing this plus and
minus sign or you can actually make use
of the Visual Studio built-in feature so
you go to edit menu outlining and then
toggle all outlining so it automatically
expands one of them if they are expanded
and if you go to edit outlining toggle
or all outlining it will collapse
everything including your class alright
so using regions you can expand and
collapse sections of your code either
manually using the plus and minus signs
that appear next to the region name or
you can use Visual Studio edit menu of
lining and toggle all outlining on the
slide you can find resources for asp.net
and C sharp interview questions that's
it for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
