in this video we'll discuss controller
as syntax and angular this is
continuation to path 31 so please watch
but 31 before proceeding so far in this
video series we have used dollar scope
as a mechanism to make the members of
the controller available in the view let
me explain what I mean
let's flip to visual studio here I have
a new asp.net web application project to
this project I have added angular script
file an HTML file and a JavaScript file
within this JavaScript file you can see
some JavaScript code the first thing
that we are doing here is creating an
angular module and then we are creating
a controller function if you look at the
name of the controller function it is
main controller and into the controller
function we are injecting dollars cope
object and the reason we are doing that
here is because we want to make this
message property available in the view
so we are attaching it to the dollar
scope object now to access this message
property in the view let's go to the
view so within this HTML page let's say
we have this h1 element and on this h1
element I am going to specify
ng-controller directive the name of the
controller is main controller and within
this HTML element we want to display the
message property to retrieve the message
property that the controller has made
available we use a binding expression
and then the name of the property so
let's save the changes and when we
reload this page look at that we see
that message property available in the
view hello angular so so far in this
video series we are being using this
dollar scope object as the mechanism to
make the members of the controller
available in the view there is another
way as well and that is by using
controller as syntax with controller as
index there is no need to inject the
dollar scope object into the controller
function so I can get rid of this dollar
scope object injection and then to
attach the message property we use this
keyword okay so that's the change that
is required within the
controller function and then within the
view we use the controller as Sendak so
here we used ng - controller directive
and we are specifying the name of the
controller followed by that we use the
ask keyword and then whatever Aaliyah's
you want to provide let's say we want to
give it an alias of main controller main
ctrl so this is a reference pointing to
an instance of the main controller and
to access the message property that this
controller has made available all you do
is you use that reference main
controller and then dot message so let's
save the changes and when we reload this
page it should still continue to work
exactly the same way as before now let's
see how to use this controller as syntax
within the example that we have been
working with in the previous videos in
this series so let's flip to another
instance of registry that's running and
this is our demo project that we have
been working with so what we want to do
is use controller s and tags within this
project so the first change is going to
be within our script file so let's go to
script or J's file and here we have our
vengeance you know which we have used to
define routes so here we have specified
our controller so here controller home
controller as let's say we want to
access it using home ctrl so that's the
reference
similarly for courses controller it's
going to be horses ctrl and for students
controller it's going to be students
ctrl and for student details controller
let's make it student details ctrl
alright so that's the first change
within the venn function we're using the
controller as syntax and the next change
is obviously within the controller
functions themselves so with controller
as syntax there is no need to inject
order scope object so I can get rid of
that from the home controller and
then we use the disk keyword the same
idea with courses controller get rid of
the scope object and use this keyword
now if you look at students controller
and student details controller this is a
bit interesting here because within the
control of using dollar HTTP dot cat and
then here we have our then function and
here we are attaching students property
to the dollar scope object first of all
again we don't need to inject dollar
scope so I'm going to get rid of that
but then I can't use this keyword in
then function directly like this and
it'll explain the reason why in just a
bit for now let's include this keyword
there and see how the app is going to
behave so the same idea with student
details controller let's get rid of
dollar scope object and include this
keyword here all right so that's the
change within the controller functions
themselves now we need to make changes
to the views also the partial templates
also so let's first go to courses dot
HTML so now the alias four courses
controller is courses ctrl which we have
specified right here so within our
controller as syntax courses ctrl so
we'll have to use that to access courses
property so courses controller dot
courses and the same idea with home so
home ctrl dot message and student
details same idea student details dot
student details
ctrl dot student dot ID and so on and so
forth for the rest of the properties so
let's go to our script file and copy the
student details ctrl and then within our
student details we specify student
detail ctrl dot student ID student
details ctrl dot student dot name same
idea with gender and city
all right and finally students and for
students it is students ctrl alright so
those are the changes required let's
save all these changes and let's
navigate to our index dot HTML so now we
are using controller ads and X so we are
on the home page and the home page is
working the same way as before let's go
to courses courses are working the same
way let's go to students and look at
that students is not working as expected
and that's because we're using this
keyword so if we go to our script or J's
file so if you look at students
controller function so the controller
function is actually making an HTTP GET
call to a web service and then we have
our den function here within the den
function we're using this keyword so
here this keyword is actually pointing
to the window object when the control
comes into this den function this
keyword here is actually pointing to the
window object and not to an instance of
this control and that's why you know
it's not working as expected so to make
this work what we have to do is within
the controller function here I'm going
to create a variable I'm going to call
it VM standing for view model so
basically whatever we are specifying
here that's a model for the view so
that's why people generally prefer to
name this variable view model because
it's essentially that so variable view
model equals this so now at this point
it is pointing to an instance of this
controller and then we can use this VM
variable to attach whatever properties
we want to attach that we want to make
available in the view so now instead of
using this keyword here we can use VM
and now this should work
same idea within our student details
controller so first I'm going to create
a variable here I'm going to call it V M
equals
and then we use VM Dot student so let's
save those changes and let's go ahead
and reload this page let's actually save
all the changes and let's reload this
page and look at that student work and
when we go to student details that work
as well so here we're using the dollar
scope object with dollar scope object we
need to inject it into the controller
function and then we attach members to
it that we want to make available in the
view in the view we simply use a binding
expression and then use the property
name that we have attached to the scope
object and with controller as index
there is no need to inject the dollar
scope object we use this keyword to
attach the members that we want to make
available in the view and then within
the view itself we use controller a
syntax and then we use the reference of
the controller to access the properties
that we have made available in the
controller and when you have a call to a
function like this you know a web server
is called within that den function we
can't use this keyword like this and
that's because this here is actually
pointing to a window object and not to
an instance of this controller and
another important point to keep in mind
at the moment in a look at the very
using controller as syntax you know
wherever we are defining our controller
you know basically specifying our
controller
you know here is Vivier defining our
routes so here we are using controller
as syntax okay home controller as home
ctrl this is one way another way is by
using so the controller is home
controller and then we can use another
property here controller as and then you
can specify whatever you want to use as
the reference so we want to use home
ctrl
and the same idea goes here and now we
don't have to use as courses controller
we can use controller
as and then we can specify a courses
controller there
same idea here students controller
and finally our student details
controller
all right so let's save all those
changes and when we reload this page
everything should continue to work
exactly the same way as before in our
next video we'll discuss how this
controller as syntax can make our code
more readable when working with nested
scopes thank you for listening and have
a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
