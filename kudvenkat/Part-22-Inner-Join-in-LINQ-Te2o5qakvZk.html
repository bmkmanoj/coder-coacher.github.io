video we'll discuss in a join with this
group join in part 21 so please watch
bar 21 for proceeding with inner join
only the matching elements are included
in the result set for example let's say
we've got two collections collection one
and collection two and when we perform
an inner join then only the matching
elements between those two collections
are included in the result set
non matching elements are excluded from
the result set let's look at an example
let's flip to visual studio so here I
have a new console application all I
have done so far is added this
department and employee classes these
are the same classes that we worked with
in the previous session Department class
is not changed in any way notice that at
the moment this department class returns
three departments ID HR and payroll
employee class is changed slightly and
the changes I have removed the
department ID property from this last
employee object which means this
employee object is not having any
matching element within departments
collection and if you look at the rest
of the employees who are associated to
departments they are either associated
to department one on department - okay
this means no employee is associated
with department three this means this
department object is not having any
matching element with an employee's
collection now what we want to do is
perform an inner join between these two
collections so what is inner join going
to do it's going to retrieve only the
matching elements so only this nine
employee should be retrieved within the
result set and only these two
departments should be included right so
payroll department from departments
collection and and the employee object
from the employees collection will be
excluded from the result set so let's
see how to do that so first let's create
a variable called result to hold the
results of our join so what we want to
do is join the employees list where
departments list now we want to perform
an inner joint so we are going to make
use of join extension method in a
previous video session we discussed
group join and to perform a group join
we used group join extension method and
if you look at this join extension
method you know the parameters that we
have to pass to this method are very
similar to that you know what we have
passed group join so first of all we
need to specify the other sequence that
we want to join with this employee
sequence so the list of employees here
is also called as the outer sequence and
we want to join that sequence with list
of departments in this case list of
departments is going to be our inner
sequence and to get the list of
departments we use get all departments
static method and the next thing that we
need to specify is the outer key
selector so what is the outer sequence
here the outer sequence is list of
employees and within the employee class
what is the join key the join key is
department ID so we have to specify that
is at that edad department ID and now we
need to specify the inner key selector
so what is the inner sequence it's list
of departments and within department
class the join key is department ID
which is DDOT ID and the final parameter
is the result selector so what do you
want in the result within the result we
want
you know the employee name from employee
class and department name from
Department class okay so we just want
those two properties so what are we
going to get back you know where as a
result of this joint we are going to get
an employee object and a department
object so let's store them in variables
called employee and department and what
we want to do with these is in our
project employee name and Department
name properties into an anonymous type
so we are creating an anonymous type
here with properties employee name and
employee name where are we going to get
that from from this variable so employee
dot name similarly let's project the
other property Department name equals
Department dot name all right so now
this variable contains you know employee
name and the respective department name
all that is left is to use a for each
loop so for beach bar let's call the
variable employee in the query result
console dot readline employee dot name
let's print a tab space and then the
department name let's run this and
notice that we don't have andis record
and look at the department's we only get
ID and HR we don't have and on the
payroll department okay so only the
matching elements between two
collections that are trimmed here so
here we have used the extension methods
in textile now let's see how to rewrite
this query using sequel likes and that
but sequel like syntax we start the
query with prom so from e-n employee dot
get all employees so we want to join
employees with departments so join D in
department dot get all departments and
we need to specify the join condition
and we do that using the on keyword on e
dot department ID and we need to use
equals operator instead of double equals
so on a dot department ID equals d dot
ID and what we want to do is select a
new anonymous type and within the
anonymous type what are the properties
we want we want employee name and that
equals e dot name and we want another
property called department name and that
equals d dot name that's it let's run
this notice that we get the identical
output in our next video we'll discuss
the difference between group join and
inner joint that's it for today thank
you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
