in this video we'll discuss how to
implement transactions in ATO dotnet
first let's understand what is the
transaction a transaction ensures that
either all of the database operations
succeed or all of them fail this means
the job is never have done either all of
it is done or nothing is done let's
understand this with an example we'll be
using this accounts table in this demo
we have two account numbers to customers
and each customer has got 100 as the
balance now we want to design a web form
which is going to display the customer
account numbers there are names and the
balance and when we click this button we
want to transfer $10 from account a 1 to
account a 2 for this to happen we should
have to update statements happening
behind the scenes the first update
statement should deduct $10 from account
a 1 and the second update statement
should add that $10 to account a 2 so
for this transaction to be successful
both of the update statements should be
executed successfully now what do you
think is going to happen if the first
update statement executes successfully
and when the second update statement is
about to be executed let's say we've got
a problem and as a result it didn't
execute successfully now if you look at
the state of our transaction it's half
done right we directed $10 from account
a 1 but we did successfully credit that
to account a 2 now when we add the
balances of Pudi accounts it should be
200 but in this case it's going to be
190 so where is that $10 con we don't
have an answer so the data integrity is
lost there but transactions will ensure
that either both the update statements
in this case are going to succeed or if
one of them fails what the transaction
will do is roll back the change is done
by the first update statement so that
the data integrity is maintained so
let's see how to implement transactions
in a do dotnet so the first step here is
to create this table which I have
already done so here is the sequel
script to create the table
and this the data that we have at the
moment now let's flip to visual studio
so here we have a new empty asp.net web
application project all I have done so
far is included the connection string to
the database within web config file and
then I have also designed the webform so
here we have an HTML table where we are
displaying account number customer name
and balance and there are labels to
display you know that information and we
have a button here and a label to
display whether the transaction you know
is completed successfully or if it has
failed so let's double click on the
button control to generate that click
event handler and let's bring in the
aerial namespaces we need system dot
data system dot data dot sequel client
and system dot configuration and the
first thing that we need to do is write
code to retrieve data from the accounts
table so what I'm going to do here is
actually write a private function so
private void let's call this get data
and here the first thing that we need to
do is read the connection string from
web config file so we are going to make
use of configuration manager class and
the connection string name is CS dot
connection string so that should give us
the connection string the next step is
to actually create the sequel connection
object
and let's pass the connection string
that we have read from web config file
let's create our sequel command object
and what we want to do is retrieve all
the data that we have within accounts
table so select star from accounts table
and we want to use the connection object
that we have created to execute this
command so let's go ahead and open the
connection and let's create a sequel
data reader object and then execute our
command using execute leader method and
then let's use a while loop and then
loop through the results that we get
okay so what is this command going to do
at the moment we have just two rows in
the database table so it's going to
return us the two rows so let's use a
check here so if RDR so what are the
column names we have got account number
customer name and balance those are the
column names
so if RDR off account number dot to
string if that is equal to a 1
then what we want to do is in the first
set of label controls here we want to
display a one information so LBL account
number one dot text equals a 1 and
similarly lbr balance 1 dot text equals
RDR off what is the column name balance
let's display that in that label and
finally there will be our name 1 dot
text equals RDR off the name of the
column here is customer name so let's
copy that let's convert that to string
all right so if the account number is
not equal to a 1 then we know that we
have to populate the information for the
second account number so we have lvl
account number 2 and LBL balance two and
LVL name - all right
so pretty straightforward method here so
let's use this get data method and call
that within the page load event so if
not is postback then we want to call
this function so this is going to load
up the data so let's quickly run this
and make sure you know it loads data so
now when we click this button that's
when we want to transfer $10 from a1 to
a2 actually we need to change this to a
2 because if it's not a 1 then the
account number is going to be a 2 so
let's run this one more time just to
make sure you know it displays account
number si - all right now let's write
code to transfer $10 from a1 to a2
so to speed things up what I'm going to
do is actually copy this piece of code
and then within the button click event
we are going to paste that okay so we
are reading the connection string from
web config file we are creating a
connection object here we are going to
include our update statement so when we
click this button what should happen
first we should do that $10 from account
a1 you know that's the first update
statement and here is the sequel update
account set balance equals balance minus
10 where account number is equal to a-1
so that's going to be our sequel command
so Z equal command equals that and we
are going to use this connection object
right and we are opening the connection
and this is an update statement so we
are going to simply say execute non
query let's actually make this part of
try block okay and let's have a catch
block if there is an exception you know
it's going to reach into this cache
block all right now once this command is
executed we want to have another update
command so what I'm going to do is
actually copy these lines here and paste
them there since we have already opened
the connection we don't have to do that
again so here our second update command
is going to be this one so we want to
add $10 to account a 2 so let's copy
that update statement and specify that
right here all right
now if both of the statements execute
then we have a label control you know on
the web form and the ID of the label is
LBL message so within that label control
we want to say the transaction is
successful so LBL message dot text
equals let's say transaction successful
and let's also set you know it's full
color to that one to green so system dot
drawing dot color dot green okay now on
the other hand if there is any problem
executing this code then we know
something has gone wrong in which case
we want to say transaction failed maybe
and then maybe let's set the color to
red alright so with these changes now
this is a do dotnet code we are not
using transactions yet so let's go ahead
and run this now so we have the data now
let's go to transfer ten dollars now
transaction successful it doesn't update
the data here because we didn't call
that method so let's actually reload
look at that you know ten dollars is
successfully transferred to account a to
now let's do one thing after all this go
through you know we want to kind of call
get data method so that the data gets
reloaded into the page and let's
introduce you know an error condition
here
let's misspell the table name update
accounts one we don't have such a table
so this update statement is going to
execute successfully but then when it's
about to execute this update statement
there will be an exception at runtime
okay and at that point let's see what's
going to happen so if you look at the
state of the data at the moment you know
we've got ninety dollars within a one
and one hundred dollars within account a
two but the total sum is 200
let's rerun this page and then let's
click this button look at that it says
transaction fare but it managed to
detect ten dollars from account a one
but it didn't add that ten dollars to
account a two okay
so if we add these together 110 plus 80
it's 190 where did that $10 go now this
area dot net code that we have written
now it's not part of a transaction
that's why the job is half done here one
update statement is executed
successfully but not the other update
statement now anytime we click this
button we want both of these update
commands to be part of a single
transaction either both of them should
succeed or if one of them fails you know
we want to undo the changes done by the
first update statement so that the data
integrity is not lost so how do we make
these commands part of transaction
that's when we use sequel transaction
object so the first thing that we need
to do is create a sequel transaction
object sequel transaction let's call
this transaction equals now how do we
create sequel transaction object now we
use the begin transaction method of the
connection object and if you look at the
intellisense notice that this method
actually returns a sequel transaction
object so we use begin transaction
method to create an instance of
transaction object now what we want to
do with this transaction object we want
to make these two commands that is the
first sequel command and the second
sequel command both of them part of this
transaction let's actually move this
line to top here okay so we want to make
this command part of this transaction
and to do that if you look at the
overloaded versions of this sequel
command constructor
there is another overloaded version
where we can specify the transaction
right so here we have caught the
transaction object we're going to pass
that as a third parameter
here so now this command is tied of this
transaction along the same lines we want
to make this command also part of the
transaction and for that we are going to
pass the same transaction object as an
argument to the second command as well
okay now both of these commands command
1 and command do both of them a part of
the same transaction now you know if the
code reaches here then we know the
transaction has been completed
successfully in the sense both of the
update statements have executed
successfully in which case we want to
commit the transaction so we want to
make the changes permanent that's when
we call the commit method okay now when
we are executing this piece of code if
there at all if there is any problem
then it's going to go into this catch
block so that's when we want to roll
back the transaction so transaction
okay we have to define this object you
know outside the try block because if we
want that to be available in the catch
block then we have to do that so let's
take this and define it right there
actually let's move this connection
object also on to the top so we open the
connection and we begin the transaction
there all right so if there are any
problems then we roll back the
transaction all right
so with all these changes let's go and
run this piece of code but before that
let's actually undo this change right
here
so update accounts you know let's look
at the happy conditions first so
everything should work now so at the
moment the balance is 190 right so let's
go to and transfer $10 from a1 to a2
look at that 70 plus 120 it is another
balances of 190 which is as expected
transaction success for now let's
introduce an error so let's say update
accounts one and let's rerun this now
let's click this button look at that it
says transaction fail but you know it
didn't deduct $10 as well so it executed
the update statement and then when I try
to execute the second update statement
there was a problem so when there is a
problem what's going to happen it's
going to go to that catch block right
and then within the catch block we are
rolling back the transaction so this is
going to undo the changes done by the
first update statement that's how we are
maintaining the integrity of data here
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
