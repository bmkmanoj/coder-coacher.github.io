this video we'll discuss how to
implement autocomplete text box using
jQuery and asp.net here is what we want
to achieve this database table TBL
students is going to contain some
student data within an asp.net webforms
application we are going to have this
student name text box as we start to
type the name of the student we want
this text box to suggest all these
student names that are available in this
case notice that we have started to type
letter M and this text box is suggesting
all the student names that start with
letter M now instead of typing the
student full name we can actually select
the name that we are interested in from
these suggestions so let's see how to
implement this autocomplete feature in
an asp.net webforms application using
jQuery UI widget autocomplete so the
first step here is to create this
database table which I have already done
and here we've got the create table
script and this in subscript is going to
insert some test data
I've already executed the script and at
the moment within this students table
we've got 10 rows the next step is to
create a stored procedure which is going
to retrieve student name suggestions so
let's go and create that stored
procedure now I'm going to call this SP
get student names and the stored
procedure is going to have a parameter
I'm going to call this term and the data
type of this is going to be an ver care
as Big M and so what do we want the
stored procedure of it to do we want to
select name column from TBL students
table their name like whatever is the
input parameter that we are passing and
to that I'm going to append this
wildcard percentage so that's going to
execute this true procedure okay now for
example if we pass letter m to the
stored procedure then this stored
procedure should return as all these
student names that start with letter M
so what's going on here so this
em you know whatever we type here will
be passed to this parameter and look at
this here we are retrieving all the name
column values from TBL students table
where name like at term so in this case
like M percentage so give me all the
student names that start with letter M
so for example if I pass ma then it
should only written as all the names
that start with ma so we should get only
three now okay
so I've got this true procedure now
let's go ahead and flip to visual studio
here I have an asp.net webforms
application within the web config file I
have included a connection string to our
sample DB database which contain our TBL
students table so the next step is to
add a generic handler to this project
okay and I'm going to call so within
this add new item dialog box select the
generate canula and I'm going to call
this student handler so what is this
handler going to do it's going to
retrieve the student data for us from
the database table TBL students so
within this process request function
within the student handler class so this
enhanced from I HTTP handler class I
mean interface and it has got this
function process request which we need
to implement so basically this function
is going to retrieve the data from the
database table and return those student
suggestions okay so we are going to
write some a do dotnet code here let's
bring in the a do dotnet namespaces we
need system dot configuration we need
system dot data we need a system dot
data dot
seek for client and we also need a
system dot web dot script dot
serialization because we are going to
serialize the data to adjacent format
using this JavaScript serializer
all right so the first thing that we are
going to do here within this process
request function is to create a variable
of type string and I'm going to call
this term and what is this going to it's
going to make use of this context object
so this context object has got request
parameter and I'm going to request for a
queries
rain that has this name term in a bit
you will understand where this query
string is coming from now if we have a
query string with that name we want to
use that value store that value in this
variable otherwise if it is null for
some reason then store empty string in
this variable in a bit you'll understand
you know how we are going to use this
variable alright so the next step is to
create a string variable and I'm going
to call the CS connection string and we
are going to read the connection string
from web config file using the
configuration manager class the name of
the connection string is DB CS and we
want the connection string value okay
and using that connection string I'm
going to create a sequel connection
object let's call this con and we are
going to use the connection string that
we have just create read from web config
file okay the next thing that we are
going to do is create a sequel command
object and using this sequel command
object we are actually going to execute
this tool procedure that we have created
SP get that student names and we are
going to execute this command object
using this sequel connection object
since this command object is executing a
stored procedure we have to tell that to
the command object using the command
type property and this stored procedure
also has got a parameter and input
parameter so we need to create that and
associate it with the command object so
command object dot parameters dot add
and what do we want to add we want to
add a new sequel parameter object so let
me go ahead and create that create a new
sequel parameter object and let's
populate the two required properties the
name of the parameter so parameter name
what is the name of the parameter we
called it at term so let's copy that and
specify it here and where is the value
going to come for this this is going to
come from this variable okay
so let's pass that so we have created
the parameter associated it with the
command object
now let's go ahead and open the
connection and let's execute the command
as a command dot execute reader and
whatever result we get let's do that in
sequel data Reader object let's call it
RDR while RDR dot read so we are looping
through each row what do we want to do
we want to create a list of student
names so I'm going to create here a list
variable so list of string let's call
this list student names equals new list
of string so while we are looping
through each row that this is command
dot execute reader okay so we are going
to get the reader object as we are
looping through each row then what we
want to do we want to add to the student
names list the name of the student
so RDR and this is going to contain name
column so retrieve the name column value
and add it to the list okay
so by the time this code finishes we
have all the student names added to that
list okay now what if you want to do we
want to create an instance of JavaScript
serialize it class and this object has
gods he realized function and we are
going to serialize the list of student
names to JSON format and whatever we
have serialized we want to write that to
the response stream so I'm going to
again use this context parameter that's
coming into this function so context dot
response dot right we won't write the
JSON object JSON string okay so we have
our handler function which is going to
talk to the database and retrieve the
data
okay so let's go ahead and quickly test
our student handler okay so I'm going to
run this and let's navigate to student
handler dot shx so look at this in this
case you know we don't have that
term querystring right they are not
passing the term query string to this
handler right as a result what happens
we are passing an empty string so when
we pass an empty string that gets passed
that empty string gets passed to this
stored procedure SP get student names
and what happens when we pass an empty
string it's going to return us all the
student names from the database okay and
that's what we are getting here now for
example if we pass in our term query
string and if I pass letter M is the
value for that query string look at that
now we only get student names that start
with letter M if I pass for example M AR
for look at that in our names that start
with M AR all right so our handler is
working is expected now let's go ahead
and add a webform to a project and let's
name it wave from one dot aspx and here
let's actually include this little text
student name and I'm going to include an
asp.net text box here let's give it an
ID let's call it txt name so this is
going to be our name text box into which
we type the student name and the
important thing here is within our head
section we have to the first thing that
we need to do is include this script
file you know this is our jQuery file
jQuery script file now in addition to
that we need the jQuery UI and
JavaScript files so we want to use the
jQuery autocomplete widget so now in
order to get that navigate to jQuery UI
dot-com website and here on this website
you cannot actually find all the jQuery
UI widgets so here we have a Cardian
autocomplete but on date picker etc okay
so we're going to see how this
autocomplete widget is going to work
we're going to use this in asp.net
webforms application so now on this
website when you actually clear
on this download button it will take you
to their download page and at the moment
notice this we've got this checkbox
toggle all so all the UI widgets all of
them are selected okay now for some
reason within your production
application if you want to just use the
autocomplete widget then there is no
reason why you want to download the
source code CSS and images of all the
vidiots right so in that case what you
can do is customize this download so you
can uncheck this and then check only the
widgets and competence that you need so
in this case if we just need
autocomplete so I can select that and
all the dependencies will be
automatically checked for us and then
once you click download you know only
the source code that is the jQuery code
CSS and image is required for that
component will be downloaded in case if
you want all of them you know check this
box toggle also it's going to select all
of them and once we click this download
all it's going to download the required
files I've already done this and
downloaded this zip file
once you extract within the folder you
will have several jas CSS and HTML files
and images folder as well so within the
images folder they've got all the images
that the widgets require and here we
have the minified and non minified
versions of CSS and JavaScript files if
it's a production app then probably use
your minified versions because they are
smaller in size so they're optimized if
it's for your development purpose then
use the normal minified versions for
easy debugging so within my project you
know here the asp.net webforms
application we are going to implement
the autocomplete widget right so all you
need here is three things so you need
you know the jQuery UI
javascript file jQuery UI CSS file and
the images okay
so I've already done this so I've copied
them and paste it into our asp.net
webforms application so we have the
jQuery UI jQuery I mean CSS file and the
jQuery UI J is file and I also have the
images folder within our web form one
dot aspx at the moment we only have
roughly
the jQuery file script file in addition
to that we also need the jQuery UI J's
file we need the jQuery UI CSS file so
those are the three things we need and
let's include another script section
here so script type equals text slash
JavaScript and dollar document dot ready
okay so we want to use autocomplete
feature so we want to use that
autocomplete feature with this text box
txt name that's the ID so let's find
this text box with that ID so dollar
find the text box eye by ID and the ID
that we are looking for is txt name and
let's copy that and look at this on this
I can actually call autocomplete so
that's a function that we are calling
and look at what this function expects
it expects some options to be passed
okay and if you want to see what those
options are you also have the jQuery UI
documentation available so if you click
on API documentation it will take you to
another page where you can find the
documentation of all these UI widgets
okay so if you want to find for example
autocomplete you can search for that so
autocomplete widget and look at this
here are all the options that you can
use and look at the source option so
basically you'll have to set the source
option so this is going to contain the
suggestions that we want to display
within that name text box in this case
okay so we will talk about the source in
detail in a later video session for now
we are going to set the source option
and we are going to set that using a
Jake JavaScript object so I'm going to
set source to our handler okay student
handler dot shx so the name of the
handler in this case is student
a sh X so this is all the code that it
requires so what is this handler going
to do this is going to written as the
student name suggestion so what is going
to happen now let's go ahead and run
this so here look at this as I type
letter M look at that we get all these
additions that start with letter M
similarly for example when ice type
letter a look at that and as I continue
to type look at that you know whatever
suggestions that match the characters
you know those are displayed for example
if you type letter R look at that we get
that list so what's happening here now
when I type letter R for example here
what's going to happen is this
autocomplete this is going to call this
student handler dot a sh X and it's
going to pass you know that letter that
we have typed in this case R - you know
this handler using a query string so
what's good what it's going to do is
call the student Handler and then append
a query string so student handler dot a
say it checks question mark term equals
whatever we type into the text box in
the text box we have type letter R so
that R will be passed you know using
that query string to the handler and
what are we doing
within that with that query string
within this handler we're actually
reading that query string value and we
are passing that to the store procedure
stored procedure is executed and
whatever the names that match you know
that start with that letter I return
back and then those are displayed as as
the suggestions within this text box so
here is the handler code here is the web
form HTML ng query code thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
