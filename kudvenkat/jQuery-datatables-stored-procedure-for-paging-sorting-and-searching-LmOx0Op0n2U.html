tutorial in this video well this is
implementing a stored procedure that can
perform paging sorting and searching and
this is how we are going to use that
short procedure we'll be using that with
jQuery data tables plug-in there are
several ways to load database data into
a jQuery data table if your data set is
small then we can load all data at once
and the jQuery data table plug-in is
going to perform all the processing on
the client side by processing I mean
paging sorting filtering etc on the
other hand if your data set is huge that
is if you have millions of rows in your
table then it does not make any sense
from a performance standpoint to load
all the data at once instead we want to
be loading only the correct subset of
data for example if your page size is 10
then we want to load only those 10 rows
from those millions of rows that we have
in the table so all the heavy lifting
should be done by the stored procedure
on the server and once we retrieve that
correct subset that you create table
plug-in is simply going to display that
on the page so in this video let's
discuss how to create that stored
procedure which can do all that heavy
lifting and in our subsequent video
we'll discuss creating a generic asp.net
Handler that's going to call that stored
procedure and retrieve data and this
generate handler is going to convert
that data to a JSON format and in that
video after that we'll discuss how to
consume that data using jQuery data
tables plug-in and display it on the
page so let's go ahead and pair that
procedure we'll be using this table TBL
employees to do that and if you notice
this table has got five columns I've
already created this table and here's
the create table script and this script
is going to insert some test data now
let's go ahead and create that procedure
so create procedure let's call this SP
get employees and this stirred procedure
is going to have a few input parameters
at display length so basically this is
going to specify what is your page size
do you want 10 rows 15 rows 20 rows
this is going to be of type integer at
display start so this is going to tell
us at which record do we want to start
fetching rows and at short column so
this parameter will tell what is the
column by which you want to sort data
and this is going to be of type integer
because we are not going to pass the
column name instead we will be passing
the column index number so for ID it is
zero first name one last name too so on
and so forth so we will be passing the
column number and sort direction so we
need to know whether we want to sort
data in ascending or descending order so
this is going to be of type and we're
care length ten characters and finally
we are going to include another
parameter search and again this is going
to be of type and we're care but let's
set the size to 255 and I'm going to
default that to a null value in case if
we don't specify a value for that
parameter now if you look at the jQuery
data table plug-in here notice that you
have the search text box now you know
it's possible that the end user may not
type anything into the search text box
in that case you know search parameter
will be now so that's the reason we are
setting that to now on the other hand if
they have typed something into the
search text box then we will be passing
that to the stored procedure okay as
begin and I'm going to declare two more
variables within the stored procedure
the first one I'm going to call that
first record and this is going to be of
type integer and another variable is
going to be last record the type is
going to be integer now let's initialize
those variables set at first record
equals at display start so for example
if we pass zero as the value for display
star that means we want to start at row
1 so we will pass 0 so we are
initializing at first record to display
start and in our condition we'll say
where for example row number greater
than at first record so it's going to
start at row one okay and let's
initialize last record at last record
equals at display start plus at display
length so if display start is zero and
if the page size that is if display
length is 10 0 plus 10 10 is 10 so first
record will be you know 0 but you know
where clause will say where you know row
number is greater than first record so
it's going to start from 1 and where row
number is less than or equal to last
record so greater than 0 and less than
or equal to 10 so it's going to give us
the first set of 10 records right so now
we are going to make use of CT common
table expression we discussed common
table expressions in detail and sequel
server video tutorial so if you're new
to common table expressions please watch
that video from sequel server tutorial
so let's create a CTE so I'm going to
call the CTE underscore employees as so
our CD begins there and ends there so
what do we want to do we want to select
so I'm going to use row number function
to produce row numbers for each of the
rows that we are going to retrieve and
I'm going to use / so that's the syntax
for row number / and we want to order
the data by the sort column that the
user has specified okay so order by and
to specify the order by I'm going to use
case statement because depending on the
sort column that we care we want to
order by that column so case when at
short column if that is equal to 0 and
at sort direction if that is equal to
ascending then what do we want to do if
short column is 0 then that means we
want to sort by the first column ID so
we want to sort by ID and I am going to
end the case statement and specify we
want to sort in ascending order because
sort Direction is ascending order so I
am going to make a copy of this put a
comma and again when short column is 0
and if the sort direction is descending
then we still want to sort by ID column
and we want to sort it in descending
order so we have done that just for ID
column we need to do it for the rest of
columns first name last name gender and
job title in the interest of time I have
already typed these case statements so
let's copy them from the notepad I have
here look at this they're pretty
straightforward so this set of case
statements here are for column 1 so
column 1 is first name and this to of a
column 2 that is last name for gender
and for job title ok so instead of you
watching me typing I'm going to copy and
paste them those case statements here so
we have all those case statements so our
case statement ends there and if you
look at this closing brace you know
that's the matching one for this opening
brace right here so we want to order by
depending on the column that the user
has specified and what are we retrieving
here we're actually selecting we are
sorting by the you know column v the
user has specified and we are actually
producing your row number so we want to
give an earlier as a column name for
that row number so I'm going to say as
row number so let's call that row number
and we also want the total number of
rows so I'm going to use count
of star as over as let's call this total
count
okay so we're retrieving the total
number of rows as well and then what
else we want we want all the other
columns that is ID first name last name
gender and job title columns so let's
specify them let's include actually from
Plus first so we get some intelligence
so from TBL employees so what do we want
we want ID we want first name we want
last name we want gender and we want job
title from TBL employees okay now at the
moment we have only specified sorting we
also need to specify filtering right so
we specify that in the where clause
where remember this search parameter can
be now right if the user does not enter
anything in the search text box then
that parameter will be none so in the
where clause here we are going to say
add search is now
or ID so ID column is again in our TBL
employee table so I D like percentage to
that
let's append whatever the user has
passed us and let's close the wild card
the percentage we have to do that for
all the columns basically because you
know whatever you search here we have to
check if that word is present in any of
the rows heidi first in last in gender
job title so we have to do the same
thing for all the columns in the table
so let's make a few copies of this so or
first name similarly or last name gender
and finally job title and the ver clause
is going to end there and our CTE is
ending here and what do we want to do
now our CD contains you know these
original columns from the underlying
table TBL employees plus the rule number
and the total count of rows in that
result set so what do we want to do we
want to select all those roles from CTE
underscore employees so at the moment
what have we done we have done sorting
we have done filtering now all that is
left is paging and we are going to do
paging with these two variables at first
record and at last record and if you
look at the CT it has got row number as
well so I'm going to specify where
clause here where row number greater
than at first record and row number less
than or equal to at last record all
right so that's all let's go ahead and
create this procedure so the procedure
is created successfully let's go ahead
and test or procedure so if this play
length is 0 let's say I want rows from
you know first row so
basically display length is going to be
ten let's say we want to display ten
rows and display start I want from the
first row so display start is going to
be zero and we want to sort by first
column that is ID column so I'm going to
specify short column as zero because
that's an integer and sort direction
let's say we want to sort data in
ascending order and search I'm not going
to specify any value for the parameter
and that's fine because we have
defaulted it to now so if you don't pass
a value it's going to default to now and
look at this look at the ID column now
you know we get rows from one to ten and
how many total rows we have we have in
the table fourteen rows order fourteen
rows we are retrieving ten rows 1 to 10
because the display length is 10 the
page size is 10 and look at that the
data is sorted by ID in ascending order
on the other hand if I specify the sort
direction as descending and when we
execute this look at that I get from 14
to 5 now the data is sorted in
descending order of ID column right
let's say we want to sort data in
ascending order of first name column
first name column is an index position
so if you look at the table here first
name is an index position 1 so when I
specify you know sort column as 1 then
now the data should be sorted by first
name look at that it's sorted by first
name now we haven't specified any search
criteria let's go ahead and specify
search criteria let's say I want all
female employees so that's our search
string that the user has typed in the
search text box let's go and execute
that look at that we get all the four
you know female employees from our table
look at the total count is 4 and the
data is sorted by you know column 1
column 1 its first name look at that the
data is sorted we get only the female
employees and there are 4 rows ok and
look at the row number it's from 1 to 4
so this is our stool procedure in our
next video we'll discuss how to consume
the stored procedure using a generic
asp.net Handler thank you for listening
