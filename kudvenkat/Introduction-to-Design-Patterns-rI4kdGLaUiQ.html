technologies my name is a wish and this
is part one of the design patterns
tutorial in this session we will learn
water design patterns evolution of
design patterns and the three types of
design patterns in many interviews you
might have encountered a lot of
questions about interfaces abstract
classes delegates and other features
related to object-oriented programming
along with the design patterns related
questions design pattern solutions are
evolved from the features of
object-oriented programming once you
understand the design patterns it makes
you very comfortable in attending any
interviews as well as it helps you in
applying these features in your projects
or applications we should note the point
that implementing design patterns and
applications are proven and tested
writing the code aligning with design
patterns will make your applications
reliable scalable and easily
maintainable so now let's understand
what our design patterns design patterns
are reusable solutions to the problems
that we encountered in the day-to-day
programming they are generally targeted
at solving the problems of object
generation and integration in other
words design patterns acts as templates
which can be applied to the real world
programming problems let's talk about
the history and evolution of design
patterns the four authors of the book
famously known as Gang of Four are the
ones who brought the concepts of design
patterns in their book elements of
reusable object-oriented software Gang
of Four has divided the book into two
parts with first part explaining about
the pros and cons of object-oriented
programming and second part describes
the evolution of 23 classic software
design patterns from then Gang of Four
design patterns has made a significant
role in the software development
lifecycle the first publication date of
the book was during the end of Eni
in 94 for more details please refer to
the listed Wikipedia article below now
let's understand the types of design
patterns gang of food have created the
design patterns into three types based
on different problems encountered in the
real-time applications they are
creational structural and behavioral
design patterns let's now talk about the
creational design pattern creational
design pattern deals with object
creation and initialization creational
pattern gives the program more
flexibility in deciding which objects
need to be created for a given case
singleton Factory and abstract Factory
are some of the examples of the
creational design pattern second type of
design pattern is structural design
pattern post creational design pattern
this pattern deals with class and object
composition in simple words this pattern
focuses on decoupling interface
implementation of classes and its
objects adapter facade and bridge are
some of the examples of structural
design pattern now that you know how to
create and structural objects and
classes we need to understand how we
control the behavior of these objects
behavior design pattern needs with the
communication between classes and
objects chain of responsibility command
and interpreter are some of the examples
of behavior design patterns we will be
taking a deep dive into all of these
design patterns in the next tutorials
with simple examples please note the
point that it's very important to have
basic knowledge about the
object-oriented concepts like
abstraction inheritance polymorphism
encapsulation interfaces classes and
abstract classes before proceeding to
the next part of the tutorial in part 2
we will focus on the singleton design
pattern in detail with a simple example
if you have any feedback or questions
related to the tutorial please feel free
