questions video series in this video
will answer this interview question why
and when should we use an abstract class
this interview question could also be
asked in a slightly different way give
an example of where we could use an
abstract class interfaces and abstract
classes or complex subjects if we answer
the questions related to them properly
in an interview chances are the
interviewer may get very good impression
about you and in the subsequent
questions even if we make slight
mistakes the interviewer may be happy to
forgive you at least in the interviews
that I do I would definitely ask
questions related to interfaces and
abstract classes so in this video let's
try an answer this question why use
abstract classes with an example let's
say in an organization there are two
types of employees full-time employee
and contract employee first let's design
full-time employee class so here I have
a blank console application so first
let's go ahead and add a class file and
let's call it full-time employee and to
speed things up I have already provided
the implementation for full-time
employee class so let's copy and paste
that class definition within this file
so if you look at this class this is
very straightforward we've got four auto
implemented properties here ID first
name last name an annual salary and we
have got two methods get a full name
which is going to return the full name
of the employee by concatenating the
first name and last name with the space
in between them and we have another
method here which is going to compute
monthly salary so how do we compute the
monthly salary divide annual salary by
twelve so very straightforward class now
let's go ahead and design the other type
of employee which is contract employee
so let's add another class file to this
project
and let's call this contract employee
dot C s and to speed things up I'm going
to copy this definition and paste it
within contract employee a and change it
as required let's make this class public
okay so even if it's contract employee
he is still going to have ID first name
last name but a contract employee will
not have annual salary instead they will
have hourly pay so public and overly pay
and then number of hours worked so let's
call this maybe total hours okay and to
get the monthly salary of a contract
employee how would we get that multiply
the hourly pay by total hours that's
going to give us the monthly salary so
this dot total hours into this dot
hourly pay so that should give us the
monthly salary of a contract employee
now if we have to use these classes
within program dot CS file we have the
main method so we would create an
instance of our full-time employee class
so full-time employee FTE equals in two
new full-time employee and then
obviously there are several properties
OID equals let's say one zero one
first-name equals let's say Mark and
lastname equals mark May and annual
salary may be 60,000 okay now we have
full-time employee and if we want to
print their details console dot readline
full-time employee dot get full name
should give us
the full name and similarly to get their
annual salary will simply say get I mean
monthly salary get monthly salary okay
and let's plant a dotted line okay so in
a similar fashion let's go ahead and
create an instance of our part-time
employee
I mean contract employee as well so
contract employee let's call it CDE
equals new contract employee contract
employee has got an ID let's say a di D
is 1 0 2 first name is Sarah and let's
say Sarah s is the LA S is the last name
and contract and what you will not have
annual salary instead there will be
overly pay let's say however Li pay is
200 and total hours he worked in a month
is maybe 40 and let's plant the full
name of the contract employee and the
total I mean monthly salary of the
contract employee so let's go ahead and
run this now and see what is the output
we get look at that marked May is the
full name of the employee and his
monthly salary is 5,000 because his
annual salary is 60,000 so when you
divide that by 12 we get 5,000 and Sarah
s is the full name and his how monthly
salary is 8,000 all right so this is
working the program is working as
expected but what is the problem with
this design so if you look at these two
classes you know these two classes are
definitely related you know both of them
are of type employee and if you look at
these two classes there's a lot of
common code between them for example ID
first name last name properties are same
in both the classes and similarly get
full name whether you know the employee
is a full-time employee or contract
employee you would compute the full name
in the same way but concatenated their
first name and last
name look at that the implementation is
exactly the same the only thing that's
different between these two classes is
full-time employee has got annual salary
property contract employee has got these
two properties in addition hourly pay
and total hours work and then the
implementation of get monthly salary is
slightly different between these two
classes otherwise they are almost
identical okay so since we have a lot of
duplicated code here the code
maintainability will be a problem
because tomorrow if we want to introduce
middle name property we have to do it
for both the classes because
irrespective of whether you are a
full-time employee or a contract
employee you may have a middle name and
in order to compute the full name we may
have to again introduce that middle name
within you know the get full name method
of both the classes now here we are only
have two related classes but in reality
depending on the types of objects that
you are creating you may have several
different related classes you know maybe
with this example we may have something
called part-time employee or director
employee you know things like that
so if we have more related classes then
you know the number of places that we
have to make changes is going to grow as
well and that is error-prone and number
too time-consuming so code
maintainability is going to be a big
issue if we duplicate code like this so
how are we going to solve this problem
so here these two classes are related
there's common functionality between
them and that common functionality is
duplicated between them okay so how are
you going to get rid of that duplicated
problem okay
divide these issues I mean this
duplicated code issue what we can do is
we can move that common functionality
into a base class okay and then we can
make these two classes inherit from that
base class but if we have to design a
base class for these two classes then
the obvious next question is going to be
should we design that base class
as an abstract class or as a concrete
class that is a non abstract class
first let's design it as a concrete
class and see what are the problems that
we are going to face and then we'll try
and use an abstract class okay
so what I'm going to do now is add
another class file and call this maybe
base employee dot CS and let's first
make this class public and we are going
to move the common code that is look at
this if you look at full-time employee
we've got ID first name last name you
know that's the common piece of code so
I'm going to take those three properties
and move them into base employee class
and I'm also going to take get full name
method and move that into pace employee
class okay so now if you look at this
full-time employee class it's very
simple it only has you know the code
that is relevant to full-time employee
or that is specific to full-time
employee okay in it then what I'm going
to do is make this full-time employee
class inherit from base employee ok so
that way this class is going to get ID
first name last name properties and get
full name method as well in a similar
fashion I'm going to make this contract
employee class and head it from base
employee class and since in the base
employee we already have ID first name
last name I'm going to get rid of those
properties and we need to retain these
properties because they are specific to
contract employee class and we can get
rid of this get full name method because
that's already available in the base
class but let's leave this get monthly
salary because you know we implement
that method differently in these two
classes ok so now if you look at this
class ok the base
let's get full name let's also introduce
here get monthly salary method so public
and get monthly salary now
let's mark it as virtual method okay
because the base employee class doesn't
know how to provide the implementation
for contract employee and full-time
employee it's the responsibility of the
derived classes to do that so that's the
reason why we are marking it as virtual
and we are going to throw and not
implement it exception so okay so very
straightforward base class here and put
in the derived classes what we are going
to do is override get monthly salary and
provide the implementation specific to
that class so similarly let's overwrite
that here all right
so let's build a solution and look at
that our program still compiles and when
I run this it's going to work in the
same way but what did we achieve here we
have moved all the common code into the
base class so tomorrow if we have to
introduce full-time I mean middle name
property we can do that only within the
base class and it will be available to
all the derived classes so code
maintainability is going to be much
easier okay but then by creating a non I
mean by creating an on abstract class
that is a concrete class you know we
have introduced another problem here
because look at this in our organization
we only have two types of employees
contract employee and full-time employee
so in the main method if you look at the
code we are creating an instance of
full-time employee and contract employee
and we are using it the baby one two
okay but then here since base employee
is created as a concrete class there is
nothing stopping us from creating an
instance of pays employee class because
that I can create you know base employee
e equals new base employee and then I
can initialize you know the properties
1:03 let's say first name equals regime
lastname equals Tec okay so here
basically we have created an instance of
base employee class and then we can
still use console dot readline base
employee dot get full name and similarly
base employee dot get monthly salary
okay now what do you think is the
problem going to be with this code when
we compile this look at this when I
build the solution on the status bar
build succeeded we didn't get any
compiler error but then we actually
learn this we are going to get an
exception
why that's because if you look at get
monthly salary in the base employee
class you know this class doesn't know
how to implement that so that's why it's
throwing not implemented exception so
when we run this program we are going to
get that exception at runtime okay
that's one problem another problem is
our organization only has two types of
employees full-time employee contract
employee there's nothing called base
employee it's only an abstract concept
since we want our common functionality
to be present in the base class we move
that common functionality to the base
employee class but we don't have
anything like pays employee within an
organization so we don't want developers
inadvertently creating an instance of
base employee class and using it like
this so we want them we want to prevent
them from doing that since we have
designed that class has a non abstract
class that is a concrete class you know
we are not able to stop the developers
from doing this okay so that is the
problem with using a
non abstract base classes here okay so
now to prevent this runtime problem you
know we can definitely achieve that by
simply removing this virtual method from
the base employee class and then within
respective classes I can get rid of this
override keyword now since we do not
have get monthly salary within the base
employee you know we cannot invoke that
method so I can delete that line so if I
run this the program is going to work
look at that resume Tech is the full
name that's fine but we still have that
other problem we don't want developers
to be creating instances of base
employee class we don't have such
employees within the organization and we
don't want to be doing that so to
prevent developers from creating
instances of this base employee class
what we need to do simply mark this
class as abstract so since we have
marked this as an abstract now look at
that we already have a compiler error
and if I hover my mouse over that let's
quickly look at that cannot create an
instance of the abstract class base
employee okay so that is the advantage
of using abstract classes okay so it's
preventing us from accidentally creating
instances of base employee class I can't
even compile now so we get a compiler
data which is a very good thing okay so
let's get rid of this code now let's
comment that now another modification
that I'm going to do look at this if I
run this it's going to work in the same
way so we have full-time employee there
and contract employee there okay now
another modification that I'm going to
make to this base abstract classes I'm
going to introduce this get monthly
salary method within the base employee
class so let's actually copy the full
signature
and I'm going to make this abstract
method so if we make the method abstract
we don't have to provide the
implementation okay only the declaration
and within the derived classes we are
going to provide the implementation by
overriding it okay so let's go ahead and
run this and see if it works in the same
way so it's going to work in the same
way but why are we introducing this
abstract method went into the space
employee that's because the advantage we
get by introducing this method as an
abstract method is that all the derived
classes now are forced to provide the
implementation forget monthly salary
method okay because this contract
employee class is in a heading from base
employee and base employee has got this
abstract method so contract employee has
to provide implementation for that
method otherwise look at what's going to
happen we will get a compilation error
again that's a very good thing because
if you have different types of employees
contract employee full-time employee may
be another type of employee called
part-time employee any type of employee
should have a salary okay so that's why
you know when you include you know this
abstract method get monthly salary in
the base class it's going to force all
the derived types to provide
implementation that way we are not going
to provide I mean some functionality to
you know employee related classes all
right
so in short we would create an abstract
class when we want to move the common
functionality of two or more related
classes into a base class and when we do
not want that base class to be
instantiated so in this case what did we
do we move the common functionality of
full-time employee and contract employee
into the common base class
you know base employee and we made that
abstract because we don't want
developers to accidentally be creating
instances of that base employee abstract
class now
you know if your requirement is such
that if you want you know the capability
of instantiating the base class then you
would do normal inheritance there and
you would not mark the base class as an
abstract class okay but then in short
this is the answer we would create an
abstract class when we want to move the
common functionality of two or more
related classes into a base class and
when we do not want that base class to
be instantiated so here is our base
abstract class and the two derived
classes that's it to today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
