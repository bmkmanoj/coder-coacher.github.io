this video we'll discuss passing data
from master page to content page
this is continuation to part 148 way we
discussed passing data from content page
to master page so please watch part 148
before proceeding and this is what we
want to achieve in this video notice
that we have got a search text box in
the search button in the master paid now
when we enter a search term and then
once we click the search button then we
want to display all the students who
have got that search term in their name
and then display them within the grid we
control on the content page so basically
we are passing this search term from the
master page to the content page and when
we click the search button that's
present on the master page that's when
we want the search functionality to be
triggered let's see how to achieve this
first let's implement this search
interface within the master page let's
flip to visual studio so this is our
master page that we have been working
with so let's first of all include a
panel control within the master page
header and let's call this panel control
panel search and within the panel
control we want text search we want that
to be bolded so let's include that
inside a bold tag and then let's include
a text box control and then a button
control
and let's change the ID of the textbox
or two to txt search and button - BTN
search and within the code-behind file
of this master page let's include a
property that's going to return the
panel control and the property has to be
public so since we are returning a panel
control that return type has to be panel
and let's call the property itself as
search panel and let's include just the
get accessor and let's return the panel
control and what is the ID of the panel
search panel I mean panel search
similarly let's include another public
property that's going to return the
search button itself so since we are
returning a button here the return type
is going to be button and let's call the
property as search button in a bit we'll
see how we are going to make use of
these properties on the content page so
return this dot BTN search and let's
include one more property which is going
to return the search term that we typed
into the search text box on the master
page so since we want to return the
search term the return or data type is
going to be string and let's call the
property as search term so what do we
want to return we want to return the
text that is present in txt search text
box all right so that's it for the
master page now let's add a content page
and let's call this student search we
want to display the students within a
grid view control within the content
page so let's drag and drop a grid view
control on to the content page and let's
use master type directive on the content
page so that we get a strongly typed
reference to the actual master page
so master type virtual path equals site
dot master all right now we need to
retrieve data from the database table so
we will be using this table TBL students
here is the sequel script to create and
populate this table with some sample
data
I'll have the script available on my
blog in case if you need it now the
first thing that we need to do is write
a stored procedure that's going to
return students you know obviously when
we click search you know we are going to
pass a search term so we need a stored
procedure which is going to take that
search term as a parameter and then
return all the students whose name
contain that search term so let's create
that stored procedure create a proc and
let's be call let's call this SP search
students let's include a parameter let's
call it search term and this is going to
be of type and we're care and let's
specify the length of 50 as begin and so
what do we want to do we want to
retrieve all the rows and columns from
TBL students table where name like we
need to include the wild-card so
percentage and to that
let's append the search term and let's
append another wild card at the end all
right so that's it very simple stored
procedure so let's go ahead and create
this let's quickly test our store
procedure to make sure it works as
expected and let's say for example when
I pass letter M
then I should get all the student names
which contain letter M look at that
there are nine of them
if I pass M a as the search term we only
get two students on the other hand if I
pass an empty string we should get
everyone back there we go alright now we
need to invoke the stored procedure from
our content page so with the code-behind
file since we are going to write some
idiotic code here let's bring in the
required ad or dotnet namespaces so we
need system data we need system dot data
dot sequel client and we need system dot
configuration so first of all let's
include a private method here and let's
call it get data and to this method we
are going to pass a search term and
let's write the ad or net code here so
first we need to read the connection
string from web config file so within
web doc config I already have a
connection string that points to the
sequel server on my machine and the name
of the connection string is T BCS so
let's read that from web config file and
for that we are going to make use of
configuration manager class so
configuration manager dot connection
strings off what's the name of the
connection string DBC s dot connection
string should give us that let's create
a sequel connection object let's call it
corn equals new sequel connection let's
use the connection string to create that
sequel connection object now let's build
the sequel command object let's call it
CMD equals new sequel command so what's
the name of our command it's nothing but
this distort procedure so let's pass
this name and then we want to use this
connection object to execute this
command now the command is actually a
stored procedure so we need to tell that
to the command of
and we do that by using command type of
property and this stored procedure
expects a parameter so we need to create
a sequel parameter object and let's call
the search parameter equals new sequel
parameter we need to specify the name of
the parameter and a value for it so the
name of the parameter is going to be at
search term and this value going to come
from the value is coming into this
method as a parameter so let's pass this
parameter alright now we need to
associate this parameter with the
command object and to do that we use the
parameters property of the command
object add our search parameter all
right so let's open the connection and
let's execute the command so command dot
execute reader so whatever result that
we get back we want to set that as the
data source for our grid we control and
invoke data bind method we don't have to
close the connection explicitly because
we have wrapped the sequel connection
object using this using a block so the
connection will be automatically closed
for us all right now let's invoke this
method within the page load event so if
not is postback let's invoke this method
get data and you know when the page
first initially loads we want to display
all the students within the grid we
control so let's pass now to this method
all right let's go ahead and run this
and see if the area dot net code and the
stored procedure is working as expected
we're going to get a runtime exception
but we'll see in just a bit how to fix
that look at this it gives an error
stating procedural function SP searches
students expects a parameter at search
term which was not supplied and look at
our ad or net code we are actually
associating the parameter with the
command object so
so why are we getting this error that's
basically because look at this we are
passing now and that's why okay so what
we want the stored procedure to do if
the search I mean the seidio dotnet code
to do is if the search term is now you
know we want to replace that with an
empty string okay and for that purpose
let's use null coalescing operator so
basically if the search term is now then
pass string dot empty as the value for
this parameter otherwise if the search
term is not now then use the value that
is present within this parameter okay
that's what this null collision operator
does okay so with this change let's run
this one more time and see if it works
as expected
okay there we go we got all the ten
students now look at this when we type a
search term and click this button
nothing is going to happen because we
haven't implemented that functionality
yet so basically what should happen now
first of all look at this the search
button is within the masturbate when I
click this button you know an even
handler method needs to be executed at
the moment we don't have any even
handler method associated with the
search button okay but then if you
remember within the master page we've
caught a property that exposes that
button that returns that button and the
property is search button so what I'm
going to do within this content page is
I'm going to include page in it event
page initialization event and within
page initialization event we are going
to associate and even handle a method
with a click event of the button control
okay and how am I getting a reference to
that button control that's present on
the master page we have the property
search button okay and look at what it
is returning it's returning a button
control which is nothing but the button
that is present within the master page
so to that button
associate you know to this click event
associate the following event handler so
search button underscore click so when
the click event occurs this even gets
executed even handler method gets
executed ok so what do we want to do
when this even handler method is
executed we want to invoke this get a
data method okay so let's go ahead and
invoke that and the next thing is we
need to pass the search term that we
entered into this textbox control so how
are we going to get that search term
again we have a property okay within the
master page so master dot search term
property should give us that you know
search term that we typed into that
search text box ok so that's all there
to it let's go ahead and run this and
see if it works as expected so there are
builders let's see what they are oh we
need to change the name of the page
event to page in it okay so let's run
this once more okay so there we go we
have all the students let's type ma the
button look at that we only get those
student names you know which contain
that search term ma if I get rid of that
click the button we get everybody okay
so very straightforward basically to
pass data from the master page to the
content page let's say for example you
know I have another maybe employee
search page okay basically let's look at
that example as well so here I have
another table select star from TBL
employee okay now let's say we want to
display these employees on another page
and we want to implement search
functionality there again it's going to
be very straightforward and it's going
to be very similar ok the first step is
obviously we need is tool procedure
searched employees so let's call it SP
search employees and we want to retrieve
data from TBL employee wear name like
add the search term so let's create the
stored procedure alright now let's go
back to a code let's add a Content page
and let's call this maybe employee
search and let's include the master type
directive I mean look at this the steps
are almost identical to what we have
done when we were implementing student
search and within the code-behind file
I'm simply going to copy paste the code
that we have in a student search so
these are the namespaces that we require
and what I'm going to do is copy this
entire code and then paste that within
the code behind of our employee search
ok the only thing that needs
modification here is the name of the
stored procedure ok what's the name of
the stored procedure in this case it's
going to be SP surged employees ok and
then obviously we need to include a
gridview control so let's drag and drop
a gridview control to display those
employees there that's that so let's go
ahead and run this now and see if this
works as expected
so basically it's displaying all the
employees now if I type letter S then we
should get all employees who have caught
letter S in their name
ok there we go so very simple and
straightforward now let's say in my
application I have another page but on
that page I don't want the search
functionality itself ok so I don't want
the search interface to be displayed in
the masterbate is there a way to hide it
absolutely
and that is the reason why we have
included in all these controls inside
this panel and then we have included a
property within the code-behind file of
the master page to return that panel
control so that we can turn off the
visibility on a page where we do need
search functionality so let's add a page
basically this is flip form six dot aspx
so let's say on this page we don't want
search functionality
first of all let's include that master
type directive let's set virtual path to
slide master and within the code-behind
file in the page load event so master
dot search panel is going to written as
the panel control and all we are going
to do is set the visibility to false so
when we navigate to this page wave form
six dot aspx you know we shouldn't see
the search interface on this page look
at that we don't have that search
interface but then if I navigate to
maybe employee search we should have
that search interface alright that's it
for today thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
