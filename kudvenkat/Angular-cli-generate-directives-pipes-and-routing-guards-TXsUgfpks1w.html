you in this video well disk is
generating directives pipes and routing
guards using the angular CLI generating
directives pipes routing guards and most
other angular features is very similar
to generating components in services we
discussed generating components and
services in our previous videos in this
course to generate a directive we use
this command ng generate directive and
the directive name or we can also use
its alias ng G for generate D for
directed and the directive name so let's
generate a new directive ng G D and
let's call our directive my directive
now this command is actually going to
generate an error there we go
look at the error message it says more
than one module matches use skip import
option to skip importing the component
into the closest module this error
message is slightly misleading if you
look at what we are creating we are
actually creating a directive here but
look at the message right here it says
component though this error message is
slightly misleading it's actually
pointing us in the right direction if
you look at the message it's basically
saying we've got more than one module
within our angular project so it doesn't
really know into which module this newly
generated directive should be imported
so if you look at our angular project we
actually have three modules within this
project we have our route module app
module student module and customer
module so the new directive that we are
generating right here into which module
should I import this there are two ways
to fix this error one way is to use the
skip import option when we use the skip
import option basically we're telling
angular CLI
do not attempt to import this directive
into any module just generate the
directive and then later we can manually
import it into the module where we need
it so let's use the skip import option -
- skip - import and let's also use the
dry run flag so it doesn't actually
generate the director there we go look
at that we don't have the Aramis H now
the directive itself and that spec file
are generated now will not be able to
use this directive until be imported
into a module where we need it and we
have to do that manually the other way
to fix this error is by using - - module
option when we use - - module option we
can specify the name of the module into
which we want to import this newly
generated director so let's use the
module option instead of skipping port
let's use - - module or we can also use
its alias - M and then specify the name
of the module into which we want to
import this newly generated directive my
directive there we go
notice it not only generated the
directive and it spec file
it also has updated the route module
file to import this newly generated
director so if we look at this project
within Visual Studio code notice we have
the director right here it spec file and
if we look at the route module notice it
has included the required import
statement and then made that my
directive part of the declarations array
so the important point to keep in mind
is if you have just one module in your
angler project then you didn't get this
error as the angular CLI will
automatically import and register the
newly generated component directive or
pipe with that one existing module when
generating certain angular features like
services our routing guards you'll not
get this error even when you have
multiple modules in your project because
by default angular CLI does not try to
import and register services our routing
guards so to generate a pipe we use the
similar pattern ng generate pipe pipe
name or we can also use its alias ng eg
for generate P for pipe and the pipe
name and along the same lines to
generate a routing guard we use ng
generate guard guard name or it's alias
ng G for generate another G for guard
and the guard name now let's try
to generate a guard and see if we get
this error more than one module matches
ng G for generate another G for God and
let's call our God my god
there we go notice the routing guard and
it's spec file are successfully
generated without that more than one
module Mattie Sara so keep in mind when
generating certain angular features like
services our routing guards you'll not
get this error even when you have
multiple modules in your project because
by default angular CLI does not try to
import and register services or routing
guards when you're generating directives
pipes or components and when multiple
modules already exist in your project
you will either have to use skip import
or module option along with the ng
generate command otherwise you will get
that more than one module Matti Sara
finally here are some of the common
options that we can use with ng generate
command we discussed these options in
our previous videos in detail with
examples thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
