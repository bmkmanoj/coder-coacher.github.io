server tutorial in this video we'll
discuss grouping ID function and sequel
server the difference between grouping
and grouping ID functions and the use of
grouping ID function this is
continuation to part 105 so please watch
part 105 before proceeding grouping ID
function computes the level of grouping
first let's look at the difference
between grouping and grouping ad
functions and then we'll discuss how to
use grouping ad function to compute the
level of grouping the first difference
is from the syntax point of view
grouping function is used on a single
column as you can see here whereas the
column list for grouping ad function
must match with the group by clause
column list whenever we use functions
like roll-up cube grouping sets we use
those functions in conjunction with
group by clause and with group by clause
we specify the list of columns by which
we want to aggregate the data so if we
are using grouping ID function in such a
query then the column list that we
specify for the grouping ID function
must match the column list that we
specify in the group by clause otherwise
we may get inconsistent result we'll
look at an example of that in just a bit
grouping function indicates whether the
column in a group by list is aggregated
or not
grouping returns one for aggregated or
zero for not aggregate in the result set
we discussed grouping function in detail
in our previous video session grouping
ID function on the other hand
concatenate all the grouping functions
perform the binary to decimal conversion
and returns the equivalent integer in
short we can say grouping ID of a comma
B comma C equals grouping of a plus
grouping of B plus grouping of C let's
look at an example and that should make
all these points clear let's flip to
sequel server management studio this is
the same query that we wrote in the
previous video session so if you look at
what this query is doing it's giving us
total sales across these three
dimensions continent country and set a
and then we are using grouping function
on these three columns continent country
and city if you look at row number 1
grouping of continent
Andrian city or all of those functions
return zero because in this case the
data is not aggregated by any of those
three dimensions whereas if you look at
rule number three the data here is
aggregated by city column so grouping of
city returns one whereas grouping of
continent and grouping of country
returns zero but if you look at rule
number seven here here the data is
aggregated by country and city columns
so grouping of country and grouping of
city returns one whereas grouping of
continent returns zero and if you look
at the grand total row here the data is
aggregated by all the three dimensions
so grouping of continent country and
city all three of them returns one so
here by using grouping function on a
single column now what I want to do is
concatenate these you know bits you know
which are displaying 0 and 1 together to
form a single binary string so to do
that I am going to say grouping of
continent apply a plus operator and
grouping of country another plus
operator and then let's give this column
Analia let's call this maybe groupings
so when we execute this I expect a
binary string for example for Row 1 it
should display 0 0 0 and for this row it
should display 0 1 1
you know the binary string basically but
let's execute this look at this we have
a problem here instead of displaying a
binary string it's actually adding those
bits together so for row number 7 it has
added you know country city and
continent 0 plus 1 plus 1 and it gave us
2 instead of concatenating them so to
force those bits to be concatenated I'm
actually going to convert you know the
result to end web tab and for that I'm
going to use the cast function so cast
grouping of continent as and where care
of 1 okay and let's do the same thing
for the other grouping functions that we
have
so let's go pay this rest of the
expression from there alright so now
let's go ahead and execute this now
notice that we get they can catenate it
bits okay so this is the binary number
that we are getting now we discuss that
grouping ID of a comma B comma C equals
clipping of a plus grouping of B plus
grouping of C now here we have grouping
of a that is Continent grouping of Bakke
and regrouping of c city okay we have
that binary string now let's use
grouping ID function now one point to
keep in mind you know they column lists
that we specify for grouping ID function
must match with the column list that we
have in the group by clause okay so
let's use grouping ID function here
grouping under school ID and then we
have to specify the column list so I'm
going to use the same column list along
with our grouping ID function and let's
give it an alias let's call it grouping
ID G PID so let's execute this now and
notice we get a grouping ID column value
and if you look at this column ID value
this is an integer now what did we
discuss grouping ID function
concatenates all the grouping functions
perform the binary to decimal conversion
and returns the equivalent integer so
here we are getting any an integer but
this one you know is a binary string so
if you convert this binary number to a
decimal you know we get a value of 3 now
if you are curious about how to do that
conversion it's straightforward so here
we have all zeros but if you look at
this row right here it's 0 1 1 so let's
do the mathematics for that to compute
that to a decimal number so we have 0 1
1 we start from right to left so to
power 0 into and we multiply that with
the bit value the bit value here is 1 so
to power 0 multiplied by 1 similarly
here it will be 2 power 1 multiplied by
1 because
a bit value is 1 and this will be 2
power 2 multiplied by 0 and that's
because here bit value is 0 so it starts
from 2 power 0 and it goes on to point 1
to point 2 to power 3 so from right to
left and then if you have a bit value of
1 you multiply that to power whatever
power value you have with that bit value
here it is 1 so we multiply it with 1
here it's 1 we multiply it with 1 here
it's 0 so we multiply it let's zero now
to power 0 is 1 1 multiplied by 1 is 1
similarly to power 1 is 2 multiplied y1
is 2 2 power 2 is 4 multiplied by 0 is 0
and when we add these values together 0
+ 2 + 1 dot is 3 so if you look at that
2 right here where we have 0 1 1 so
that's what the grouping functions have
given us the binary string and the
equivalent integer value returned by
grouping ID function is 3 and if look at
this grand total row look at the bit
values that we have it's 1 1 1 so when
we do the same mathematics for 1 1 1 we
should get a value of 7 so these two are
not going to change because they're 1 1
and this will be now 1 so 2 power 2
multiplied by 1 because the bit value
here is 1 so 2 power 2 is 4 4 x 1 is 4
so 4 plus 2 plus 1 equals 7 and that's
what we see right here so that's how the
grouping ID function in our retrieves
the value now we also discussed that if
the column lists that we used with
grouping ID and if it's not identical
with the list that we have in grew by we
may get inconsistent results and that's
going to happen if we alter this so if I
remove country here
I mean continent from that grouping ID
but our group by column list is
different so when we execute this look
at what we are getting we are getting
different integer values
okay all right
now we know how to compute you know the
grouping ID column how sequel server
computes that grouping ID column value
and if you look at let's put this
continent back so the beauty about using
this grouping ID function is that it
gives us the level of grouping so
whatever grouping ID column value you
have here that specifies the level of
grouping that means we can use this
column to sort or filter by level of
grouping for example so we have just
seen that how we compute the grouping ID
column value now if you look at the data
that we have here notice we have sorted
the data by grouping ID column let's
actually do that here in real time so I
don't require these three expressions
right here so I'm going to get rid of
them and here I'm going to use order by
GP ID this column now before I execute
the query look at the data that we have
here now first it displays this total
sales you know here for first and second
rows the total sales data is not a
graded by any specific column but if you
look at the third row its aggregated by
city column and then again the data is
not aggregated by any specific column
then we have the data aggregated by city
column then we have data aggregated by
country and city columns because both of
those columns are now so you know this
is not n you know an order in which I
want it to be now what I want to do is I
want the data to be sorted like this
first give me the total sales where it's
not grouped by any of these specific
columns in the sense it's not aggregated
by any of these three dimensions
so in that case look at the grouping ID
column value it is 0 in this case it's
not aggregated by any specific column
and then we have grouping ID column
value 1 that means here the data is
aggregated by just the city column
notice
city column value is small for all the
rows where G PID column value is 1 and
then we have the data aggregated by both
the columns country and city you know
the rows where we have G PID column
value 3 notice country and city columns
are a mile and finally we have the grand
total okay so when we execute this query
we should get identical results on what
we have seen on the slide so we can use
fill up sorting of data like that by
level of grouping now another benefit is
you can also filter by level of grouping
now here at the moment we have all the
data from the result set now for some
reason if you want only the data that is
aggregated by let's say city level then
you can filter we're grouping ID is 1 so
I can say having grouping of this equals
1 so this is going to give us the data
that is aggregated at the city level now
if you want only the data that is
aggregated you know by country and city
then probably you can use 3 so we get
the continent level data and if you want
the grand total you can use 7 so
filtering is also possible by level of
grouping and all this is possible
because we're using the grouping ID
function thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
