this video we'll discuss different ways
of writing link arrays to write link
varies we use the link standard query
operators here are a few examples of
them select from where order by etc
there are a lot more than this for the
full list of all the links standard
query operators please the MSDN website
there are two ways to write linked
queries using these standard query
operators one using lambda expressions
we discussed what lambda expressions are
in detail in part 99 of c-sharp tutorial
if you are new to lambda expressions I
would only encourage you to watch that
video first another way of writing
linked queries is by using sequel like
query expressions from a performance
perspective there is no difference
between the two which one to use purely
depends on your personal preference if
you are from a sequel server background
then probably you will like using sequel
like query expressions but keep in mind
behind the scene link where is written
using sequel like vary expressions are
translated into their lambda expressions
before they are compiled all these
standard query operators are implemented
as extension methods on I enumerable of
T interface this means that on all the
types that have implemented ienumerable
of T we should be able to use these link
standard query operators for example
arrays implement ienumerable obtain non
generic collection clauses that are
present in system dot collections
namespace like ArrayList hash table they
also implement ienumerable of teh
generic collection classes like list
dictionary etc they also implement
ienumerable of T this means that on all
these tides we should be able to use all
these linked standard query operators in
a later video session we'll discuss what
extension methods are and how to write
our own extension methods on a given
type in detail but for now let's just
focus on writing in our ling queries
using these two different ways for this
demo we'll be using this student class
it's a straightforward class with three
auto implement
properties here ID name in gender and we
also have caught the static method get
all students and this method is
returning list of student this list
class it's a general collection classes
which is present in systems or
collections for generic namespace and
all the generic collection classes
implement the ienumerable of pay so we
should be able to use the standard query
operators on list of student ok i have
already typed the code required for the
student class to speed things up so
let's copy that code and let's flip to
visual studio so here I have an empty
asp.net web application project all I
have done so far is added this platform
drag and drop a grid view control and I
have selected colorful screen so now to
this project let's go ahead and add a
class file let's call this student dot C
s and let's paste in the code that we
have just copied and this class is pre
straightforward so there we have the
three order implemented properties get
all students is a static method
returning list of students and the first
thing that we are doing is creating a
list of student object and then we are
creating you know several student
objects in line here and populating the
properties so we have got one male
student at the moment so one two and
three male students and we have got
three two female students so all we are
doing is creating the student object and
then adding it to this list okay so
after we are done creating all the
students we are returning that list back
so pretty straightforward method there
all right and what we want to do is we
want to display all the male students
within this grid view control so keep in
mind there were three male students so
we want to display all of them and that
would be control so let's see how to
write a link query so first we look at
writing it using lambda expressions so
student class this one has got get all
students and notice what it is returning
it is returning list of student so if
you look at
list class and if we go to the
definition on this list class notice
that this list class actually implements
ienumerable of T which means on list of
student we should be able to use those
query operators okay so on the student
class let's invoke that get all students
method and then what we want to do is
retrieve only the male students so I'm
going to use the ver standard query
operators and then here we pass in a
predicate so what kind of students do we
want we want all the students who are
male
so here I'm going to specify you know a
variable called student you can give
this variable any name you want so I'm
calling it student so student such that
student dot gender equals male so this
we're method is going to return an
ienumerable of students you know it's
going to return all male students okay
so let's go ahead and store the query
results in ienumerable
of student and let's call this maybe
query result okay and we want to display
these students in aggregate control so
all you need to do is give you one dot
data source equals that query result and
in work data bind method that's it let's
go ahead and run this so here we're
using a lambda expression so notice that
it only displays the three male students
now let's see how to rewrite this query
using sequel like you know expressions
so instead of using a lambda expression
like this
I can rewrite the same query using
sequel like syntax so so we use the from
keyword first from give a variable this
variable is called range variable we'll
discuss what is meant by range variable
in detail in a later
session 4 now you know let's continue
the queries of from student in this
collection so student get all students
which is returning list of students so
what we want to do is where student dot
gender equals male so we only want such
kind of students now if I end the query
here you know we are going to get a
compilation at a look at what the errors
is a query body must end with a select
clause so if you are using sequel like
expression a query body should end with
a select clause so you have filtered the
student but what you want we want to
select that student so we use the Select
keyword so select student and that's it
so let's go ahead and run this this time
we should have the same results
here we are using sequel like query
expressions that's it for today thank
you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
