this video we'll discuss jQuery dialogue
which had there are two simple steps to
get the jQuery dialogue widget on a web
page the first tab is to place the
content that you want in a dialog inside
the development and the second step is
to write this one line of jQuery code
find the development and on that call
the jQuery UI dialog function these two
steps would produce the dialogue which
ad let's look at this in action let's
flip to visual studio here are we've got
a development and inside the development
we've got the content that we want in a
dialogue if we view this page in the
browser this is how it looks like the
content of the dev is rendered on the
web page by default now if you want to
convert this div element into a dialogue
all you'll have to do is find this
development this development has got an
ID so within our jQuery ready function
let's use the jQuery ID selector find
that development using its ID and on
that I'm going to call the jQuery UI
dialogue function let's save our changes
and reload this page notice the
development is now converted into a
dialogue now this jQuery dialogue widget
is highly customizable it has got loads
of options available on this slide right
here I've got a few of the options that
are commonly used now if you look at
this dialogue here it doesn't have a
title and there are two ways you can get
the title one way is by setting the
title attribute on the development so
let's go ahead and do that title equals
let's say title from div element let's
save the changes and let's reload this
page notice the title attribute value is
used as the title for the dialogue
another way is by using the title option
of the jQuery dialogue widget so Doerr
dialogue
jQuery UI function let's pass a
JavaScript object and I'm going to
specify the title option and let's say
here title from title option so here we
have specified
the title attribute and the title option
when we do that the title option value
will override the value of the title
attribute so within our dialog now we
should get the value of the title option
so let's save our changes and reload
this page and we should get the title
from title option draggable this is a
boolean option that determines if the
dialogue can be draggable by the title
bar so now at the moment if you look at
this dialog here notice that as soon as
we hover the mouse over the title bar
look at that it changes to a different
symbol and I can actually hold down my
left mouse key and drag it around the
webpage so by default this draggable
option is set to true now for some
reason if you don't want the end user to
be able to drag this dialog by the title
bar set that option to false so let's go
ahead and do that
draggable to false let's save our
changes and let's reload this page and
look at this now when I have the mouse
of the title bar it doesn't change to
that cursor which prompts us you know
that this can be draggable by title bar
so I can't drag it anymore resizable
again this is a boolean option that
determines if the dialogue is resizable
at the moment the dialogue is resizable
look at this i can increase its height i
can also increase its width so its
resizable again for some reason if you
don't want the end user to be able to
resize this dialog then set that option
to false resizable false so let's save
our changes reload this page and now
notice I can't really change its height
and width I can't resize it close on
escape now look at this when I press the
Escape key on the keyboard the dialog
closes if you don't want the end user to
be able to close the dialog by pressing
the Escape key
and said that option to false closed on
escape so let's go and do that closed on
escape and I'm going to set that to
false let's save our changes reload this
page and look at this when I press
Escape key you know it doesn't close
model again this is a boolean option
that determines if the dialog is a modal
dialog by default this option is false
meaning it's not a modal dialog so
that's actually to understand that let's
throw in a text box here on this page so
let's include an input element of type
equals text and let's put a label for
that let's say first name and let's
include an HTML break and the default
for model option is false so let's save
our changes and let's reload this page
so we have the dialog here and look at
this as I have this dialog I can still
you know interact with the elements that
are present on the webpage look at that
I can actually type into the text box I
can interact with the elements on the
webpage because this is not a modal
dialog now if you want to turn this
dialog into a modal dialog then all you
have to do is set that modal option to
true so let's save our changes reload
this page and look at this now this is a
modal dialog now I cannot interact with
the elements that are present on the
page under I dismiss this modal dialog
look at this as soon as I close this now
I can interact with the elements on the
page so to convert the dialog into a
modal dialog all you have to do is set
this option to true so this is a boolean
option that determines if the dialogue
is modal dialog with modal dialog other
items on the page will be disabled and
cannot be interacted well until the
dialog is closed Auto open this is very
interesting now if you look at what's
happening
at the moment when we load the page look
at this as soon as the page is loaded
you know the code that's present within
our document of ready function will be
executed and you know this development
is turned into a dialog now in most of
the web applications you know you want
this dialog to be opened when you click
a button or when you click on a link if
that's the case then we don't want this
dialog to be appearing like this so we
want to associate that with a click of a
button or a link so in order to achieve
that we need to use this auto open
option so by default you know this
option is set to true which means as
soon as the dialog which it is
initialized it is also opened if you
don't want that to happen all you have
to do is set that Auto
open option to false so let's save our
changes and let's reload this page look
at this when the page is loaded we don't
have the dialog opening now when we
click the button that's when we want
that dialog to open so let's go ahead
and place a button on this page so input
type equals button that's a value equals
show dialog and let's give it an ID
let's call it BTN so within our jQuery
ready function let's find this button
using the jQuery ID selector and let's
associate click event handler so when we
click the button that's when we want to
you know open this dialog so to do that
I'm going to again find the development
and then call the dialog function and
then I'm going to specify the name of
the function here has a string so we use
the open method to show the dialogue so
this code will execute when the webform
is loaded that is when the document is
ready
that's going to initialize the dialogue
widget when we click the button you know
we are saying open the dialogue and you
know here we have set Auto open to false
so upon initialization the dialogue will
not be open so if you want to open that
explicitly call the open function of the
jQuery dialogue widget so let's save our
changes let's go ahead and reload this
page one more time and look at this we
have got a button here now when I click
the button that's when we are getting
the dialogue but when the page initially
loads we don't have that dialogue so
very useful option auto open so this is
a boolean option that determines if the
dialogue should open automatically upon
initialization if we said this option to
false the dialogue will stay hidden
until the open method is called thank
you for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
