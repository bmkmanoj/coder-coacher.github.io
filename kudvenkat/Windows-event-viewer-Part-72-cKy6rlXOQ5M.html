venket this is part 72 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll discuss
about the Windows Event Viewer whenever
there is an exception in asp.net web
application we handle that we have seen
how to do that using try-catch blocks
using error events like page underscore
error and application underscore error
once we handle an exception we want to
log it somewhere so that the developers
can work on a fix for those exceptions
now to log exceptions we can log them to
a database table or to the Windows Event
Viewer in this session we'll discuss
about what the Windows Event Viewer is
all about and then in a later video
session we will see how to log the
exceptions to that Windows Event Viewer
now to get to the Windows Event Viewer
there are two ways the first way is
click on the start button right click on
computer and click on manage that should
bring up the computer management window
from which we can select Windows Event
Viewer so I have the Event Viewer there
that's one way another way is click on
the start button type run and then
placentae that should bring up the run
window within the run window type Event
Viewer and click OK so that should also
bring up the Windows Event Viewer now if
you look at this Windows Event Viewer
there's a folder for Windows logs and if
I expand that folder you should see some
built-in windows logs their application
related log security related log system
related logs etc now let's quickly see
what these logs contain now application
logs has the name States these
application log is going to contain
information related to applications like
Microsoft Office a sequel server visual
studio etc and security log is going to
contain information related to security
like user sign ins access checks etc and
system logs contain information about
you know system drivers system service
failures etc now whenever there is an
exception within an asp.net web
application I can log the information
about that exception to these logs
within Event Viewer if I want to so for
example if there is an exception in a
that I am developing I can lock that
exception information to this
application log look at that
this application is showing currently
the log the information related to the
applications that are installed on this
come on this computer for example there
is an information log from office
software protection platform maybe this
is related to Microsoft Office and there
is another log from Microsoft sequel
server okay so if you want it's also
possible to filter these logs currently
there are 13,000 172 logs in the
application log so I can right click and
I can say filter current log and then
look at this I want only the errors
maybe which are which can be classified
as exceptions and warnings so I can just
select those to click OK and the filter
is applied here so currently it's only
showing errors and warnings and 1683 of
those are there ok similarly if I want
to clear these logs I can simply select
clear log and I can either save them and
then clear or simply clear them ok now
instead of creating let's say for
example I am developing an asp.net web
application instead of logging the
exception information to the application
built in application log here I can
create my own custom logs within this
Windows Event Viewer for example let's
say we are developing a website called
pledging techcom all exceptions related
to presume techcom I want to log those
within a custom log you know maybe by
name presume tech comm so let us see how
to create a custom Windows log and then
log all our website related exceptions
under that log rather than mixing them
with all the other application logs here
ok so in this session we will see how to
build a Windows application that can be
used to create this custom log now in
the Event Viewer you cannot simply right
click and say create a new custom you
know that's not possible you have to
edit the registry Keys for that but
instead of doing that you know the
microsoft.net framework provides us with
a class and a method that can be used
easily to create a custom
windows log let's see how to do that so
I have created a simple Windows
application here and I dragged and
dropped to label controls two text boxes
and a button control and then I have
given a nice text to this button create
event log and the event source by the
way let's understand what we mean by
event source now if you look at the
event viewer here now whenever I select
if you look at this application log look
at that it's showing at the source
source is nothing but the application
that has a log that that information for
example let me remove that filter so if
I remove those filters look at that this
log is written by Microsoft sequel
server application okay so basically
source is the application that has
written that log there okay so we want
to create the source the custom source
so for example let's say we are going to
develop a website called pledging tag so
I want the source to be pledging tag so
we are going to create that source and
then the log like this application
security system instead of them I want a
log name called presume tech log let's
see have to do that it's actually just
one line of code that we have to write
to do that okay so the user whoever one
is going to run this application they're
going to provide the event log name in
this textbox and the source name in this
text box and then they will click this
button that's when I want to create that
custom log and custom source name and to
do that I have to use a class okay there
is a class in system Diagnostics
namespace and the class name is event
log and this class has got a method
create event source and this class all
it take is two parameters the source
name and the log name okay so what is
the log name that you want and what is
the name of your source that's all so
I'm going to end and that is of type
string so the source I'm going to call
the sources presume techcom that's how
that's the website that we are going to
build and what is the log name we'll
call that
as pledging tech logs that said okay but
then instead of hard-coding them like
that we will retrieve them from these
text boxes okay and so obviously to do
that first we need to verify if txt
actually i've given them names if you
look at the form here if i go to the
properties you should see the name of
the text box event log name textbox so
let's go to the code behind their event
log name text box text okay so if that
is not equal to string dot empty and
along the same lines event log source
text box dot txt not equal to string dot
empty if they are not empty then we want
to create the event source and then
instead of hard-coding these values I'm
going to get the event log name from
event log named xbox as the second
parameter and event log source from the
event log source text box that's the
first parameter so we are going to pass
that there and specify the text property
and along the same lines here we are
going to specify the text property
that's it and then maybe we want to show
a message to the user so we can make use
of the message box so message box dot
show so we can simply say event log and
source
created so if they are empty then maybe
we want to say even login sores are
required okay so let's go ahead and run
this so now once we have the application
all we have to provide is I want to give
the log name as presumed tech and the
source name is pledging tech comm okay
so once I click this you should see that
message event log and source created I
click OK now if I come here and expand
this we might not see it there if that's
the case close the event viewer and open
it once again and once that opens if we
just go and expand this now it's
actually working on that it will expand
and we should see the log that we have
just created we have created a log with
name pledging tech so we should see that
so it's taking a bit of time to open
that so you should see that log presume
Tech and currently this presume tech log
doesn't contain anything in the next
video session will actually see how to
add exceptions you know to this log here
so anytime there is an exception and
when we log at using our application
that gets logged into this pledging tag
and any time the developers can come
check the log fix those bugs and clear
them if they want to okay now since we
have seen how to create the log itself
if you want to delete the log then there
is a very simple method again this class
has got a very simple method so even log
class has got another static method
called delete and if you look at this if
you pass in the log name for example if
you want to delete the presume tech log
all you have to do is pass in the log
name and it gets deleted okay so in this
video session we have seen how to create
our own custom windows log and
custom source in the next video session
we will see how to log exceptions to
that custom windows log on this slide
