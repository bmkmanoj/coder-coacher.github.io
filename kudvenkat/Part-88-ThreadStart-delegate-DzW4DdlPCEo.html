video we'll discuss the purpose of
thread start delegate this is
continuation to part 87 so please watch
but 87 before proceeding let's
understand the purpose of thread star
delegate with an example here we have
caught a class call number within that
we have got a static function called
print numbers this function is going to
print numbers from 1 to 10
within the main method we are creating
an instance of the thread class and to
its constructor we are passing the name
of the function that we want this thread
to execute since print numbers is a
static function we are invoking it on
the name of the class I have this exact
same code already typed within visual
studio let's go ahead and run this and
notice the output is what we expect
numbers from 1 to 10 now let's rewrite
this line right here using thread start
delegate first of all notice the
constructor of the thread class there
are 4 overloaded versions and if you
look at the second overloaded version it
expects a parameter of type thread start
and what is this thread start it is a
delegate now what is a delegate a
delegate is a types a function pointer
why do we call a delegate you know as
types a function pointer that is because
the signature of the function to which
the delegate points to should match the
signature of the delegate otherwise
we'll have a compiler error
that's why delegates are called as types
a function pointers now if you look at
this delegate syntax notice that you
know it returns wide and doesn't take
any parameters and the function to which
it is pointing that it's print numbers
look at its signature it returns wide
and doesn't take any parameters so the
signature of this function matches the
signature of this delegate that's why
delegates are types of function pointers
now coming to this example this delegate
is pointing to this function and we are
passing that delegate is an argument to
the thread class constructor so when
this line is executed this thread is
going to execute print numbers function
right so now the obvious next question
is why a delegate need to be passed as a
parameter to the thread class
constructor now what is the purpose of a
thread why do we create thread the
purpose of creating a thread is to
execute a function maybe we have a
function that takes a long time to
execute so we want to fire off another
thread and then we want that thread to
execute that function so that the UI
thread is free you know to maintain a
response you use an interface right so
the purpose of creating a thread is
takes you to the function and what is a
delegate a delegate is a types a
function pointer meaning it is pointing
to a function that we want the thread to
execute in short on threads require an
entry point to start execution any
thread you create will need an
explicitly defined entry point that is a
pointer to the function where they
should begin execution so let's always
require a delegate okay now you may be
wondering within the first example you
know we have created a thread like this
to the constructor we J we have just
passed the name of the function that we
want this threat to execute we didn't
explicitly create a delegate and pass it
to the thread class constructor so how
did it work then it's working there in
spite of not creating the thread star
delegate explicitly because the
framework is doing that automatically
for us behind the scenes okay and there
are several other ways of you know
passing the address of the function to
the thread class like by using the
delegate keyword or by using lambda
expression as you can see here now let's
see have to use the delegate keyword so
all you do is use the delegate keyword
and then invoke the function let's go
ahead and run this and see if we get the
same output look at that and we can also
use a lambda expression like that
so number dot print numbers
the same output now so far in this
example print numbers you know has been
a static function now thread function
need not be a static function always it
can also be a non static function in
case of non static function you know we
have to create an instance of the class
as you can see here and then invoke the
function on that instance let's actually
look at that within the example so let's
make this a non static function so
obviously this line now is going to
throw an error so since it is a non
static function we need to create an
instance of our class so let's call the
instance number and then to the thread
class constructor on the instance we
invoke print numbers function the same
output alright that's it for today thank
you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
