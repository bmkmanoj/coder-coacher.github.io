I am venket this is part 64 of c-sharp
tutorial in this video we'll discuss
about where our index is used in dotnet
framework and what our index ins in our
next video session will discuss about
creating indexers if you are an asp.net
web application developer then you must
be familiar with session state and
application state variables to store
retrieve data from session state or
application state variables we use index
URLs let us understand this with an
example let's flip to visual studio here
I have an asp.net web application
project and I am on the code-behind file
of webform one dot aspx now within the
code-behind file in the page load event
let's say I want to store something into
session state variable then I can make
use of the session object and look at
this the moment I open the square
bracket I can see that there are two
indexes defined on the session object
the first index R here is an integral
index ax and then once I press the down
arrow I can see that there is another
index R and this is a string index ax
the fact that we have two indexes on
this in our session object indicates
that it's possible to overload indexes
will discuss about overloading indexes
in a later video session all right now
let's say I want to store something into
the session object and let's say I want
to use the string index ax and let's use
the key session 1 and then I want to
store you know a string stating session
1 data into the session object with that
key now let's say I want to store
another string and let's call this
session 2 data and this time the key is
going to be session 2 now here we are
using the index to actually store the
data into the session object now is it
possible to retrieve data using indexes
absolutely let's see how to retrieve
data out of these you know session keys
so obviously to print something onto the
waveform I have to use the response
object so response dot right now let's
print out a hard-coded string saying
that session 1
beta is equal to now to retrieve the
data out of the session object look at
this I'm going to use the session object
and then I open the square bracket and
then it shows me again that I have an
integral indexer and string index ax now
let's actually use the integral indexer
to retrieve the data out of the first
session kay okay so I'm going to say 0
as the index okay
so 0 index is going to pull the data
that is present in the first session key
session 1 and then look at that the
session object actually returns an
object data type because you can store
anything into a session state so it
returns an object but we know that it's
a string so I'm going to convert that to
a string all right now let's write an
HTML break so that the output comes in a
separate line and then let's say I want
to retrieve a session I mean the data
that's present in the session variable
with key session 2 now here you know the
to retrieve data from the first session
key by using an integral indexer here
let's say I want to use the string index
ax so I just use the double quotes and
then specify our session key which is
session 2 and let's change this
hard-coded string here to session 2 data
now let me go ahead and run this as you
might expect we should be able to
retrieve data from both the keys session
1 and session 2 to retrieve data out of
session 1 key we are using the integral
index ax and for session 2 we are
actually using the string index ax so
this is one classical example where
indexes are used in dotnet framework ok
now if you can't actually see the you
know those indexes within that class
look at this this session is actually a
property within the page object so I'll
right click on the session and go to
definition so this is the session
property and this actually returning an
HTTP session state object so when we
right-click on that and then go to
definition within that class you should
see two index herbs now we usually
create indexes using this keyword
look at that I have to indexers here the
first one is the integral indexer and
the second one is the string index ax
now don't worry about this syntax of the
indexers here we are going to discuss
about creating indexes in our next video
session now if you look at this index I
look at that it has got a get and set
accessor as well just like properties
indexes have get and set accessories
discuss about creating indexes in detail
in our next video session now so we have
just seen the metadata of httpsession
state class showing those two indexes
integral indexer and string index ax now
let's look at another example of you
know indexers usage in dotnet framework
now most of us have written the ad or
dotnet code now let's say for example
here I have this TBL employee table
I want to retrieve data from this table
and write that on a web form okay so
obviously we need to write some ad or
dotnet code and just speed things up you
know a deal discussing about the ad or
dotnet code is out of the scope of this
video
we discussed about ad or dotnet in a
separate video series I do dotnet video
tutorial so beginners please watch
videos from that series okay but then
let me copy this ad or dotnet code here
and then let's go to the code behind
file of this web form and let's paste
that within the page load event let's
delete whatever that's there all today
and let's paste this so we are using the
configuration manager class to read the
connection string from web config file
so in the web config file I have already
a connection string with the name DB CS
database connection string there so we
are reading that connection string from
web config file using the configuration
manager class and using the connection
string be a building of a sequel
connection object and look at our sequel
command select star from TBL employee we
are executing the command which is going
to return a sequel data reader object
and look at this we are looping through
each row that we retrieve from the
database and look at this each row will
have these columns employee ID name
gender and city but let's say I want to
print out the employee ID and in a
of every employee onto the webform then
there are you know two ways that I can
retrieve the employee ID column value
okay so let's say for example in order
spawn starts right now the first row
will be retrieved in to the reader
object so I can use reader and then look
at this the moment I open the square
bracket I can either use the integral
indexer on the reader object to retrieve
the column value or I can use the name
now let's say for example if I say a
reader of zero I'm using the integral
index a meaning I want the first column
value the first column is employee ID so
we will be getting the employee ID okay
so the reader of 0.2 string so that
should return employee ID and just I
know let's hard what it's string here
saying ID is equal to you know whatever
is the employee ID that we get and then
maybe I want a space and then let's say
we want to print the name as well so
response dot right and let's say name is
equal to plus I want to retrieve the
name out of the reader object again I
can either use the integral index or the
string index I if you are using the
string string index ax then you specify
the name of the column let's say for
example I want name of the employee then
I say reader of name that because that's
the name of the column dot to string and
then let's write an HTML break so that
every employee record comes in a
separate row
you
all right let's go then run the snap as
you might expect we should be able to
print employee ID and the employee name
look at that employee ID is equal to one
name is equal to MA we get that for all
the 11 employees now again here we using
the integral index and the string index
ax so it's you know in.net framework
there are several classes that already
use these indexers now in our next video
session we'll discuss about creating
indexes for our own class for example
let's say I have a class called company
which is going to return employees now
is it possible to retrieve the company
employees using indexers just like how
we are using indexers to retrieve the
column values and session values
absolutely we'll discuss about that in
our next video session but now you know
here we have used the sequel data reader
and then we know that it has got two
indexes let's quickly inspect the
metadata of the sequel data reader class
to see if they if it has the two indexes
so we are in sequel data reader class
and then look at that I have two
indexers here again you know integral
index ax and a string index ax all right
so that's the metadata which is showing
the indexer so from the above example so
what are indexes in c-sharp from both
examples that we have seen you know it
should be very clear that indexes allow
instances of classes to be indexed
just like arrays in our next video
session we will discuss about creating
indexes on this slide you can find
resources phase B dotnet C sharp and
sequence of interview questions that's
it for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
