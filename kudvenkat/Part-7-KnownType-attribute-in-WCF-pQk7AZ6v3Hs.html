this video we'll discuss known type
attribute in WCF we'll be working with
the same example that we started in part
6 so please watch part 6 before
proceeding let's assume in our
organization we've got two types of
employees that is full-time employee and
part-time employee the properties that
are common to both of these employee
types are present in the base class
employee and the property specific to
full-time employee which in this cases
annual salary is present in this
full-time employee class and similarly
hourly play and hours worked is specific
to part-time employee all right so here
these classes are related by inheritance
if you look at the employee service that
we have implemented in the previous
session look at this get employee
operation contract it's returning the
base type and the save employee is
expecting base type employee class ok
now we actually want to create an
application that can save full-time
employee and get full-time employee in a
similar fashion I should be able to save
part-time employee and get part-time
employee back ok which means these
operation contracts should be able to
return
you know the derived types that is
full-time employee and part-time
employee back and similarly this method
should be able to accept those derived
types ok
so in order for the WCF service to be
able to do that we need to associate
these derived types as known types and
how do we do that there are several ways
one of the ways is you know doing it
programmatically in code using known
type attribute we can also do this
declaratively in the configuration file
which we will discuss in our next video
ok so first let's go ahead and create
these two classes full-time employee and
part-time employee so let's flip to
visual studio so this is the same
example that we worked with in part 6
so first let's add a class file to our
employee service
and let's call this full-time employee
dot CS and within this class in a
full-time employee has got just one
property which is annual salary and
speed things up I have already
implemented that property so let's copy
and paste it right there
now let's go ahead and add part-time
employee so let's call this file
part-time employee dot CS let's make
this class public and this class is
going to have these two properties of
Ali pay and hours word so let's copy
those and paste them within part-time
employee all right now within our
employee class itself so if you look at
our employee class B at the moment we
already have ID name gender and date of
birth properties we need to introduce
the type of property so basically this
type of property is going to tell
whether if the employee is full-time
employee or part-time employee and we're
going to make use of an enum to do that
so first we need to create this enum so
let's go to visual studio and then
within the employee class itself I'm
going to create that enum so let's call
this employee type and then you know we
want to say the first item within this
enum is going to be full-time employee
and we want that value to be equal to 1
and part-time employee and let's specify
the value as 2
all right and one more thing we need
type property within the employee class
so this is employee class so let's go to
Enda create an employee type so the data
type is employee type enum and let's
call the property type and let's make
this an auto implemented property
alright so at the moment we have
designed our classes okay and we forgot
one important thing we need to make this
class inherit from employee class in a
similar fashion part-time employee
should also inherit from employee class
so let's go and do that so full-time
employee is inheriting from employee and
part-time employee is also inheriting
from employee class now we need to
associate these as known types and in
order to do that you know employee class
is the base class so here you know along
with the data contract attribute we can
use known type attribute and you need to
specify the known type and to do that we
need to we are going to use this
overloaded version where it expects that
type and to get the type we use type of
keyword and you know one of the known
type is full-time employee and the other
known type is part-time employee alright
so here we are using known type
attribute and we are doing this
programmatically within code in our next
video we'll see how to do this
declaratively within a configuration
file alright
so we are done so to specify known types
one of the ways is to use known type
attribute now let's first modify the
database table if we look at the
database table at the moment you know
this is the state of the table you know
as of part six so we only have ID name
gender and date of birth columns now we
need an employee type and you'll salary
hourly paid and hours worked columns in
this table and to speed things up again
I have written the sequel script to add
those columns so we are altering
employee table adding employee type
annual salary overly pay and hours work
all of them of type integer
so let's plus a five now if you select
the data back we should have those
columns there now let's actually get rid
of this data delete the data from the
table all right so at the moment we have
got the columns that we need now another
thing that we need to do is we need to
modify the stored procedure as well
because look at this you know when you
when we click get employee we want to
get all the columns basically from this
table at the moment this get employees
only retrieving you know ID name gender
and date of birth so let's also include
these columns in the Select statement so
let's alter this so now this stored
procedure should retrieve all the
columns from the database table in a
similar fashion save employee we are now
passing the additional four parameters
employee type annual salary of early pay
and hours work now one thing to notice
here is we made annual salary hourly pay
and hours worked
nullable you know the default values are
now so if we don't supply a value for
annual salary then null will be stored
in the database in a similar fashion
hourly pay and hours work that's
basically because when we save part time
I mean full-time employee full-time
employee will not have values for hourly
pay and hours work so they need to be
now and which means will not be passing
values for those parameters in which
case it will insert null
into those columns okay that's why we
have specified nulls for those columns
as the defaults all right so let's alter
this procedure now okay so from the
database side we are done now we need to
change the behavior of the employee
service as well so let's flip to visual
studio and if you look at employee
service at the moment you know this get
employee it's calling that SP get
employee but look at this
we are only populating ID name gender
and date of birth and if you look at
this object type it's actually of type
employee okay now based on the type of
the employee that we have within the
database we need to create that type of
object and return that object back okay
so in the database you know we're not
going to have just an employee object we
will either have a full-time employee
object or a part-time employee object
and how do we know whether if a
particular row corresponds to full-time
employee or part-time employee
that depends on this employee type
column if employee type is one then we
know it's a full-time employee so if you
recollect within the enum we have
specified the value of one is full-time
employee value of 2 is part-time
employee okay so what we need to do
within our service now in employee
service you know we need to first check
if the database value is one or two and
depending the on that we will either
create a full-time employee object or a
part-time employee object okay and to
speed things up I have written that code
as well so this is not specific to WCF
this is just you know the logic that we
usually write this is related to
inheritance now since part-time employee
and full-time employee classes are
related with employee class through
inheritance these can be you know
returned by
as an inherited type that's general
inheritance concept but for the WCF
service to be able to return them we
need to specify them as known tides okay
so now let's go to our employee service
copy this code and paste it within this
block okay before we go through this
code the first thing that we have to do
here is we don't want to create an
employee object anymore let's actually
initialize that to now and then look at
what we are doing here so this code is
common whatever we have written in the
previous session now this is the code
that we copied and pasted so what are we
doing here
we are retrieving the column value of
employee type and then we are
typecasting it to be of type employee
type enum okay and if that column value
is equal to full-time employee then look
at what we are doing we're creating a
full-time employee object and then
retrieving ID name gender date of birth
and we are specifying the type as
full-time employee and full-time
employee has got annual salary property
so we are assigning that value there all
right if it is not full-time employee
then we know it's going to be part-time
employee so it comes to the else part
and within the else part we are creating
an instance of part-time employee object
and to part-time employee these two
properties are specific hourly pay and
hours work in which case we are
retrieving those values from the
database column and then populating
these properties and look at the type
part-time employee and then we are
finally returning that employee object
back so straightforward code there okay
so that is get employee now in a similar
fashion we need to modify save employee
now look at this what are we getting
into this method we are getting the base
type employee object and keep in mind we
have added type property you know to
this class and based on that type we are
going to create parameters and
and send them to the database table okay
so basically until this point you know
ID name gender date of birth these are
common for both of the employees so that
code is not going to change so what is
going to change here is this part so
let's copy this again this code goods
looks in on lengthy but it's basically
you know same piece of code copy pasted
so we have date of birth you know until
this point we have discussed yesterday
and this is the piece that we have
copied and pasted so if you look at this
here we are creating another sequel
parameter employee type so that's the
name of the parameter and we get the
employee type using the type property of
the employee object okay and then we are
adding the parameter to the command
object and then look at this this is
what is important so here we are
checking the type so this employee
object is what is coming into this
method as a parameter so we are checking
the type so how are we getting the type
of that object using get type method
look at what it is returning it's
returning the type back and then we are
saying okay is this type equal to
full-time employee class if that is that
la a case then create you know a
parameter for annual salary and you know
typecast that object to full-time
employee retrieve annual salary property
value and then set that as the value for
this parameter and add the parameter to
the command object if it's not full-time
employee then we know it's going to be
part-time employee in which case we are
passing the parameters for the part-time
employee
so here hourly pay and then hours worked
okay again we are typecasting the object
here to part-time employee and then
getting the respect to property values
so straightforward code there again and
this bit doesn't change so we open the
connection execute the non query which
is going to execute this stored
procedure and we have already modified
the stored procedure to include all
these parameters okay so basically at
this point we are done with the service
ok so now let's actually close the host
that is already running and let's rerun
the project so the host has started so
the configuration and you know the
hosting code doesn't change in any way
now let's get to the Vistal document so
let's go to the base address which is
localhost colon 8080 and then if we get
to the vestal document now look at this
at this URL so let me zoom in so at this
URL we should have the schema for the
employee object
so let's copy this look at that
we got the schema for employee object so
ID name gender date of birth now let's
take this URL
now here look at this we have the schema
for our complex type you know which is
full-time employee and this full-time
employee has got annual salary and we
have here part-time employee which has
got hourly pay and hours worked now
let's go back to our employee service
now look at this this employee type is
not decorated with data member attribute
and if you look at the employee object
here it doesn't have that property
serialized okay so we forgot to do that
so let's go ahead and include data
member attribute here and we want the
order of serialization to be number five
so let's close the host once again let's
run it and now let's refresh this look
at that
you know employee type that is going to
be present in this file now
so now let's refresh this and look at
this we have that enum enum char simple
types so that's why it's a simple type
here so employee type in am and this
enum has got two values one is full-time
employee look at this one is the value
and part-time employee two is the value
okay so that's our enum and that is our
full-time employee and that's our
part-time employee okay so now within
the Vista we have the XML representation
of those objects all right so now
clients should be able to build proxy
classes now what's going to happen if we
don't let's go to the service if we
don't decorate this employee class with
known type attribute let's actually look
at that let's comment this known type
attributes
let's close the host let's run this and
now let's refresh this look at this at
the moment we have employee type enum
full-time employee part-time employee
all three now look at that we have that
simple type employee type enum but we
don't have part-time employee and
full-time employee that's basically
because we didn't specify the known
types okay so let's go ahead and then
come in this code alright so now let's
read another host one more time and then
let's go to the client and then update
the service reference so that the proxy
classes will be updated so now you know
once this is updated we should have you
know full-time employee part-time
employee employee type enum everything
with an employee service namespace okay
now when we click button get employee
what should happen we should be able to
retrieve depending on whether we have
entered the full-time employee ID a
part-time employee ID we should be able
to get that employee and display them
now if you look at the moment the pepped
form design within the client
application you know we only have ID
name gender date of birth now we want to
design our form with all the fields
basically that is employee type we need
a drop down list annual salary hourly
pay and hours world so we need to
implement that HTML and to speed things
up I already have typed that HTML so
let's copy that and paste it on that
platform so let's flip to the source
mode so we want after date of birth okay
so let me go ahead and paste it there
and then let's actually flip it to the
design mode and if you look at this it's
again straight for HTML I'll have all
the school available on my blog in case
you need it okay so we have employee
type drop-down list and text boxes for
these
okay and if you look at this drop-down
list at design time I have specified
three list items okay the first list
item say select employee type and the
value for that is minus one for full
time employee remember the enum value is
1 so I have specified value as 1 for
part-time employee 8 is 2 so
straightforward code and then what we
need to do is we need to set Auto post
back to 2 for this drop-down list so
that when the selection changes the
drop-down list is automatically going to
post back to the server and then within
this what we need to do let's say for
example we want to you know store
full-time employee into the database
table so when I select full-time
employee it should only show annual
salary table draw okay on the other hand
if we select part-time employee it
should display hourly pay and of us work
and hide annual salary okay and in order
to do that I have caught some code here
so let's copy and paste this code
so within the client so we are saying if
the selected value is minus one which
means we haven't selected anything then
we are hiding all three of them okay all
the table rows which means this annual
salary hourly pay of us work nothing
will be displayed on the other hand if
the value is one that means we want
full-time employee details in which case
only show the annual salary table row
don't show hourly pay and hours worked
on the other hand if it is not full-time
employee if it is not you know please
select employee which is the first
option then you know the selection is
for part-time employee in which case
display these two and hide NL salary and
if you look at this this D are and you
know all these DRS are nothing but
tabled rows so within the HTML what I
have done is for those table rows for
the annual salary you know look at this
this is the table row I have given it an
ID and run it so that you know we can
use that ID to dynamically hide and
display and then initially when the form
first loads we are setting the
visibility of those rows to false okay
all right so that's straight forward
drop-down list selected index changed
code there and then now the important
thing is get employee so when we click
get employee we should determine what
type of employee are we getting and then
based on that you know we need to
display the respective labels and text
boxes and again to speed things up I
have the code already implemented so let
me copy this code and let's flip to
visual studio and here
let's paste that so if you look at this
code this is again straightforward look
at this get employee is going to return
an employee object back okay and they're
checking the employee type so is the
employee type full-time employee and
look at that employee type enum is also
present and that's present in the
employee service namespace okay so if
it's full-time employee then set you
know this row you know this textbox
value to annual salary and look at this
we are typecasting the employee object
to be of type full-time employee and
then we are retrieving annual salary
property value assigning that as the
text for this textbox and then we are
showing that tabled row you know we are
displaying it and you are hiding hourly
pay and hours for table rows else if
it's not full-time employee then we know
it's going to be part-time employee
in which case display values within the
text boxes that is hourly pay text box
and hours work text box and then hide
annual salary row and display hourly pay
and hours worked rose okay
straightforward code and then we also
need to set the selected value within
the drop-down list so employee type we
need to typecast it to integer okay
because selected value is a string so
what are we doing here we are
typecasting it to an integer and
converting that to a string so you know
it will be the one or two in a string
format and then that value will be
selected in the drop-down list and then
the rest is common so name gender date
of birth it should happen as normal and
then finally within the label control we
are saying employee retrieved alright
now the next step is save employee and
again the code is right here
straightforward dotnet code so let's
copy and paste this
okay so here we have an employee object
now again we don't have to create this
employee object here we can initialize
that to now and then we are saying if
employee type is look at this within the
drop-down list we are taking the
selected value and we are converting
that to an integer and then we are
typecasting it to ena okay but the
selected value will return a string
whether one or two that you have
selected okay and then we need to
convert that to an integer because the
underlying type for the scene um is an
integer okay and then we are comparing
that okay is it full-time employee if
that is the case
go ahead create a new full-time employee
object for some reason this ID is small
case okay so we are assigning ID name
gender date of birth type as full-time
employee and annual salary we are
retrieving it from the textbox
converting into integer and assigning it
there and then we are passing that
employee object to the same employee
look at this in spite of it being a
full-time employee we are passing it to
the same employee save employee expects
the employee object but we are able to
pass it as to derive the type and within
the message we display employee saved on
the other hand if the employee type is
part-time employee then create a new
instance of part-time employee object
and then assign a name gender date of
birth and then look at this you know we
are setting type to part-time employee
hourly pay and the worse work we are
retrieving from the respective text
boxes and saving the employee and
displaying that message now if it is not
full-time employee if it is not
part-time employee then it is going to
go to the else part in which case it
will say please select employee type
because he has selected the first option
please select employee type option okay
so that's it we are done so let's go
ahead and run this and see if it works
as expect
so now let's say first let's see this
drop-down list full time employee look
at that it only displays annual salary
part-time employee it only displays
hourly paid and hours worked
if I select select employee nothing gets
displayed all right now if we click Save
look at what's going to happen it says
please select employee time okay now
let's actually create a full-time
employee let's say one mark male 10 10
1982 and let's say his annual salary is
60,000 look at that employee saved let's
go to the database let's actually take
check the table look at that ID name
gender date of birth employee type is
one for full-time employee and Anil
salary 60,000 and look at hourly paid
and hours worked
it's basically now let's create full
time employee and let's say IDs - let's
say it's maybe female and let's say hard
date of birth is 11 1981 hourly pay
maybe 250 and number of hours 40 and
let's click save employee look at that
it says employee save let's check our
database table and we got the second
record notice annual salary now but we
have values for hourly pay and the verse
word let's actually check if the get
operation works as expected
get employee look at that we get that
employee and number two we get that
employee as well alright that's it for
today thanks for listening have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
