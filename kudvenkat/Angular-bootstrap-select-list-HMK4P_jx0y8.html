in this video well discuss working with
a select list that is a drop-down list
in angler we'll also discuss how to have
one of the select list option selected
by default and finally how to disable
the Select list working with a select
list is similar to working with the
other controls like textbox checkbox
radio button etc so here is what we want
to be able to do we want to include this
department drop-down list with these
options help desk HR ID etc so let's
take a look at the HTML required for
this here is our create employee
component view template and right here
we've got is active checkbox HTML so
let's make a copy of this and then we'll
change the bits that are required we
don't need this form control there so
let's get rid of that and let's also get
rid of the closing div and let's move
this input type checkbox' out of the
label and for our drop down list we want
the label as Department and we want a
select list so instead of an input
element let's use a select element and
with a select element we also need its
corresponding closing tag so let's
include the closing tag as well and
let's give our select element an ID
let's call it Department with a
lowercase D and let's link this label to
the select element and we do that by
using the four attribute and we said the
value of the four attribute to the ID of
the element that we want to link to and
let's also give the name attribute and
we are setting name also to Department
and we don't need this type attribute on
a select element so let's get rid of
that and let's remove this duplicate
name element and ng model is going to be
Department and on the select element we
are going to use one more bootstrap
Plus and that is the form control
bootstrap class so at this point if we
save our changes and then if we take a
look at the browser we will have an
empty drop-down list notice we have our
department drop-down list right here
when I click on its label they drop down
list receives focus and if we drop this
list down we don't have any options here
and here are the four options that we
want help desk HR ID payroll so let's
include the required options within the
select element the first option that we
want is help desk now this help desk
text is what the end user sees and these
options right here are departments in
reality every department will also have
its unique department ID and that is
what we want to save when we save this
employee so let's also set the value
attribute of the option to the ID of the
corresponding department let's give an
ID value of 1 for our help desk
department similarly let's include the
rest of the options while we are here
let's also change the code within our
component class let's lock the value
property of the employee form instead of
logging the entire ng form notice when
we drop this list down we see all over
four departments and when I select a
department its corresponding value is
captured by the angle generator for
Moodle and along the same lines with the
Save button we also have the department
logged to the console as expected at the
moment we have hard-coded the select
list options within the HTML in our next
video we'll discuss how to get the
Select list options from the component
class instead now let's discuss how to
have one of these options selected by
default when the form initially loads
that's a for example we want our IT
department to be selected so we include
the selected attribute on that option
now if we take a look at the browser we
expect the IT department to be selected
by default but notice that is not the
case if we remove this ngmodel director
then the selected attribute works as
expected so if we take a look at the
browser now notice we have the IT
department selected now if we put this
ngmodel director back in place it does
not work again notice we don't have the
IT department selected again in angular
we use this ng Moodle directive for
two-way data-binding so to make this
work within a component class let's
include department property and then
initialize that with a value of the
option that we want to have selected by
default in our case we want the IT
department to be selected and its value
is 3 so we have initialized the
department property with a value of 3 so
when we save our changes and take a look
at the browser when this form completes
loading we should have the IT department
selected there we go
now with this department property in
place even if we remove the selected
attribute from the ID option it should
still work exactly the same way as
before when the form reloads we should
still have the IT department selected
that is because of the two-way
data-binding
that we get with this ng model directive
finally let's discuss how to disable a
select element to disable a select
element all we have to do is include the
disabled attribute notice we have the
Department drop-down list disabled
because this drop-down list is disabled
when we click the Save button its
corresponding property Department is not
logged to the console so within the
console we see all the other properties
except the Department property in our
form we don't want the select list to be
disabled so let's remove the disabled
attribute we also don't want any of the
option to be selected by default
so let's also remove the Department
property notice now we don't have the
department select
disabled when we click the Save button
the corresponding Department value is
logged to the console on the slide right
here we have the HTML required for our
Department select list thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
