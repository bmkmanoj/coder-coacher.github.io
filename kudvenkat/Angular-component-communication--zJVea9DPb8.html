tutorial in this video we will discuss
how to pass data from the child
component to parent component using
output property in our previous video we
discussed how we can make use of an
input property to pass data from the
parent component to child component so
let's quickly review input properties in
the child component we create a property
with add input decorator notice with
another child component right here we
are creating this employee property and
it is decorated with that input
decorator so this employee property is
an input property and then within the
parent component we bind to this input
property and then pass the data it needs
notice here we are binding to the
employee input property of our child
component which is display employee
component and then passing it the data
it needs and this chill component will
display the employee details so we are
using input properties to pass data from
the parent component to child component
we discuss this in detail in our
previous video in this video we'll
discuss how to pass data from the child
component to the parent component using
an output property let's understand this
with an example here is what we want to
when we click on this employee panel
which is rendered by our child component
display employee component we want to
display this specific employee name in
an h1 element just above the panel right
here between the menu and the panel so
we want to pass the employee name from
the child component to the parent
component so the parent component can
display that name within an h1 element
right here so let's see how to achieve
this using auto property so if I click
on this employee panel right here this
employee name is Mary so it should
display Mary within that h1 element so
depending on which panel we have clicked
we want to display that specific
employee name within an h1 element with
no apparent component so we want to pass
the employee name from the child
component
to the parent component and let's see
how to achieve this using an output
property so the first thing that I'm
going to do here is create an output
property within our child component
display employee component to create an
input property we use the add input
decorator along the same lines to create
an output property we use the output
decorator
so first let's import the output
decorator next let's create the property
itself I'm going to name it notify since
this is an output property I'm going to
decorate it with at output decorator now
we need to specify the type for our
output property notice we have specified
the type for our input property as
employee because the parent component is
going to pass an employee object into
this child component along the same
lines we need to specify the type for
our output property the time for our
output property is going to be event
emitter so first let's go ahead and
import event emitter now let's set this
event emitter as the type for our notify
output property
as far as an output property is
concerned one of the very confusing
aspects is specifying its type now you
might be wondering why are we setting
the type of our output property to an
event emitter object
well that's because a child component
uses an event to pass data to the parent
component now let's quickly recap what
data we want to pass from the change
component to the parent component and
most importantly when do we want to pass
that data from the child component we
want to pass the name of the employee so
the name of the employee is a string so
the type of data that we want to pass
from the child component to the parent
component is string and when do we want
to pass that string data whenever there
is a click event on any of these
employee panels right here so the type
of data that we want to pass is string
and we want to pass the data when there
is a click event on the employee panel
as the name implies even the emitter
object helps us emit a custom event
because we are going to use an event to
pass data from the child component to
the parent component and the type of
data that we want to pass a string so we
have said the generate type of the event
emitter to string if you want to pass
numeric data then you set the type to
number if you're not bothered about the
type and want to be able to pass any
type of data then you can use any type
like this but this is not a great thing
to do because we are losing tight safety
one important point to keep in mind is
using this event emitter object we can
pass only one value if you want to be
able to pass more than one value then
create a custom type specifying your
values as properties and then include
that custom type as the argument for
this event emitter generic type in our
case we want to pass only one value and
the type for that value is string so
let's change this back to string now we
need to raise this custom event notify
but the important question that comes to
mind is when should we raise this event
well we should raise this event
whenever the user clicks anywhere on
this employee bootstrap panel the HTML
for the employee panel is within the
butan plate of our change component
notice here is the bootstrap panel there
and we have the HTML here which displays
the employee photo and the rest of the
details so on this development I'm going
to wire up the click event handler since
this is an even binding we include a
pair of parentheses and I'm going to
name our even handler handle click we
don't have this method within our
component class so let's go ahead and
create this now all that is left to do
is raise our custom event notify from
this handle click method notice when I
type this dot we see the notify event
and raise this event we use the emit
method of the event emitter object when
we emit this event we also want to pass
the name of the employee to the parent
component so to get the name of the
employee we are going to make use of
this employee property right here so
this dot employee dot name is going to
give us the name of the employee and we
are passing that as the even data this
even data is also commonly called as
event payload next in the parent
component we need to bind to this custom
notify event our parent component is
list employees component so in the view
template of Lists employee component
here we have our child component used as
a directive so let's bind to the notify
event since this is an event binding we
use a pair of parentheses when this
event is raised we want to handle it and
to handle that event I'm going to
include this method handle notify and
remember when the change component
raises this event it's also going to
pass employee name as the even data and
this dollar event object is going to
receive that event payload we don't have
this handle notify method in our
component class so
it's good and created now we know this
method is going to receive the employee
name as even data employee name is
string so I'm going to specify the type
as string now what do we want to do with
this even data that we receive from the
child component well we want to display
that in an h1 element between the menu
and this employee panel right here so
within the view template of our parent
component which is list employees
component let's include an h1 element
right here and let's bind this to a
property called data from child we don't
have this property yet we'll create this
in just a bit let's copy the name of
this property and create that within our
component class the type for this
property is going to be string and all
we're going to do is within this handle
notify method we are going to assign
even data to this data from child
probably and we know within our view
template you're binding to that property
so let's save all of our changes and
then take a look at the browser notice
on the initial page load we don't have
anything displayed but when I click
anywhere on an employee panel that
respect to employee name is displayed as
expected at the moment they're only
displaying employee name one value now
let's say we want to display employee
name as well as their gender now we want
to be able to pass both the name of the
employee and gender as even data so
within our child component where we are
specifying the event type right here at
the mount way of passing employee name
so the type is string but now we want to
pass both employee name and gender but
using this event emitter we can only
pass one value to be able to pass more
than one value we need to specify a
custom type here we already have it type
for our employee which is employee so
let's specify that right here
notice as soon as we have done that we
have an error right here because the
even payload now is of type employee and
not string so let's knock off this name
property from the employee object we
need to make a similar change in our
parent component so the type of this
property is employee along the same
lines the even data type iya is employee
and then in the view template let's bind
to the name and gender property let's
save all our changes and then take a
look at the browser now let's launch
browser developer tools and if we take a
look at the console tab we have couple
of errors here and look at what the
error says cannot read properly name of
undefined the reason we are getting this
error is this property data from child
this is null on the initial page load
it's only said when we click on an
employee panel that's when we see the
name of the employee and gender but on
the initial page load this property is
now and we are calling name property on
an undefined object that's why we see
this error cannot read property name of
undefined to fix this let's use the safe
navigation operator here and here notice
now we don't have any errors on the
console but we see null two times
that's because data from child in both
the cases here is now now on the initial
page load we don't want to render this
h1 element at all so I'm going to use
the structural directive ngf so render
this h1 element only if data from child
is true thee notice now we don't have
any errors on the console and we also
don't see in all displayed on the
initial page load and when we click on
an employee panel we see that respective
employee name and gender so we use an
output property to pass data from a
child
to a parent component output properties
are not as straightforward as input
properties there are several moving
parts so let's understand these
different moving parts one by one first
we create the output property in the
child component since it's an output
property we decorate it with at output
decorator output properties use events
to emit data from child component to the
parent component so we are using event
emitter object and to specify the type
of data that we want to pass along with
the event we use the event emitter
generic type in this case we want to
pass employee object so we specify the
type here as employee next we need to
raise our custom event notify in our
case we want to raise this notify event
whenever a user clicks on the employee
panel so within the view template of our
child component we wire up the click
event handler on the development so when
we click on the development we are
calling this handle click method which
emits the notify event passing it the
employee object as the event payload
next in the parent component bind to the
child component custom event so in our
case we are binding to the child
component notify custom event when this
event is raised we are handling it using
this handle notify method now this
method receives the event data in our
case the even data is this employee
object so this parameter right here
dollar event receives the even payload
finally in the parent component class
include handle notify even handler
method and all this even handler method
does this assigns the even data employee
object in this case to this property
data from child and of a view template
binds to that property to display the
name of the employee and their gender
I hope output properties make a bit more
sense now in our next video we'll
discuss an easy approach to pass data
from the child component to parent
component that's it in this video thank
you for watching and have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
