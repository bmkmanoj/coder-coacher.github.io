tutorial in this video we'll discuss
jQuery data tables plug-in data tables
is a powerful jquery plugin it provides
searching sorting and pagination
out-of-the-box let's understand this
with an example on the web page right
here I've got an HTML table and within
the HTML table we've got tea head
section and within the P head section
we've got a table header row so we've
got ID city country and continent and
within the tea body section we've got
several data rows and if you look at
each of the data rows we've got the CT
ID CT name the country to which that
Salib belong to and the continent so if
we view this HTML in the browser by
default it will be rendered like a table
as you can see here now what we want to
do is we want to turn this table into
something like this
that you can see on the slide so
basically we want paging so if you look
at this we've got 21 entries that is 21
rows so we've got three rows and look at
the status text it's saying it is
showing 1 to 10 of 21 entries and I also
want bi-directional sorting on every
column of the table so if I click on a
column once the data should be sorted by
that column in ascending order if I
click on the column again the data
should be sorted in a descending order
so we want that bi-directional sort on
every column and we also want the search
functionality so for example if we type
United Kingdom then only those entries
that have United Kingdom in them should
be displayed and we can also configure
how many entries we want to display on
the given page so if we have to
implement all these features just
imagine the amount of code and time it
takes with data tables plug in all you
need is one line of jQuery code so let's
now see how to turn this table into a
table like this using the data tables
plug-in first of all this is a jQuery
plugin so on your web page you require
cool jQuery as well so I already have
the core jQuery referenced on this page
the next thing that we need is the CSS
and JavaScript files of the data tables
plug-in so to get those visit data
tables net website on the home page you
can actually see the links I mean the
CDN links to the data tables CSS and
JavaScript so let's copy the CSS link
and on our web page let's include that
so we want a link element so this is a
stylesheet type equals text slash CSS
and HTML in for the CSS and similarly we
need the JavaScript file so script type
equals text slash JavaScript and source
equals let's grab the JavaScript CDN
link okay so we have the required CSS
and JavaScript files and at the moment
if you look at this HTML table it does
not have an ID so let's go ahead and
give it an ID let's call it data table
you can give it any meaningful name you
want and with our jQuery ready function
let's use the jQuery ID selector find
the data table and on that call data
table function let's save the changes
reload this web page and look at what is
going to happen look at that
we now have all those features that we
have just discussed so now look at this
I am able to sort by city in both the
directions and there is paging we can
search look at that at the moment I type
United Kingdom I get all those entries
which have United Kingdom in them and
look at this the moment I delete look at
that the data is updated dynamically and
we can also configure on how many
entries we want to say so 10 25 50 100
so at the moment it is displaying you
know all the 21 entries but by default
look at this data table it's occupying
the entire width of the web page and at
the moment it does not have any border
so there are several ways to configure
the styles of those data tables but for
the purpose of this demo now if we want
to control its width - let's say for
example - 600 pixels what I'm going to
do is put this entire table inside a
development and specify the properties
on that development so let's include a
development on this page and let's move
this closing div to the end of the form
and on this development let's set the
style attribute and specify whatever
Styles we want so style equals I'm going
to set weight to 600 pixels so let's
save the changes and when we reload it
should now occupy only 600 pixels and
let's also include a border for this one
so I'm going to set that border on the
development so we want a border let's
set it to 1 pixel solid black border
let's save the changes reload this page
so we get that border now it looks like
the search text box is actually sticking
to the border so let's give some padding
between those two so let's use the
padding style and I'm going to set that
to 3 pixels so let's say well changes
reload this page and this is better
alright so in this video the data of
this table is you know present on the
page itself now what if we have our data
in the database in our upcoming videos
we will see how to work with data based
data and you know this data tables
plug-in we will also see how to
customize and configure the sorting
search functionality etc so we'll
discuss that in our upcoming videos so
here we have the steps that we have just
discussed thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
