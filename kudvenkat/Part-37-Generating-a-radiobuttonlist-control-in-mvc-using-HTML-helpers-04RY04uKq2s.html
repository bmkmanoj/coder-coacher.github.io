this video we'll discuss generating a
radio button list in MVC using HTML
helpers please watch part 3 6 before
proceeding now for each department
within this table TBL department we want
to generate a radio button if I don't
select any of the radio buttons and then
once I click on the submit button we
want to display message stating you
didn't select any department on the
other hand if I have a department
selected and then once I click on the
submit button we want to display a
message you select the department with
ID is equal to whatever is the ID of the
selected Department let's see how to
achieve this let's flip to visual studio
the first step is to add a model class
so let's right-click on the models
folder add a class file and let's name
it company dot CS and this class is
going to contain departments property
which is going to return list of
department objects now notice within the
get accessor we are creating an instance
of instance of sample dbcontext class
and if you remember this class is coming
from the sample data model which is
nothing but the ad Oh dotnet entity data
model that we have built in the previous
sessions of this video series and this
class has got this departments property
which is going to return the list of
departments in TBL department table and
this company class is going to contain
another property of type string and the
name of the property is going to be
selected department and this is going to
be an auto implemented property now we
are going to make use of this property
to receive the selected department ID so
notice that a user can select a
department and then once he submits the
form to the server we are going to make
use of this property you know to receive
that selected department ID value now
the next step is to implement the index
action within home controller and we're
going to make use of this company class
within our home control
and notice that this class is present in
this namespace MVC demo dot models so we
need to include this namespace within
our home controller so within the index
action method I'm going to create an
instance of our company class and let's
pass the instance to the view now let's
generate index view so right click on
the action method select add view from
the context menu name of the view is
going to be indexed raise a view engine
and we are going to create a strongly
typed view against company model class
so this should add index view now when I
click on this button we want to post the
form to the server so we need a form tag
and to generate form tag I'm going to
make use of this begin form HTML helper
and notice that the call to this
function is wrapped inside a using block
so this will ensure that a closing form
tag is automatically generated
right now we need to loop through each
department and then generate a radio
button so to loop through each
department I'm going to make use of for
each loop
so the model for this view is the
company object and if you remember this
company object has got departments
property so we are going to look through
each department and for each department
we want to generate a radio button so
we're going to make use of radio button
for HTML helper and then the first
parameter for this function is going to
be a link expression so M such that m
dot select the department whatever
property we specify here is going to be
treated as the ID and name for the radio
button and then notice that for each
radio button we want you know the radio
button value and also you know the name
of the radio button to be displayed next
to it okay so to retrieve the ID of the
department I'm going to make use of the
ID property of the department object
notice that we are looping through each
department we are using the department
object and retrieving the ID so the
value of the radio button is going to be
the ID of the department and then we
want to display department name text
next to each radio button and then once
all the radio buttons are printed then
we want to you know have some breaks and
then a submit button so input type equal
to submit and the value is also going to
be submit
okay so with all these changes let's go
ahead and run this and as you might
expect when the form renders we should
have something like this so notice that
we have all the departments now let me
select the department and click Submit
basically nothing happens this reloads
that's because we haven't implemented
you know a post action so this method we
want this to be responding to HTTP GET
action and we want another index action
method responding to the post operation
so within the post method this action
method is going to receive a company
object and then look at what should
happen when we click on that submit
button if I don't have a department
selected we want to you know return this
message if I have a department selected
then we want to display the ID of the
selected department and to do that and
by the way look at this form when I
right click on that and view page source
and let me zoom this and notice that
notice the name of each radio button you
know it's nothing but selected
Department the name and ID of each radio
button all right now to retrieve the
selected department ID value we are
going to make use of that selected
Department property so this company
object has got selected department
property so we are going to make use of
that we are going to check if that
property is null or empty then we know
for sure the end user hasn't selected
any department so if string dot is null
or empty and we're going to check this
company object
select the department property if it is
null or empty then we simply return so
we just want to return a string back so
we are going to return here
else we know that the user has selected
Department in which case we want to
return a string saying you selected
department with ID is equal to whatever
is the ID of the selected Department and
how do we get that company dot select
the Department property we'll give that
so these changes let's go ahead and run
this so this method is going to respond
to the post operation so I don't have
any Department selected there look at
that you didn't select any department on
the other hand if I selected Department
you select the department that ID is
equal to two if I select payroll the ID
of the payroll department is three all
right now notice that these departments
are in horizontal you know order if you
want them in vertical order then all you
need to do is include an HTML break
inside your view so when you're looping
through just include an HTML break here
so now if we run this so we get them in
vertical orientation but the behavior
will be the same now look at this within
this table we have e selected property
as well now e selected is one for HR
meaning when the form is loaded by
default let's say we want HR department
to be selected that radio button to be
selected how do we achieve that again
it's pretty simple so if you notice this
radio button for HTML there is another
overloaded version where we can pass
HTML attributes okay and if you remember
this department every department object
has got you know three properties what
are they ID name and D selected so if I
selected property has got a value and if
that is true then we want to
said you know checked attribute -
checked for this radio button so radio
button has got several attributes ID
name checked so this checked attribute
is what determines whether if that radio
button is selected or not so we need to
set that to check and when am I going to
set that attribute to check so I am
going to check so we have this
Department object so if Department dot
is selected if that property has a value
and if that value is true
so if these two conditions are true then
we know that is selected attribute I
mean II selected property is set to one
II selected column within the table is
set to one in which case we want to pass
so if that condition is true then we
want to include the HTML attribute
checked and this check is a reserved
keyword in c-sharp if it is reserved we
have to prefix with an @ symbol so we
want to set that to checked on the other
hand if any of these conditions if this
condition is false in that case we don't
want to include any attributes so in
which case we will simply pass now okay
so with these change let's go ahead and
run this and see if the HR department is
selected on the form load notice that it
works as expected and if you look at the
HTML so for that HR department
notice that this the HR department value
is equal to 2 and then it has got this
checked attribute set which is set to
checked and that's why you know we have
this radio button option selected on

speed or net C sharp and sequence of
interview questions that's it for today
