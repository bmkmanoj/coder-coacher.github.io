video we'll discuss projection operators
in length select and select many
standard query operators belong to
projection operators category projection
operators are used to transform the
results of a query select clause in
transaxial allows us to specify what
columns we want to retrieve from the
list of all available columns in a
similar fashion the link select standard
query operator allows us to specify what
properties we want to retrieve it also
allows us to perform calculations notice
the employee class right here it has got
five properties employee ID first name
last name gender and annual salary using
the select projection operator we can
select just the employee ID property or
we can even select multiple properties
like first name and gender into an
anonymous type or even perform
calculations like monthly salary and
full name on-the-fly let's look at a few
examples let's flip to visual studio
here I have a new console application to
this project let's add a new class file
and let's name it employee dot CEA's to
speed things up I have already
implemented the code required for this
employee class so let's copy and paste
it right here these are the properties
that you have seen already on the slide
and then this employee class also has a
static method called
get all employees which is returning
list of employee objects and look at the
implementation of this method it's
pretty straightforward here we have a
variable of type list employee and this
list contains four employee objects and
finally we are returning that list back
so pretty straightforward employee class
I'll have this class available on my
blog in case you need it
now what we want to do is retrieve just
the employee ID property of all
employees and print them on a console
screen so let's see how to achieve this
so we're going to make use of the
employee class which has got this get
all employees static method and notice
that this method is returning list of
employee objects
now we don't want all the properties of
the employee if you want just the
employee ID property so I'm going to use
the select extension method and then
specify a lambda expression which is
going to retrieve just the employee ID
property so EMP such that EMP dot
employee ID now this lambda expression
will be applied on every employee object
that is present within this list and the
type of this employee ID is an integer
so when you when I hover the mouse over
the select extension method look at the
intellisense
it is returning I enumerable of integer
right so let's use a variable of type I
a numeral of end let's call it result so
this variable is going to store the list
of all employee id's and then we can use
a for each loop for each end ID n result
print the value of ID let's run this
notice that we get the employee ID is
printed so if you look at the list that
we have employee IDs you know start from
1 0 1 and go all the way up to 1 0 4
let's look at another example this time
what we want to do is project first name
and gender properties of all employee
objects into anonymous type and then
print first name and gender on the
console screen so let's see again how to
achieve that so get all the employees
again it's going to return that list of
employee objects this time we want you
know first name and gender to be
projected into an anonymous type so we
are using a lambda expression again EMP
such that what we want to do now is
create a new anonymous type so I'm going
to use a new keyword now if we want to
create a new customer object we simply
say new customer and then specify the
properties and then populate them but
here an anonymous
type is a type that that that doesn't
contain any name so that's why we are
simply saying new and then we don't have
the name of the type that we want to
create now again we need to specify the
properties for this anonymous type as
well so the first property is going to
be first name and the value for this
property is going to come from the
employee object first name property and
the second property that will be present
in our anonymous type is gender and the
value for that is going to come from the
gender property of the employee object
and notice that at the moment we have a
compilation error that's because you
know look at the variable on the
left-hand side here it's ienumerable
event but then this select method it's
not going to return an INT Miraval event
if i hover the mouse over look at what
it is returning look at the first line
in the intellisense it's returning i
enumerable of a so what is a here a look
at this you know second line here a is
an anonymous type which has got two
properties first name and gender right
so you know if it is an ienumerable of
customer object for example then we can
say i n numerable of customer here but
the type that is being returned now it
doesn't have any name so we can't really
say what is the you know type of
ienumerable that gets returned that's
why we have something called where so
this is now going to store the anonymous
type okay so that is ienumerable of that
anonymous type that is returned by the
select extension method now we can use
this for each loop loop through the
anonymous type so again we have to use
where keyword here where let's call it V
in result and now when I say V dot we
should see both these properties first
name and gender so V dot first name
and then we also want to print the
gender all right let's go and run this
now notice that name of the employee and
the respective gender is printed so here
we are projecting those two properties
the first name and gender into an
anonymous type let's look at another
example now this time what we want to do
is compute full name and many monthly
salary of all employees and project
these two new computed properties into
an anonymous type and then print full
name and annual salary
I mean monthly salary on the console
screen so how do we compute the full
name but concatenate in first name and
last name and how do we calculate
monthly salary by dividing the annual
salary by 12 so let's look at that
example so we want to select again in an
anonymous type this time what we want is
full name and a full name how are we
going to compute that employee dot
first-name Plus give a space and then
EMP dot last name notice that here we
are performing a calculation and then
you know we are storing that result in
this property of the anonymous type and
similarly what else we want we want
monthly salary so monthly salary equals
employee dot annual salary divide that
by 2r okay now these are the properties
that are present in our anonymous type
now that's why if we look at this for
each look we have you know compilation
errors because first-name is not present
within you know the new anonymous type
so what we want to do we want to print
full name and then monthly salary so now
let's go and run this so notice that we
get the employee full name and their
respective monthly salaries let's look
at one more example now this time what
we want to do is give 10% bonus to all
employees whose annual salary is greater
than 50,000 and project all
such employees first name annual salary
and bonus into an anonymous type right
so to filter the employees we are first
using the Bayer extension method so via
saying where employees it's that
employee dot annual salary is greater
than fifty thousand and then we are
using the select extension method and
then projecting you know an anonymous
type here and then specifying what
properties we want so within the name
property we are storing just the first
name salary we are storing the annual
salary and to compute the bonus you know
we want to give 10% bonus to everyone
who has got you know annual salary
greater than fifty thousand so 10% is
point one so multiply annual salary at
point one it's that straightforward so
we have to first apply the very
extension method and then we'll say
where X such that X dot annual salary
greater than fifty thousand and now we
apply the select extension method so
select M such that what we want to do is
select we want the property to be named
as name and the value of that one is
going to be equal to e MP dot first-name
and then we want annual salary so let's
make this property annual salary EMP dot
annual salary and what else we want we
want bonus so bonus equals e MP dot
annual salary in two point one so now
you know whatever we get back it's going
to contain these three port properties
named annual salary and bonus so what we
want to do is print name
separate that with a colon and then we
want to plant annual salary separate
that the - and then we want to print
bonus now when we run this we should see
the name of the employee their annual
salary and the bonus they get ten
percent of sixty thousand is six
thousand okay
and look at that it only displays now
three employees because only three
employees have got a salary that is
three than fifty thousand alright that's
it for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
