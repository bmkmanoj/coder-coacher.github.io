this video we'll discuss displaying
images in sequence in the image
slideshow that we have created in part
134 please watch part 1 34 before
proceeding we'll be working with the
same example that we started in part 134
at the moment the problem with the
slideshow that we have created in part
134 is that the images are not being
displayed in sequence they're being
displayed at random but now our
requirement is such that we want to
display them in sequence that is first
we want to display one dot JPJ next to
dot jpg so on and so forth until 8 dot
jpg once we reach ATPG we want to start
again at 1 dot jpg and then we should
continue until 8 dot jpg and at the same
time we also want to display the image
number that's being displayed below the
image as you can see here okay so first
of all notice the state of the
application it's displaying an image but
we don't know but if it's displaying
these images at random or in sequence to
prove that these images are being
displayed at random let's display the
image number and to achieve that I'm
going to you know include an HTML break
here and then drag and drop an image
control sorry label control get rid of
this text property and then within the
code-behind file so this variable I is
going to contain the number of the image
that is being displayed so within our
label 1 control so label 1 dot text is
equal to maybe we can have a text
stating displaying image whatever is the
image that is being displayed which is
stored in this variable I so convert
that to strain let's run this
application
so now we should have the number of the
MH notice that it is playing image six
four three one so obviously the images
are for sure being displayed at random
so let's fix that so we want the images
to disappear to be displayed in sequence
okay now to display the images in
sequence first of all we need to
remember the image that was displayed
the previous time and on a postback you
know we know that web forms work on a
stateless protocol so if you have to
remember state there are several
techniques we are going to make use of
view state to remember the state you
know across a postback okay if you're
new to view state variables we have
discussed in a very great detail about
view state variables in the initial
sessions of this video series so please
check that video okay so we're going to
make use of view state variables so if
view state of let's say I'm going to use
a key called
image displayed so if that is now so if
there is nothing within this variable
within this view state variable image
displayed then we know we haven't
displayed anything as of yet so we want
to start at image one so what I'm going
to do here is set the image URL property
to till four slash images 4/1 dot jpg so
we want to display the first image and
then the important thing that we have to
do now is to store that image number
within this view state variable and then
obviously we need to set the image text
I mean the image that we are displaying
in this case we can hard-coded
displaying image one else
so we'll get to this else part only if
there is something in this view state
variables so first time when we land on
this waveform you know there will be
nothing in this view state variable in
which case we are displaying image 1 and
within that view state variable we are
storing this value of 1 but then when
the timer control post this waveform
back again after one second
you know this view state this condition
will be false because there is a value
of 1 so it will come to the else part in
which case we want to pull that value
out of the view state variable okay so
let's pull it and then store it in this
variable I so view state of image
displayed but then you know it's going
to return that variable I mean the value
stored in that variable as an object but
we need to typecast it to be of type
integer so let's go and do that so now I
value will be 1 so we have displayed one
dot jpg the previous time we want to
display two row jpg now so we need to
increase the value of I by 1 so I is
equal to I plus 1 and then we need to
set the image URL to still four slash
images four slash now we can't hard-code
the number because every time we need to
you know compute the image that we want
to display dynamically so we are going
to use this variable I for that purpose
okay so I will have a value of two the
second time so can wear that two string
and then the extension of the image
which is dot jpg okay and the next thing
is to actually store the value of Phi
back into the view state variables so
let's copy that and view state of image
displayed again we can't hard-code the
value instead we use that variable I and
then let's display the number of the
image that is being displayed in label
one okay so with all these changes let's
go and run this so the first time in the
waveform loads it should display image 1
then it should start incrementing it so
displaying image one two three four so
it's incrementing it but notice that it
will have a problem and it reaches eight
so it's going beyond eight but do we
have image nine ten eleven twelve within
our application it's not going to stop
it's just going to continue okay but we
don't have you know images beyond number
eight so somehow we need to start that
stop that loop at eight so how can we do
that let's close this so once we
retrieve the value out of view state if
the value of Phi is eight what we need
to do at that point we need to reset we
need to restart at one and this code can
help us do that so I'm going to copy
whatever we have in that if block I'm
going to paste it there so what we are
doing if I is equal to eight then we
know that we have reached until
displaying image eight in that case you
know start at one dot jpg and store a
value of one in that view state variable
and then say you know we are displaying
image 1 in that Labour okay if it is not
8 then go to the else part okay so
obviously if it is 8 it will come here
it will store a value of 1 in that view
state so it's going on you know the
waveform will be posted by the timer
control automatically and then it comes
here checks okay is there something in
the view state obviously there will be
something in the view state and then
it's going to come to the else part okay
and then obviously so it comes and
retrieves the value out of the view
state it will be 1 there so is I is
equal to 8
no so it's going to come to else part it
it will increment that by 1 now I value
is 2 we're going to display image 2 so
now this should work as expected so it
will continue all the way until 8 and
then it starts again at 1 because we
have that check there so 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
and it should come back to 1 okay so
this will be in this cycle
right now at the moment there's no
mechanism in place to start a stop the
slideshow so if you look at the
slideshow you know the end user can't
stop it if he wants to because you know
keep in mind this is posting back every
time it has to change the image now
let's say for some reason the end user
wants to stop the slideshow okay so we
don't have that mechanism in place at
the moment but we will see how to
include that in our next video session
on the slide you can find resources for
is p.net c-sharp and sequence of
interview questions that's it for today
