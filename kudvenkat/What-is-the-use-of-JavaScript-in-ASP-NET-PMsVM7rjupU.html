in this video we'll discuss the use of
JavaScript in a web application and the
advantages of using javascript to
understand the use of JavaScript in a
web application let's design a web form
that looks like this this form is going
to capture first name last name and
email once we click the submit button we
want to save that data to a sequel
server users table I have already
created a web form and this equals of a
table let's flip to sequel server
management studio first so here I have
this equal script to create users table
and this script is going to create an
insert stored procedure this two
procedure is going to insert first name
last name and email into users table
I'll have this script available on my
blog in case you need it now let's flip
to visual studio I've created a new
empty asp.net web application project I
named it demo and then within the web
dot config file I included a connection
string to our sample database and if you
look at the sample database we have
users table within that and I have also
designed the web form to capture the
users first name last name and email so
we have three text boxes so the end-user
can type the values for those three
fields and we also have three label
controls I have set the font color to
red because these labels will be used to
display validation error messages
basically all these three fields are
going to be required fields and at the
end user dint enter data for any of the
fear then the respect to label control
will display a message stating that
specific field is required and I also
implemented the server-side code so
basically within the button I mean
submit button click event handler we are
calling two functions validate form if
you look at validate form function this
function returns a boolean value that is
true or false
it returns true if the form has
succeeded validation by that we mean you
know all the fields are required if the
end user has entered data for all of the
fields then that validate form function
is going to return true otherwise false
and how are we doing that notice that
within the function we have a private
variable of type boolean which is
initialized
true and then we are checking if the
text property of the first M textbox is
null are empty it will be null or empty
the end-user did not enter anything in
that case we are setting that variable
to false which means you know this field
of first name field has failed
validation and then within the label
control our mere displaying first name
is required error message else if it is
not null or empty it comes to the else
block in which case we are setting text
property to an empty string in that case
return variable will remain true that
means you know so far validation has
succeeded for first name textbox right
and then if you look at the rest of the
code we have he is exactly the same
thing we are doing exactly the same
thing for the last name textbox and for
email textbox and finally we are
returning the return variable if that
return variable is false then we know
that the validation has failed at least
one field has failed validation so if
you look at the submit button click
event handler we are checking if
validate form returns true if that
returns true validation succeeded in
which case called save data method and
as you might expect within save data
what code we have we have ATO dotnet
codes would save data to the database
table so basically we are reading the
connection string from web config file
and then using that connection string we
are building the sequel connection
object and then we are building the
sequel command object specifying the
name of the stored procedure that we
want to execute in this case insert
should procedure and since it's a stored
procedure we have to tell that to the
command object we are using command type
property for that and this stored
procedure expects three input parameters
at first name last name email so we will
have to specify those three parameters
so we are creating a sequel parameter
object these are the names of the three
parameters and then the values are
coming from the respect to text boxes on
the web form and then we are associating
the parameter objects with the command
object opening the connection and
executing the command so pretty
straightforward
Aereo dotnet core
now let's go ahead and run this
application so now the requirement of
this application is to capture the data
and save it we use this table and if you
look at this application it's definitely
doing that we also should have
validation look at this when I click
Submit button you know we also have the
validation and placing the end-user
fails to enter data for any of the
fields and then when we click the submit
button it is coming back with those
validation error messages on the other
hand if I enter data and then click the
submit button it should save the data to
the database table let's quickly check
that look at that the web for
application is doing what it is supposed
to do at the moment if you look at the
code that we have we don't have
JavaScript anywhere so what is the rule
of JavaScript in a web application let's
try and understand that now here we are
validating the form now where are we
validating it we are validating it on
the server-side so every time I click
the submit button look at this we don't
have any data entered in the fields so
when I click the submit button what is
going to happen the request is sent to
the server so the request is sent over
the network to the web server for
processing the web server receives the
required processes it and it notices
that you know the form fields are
missing and then it is going to send the
response message again over the network
back to the client so there is a
round-trip between the client and the
web server just to let the end-user know
that some of the fields are missing
validation now let's say the network
over which the messages have exchanged
is low or let's say if the web server is
busy processing other client requests
then you know the end user has to wait a
few seconds to get that response message
back
ok and all we are doing on the server
now is validating and returning those
validation error messages ok now let's
introduce some network latency by making
the thread that is currently executing
our request sleep for 3 seconds and the
way to do that is by using the thread
class in threading namespace
and then we've got the sleep method and
we specify the time in milliseconds
let's say the time is 3000 milliseconds
let's go ahead and run this so now look
at this when I click the submit button
the end-user has to wait at least three
seconds
to get that response message back right
now if we can do that validation on the
client without a post back don't you
think that will be much better you know
the application will be much more
response you look at this every time I
click the submit button it has to kind
of wait at least three seconds because
we are artificially introducing the
network latency in this case so let's
see how to do that client-side
validation so to do the client-side
validation that's when we use JavaScript
JavaScript execute on the client browser
so immediately when we press the submit
button if we have a JavaScript function
you know that gets called and that gets
executed on the client so there is no
round-trip between the client and the
web server so the application is going
to be much more responsive let's
actually see how to use a JavaScript
function to perform the same kind of
form validation on the client side now
to include JavaScript on a page there
are several ways now one of the ways is
to use the script section and define the
JavaScript function on the page itself
or you can have that function in an
external javascript file we'll discuss
all those details in a very great detail
in our upcoming videos so now understand
that we need a script tag and then we
are going to specify the type type is
going to be text slash JavaScript and
language is going to be JavaScript and
here we are going to include a
JavaScript function to validate the form
fails now we are not going to get into
the basic details of JavaScript
programming language we'll be doing that
in our upcoming videos the main
intention of this video is to understand
the rule or the use of JavaScript in
asp.net web application so to speed
things up I already have it
script function here so let me copy and
paste this and then we'll go that
function very quickly
so basically we're calling this function
validate form and then just like how we
have a boolean variable within the
server-side validation function we also
have a boolean variable here in c-sharp
to create a boolean variable we use bull
keyword but in JavaScript to create any
type of variable we use the VAR keyword
and if we are initializing that boolean
variable to true and then basically you
know the same type of logic here we are
getting the element by ID that is we are
retrieving the textbox that captures the
first name and we are checking its value
if it is an empty string then we know
that the end user did not enter anything
into the textbox in which case we are
retrieving you know the label which is
going to display the validation error
message and we are setting the inner
text property to first name is required
that's the error message and we are
setting written variable to false which
means this field has failed validation
so this is our JavaScript function now
if the value of the first name textbox
is not an empty string then it's going
to come to this else path in which case
we are setting the inner text property
of the label to an empty string meaning
the label has not failed validation and
this return variable will remain true
okay and if you look at the rest of the
code it's exactly the same thing and we
are doing that here for last name
textbox and here for email textbox and
finally we are returning whatever value
we have in that return variable it will
be either true or false depending on
whether the fields have succeeded
validation or not so we have the
JavaScript function now defined but then
when we click this submit button that's
when we want to call that javascript
function and validate these text boxes
okay and if we look at these source here
look at this on click attribute so on
click we want to call this button submit
click method and this is actually the
server side function so if
look at the code-behind file we have
that on click button even handler method
so this gets called on the server side
but before that is happening we want to
call the JavaScript function that is
defined on the page here how to do that
using this on client click attribute so
basically on client click what we want
to do is call this JavaScript function
validate form now if you look at that
function that function is returning a
boolean value that is a true or a false
it returns true if the form succeeds
validation otherwise false so we are
returning whatever value that method
returns if it returns true then the form
will be allowed B to be submitted to the
server otherwise the form will not be
submitted so with this change let's go
ahead and run the waveform once again
now look at this I don't have any data
entered once I click the submit button
look at this I don't have to wait 3
seconds now initially we have included
that system log threading dot thread dot
sleep in our code here which means if
the form is posted to the server it has
to wait at least three seconds but here
the validation is happening on the
client side so we don't have to wait
those three seconds look at this the
moment I enter some data click the
submit button the response is
instantaneous because the JavaScript is
being executed on the client machine
there is no round-trip between the
client and the web server so the end
user is going to have better user
experience because the application is
more responsive now so now let's look at
the advantages of using javascript so
one of the uses is form validation now
can be done on the client side which
reduces the unnecessary round trips
between the client and the web server
this also means the load on the server
is reduced and the application is more
responsive which means better user
experience Java Script uses the client
machine processing power so now
look at this if there are a hundred
thousand users and you know you have
this JavaScript validation when you know
if they don't enter data and once they
click the submit button you know with
that client-side validation function
executing on the client browser you know
you are eliminating those round trips
between the client and the web server so
you have reduced essentially in this
example at least the requests are load
on the server by 100,000 and now here we
are using the client machine processing
power because on the client machine this
JavaScript is executed and with
JavaScript partial page updates are also
possible partial page updates mean only
portions of the page can be updated
without reloading the entire web form
this is commonly called as Ajax we will
be discussing Ajax in detail in a later
video session javascript can also be
used to animate elements on the page for
example sure hide certain elements or
certain sections of the page we'll
discuss all these with examples in our
upcoming videos thank you for listening
