venket this is part 47 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll discuss
about the regular expression validator
control before continuing with the
session I strongly recommend to watch
parts 44 45 and 46 of this video series
regular expression validator is a very
powerful validation control this control
is used to check if the value of an
Associated input control matches the
pattern specified by a regular
expression let's understand what we mean
by this with an example now on the
screen you can see that we are asking
the user to enter a valid email address
now we know that an email address has
got a pattern for example it needs to
have some characters and numbers
followed by an @ symbol followed by some
characters or numbers and then a dot and
then the domain name okay so this is the
pattern of an internet email address now
if user enters anything that does not
adhere to this pattern we know that it's
an invalid email and it should be
flagged as a validation error
so which validation control can be used
to match to a specific pattern regular
expression validator control and the
only property that is you know specific
to this validation control is the
validation expression property now in
the validation expression you see a
strange expression here this is called a
regular expression now this regular
expression is specifying a pattern like
this you know letters have words one or
more letters or words followed by an @
symbol followed by a few more letters of
words and then followed by a dot and
then few more letters now discussing the
regular expression stems are obsessed
beyond beyond the scope of this video
we'll talk about regular expressions
themselves in a later video session in
this session we will see how to use the
regular expression validator control
okay as I said the only property that is
specific to this control is the
validation expression now let us see how
to achieve this you know that we can see
on the slide and we lost the user to
enter an email address if it doesn't
match the pattern then
we want to show a validation error
message let's see how to use regular
expression validator control so let's
quickly design this waveform let's
create an HTML table so table and it's
got a TR and this TR will have two TDs
so one is that so let's say we want to
ask the user to enter their email
address and I want that to wrap inside a
bold tag and obviously we need a textbox
for the user to enter the email so let's
drag and drop the text box and let's
call this txt email okay and then I need
another rule basically for the submit
button I'm going to use TD but I want
this TD to span across to TDS so I'm
going to set the call span attribute to
two okay so let's drag and drop the
button control onto the webform and
let's call this BTN submit and let's
call this maybe save or submit and then
I need another TR basically to include a
label for the status so let's drag and
drop a label control onto the webform
and let's call this LBL status and let's
get rid of the text property and I want
to set the font bold is equal to true
alright so we have the webform now we
need to validate the email address that
the user entered so obviously we need a
validation control email address has
caught a pattern and we need to ensure
that the user entered email matches that
pattern so to match a string to a
pattern we can make use of the regular
expression validator control so let's
drag and drop that onto the webform so
regular expression validator control
oops that needs to be next to the
textbox so let's give this regular
expression validator a meaningful name
since its matching email I'm going to
call this regular expression
related email run at is equal to server
error message let's give it a meaningful
error message let's call this invalid
email in case if the pattern doesn't
match then we also need to specify
control to validate property so we are
validating txt email text box so that's
the control to validate and the most
important thing is the validation
expression now we can type the
validation expression if we want or you
know dotnet provides some built-in
validation expressions already now let's
set the full color to red so that the
error message appears in red color so
for color is equal to red now let's
select the validation expression go to
the properties of that and we have this
validation expression property and if
you click the ellipsis button next to
the validation expression you should see
some of the built in standard
expressions provided by Visual Studio
now I want to validate against I want to
match to the Internet email address
pattern so we should have internet email
address the moment I select that look at
this I get this validation expression so
I click OK and now if I flip to the
source you should see you know this is
the regular expression okay so let's go
ahead and run this and see if it's going
to match up to that pattern of the email
address so I'm going to say you know
maybe presume tag at presumed calm so
that's a valid email address so if I
click I don't get an error message but
on the other hand let me omit that at
symbol because an email address should
have a net symbol and a valid email
address so if I click away look at that
I get that invalid email on the other
hand if I put the @ symbol but if I
knock off the dot you know dot is again
required to have the domain name so
again invalid email address but if I put
a dot anywhere then it's going to go
away so here a regular expression
validator matches a pattern now whether
this email exists or not that cannot be
tested by regular expression validator
regular expression validator only
you know matches the user entered a
string to follow a specific pattern if
it doesn't follow that pattern then it's
going to you know flag that as a
validation error okay and by default
this client-side validation is turned on
now for all validation controls if you
drag and drop them by default the
client-side and server-side validation
is done now user can disable client-side
validation so how do users disable
client-side validation just by disabling
JavaScript on their browsers and we have
seen how to do that in the previous
sessions of this video series but then
let's say I want to as a developer I
don't want client-side validation can I
disable client-side validation
absolutely all you need to do is all the
validation controls has a property
called enable client-side validation or
enable client script which is true by
default if I said that to false
okay I'm setting enabled clients script
to false so in that case what's going to
happen this validation controls will not
generate the client script so when I run
this now the client-side validation will
be skipped in the sense the validation
will not be performed on the client side
look at this I type this an invalid
email address and if I click Save I get
this message invalid email but after a
postback and just to prove that let's
click that Save button
so if page dot is valid and we know this
is valid property is going to return
true only if all the validation control
passes validation even if one validation
control fails then it is going to return
false so we know that if if this
property returns true then all
validations have passed so I'm going to
say label status dot text is equal to
maybe we can say data saved and then I
want to set the for color of this one to
green so system the drawing dot color
dot green on the other hand even if one
validation control fails we know that we
are going to get false and that would
come to the else block in
which case we want to show a validation
error message so validation error and
maybe we want to say data not saved and
the color red okay so now let's go ahead
and run this and see and remember we
have disabled that you know the
client-side script generated so now if I
enter an email address here which is not
valid I click Save look at that the
validation is happening on the post back
on the client it is not happening and
all the validation controls support this
property enable client script and to
disable validation control itself set
the enabled property to false now for
example let's say I don't want any
validation to be performed maybe I'm
testing my application or something so I
don't want these validations to you know
slow my testing so for temporarily I can
disable these validation controls if I
want to do that select the validation
control and set enabled property to
false and the moment I do that
validation is not going to happen either
on the client or on the server okay so I
enter an invalid email address I click
Save look at that it says data saved
which means page dot each valid property
has returned it true okay again this
enabled property is supported by all
validation controls on this slide you

and sequel server interview questions
that's it for today thank you for
listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
