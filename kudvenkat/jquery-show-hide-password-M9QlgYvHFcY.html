this video we'll discuss how to toggle
password visibility using show/hide
password checkbox let me explain what I
mean next to the password field we are
going to have this checkbox show
password if this check box is not
checked then we want the password to be
masked on the other hand if the show
password checkbox is checked then we
want the password to be in clear text
and visible to the user let's see how to
achieve this using jQuery let's flip to
region studio here I already have the
HTML to produce this UI so we have that
little text password following that we
have an input field of type equals
password so this is going to produce
this text box and following that we have
a check box and to get this check box we
are using another input field of type
checkbox and following that we have this
little text show password so this HTML
right here is going to produce this UI
now since the type of this input field
is password by default if you type
anything into this field it's going to
be masked now when we check this
checkbox we want that text to be in
clear text and visible to the user let's
see how to achieve that using jQuery so
with NOAA ready function let's first
find this check box and this check box
has got an ID CB show password so let's
use the jQuery ID selector to find that
check box and when we click on the check
box we want to call a function now I'm
going to find this password text box
again this text box is got an ID
txt password so we are going to use the
ID selector find that password text box
and then what I'm going to do is use the
attr function and change the type
attribute of this input field now if we
change the type
tribute to text then whatever you have
typed into that password text box it
will be in clear text and visible to the
user on the other hand if it is if it's
type is password then it will be masked
and not visible so I'm going to change
dynamically the type attribute of this
input field so we are going to change
the type attribute but I am NOT going to
hard-code that I'm going to change the
value of the type attribute depending on
the check that status of this show
password checkbox so now look at this we
are in the context of this checkbox
click so here dollar this is going to
refer the check box and I'm going to
check if it is clicked so I'm going to
use es and the selector here is going to
be : checked so what is this expression
going to do it's going to return true or
false if it returns true then we know
the checkbox is checked if the checkbox
is checked then we want the password to
be in clear text so I'm going to set the
type attribute to text else I am going
to set it to password if it is not
checked so just one line of code there
so let's look at this in action let's
save the changes let's reload this page
and look at this let's type a password
so by default when the page loads the
type attribute is set to password so
anything that we type into this text box
that is going to be masked now when we
click this check box what's going to
happen you know the type attribute will
be set to text and when the type
attribute is set to text what's going to
happen the text that is already present
when the text box will be in clear text
and visible to us look at this it's
visible now when I uncheck the type
attribute will be set to password and as
a result the value that we have in the
text box will be masked look at this so
when I check it it's in clear text
invisible
check it it's masked right now this you
know is great it's working but the
problem with this approach is that it's
not going to work
in ie8 and earlier versions let's let's
open this in ie8 and see if this is
going to work the same way so I'm going
to browse this page with Internet
Explorer now at the moment on my machine
I have ie 11 so this is going to work in
IE 11 without any problem look at this
when I check show password I can see it
when I uncheck it it's masked because
this is running an IE 11 now let's
launch developer tools and change the
mode to IE 8 okay
let's go back and type a password here
and look at this when I check this
checkbox it's not working that's because
with the IE 8 and earlier versions
once you have set the type attribute of
an input field you cannot change it
later that's the reason why it does not
work in IE 8 and earlier versions okay
now let's modify this code so that it's
going to work in all versions including
IE 8 and earlier versions ok so I'm
going to delete all this code I'm going
to create a variable here let's call
this current password field and the
password field has got an ID
txt password so let's use the jQuery ID
selector and find that password field
and let's create another variable and
let's call this current password and I'm
going to retrieve the value that is
present you know within this current
password field so current password field
dot value so that should give us the
value that is present in the password
field textbox and then what I'm going to
do is remove this you know password
field from the Dom okay so current
password field dot remove
and then I'm going to check okay if
dollar this dot is checked so if the
checkbox is checked that is if show
password checkbox is checked then what
I'm going to do is add a new field of
type equals text okay so I'm going to
say dollar this and use the before
method so at the moment you know when we
click the button what is this going to
do this is going to remove the password
field and if the show password checkbox
is checked
I'm going to use you know before
function and then add a new input field
to the Dom element so I'm going to add a
new input field type equals text and
let's give it an ID equals we are going
to use the same ID txt password and
value equals so notice that we have
retrieved the value that the user has
typed into the password text box into
this variable so I'm going to use this
variable current password and to that
lets append
all right so what is this going to do
this is going to add a new input field
of type equals tags to the DOM and the
value attribute is set to the password
that we have retrieved you know from the
password field that we have just removed
right and if it is not checked that
means we don't want the password to be
visible to the user in that case we are
going to add you know a new input field
in this case the type of the field is
going to be password when we set the
type to password then it will not be in
clear text and not visible to the user
okay all right so let's save the changes
let's go ahead and run this look at this
now let's type a password and then we
click show password look at that it's
visible and when I entered that it's
masked okay so it's working in Google
Chrome let's try the same thing in IE so
browse with internet explorer and this
is going to work in IE 11 so it works
now let's change the browser mode to IE
8
and let's change let's type a password
let's check this checkbox look at that
it works in ie8 as well okay now why is
it working now it's working now because
we are not changing the type here we are
adding a new field right so we are
retrieving what about password the user
has typed into the password field and
then if the show password checkbox is
checked then we are adding a new input
field of type equals text and for this
new input field we are setting the value
attribute to the password that we have
retrieved from the field that was
already there on the other hand if it is
not checked it's going to come to the
else part in that case we are adding an
input field of type equals password
again the value attribute of this
textbox is also set the password that we
have retrieved okay so this code is
going to work in all browsers including
IE 8 and earlier versions and here is
that code which we have just discussed
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
