tutorial in this video we'll discuss the
feature of conditional mapping and
entity framework with database first
approach let us understand what
conditional mapping can do with an
example we'll be using this employee's
table for this demo is terminated column
within this table is used to determine
if an employee is a terminated employee
or not and let's say in the application
that we are developing we always need
only the employees were not terminated
if that's the case then in the query
we'll always have to include the filter
across our entire application
conditional mapping an entity framework
can be used to apply such a permanent
filter on the entity itself so that the
generated sequel query will always have
the where clause let's see how to
achieve this obviously the first step
here is to create the employee's table
itself which I have already done and
here is the sequel script that can do it
I'll have the script available on my
blog in case you need it now let's flip
to visual studio here I have an empty
asp.net web application project I have
already installed the ad or an entity
framework now the first step here is to
add a new item to this project and
that's going to be the area dotnet
entity data model and let's give this
model a meaningful name let's call it
employee model and we want to generate
our model from the database so select
that option click Next give the
connection string a meaningful name
let's call this employee dbcontext
click Next this is going to connect to
the database and retrieve all the tables
views and stored procedures so let's go
and select the employees table and give
this model namespace a meaningful name
and click finish so this should generate
the employee model for us based on that
employees table now I have already added
a webform to this project and if you
notice what I have done so far is
dragged and dropped a grid view control
let's flip this to the design mode and
auto format this and choose this
colorful scheme and then within the
code-behind file let's create an
instance of employee dbcontext
so employee dbcontext equals new
employee dbcontext and employees
property should return all the employees
which we are going to set as the data
source for our grid view control and
then let's invoke the data bind method
all right before we run this waveform
let's actually flip the sequence of a
management studio fire up sequel
profiler and then let's run a new trace
all right so the trace is running now
let's go ahead and run our waveform so
now all the employees will be loaded you
know both terminated and the employees
who are not terminated so we have seven
employees in the database and all of
them are displayed here and if you look
at the sequel trace that's running look
at the query that is generated you know
we don't have a where clause here all
the columns are basically selected from
that employees table now let's say in
our application we are not really
bothered about terminated employees
there's no need for them to load into
the application you know if that's the
case you know it's very easy to load the
employees who are not terminated what we
can do is here we can use a ver clause
and say we're employee such that
employee dot is terminated equals false
so now what is this going to do this is
going to return only the employees who
are not terminated so let's go and run
this once more and then look at this now
we only got you know the employees who
are not terminated and if you look at
sequel profiler here look at this there
is a ver clause here
you know where is terminated equals zero
okay so but you know let's say I have
another page you know where I need to
load employees who are not terminated
then they're also I have to include this
a ver method okay so in our entire
application wherever you know we need to
load employees every
time we have to include that we're
method now instead of this we can use
the feature of conditional mapping n
entity framework to apply a permanent
filter on the entity itself so that you
know the entity framework is
automatically going to include that via
clause in the generated sequel let's see
how to achieve that so to use
conditional mapping you know first right
click on the entity and select table
mapping option and then we specify our
condition okay so let's go to the your
net entity model designer right click on
the entity select table mapping and look
at this we have an option here to add a
condition so I'm going to select here is
terminated and look at this I'm going to
say when used terminated equals false
okay now if you want to compare against
null values then you have another
operator here is when you select that
you have two options you know whether
the column values is null or not now
here we always have something populated
within the database table for that
column so I'm going to use equal to
operator instead of now so equal to
false okay now at this point if I build
a solution look at this I have a an
error and similarly even if I validate
the model we will still have the same
error so when we build a validate after
adding this condition we have this error
and why is that that's basically because
a table column in this case is
terminated table column is mapped more
than once we have mapped it in this
conditional mapping here as well as in
this property mapping here okay so we
cannot actually map a you know a table
column more than once and that's why we
get that error you know the error is the
same thing problem in mapping fragment
starting at that line member is
terminated so that is the column which
is throwing that error okay so to get
rid of that error all we need to do
is delete that property from the entity
now let's build a solution notice that
okay does not contain a definition for
East terminated look at that why do we
have that error that's basically because
if you look at the where clause
you know we removed East terminated
property from the employee entity that's
the reason why we have that error so
let's get rid of that condition from
there and then now let's build a
solution so bill succeeded and similarly
if we go ahead and validate the model so
validation completed okay now let's go
ahead and run our webform one the sequel
trace is still running and notice that
we only have the employees who are not
terminated and if you look at sequel
profiler here look at that you know we
have all the columns except the East
Terminator column because we remove that
from the entity and then look at the
where clause there is a where clause so
this where Clause is going to ensure
that only the employees who are not
terminated are loaded now there is no
need for us to include you know that ver
Clause manually you know in all the
places where we are loading employees
that's automatically generated for us
you know with that conditional mapping
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
