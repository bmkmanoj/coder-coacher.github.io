tutorial in this video we'll discuss how
to use link to sequel to retrieve data
from the sequel server database but
before that let's understand what is
linked to sequel link to sequel is an
ORM framework object relational mapping
framework that can automatically create
strongly-typed dotnet classes based on
database tables we can then write link
to sequel queries in any dot in
supported language in between the
application and the database there is
another component called linked to
sequel provider so this component is
responsible for inspecting the incoming
link query and then translating that
link very into corresponding transact
sequel that the underlying database can
understand linked to sequel fully
supports transactions views and stored
procedures but keep in mind link to
sequel only supports sequel server
database databases like Oracle db2 are
not supported by link to sequel since
link to sequel models a relational
database using that strongly type that
dot in classes we have intelligent
support compile-time error checking and
debugging support let's now look at an
example of retrieving data from a sequel
server database using link to sequa
let's slip to sequel server management
studio so here we've got the sample
database and within that we've got
departments and employees tables here is
the sequel script to create and populate
these tables with sample data
I'll have the script available on my
blog in case you need it now what we
want to do is retrieve employee's data
and then display that within an asp.net
web application so let's flip to visual
studio here I have a new empty asp.net
web application project so to this
project let's add a new item make sure
you select data under install the
templates select link to sequel classes
and let's change the name of this file
to sample dot DB ml so now click on this
link server Explorer so that's going to
open up the server Explorer window
expand data connections and expand you
know this connection to the sample
database and then once we expand tables
folder we should find departments and
employees tables now once we drag and
drop these tables onto the designer
notice that this designer is
automatically going to create entities
for those two tables so departments
table has this department entity and
employee entity maps to employees table
and these properties maps to the columns
in the respective tables and also notice
that there is an association between
department and employees so this
association is modeled up based on the
primary key and foreign key relationship
so within the employees table Department
ID is a foreign key so based on that
relationship this link to sequel
designer is able to model the
association between these two entities
so notice the arrow is pointing from
Department to employees meaning there's
a one to many relationship between
department and employees entities so a
department can have one or more
employees so now to this project let's
add a webform and on this web form
let's drag and drop a gridview control
so let's save everything now let's go to
the code-behind file now when we drag
and drop these tables on to the design
it has created these tables and it has
also placed a connection string within
the web config file and if you look at
the sample door designer dot CS file has
automatically created a class called
sample data context now we'll discuss
this class in detail in a later video
session for now just understand that
this PLAs is the entry point into the
database so if we have to get anything
from the database we have to create an
instance of this class and then use that
to retrieve any data so within the page
load event let's create an instance of
that class sample data context let's
call this dbcontext equals new sample DB
context now this dbcontext object escort
employee's property so this property is
going to return all the employees for
employees table and we also have
departments property so this property is
going to return all the departments that
are present in the department's table
now let's retrieve all employees from
the employees table and then we have got
this creepy one control so let's set
those employees as the data source for
the grid view control and then let's
call the data bind method so now when we
run this we should have all the
employees displayed within the grid view
control within this waveform now let's
actually write a link really here and
let's do some filtering and sorting now
instead of displaying every employee
within the grid we control what we want
to do is from employee in DB context dot
employees where employee dot gender so
we want only male employees and we also
want to sort these employees by salary
notice that we get intellisense now if
we make any errors you know let's say
for example salary if we misspell that
we will have you know a compilation
error right away okay so order by
employee dot salary descending and we
want to select all such employees so
here we've got a link query right so
let's actually run this and see if we
get only the male employees so we got
only male employees and they are sorted
by salary in descending order now the
interesting thing to note here is that
notice that here we have not written any
transact sequel query all we have
written here is a link query ok but
sequel server does not understand link
where it only understand transact sequel
so what's happening behind the scenes
how is the application able to retrieve
data from the sequel server database so
between the application
and this equals server database we have
this component called link to sequel
provider okay so the application issues
this query ok the link very so this link
to sequel provider is going to inspect
that query and then it's going to
generate the corresponding transact
sequel and then that gets executed
against the sequel server database and
the sequel server database is going to
return the matching employee rows back
to this link to sequel provider so this
link to sequel provider is going to take
those rules and for each row it has
retrieved it is going to create an
employee object and then populate the
properties of the employee object from
that raw data so if we have for example
let's say five rows returned there will
be five employee objects created and
those five employee objects will then be
returned to the application the
application just simply displays those
employee objects so that's how the link
to sequel actually works that's it for
today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
