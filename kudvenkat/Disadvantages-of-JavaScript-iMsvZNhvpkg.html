tutorial in this video we'll discuss the
disadvantages are downsides of using
javascript there are two main
disadvantages the first one is related
to security JavaScript runs on the
client machine
this means a malicious user may use
JavaScript to do a variety of things
like tracking your browsing history
stealing passwords etc JavaScript can
also spread viruses that's one of the
main reasons why people disable
JavaScript on the machine if we don't
trust a specific website then I think
it's wise to disable JavaScript for that
website because we don't know what the
JavaScript of that website will be doing
on our machine another disadvantage is
related to browser compatibility not all
browsers treat the same piece of
JavaScript in the same manner
this means the functionality and the
user interface may vary from browser to
browser that's why cross browser testing
is very important by cross browser
testing we mean testing the web
application with different browsers that
is with Google Chrome Microsoft Internet
Explorer and Mozilla Firefox and see how
the web application behaves
however with JavaScript libraries like
jQuery browser compatibility is no
longer a major issue we will discuss
jQuery in detail in a later video
session let's look at a few examples
related to browser compatibility it is
the first example in a text property is
supported only in IE and chrome but not
in firefox this means if you recollect
the validate form javascript function
that we worked with in part 1 of this
video series this javascript function is
going to work only in IE and chrome but
not in firefox let's look at that in
action let's flip to visual studio so
here we have that javascript function
validate form and notice within this
function we are using inner text
property now basically we are using this
property to display this validation
message you know using this label
control now this javascript function is
going to work only in chrome and ie but
not in Firefox let's quickly test that
let's go to Google Chrome so let's
reload the web form and click the submit
button
notice that the validation works now
let's go to ie reload the web form click
the submit button it works now let's go
to Firefox reload the web form click the
submit button notice that you know the
JavaScript function does not work in
Firefox as expected why is that
that's because Firefox does not support
in a text property so if we want this
JavaScript function to work across all
the three browsers then instead of that
inner text property we should be using
text content property so let's go ahead
and replace this inner text with text
content so + control H so we want to
replace inner text with text content and
let's replace all the instances of that
property on this current document now
with this change let's save the changes
and let's go back to Chrome reload the
web form click the submit button it
still works now let's do the same thing
with an Internet Explorer reload the web
form click the submit button
validation still works let's go to
Google Mozilla Firefox reload the web
form click the submit button look at
that it now works so this is one example
related to browser compatibility let's
look at another example so here I have a
piece of HTML so basically we have the
server-side form tag and then we have
the div HTML element and within that
development we have caught a select
element with these two options male and
female so basically this select element
is going to display a drop-down list and
the ID of this drop-down list is TDL
gender and whenever the selection in
this drop-down list changes then we want
to call this DDL gender selection change
client-side JavaScript function and we
have that client-side JavaScript
function right here and what does this
function going to do it's going to
simply display a message you selected
whatever value we have selected from the
drop-down list if we have selected male
then it's going to display you
elected male within an alert box now
this piece of JavaScript function is
going to work in Chrome and Firefox but
not an IE let's look at that in action
so here I have already added a webform
and I named it Feb form too and if you
look at you know this exactly the same
HTML that we have seen on the slide a
select element present inside a
development and then we have the
function DDL selection change now let's
go to Chrome and let's navigate to web
form tool and let's select in our female
look at that we get the message you
select it female within an alert box now
let's do the same thing in Firefox
so let's navigate to webform - and then
select female notice that we get an
alert saying you selected female let's
go to ie
and navigate to the form tool and select
female look at that we don't get that
alert box so this piece of JavaScript is
behaving differently in IE okay now if
we want this JavaScript function to work
across all the three browsers then we
should be changing this line right here
to something like this so we should be
using document dot get element by ID
function and then pass the ID of the
HTML element and then use the value
property so this piece of code is going
to work across all the three browsers so
let's look at that in action so let's go
back to visual studio and then change
this to document dot get element by ID
and then we are going to pass the ID of
the drop-down list and then use the
value property so now let's save these
changes now let's go back to Google
Chrome reload this platform - and select
female look at that we still get the
alert now go to Firefox reload the
waveform and sell it female it still
works now let's do it an Internet
Explorer reload the waveform select
female and we get the alert now
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
