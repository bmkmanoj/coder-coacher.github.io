tutorial and this video will disk is
querying XML document using link to XML
in parts 1 and 2 of this video series we
discussed creating XML document is
England to XML in this video we'll
discuss how to query XML document using
link to XML what we want to do is
retrieve all the student names from this
XML who has total marks greater than 800
we also want the student names to be
sorted by total marks in descending
order so let's see how to achieve this
let's flip to zeal studio this is the
same example that we worked with in the
previous video session this is the piece
of code that helped us create this data
or that XML file which contains student
data so let's delete this piece of code
and write our link very instead so what
we are going to get back is list of
student names which means we'll be
getting back
i enumerable of string objects
ienumerable is present in system dot
collections dot generic namespace so
let's bring that in so i enumerable off
string and let's call the variable names
equals so the link where is going to
start with from keyword from student n
so we need to load our XML data so we
are going to make use of this X document
class and it has got the static method
load all we need to do is specify the
part of the XML file from where we want
to load the XML data so let's get the
path of this XML file and then pass that
to this method so now from this XML file
we want all the descendants of this
student element right so we are going to
make use of descendants method so dot
descendents of student element so once
we have the descendents of student
element then we want to do some
filtering so we are going to make use of
where keyword we only want students who
has total marks greater than 800 so
where student dot element of total marks
so we want to typecast total marks to
integer type so we only want students
who has caught total marks greater than
800 and we want to sort the students by
name I mean by total marks in descending
order so we are going to make use of
this order by class so order by total
marks descending and then we want to
select name of the student
so select student dot element what is
the name of the element its name so we
want the name value so all that is left
now is to use a for each loop so for
each string name and names let's print
out the name of the student onto the
console so this console class is present
in the system namespace so let's bring
that in first
let's run this and notice that we get
the three students who has total marks
greater than 800 and their names are in
descending order you know of total marks
okay so this is one way of writing that
link really so we are using descendants
here which is going to give us the
descendants of student element okay
instead of that we can also write this
link very like this dot element so we
first start from the root element which
is too dense and then from there we want
elements what elements we want student
element
and then from that we are getting total
marks and then named elements so now
when we run this we should get the
identical output so two ways of writing
the same query that's it for today thank
you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
