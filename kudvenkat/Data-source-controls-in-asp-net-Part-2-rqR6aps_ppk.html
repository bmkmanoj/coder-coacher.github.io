venket this is part 2 of asp.net
grid-view tutorial in this video we'll
discuss about different data source
controls that are available in asp.net
there are several of them as you can see
on the slide for example let's say I
have some data in an XML file and I want
to retrieve data from that XML file and
then bind that to a grid view control so
which data source control can I use I
can make use of the XML data source
control now if my data is stored in a
Microsoft Access database then I can
make use of access data source now let's
say if my data is available in a sequel
server database then which data source
control do I use I can make use of
sequel data source control on the other
hand if my data is available in an
Oracle database then which control can I
use again sequel data source now
remember sequel data source control can
be used to work with databases like
sequel server any oily DB or ODBC
databases or even Oracle databases don't
get confused by the name sequel data
source it doesn't mean you can only use
it to work with sequel server you can
also use it to work with other databases
as well we will actually be talking
about each of these data source controls
in detail in our upcoming videos now the
point to keep in mind here is that prior
to the introduction of these data source
controls developers had to write a few
lines of code to retrieve and bind data
with these data I know with the data
bind controls like data grid grid view
data let's drop down list etc but with
the introduction of these data source
controls we don't have to write even a
single line of code to do that let's
actually understand that with an example
but before that keep in mind to bind
data to any data bound control basically
we can achieve that in two ways we can
do that by using these data source
controls or without using these data
source controls first let's look at how
to do that
without using data source controls for
example I have this table called TBL
products now let's say I want to
retrieve this data from the sequel
server database and then bind this to a
data Brown control like a grid view
control let's see how to do that without
using sequel I mean datasource controls
basically so I have this grid view
control dragged and dropped on this
waveform all today and then if
I am NOT using data source control then
obviously I will have to write all the
code myself by hand now I have this ATO
dotnet code already typed so let me copy
that and paste that on this waveform so
obviously what are we doing here we have
a connection string defined in web
config file so DB connection string is
the name of the connection string and
then look at what we are doing here we
are reading the connection string from
web config file using the configuration
manager class and then we are preparing
the sequel connection object using that
connection string then preparing our
sequel command object and this command
is executed using that connection object
open the connection retrieve data set
that data as the data set for the grid
view control and invoke data bind so all
these things we have to do in code so if
I am not using you know data source
controls then we have to write code
basically to do all these steps okay and
then obviously when I run this as you
might expect you know it will execute
that command select star from TBL
products retrieve data and display that
in the grid view control so here we are
not using datasource controls so we have
to write code ourselves to do all those
steps okay so we have the data there now
let us see you know when we use
datasource controls you know how easy it
is to actually configure that data
source control and then we will be able
to retrieve data without writing even a
single line of code so let's do that so
I have another waveform here waveform 2
dot aspx on this waveform 2 I have this
grid view control now on this grid view
control I want to display the same data
so I'm going to go to my toolbox and
then I'm going to use sequel data source
control because my data at the moment is
present in sequel server and I'm going
to use sequel data source control so let
me drag and drop that on to the waveform
and click on this button and click on
configure datasource
so obviously now I will have to tell the
sequel data source control you know
where my database is present ok now in
web dot config file we have already seen
that we have a connection string so if I
drop that list down I can see the
connection string that's present in web
config file select that so now this data
search control knows which sequel server
to connect and which database to connect
to
in that sequel server installation so
when I click Next now within that
database you know in this case we are
connecting to sample database
so whatever tables we have all the
tables will be listed you know on the
screen but I want the data from TBL
products so I'm going to select that
table and I basically want all the
columns so I'm going to leave that start
selected and then click Next we can even
test it ready if we want and then click
finish
so my data source control is now
configured and if you look at this data
source control now look at that it has
got this connection string property
which basically has the information
about the sequel server and the database
to connect to and the Select command
property specifies what command needs to
be executed on that database okay
now all that is left is you know for
this sequel data I mean for this grid
view control specify the data source
control that we have to use and then we
can do that
you know graphically by selecting it
from this drop-down list choose your
data source so I can select our sequel
data source one here or you can also
associate that you know in the source
directly so every data bound control has
got a property called data source ID so
data source ID is equal to the ID of the
data source control which knows how to
retrieve you know which knows to connect
to which sequel server and what data to
retrieve okay so in our case it's going
to be sequel data source one so I'm
going to grab that and specify it here
that's it we are done now let's run this
and as you might expect you know the
data is going to be the same on this
platform to be retrieve data without
using you know any code by using the
sequel data source control if you look
at our waveform to dot aspx in the page
where you don't have any code whatsoever
but whereas on webform one dot aspx way
we have not used you know a sequel data
source control we have to write you know
this code basically to connect and to
execute that command retrieve data so if
you are using data source control we
have we don't have to write even a
single line of code all you have to do
is drag and drop it as control on the
waveform configure the data source
control to connect to a data source like
a database and retrieve data finally a
Susi
that datasource control to a data bound
control using data source ID property
okay and and please keep in mind all
data bound controls has this data source
ID property you know there are several
data bound controls like drop-down list
checkbox list etc for example let's say
I want to display the same data you know
whatever that's present in sequel
datasource one control I want to display
that data in a drop-down list can I do
that absolutely let me drag and drop
this drop-down list for example on this
web form so that's the drop-down list
and look at this this drop-down list
also has you know choose datasource so
when I click that I can select the
datasource sequel datasource one now you
have an additional thing to do here
because a drop-down list you know there
are two things that we need to specify
the value that we want to display to the
end user I mean the text basically and
this text item will also have a value
behind it which will basically be stored
in the database okay so what is the
drop-down list it's a collection of list
item objects we have discussed about
that in our asp.net tutorial so if you
new to drop-down list I strongly
recommend to watch you know videos on
asp.net drop down list but then a drop
down list object is a collection of list
item objects and a list item object has
a text in the value property so what is
the value that you want to display for
text property let's say I want to
display name and maybe for value I want
to display
you know the ID property itself okay so
I click OK that's it we are done now
when I run this obviously the same data
will be shown both in the grid view
control and in the drop-down list so as
you can see there okay so keep in mind
all data bound controls has this data
source ID property meaning you can
associate these data source controls
with any data bound control we will be
talking about the rest of the you know
data source controls in our upcoming
videos on this slide you can find
resources for asp.net c-sharp and sequel
server interview questions that's it for
today thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
