I am venket this is part 6 of asp.net
grid-view tutorial in this video we'll
discuss about access data source control
in asp.net if you want to retrieve data
from Microsoft Access database and then
display it in a grid view control or any
data bound control without even writing
a single line of code then access data
source control can be used let's
understand that with an example let's
first create a sample Microsoft Access
database and then try and use that
within an asp.net web application
project using access data source control
so click on start all programs Microsoft
Office Microsoft Access 2010 and click
on this folder icon now this allows us
to navigate to the location where we
want to save the sample Microsoft Access
database so I basically want to save
this to C colon backslash data folder
and then I want to call my database as
products database because I am going to
store some products related information
and depending on the version of
Microsoft Access you have the database
may have an extension of dot accdb
dot or dot m DB etc so let me select up
accdb and I click OK and now click on
this create button so that should create
products dot accdb Microsoft Access
database within sequel and data folder
and by default look at this I have an ID
column here which is going to act as a
primary key for this table let's add a
few more columns let's add a text column
and I'm going to call this product name
and then let's add another column but
this time let's add in number column and
let's call this unit price
ok let's store some sample data into
this table so let's say for example I
want to store I phone and maybe unit
price is 200 and then maybe iPad and
even prices maybe 150 and finally maybe
laptops and maybe unit price is 250 all
right we have got some sample data in
this table let's go and save this table
let's call this TBL products
okay so our table within this products
database is TBL products our table so
let's close this so within our C colon
data folder I have this products a CCD a
Microsoft Access database and I want to
use this in an asp.net web application
project so let's flip to visual studio
let's drag and drop a grid view control
onto this webform and now I want to use
this Access database within our asp.net
web application project so I'm going to
copy this and then let's flip to visual
studio now I can store my Access
database within app data folder or I can
create my own data folder and paste it
there so depending on how you want to
organize your data you can do you know
you can create a new folder if you wish
to but I'm going to paste this Access
database into into this app data folder
so right click on that click on paste
that should move you know copy the
Access database into our asp.net web
application project all that is left out
is retrieve data from that database and
display that in the critique control and
the easiest way to do that is by using
access data source control so let's go
to toolbox let's drag and drop access
data source control on to the webform
and click on the smart tag button click
on this configure data source and then
we need to select the Microsoft Access
database file click on the Browse button
go to your app data folder and select
products dot accdb and now click Next
look at this it will automatically
detect the table that's present in that
database in our case it's TBL products
and it has got all these columns look at
this I want all the columns to be
retrieved and displayed in the grid view
control so I'm saying select star from
TBL products and then click Next it will
give you an option to test the query so
click on test query so I have my sample
data there finally click finish
we are done configuring access to the
source control all that is left out is
to associate this axis datasource
control with this grid view control and
to do that click on the grid view
control click on that smart tag button
and from the choose data source
drop-down list select access data source
1 that's it we are done let's go ahead
and run this we may get an error if
that's the case there is
configuration that we need to do now
look at this if you get this error
Microsoft oledb 12.0 provider is not
registered on the local machine then
what you basically need to do is
navigate to this URL and then there will
be two versions of access database
engine there a 64-bit version that says
underscore x64 and a 32-bit version you
know so let's navigate to that you are
also on this URL as you can see there
are two database engines this one with
an x64 says this is for the 64-bit
version and this is for 32-bit version
now let's understand what we mean by
that which we need to install now on
your machine if you have a 64-bit
operating system so how do I figure out
which version of operating system I have
it's very simple you need to click on
start right click on computer go to
properties the computer properties
window should tell you what version of
operating system you have look at this I
have a 64-bit operating system so if
your operating system is 64-bit and your
MS Office is also 64-bit so now how do I
figure out my MS Office is 64-bit or
32-bit again that's very easy click on
staff go to Microsoft Access or excel
whatever open that and then on the start
page click on help and here you should
see whether the Microsoft Access is
32-bit or 64-bit in my case it's a
32-bit version so on my machine I have a
64-bit operating system and a 32-bit
Microsoft Office installation if that's
the case then install Access database
engine a 32-bit version which is this
one on the other hand if both the OS is
64-bit and MS Office is also 64-bit then
install the 64-bit version which is this
one all right after you install this if
you if you have MS Office 32-bit you may
still have the issue if that's the case
then what we basically need to do is in
application pool there is a property
call enable 32-bit applications we need
to turn that to true ok let's understand
what we mean by this look at this my web
application is
more and then when I actually run this
application look at how it's running it
is running using you know my local is
you know there I have an application
called demo so that's the application
that I am using to run this application
so now let's go ahead and see what is
the application pool that this
application is associated with and to do
that I need to go to is and to get to is
click on start go to control panel
Administrative Tools so in system and
security you should see something called
Administrative Tools and then within
that you should see is manager so
navigate to iis and then within is
expand the root node and then go to size
and then look at this I have this demo
application and then right click on that
go to basically manage application
advanced it settings and within that you
should see the application pool with
which this application is associated its
associated with default app pool so now
let's go to application pools in is we
should see an application pool with
default app pool so in default app a
pool what you need to do is go to the
advanced it settings and then there
enable 32-bit applications now it's set
to false so turn that to true and that's
it that should get rid of that error now
let's go ahead and run this application
and let's see if that error goes away so
now it should be able to connect you
know to our Microsoft Access database
retrieve the data and display it there
and that's what happens on this slide
