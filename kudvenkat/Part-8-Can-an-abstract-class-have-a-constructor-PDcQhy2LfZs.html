questions video series in this video
will answer this interview question can
an abstract class have a constructor if
so what's the use yes an abstract class
can have a constructor in general a
class constructor is used to initialize
fields along the same lines an abstract
class constructor is used to initialize
fields of the abstract class let's look
at an example let's first create an
abstract class let's call it customer
and let's include a private field and
the written type of this private field
is going to be a grade that is a
globally unique identifier let's call it
underscore ID and to expose this private
field to the external world let's
include a public property and we want
this property to be read-only so I'm
going to include only the get access are
all right now to initialize this private
field of this abstract class I'm going
to include a constructor within this
abstract class constructors will have
same name instead of the class and they
will not have a return type so let's use
this constructor now to initialize this
private field and we want this to be
initialized to a new globally unique
identifier and to do that I'm going to
invoke new grid function on the grid
class all right now let's say in our
business we have two types of customers
savings customers and corporate
customers so let's create a class let's
call it a corporate customer and this
class is going to derive from our
abstract customer class let's have
savings customer class and this class is
also going to derive from the abstract
customer class now let's go ahead and
create an instance of corporate customer
class
now corporate customer class derives
from customer class and this customer
class has got public ID property so this
property should be available on the
instance of this corporate customer
class and let's write the ID to the
console along the same lines let's go
and create an instance of our savings
customer class and let's print the ID of
savings customer as well all right so
let's go ahead and run this now and as
you might expect we should get a
globally unique identifier both for
corporate customer and savings customer
so here within the abstract class we are
using the constructor to initialize the
fields of this abstract class okay we
would also provide a constructor for an
abstract class if we want to initialize
certain fields of the abstract class
before the instantiation of a child
class takes place now here we have two
child classes savings customer and
corporate customer both of them deriving
from the abstract customer class now
let's say we want a globally unique
identifier to be assigned to this ID
field even before an instance of either
corporate customer or savings customer
class is created then this is another
use case where we would use a
constructor within the abstract class
let's actually prove that the abstract
class constructor is called before even
the constructor of the child class and
to prove that let's include a
constructor within the derived class
and let's also include a constructor
with in savings customer class all right
now let's take in a breakpoint here here
in the abstract class constructor and
within the main method let's run this
look at this we are trying to create an
instance of corporate customer class now
when I + f11 look at that so it's coming
to the corporate class which is child
class it's trying to execute the
constructor of the child class when I +
f11 notice what is going to happen look
at that it comes to the base class
constructor
now I + f11 look at that a globally
unique identifier is assigned to this
field now when I press f11 now it has
come to the constructor of the derived
class now it is executing the
constructor of the child atlast
so this proves that the constructor of
the parent class is constructor is
called
before the constructor of the derived
class so if at all if there is a need to
initialize certain fields of the
abstract class even before the
instantiation of a child class takes
place then this is another use case
where we would use a constructor within
the abstract class and an abstract class
constructor can also be used to execute
code that is relevant for every child
class this prevents code duplication now
if we look at this implementation at the
moment this ID field is common to both
corporate customer and savings customer
ok now the code to initialize this field
is present within the abstract class now
if we were to move this code into the
derived classes obviously we will end up
with this duplicated code in both the
classes let's actually move it so let me
copy it paste it within the corporate
customer class and within savings
customer class
and constructors should have the same
name as that of the class so let's copy
the name of the class and paste it let's
do the same thing here and within our
base class let's get rid of this
implementation and let's make this
property abstract since that is an
abstract property we cannot have
implementation and the derived classes
need to override that property so here
we need to have override keyword let's
do the same thing for savings customer
class as well alright now let me go
ahead and run this we should get the
same output but at the moment since we
have delegated the responsibility of
initializing that common field to the
derived class
we have duplicated code in both of the
classes all right so an abstract class
constructor can also be used to execute
code that is relevant for every child
class which prevents code duplication
now you cannot create an instance of an
abstract class so what's the use of a
constructor in an abstract class though
we cannot create an instance of an
abstract class we can create instances
of the classes that are derived from the
abstract class so when an instance of a
derived class is created the parent
abstract class constructor is
automatically called now
abstract classes can't be directly
instantiated the abstract class
constructor gets executed through a
derived class so it's a good practice to
use protected access modifier with the
abstract class constructor rather than
using public access modifier using
public access modifier doesn't really
make sense let me explain what I mean
let's actually move this implementation
back into the base class
and let's get rid of this all right
keyword let's change the name of the
constructor now look at this here the
abstract class has got a public
constructor does that mean we can create
an instance of this abstract class exit
explicitly let's see what happens if we
try to do that so customer Z equals new
customer if we build this we get an
error cannot create an instance of the
abstract class and that makes sense
okay now the constructor of the abstract
class is invoked you know through
derived class constructor okay so this
constructor should be available for the
derived classes and we know that we
cannot create an instance of an abstract
class explicitly like this so having a
public access modifier like this doesn't
really make sense
so let's use protected access modifier
and that's a good practice and our
application should work in the same
manner as it used to all right that's it
for today thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
