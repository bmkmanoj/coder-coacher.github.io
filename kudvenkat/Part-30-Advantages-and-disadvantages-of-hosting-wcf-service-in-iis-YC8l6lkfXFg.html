this video we'll discuss the advantages
and disadvantages of hosting WCF service
in iis this is continuation to part 29
so please watch for 29 before proceeding
here are the list of advantages no code
required to host the service the service
host directive in dot SVG file is
responsible for creating an instance of
service host when required there is no
need to write custom code to instantiate
and start service host as it is the case
with self hosting if you recollect from
the previous sessions of this video
series we have hosted this WCF service
that is the hollow service using a
console application and hosting the WCF
service in a console application is self
hosting and if you look at this program
dot CS file notice that we are writing
code here to create an instance of
service host and then we are invoking
the open method on the service host
instance ok so we don't have to write
this same code when we host the WCF
service in is all we need is a dot SVG
file and within this file we will
specify the service hosted directive and
the service an tribute to the service
that we want to host so the service host
directive is responsible for creating an
instance of service host and starting it
when required automatic message based
activation IAS provides automatic
message based activation this means that
the service can be activated on demand
we don't have to have the service host
always running if you look at you know
self hosting for example you know we
have hosted this
hello service within this console
application so if we want our servers to
be available for the clients then you
know we have to make sure that the
console application is up and running ok
but with is we don't have to do that
once you deploy you know the project to
is you know it can be activated on
demand and it's called as message based
activation ok so when a message arrives
at the server
it launches itself automatically and
fulfills the request in case of self
hosting you know the service should
always be running and we are responsible
for ensuring that the service host
application is up and running and
another benefit is automatic process
recycling so IAS provides the capability
of automatic process recycling if the
process is not healthy and if it's
taking a very long time to service the
client request we don't get this
automatic process recycling with self
hosting and the disadvantage is that you
know if we host the WCF service in is
5.1 and is 6.0 then you know the service
is only limited to http communication
this means that we can only use HTTP
related bindings that's it for today
thank you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
