this video we'll discuss how to select
values of checked checkboxes that are
present in different groups and along
the way we'll also discuss how to pass a
variable to a jQuery selector we will be
working with the same example that we've
worked with in part 11 so please watch
part 11 before proceeding with this
video now on this page we have just one
checkbox group that is the skills check
box group and look at the selector via
using input type equals checkbox colon
checked so what is the selector going to
do it's going to return us all
checkboxes that are checked since we
have only one checkbox group on this
page this selector is going to work fine
without issues but what if we have two
checkbox groups like this notice we have
skills checkbox group and preferred
cities checkbox group and what is this
selector going to do this is going to
give us all the checkboxes that are
checked from both the groups
irrespective of whichever button you
click but that's not what we want when
we click get selected skills we only
want the checkboxes that are checked
within the skills group similarly when
we click get selected cities button we
only want the checkboxes that are
checked and are in cities group so let's
see how to achieve this we will be
modifying the example that we worked
with in part 11 so please watch part 11
before proceeding let's flip to visual
studio so this is the same example that
we worked with in the previous video
session and at the moment we only have
the skills checkbox group and to speed
things up I have already typed the
required HTML to get you know the
preferred cities checkbox group and two
button elements so look at the image
here we want preferred cities checkbox
group and two buttons get selected
skills and get selected cities and here
is the HTML for that so let's copy that
and instead of this button the submit
button here I'm going to paste the HTML
that we have copied and we look at this
HTML this is straightforward we have
three check boxes and look at the name
four three three check boxes
cities and for these skills check boxes
it is curls and then we have to break
elements and then to button elements
okay all right so let's save these
changes and let's reload so we should
get a UI that is similar to what we see
on the slide here
okay now let's wire up click event
handlers to these two buttons now let's
scroll all the way up so here is our
jQuery code and look at this this this
jQuery code is from a previous example
at the moment we have the speedy and
submit button to which the click event
handler is wired up instead we want to
wire up a click event handler to these
two buttons okay before that lets
actually encapsulate all this code which
we have written in the previous video
session into its own function so I'm
going to create a variable here so let's
name this get checked checkboxes and we
want this to be a function so I'm going
to put all this code inside that
function okay so this is a function so
I'm going to cut this function okay so
we have the click event handler for that
button so outside of that click event
handler so this is the closing of the
click event handler for this button and
this is the closing of the ready
function so the function that we have
just created I'm going to paste that
here so this is now present within the
ready function okay so now let's make a
copy of this okay and we have two
different buttons one is BTN get
selected skills and the other one is bt
and get selected cities those are the
IDS so let's wire up click event
handlers to both of those buttons so get
the button by ID and then we are wearing
up a click event handler let's do the
same thing for the other button bTW and
get selected cities
all right so when we click the button
what we want to do we want to call this
function the reason why we encapsulated
this jQuery code into a separate
function is because we are going to
reuse this function in both of these
click event handlers so that's the
reason we encapsulated it so let's call
this function within the click event
handler of both the button controls all
right so let's save those changes and if
you look at this function look at the
selector input type equals checkbox
colon checked so what is this going to
do this is going to select all the
checkboxes that are checked you know
from both the groups okay
so let's quickly look at that in action
let's reload this page and from the
skills group let's select JavaScript and
jQuery and from Cities New Delhi and
London look at that when I click collect
get selected skills it says for checkbox
is checked and it gets all the
checkboxes from both the groups you know
whatever is checked okay now look at
this when I click get selected cities I
get the same thing again okay
and that's not what we want when we
click get selected skills we only want
the checkboxes from the skills group
that are checked and the same for get
selected cities get me to check two
check boxes from the preferred cities
group so let's see how to do that
so why do we have the problem at the
moment at the moment we have that
problem because we are using type
attribute here so if you look at these
check boxes all of them are of type
check box now instead of using type
attribute why can't we use the name
attribute because name attribute is
different for the check boxes that are
present in skills group and its cities
for the check boxes that are present in
cities group so what I'm going to do
here is use the name attribute so input
name equals skills okay
but we can't hard-code it like this
what's the problem if we hard code it
like this the problem is irrespective of
whichever button you click it's always
going to give you the check boxes that
are
and present in skills group and that's
not what we want so we want this to be a
variable so we want to pass a variable
to this selector okay so to this
function I'm going to pass a variable
let's name it group name and then
instead of hard-coding the group name
like this what I'm going to do is pass
that variable in so this is the selector
beginning so I'm going to terminate that
with another single code and then
instead of this hard-coded skills name
we are going to use that group name and
then concatenate that with the rest of
the selector string okay so now this
function has got a parameter so we need
to pass a value for that parameter when
we call that function so when we click
get selected cities button the group
name is going to be cities and when we
click this get selected skills the group
name is going to be skills all right so
let's save those changes reload the page
and let's select jQuery and VB New York
and London so get selected skills look
at that we only get the check boxes that
are checked and present in skills group
and when we click get selected cities in
our two check box is checked New York
and London only the check boxes from the
preferred cities group ok now we only
have one development to display the
result that's why it so we're right in
but if you have two developments you
know you can display them separately
load in fact let's do that so at the
moment here we have one development
let's include another development and
let's actually put a break in between
those two and let's name this first Dave
Dave skills and the second one Dave
cities and look at the names both of
them are prefixed with the Dave and this
rest of the name
skills that matches with a group name
and the same is this one cities matches
with the second group and I have done
that intentionally because we can make
use of that group name here so here at
the moment the div ID is div reserved
but we don't have that div anymore
instead what I'm going to do is use the
variable name that is coming into this
function that's the group name and then
we are going to concatenate that with
this word div so if the group is kills
the div is going to be difficult if the
group name is Cities then the div is
going to be DVDs and then we are setting
the HTML on that so that's same for this
one right so let's save those changes
and let's reload this page javascript
c-sharp new york new delay and get
selected skills so to checkbox is
checked and get selected cities to
checkbox is checked and we get the
selected cities alright so at the moment
we are relying on these buttons you know
to actually get the selected checkboxes
now instead why don't we do that as soon
as the click event happens on the check
box for example when I click on jQuery
check box it should automatically say
three check boxes checked and then it
should list all the three check boxes so
let's see how to achieve that now to
achieve that all you have to do is wire
up the click event handler to all the
check boxes just like how we did it for
the button controls right so here we are
getting the button by ID and then
associating a click event handler to
that instead why don't we get you know
all the check boxes from the skills
group and then associate it click event
handler to them ok and how to get the
check boxes all the check boxes from
skills group use input type equals I
mean input name equals skills selector
so instead of the ID selector here I'm
actually going to use
input we're name equals skills so this
is going to give us all the check boxes
from the skills group and to those check
boxes we are wiring up a click event
handler and let's do the same thing for
the check boxes that are present in
city's group so here the group name is
going to be cities right so let's see if
these changes and we don't need these
buttons anymore so let's get rid of
these buttons
let's save the HTML reload the page so
we don't have the buttons anymore so now
when I select the check boxes look at
that and similarly when we select the
cities and when we uncheck you know
everything happens on a click on the
check box and here is the HTML for the
first example the jQuery code HTML for
the second example and the jQuery code
for the second example thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
