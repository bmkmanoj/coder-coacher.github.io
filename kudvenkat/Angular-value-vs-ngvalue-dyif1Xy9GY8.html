tutorial in this video we'll discuss the
difference between value and any value
directives in angular along the way
we'll also discuss how to validate a
select element with a custom option like
please select select Department etc
notice we have our Department select
list right here and our first option
select Department is selected and if we
take a look at the HTML here is that
select Department option and look at its
value it is minus 1 and since we have
this option selected by default when the
page loads look at the corresponding
property value in the model Department
value is minus 1 and angular is treating
that value as a valid selection we know
that's not a valid department and when
we have this option selected we want
angle validation system to fail the
required validation the easiest way to
get this required validation working is
by setting this default option value 2
now instead of minus 1 and when the page
initially loads we want this option to
be selected by default
so let's also initialize the
corresponding property with a value of
now so here is our model object and the
corresponding property is Department
let's initialize this property with the
value of null so select department
option is selected by default when the
page initially loads notice now the
department property value is now so if
we touch the department field and leave
that field without selecting a valid
department we get the required
validation error as soon as we select a
valid Department the validation error
disappears now look what happens when I
go back and select select Department and
leave the field we don't get the
validation error anymore so let's
understand what's going on here now if
we take a look at this department
property it looks like the value is null
so the required validation should fail
but if we take a closer look at that
notice that null verb is actually within
double quotes so it's actually a string
with those four letters a new LL and it
is not now now the obvious next question
that comes to our mind is how did it
work the first time let's reload this
page to understand that notice now the
department value is null we don't have
double quotes surrounding that word now
so it's treated as a now and because of
that when we touch the field and leave
it we get the required validation error
as soon as we select a valid Department
the validation error disappears and we
see the selected department ID as a
string against this department property
now if we go back and select the first
option now we have that now within
double quotes so now it is treated as a
string instead of now so the obvious
question that comes to our mind is how
is it working properly on the initial
page load well that's because if you
take a look at this department property
within our model we are initializing it
with null and this is what is used on
the initial page load so it's working as
expected but on our subsequent selection
it's actually using the value that we
have against this value attribute and
this value is being treated as a string
with these four letters n you ll and now
you might be wondering if we use
property binding instead of attribute
binding by wrapping this value attribute
in a pair of square brackets like that
will it work well let's take a look
notice on the initial page load it is a
proper now so when we touch the field
leave it we get the required validation
as soon as we select a valid Department
it disappears and when we go I can
select select Department its treated
again as a string so the required
validation is broken so to properly fix
this we will have to use ng value
instead of value and remember B here has
to be a capital letter notice on the
initial page load the property value is
now so the required validation should
work the same way and when we select a
valid department the validation error
disappears now when we go back and
select cell
Department they still get our validation
data back and if you look at the
department property here notice it is
still treated as a proper null value and
not as a string so the obvious question
that comes to our mind at this point is
what's the difference between value and
ng value properties well if your option
value is a simple string then you use
the value property on the other hand if
the option value is null or an object
then use ng value property for this
default option we want to treat this
value as null and not as a string and
hence we are using ng value instead of
value now if you take a look at this
option loop notice we are using value
property instead of ng value that's
because when we select a department we
want that select a department ID as a
string so since we are using the value
property notice when I select a valid
department we get that selected
department ID value as a string now if
you want the entire selected Department
object instead of this selected ID
Department string then use ng value
property instead of the value property
and we want to bind that to the
department object and keep in mind this
department object is this loop variable
right here so let's see what changes and
then take a quick look notice now when
we select a valid department we get the
entire department object whether its ID
and name property instead of just the
department ID string I hope that
explains the difference between value
and ng value while we are here let me
also give you a quick tip if you don't
want users to be able to select this
first option select Department we can
use the disabled attribute like this so
on this default option let's use the
disabled attribute notice we have select
Department selected on the initial page
load when I drop this list down look at
this tile we get you know the select
Department is
kind of greyed out meaning will not be
able to select that look at this as I
move my cursor I can select any of these
Valley departments but I am not able to
select select Department now if I click
outside of this field look at that we
have that select apartment selected and
because that's not a valid Department
selection we get the required validation
as expected now when I select a valid
Department the validation error
disappears if I want to go back and
select the first option I will not be
able to do that because we are using
disabled attribute so the important
point to keep in mind is this built-in
required validation will work on the
select element only if your default
option value is now if it is anything
other than now then it's not going to
work
in a real-world application most of the
time we load the select list options
from a database table we might also load
this default option from a database
table and when you're loading this
default option from a database table
your option value may not be now it
could be minus one or select or
something else depending on how you have
designed your table if that is the case
then this built-in required validation
will not work the only way to make it
work is by creating a custom validator
we'll discuss creating a custom
validator in our next video we don't
want the entire department object so
let's use value instead of ng value and
let's bind just to the ID property on
the department object we also don't want
our first option to be disabled so let's
remove the disabled attribute and we
want the Select Department to be
selected on the initial page load as we
have said it's value 2-1
let's also initialize its corresponding
property to minus one we forgot to
remove the square bracket so let's
remove them as well notice now the
required validation is broken it doesn't
work anymore because the default option
value is minus one will discuss how to
fix this in our next video by creating a
custom ality
and here is the example that we just
discussed thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
