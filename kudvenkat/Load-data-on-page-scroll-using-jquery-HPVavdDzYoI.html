this video we'll discuss how to load
more data on page scroll using jQuery
AJAX this is continuation to part 69 so
please watch part 69 before proceeding
here is what we want to achieve we're
going to have this database table TBL
employee let's assume this table has
thousands and thousands of rows now we
want to display this data on a web page
as you can see here but on the initial
page load we don't want to load all the
rows from the database table we only
want to load the first set of 50 rows on
the initial page load as we scroll down
on the page and when we hit the bottom
of the page that's when we want to load
the next set of 50 rows that is rows
from 51 to 100 if we scroll down again
and when we hit the bottom of the page
again then we want to load the next set
of 50 rows that is rows from 1 0 1 to
115 so this is very similar to Facebook
if you log in to your Facebook page and
as you scroll down and when you hit the
bottom of the page that's when
additional data will be loaded so let's
see how to achieve this using jQuery
AJAX so the first step here is to create
this database table which I have already
done and here is the create table script
this insert script right here is going
to insert only 5 rows I have already
inserted 200 rows into this employee
table so that's the first step create
the table and populate it with test data
the second step is to create a stored
procedure which is going to return us
page data this stored procedure is going
to have two input parameters page number
and page size if the page size is 50 and
if I ask for the first page then the
stored procedure should return rows from
1 to 50 if I ask for the second page
then the stored procedure should return
rows from 51 to 100 so let's go and
create that stored procedure let's call
this SP get employees and it's going to
have two input parameters page number
and the type is going to be integer and
paid size and the type of this parameter
is also going
be integer and within the body I'm going
to declare two integer variables so
let's call the first variable start row
and it's going to be of type integer and
the second variable is going to be and
row again of type integer now let's go
and compute the values for start row and
end row so depending on page number and
page size we should compute the start
row and end row so start row equals page
number so that's the parameter I'm going
to subtract one from that and whatever
result we get I'm going to multiply that
with paid size and whatever result we
get I'm going to add one to that now
let's go ahead and compute endru value
if this logic is not clear at the moment
don't worry when you you know work with
parameter values that's when this logic
will be clear so n Rho equals I'm going
to simply multiply page number with page
size okay now I'm going to make use of a
CTE so with let's call the CD the common
table expression result now if you're
new to CT we discuss them in detail in
our sequel server video tutorial so
please check that so let's call the CTE
result as now within the CTE I want all
the columns and all the rows from TBL
employee table now in addition to all
the columns that is ID named gender and
salary columns I also want to compute
row number and to compute row number I'm
going to use sequel server row number
function so rule number / let's order
the data by ID column in ascending order
and let's give this
a column a name within our CTE so let's
call this row number so now this CD is
going to contain all the columns from
TBL employee table and this row number
column now what I'm going to do is
select all the columns from result CTE
where row number is between you know
whatever starter and endru that we have
here so let's go ahead and issue a
select query select star from result
where row number that's the column
within our CD where row number is
between at start row and head and row
right let's go and create the stored
procedure now let's quickly go the logic
of this stored procedure let's assume we
pass page number as one and paid size as
50 so if it's paid size is 50 and if we
are asking for the first page then it
should return as rows from 1 to 50 so
let's see what we get in these variables
so here we are saying page number - 1
page number is 1 so 1 minus 1 is going
to be 0 0 x paid size page size is 50 0
x 50 is 0 and we are adding 1 to that so
0 plus 1 is 1 and row equals page number
x page size page number is 1 page size
is 50 so 1 x 50 is 50 so start row is 1
and row is 50 and here we are going to
get rows from 1 to 50 if we pass you
know page number s 2 then 2 minus 1 is 1
1 multiplied by 50 is 50 and we are
adding 1 to that 51 is the start row and
row is going to be page number is 2 and
page size is 50 so 2 multiplied by 50 is
100 so we get rows from 51 to 100 let's
quickly test this so if I pass page
number as 1 and paid size as 50 and when
we execute this we should get rows from
first of all notice here we get 50 rows
and as we scroll down we only have 50
rows and if you notice the row number
column we are getting rows from
two-fifty if we pass page number s2 and
when we execute this we should get rose
from 51 to 100 so this stored procedure
is returning us paged data now that's it
from the database side clear the table
create the stored procedure
now let's slip to our web application so
here I have included a connection string
within the web dog config file to this
database table TBL employee now let's go
ahead and create an employee class for
that let's add a class file and let's
call this employee dot cs and this class
is going to have four properties ID name
gender and salary so these properties
correspond to the columns that we have
in this TBL employee table ID name
gender and salary so we have the
employee class there next let's go and
create our web service so to this
project let's add a new item and the
item that we want to add is a web
service and let's call the service
employee service now we want the service
to be called from script so I'm going to
uncomment that line there and we're
going to write some radial or net code
here so let's go ahead and bring in the
area dot namespaces we need system dot
configuration we need systems or data
and we need system door data dot sequel
client and we also need system dot web
script dot serialization namespace
because we want to use the JavaScript
serialize a class that's present in this
namespace to serialize the output wages
and format all right so let's go ahead
and change the name of this method let's
call this function get employees and
this function is going to have two
parameters page number
and page size and this function is
actually not going to return anything so
I'm going to change the return type to
void and within the function what we are
going to do we are going to write some a
do dotnet code to retrieve data from the
sequence of a database table TBL
employee and we have already returned
that stored procedure as well the name
of the stored procedure is SP get
employees in the interest of time I have
already written the Ariat net code this
has got nothing to do with jQuery so
let's copy and paste that within our get
employees function and if you look at
this code this is straightforward ato
dotnet code so first we are creating an
object of type list employee to store
the list of employees that we want to
return and we are reading the connection
string from web config file using that
connection string we are building a
sequel connection object and then we are
building a sequel command object using
this command object we want to execute
it's true procedure with name as we get
employees since the command is executing
a stored procedure we have to tell that
to the command object using the command
type property and this stored procedure
has got two parameters that is page
number and page size so we need to
associate those parameters with the
command object so here we are creating a
parameter object so the first parameter
is page number and a value for that is
coming you know from this method
parameter similarly be creating the
second parameter of page size and the
value is coming from this second
parameter okay and we are opening the
connection executing the command looping
through the rules that we get
constructing an employee object for each
row and then populating the ID name
gender and salary properties of the
employee object adding that employee
object to the list that we have created
on the top right here okay so after we
complete this loop we'll have all the
employees added to the list and then
what we are doing finally if we are
creating an instance of the JavaScript
serialize it plans and using the
serialized method we are serializing the
list of employee objects to a JSON array
and writing that to the response
strain so straightforward ATO dotnet
code so let's go ahead and build this
project and let's quickly view this in
the browser and test our web service to
make sure it works as expected so we
have this get employees function
available let's say page number is one
and if we pass fake page size as 50 and
when we click this invoke button we
should get the 50 rows okay now if we
pass page number s2 then we should get
the second set of 50 rows that is rows
from 51 to 100 okay
all right so our web service is working
as expected
now let's go ahead and call that web
service using jQuery so I have already
added HTML page 1 dot HTML to this
project and within the body section I
have included the HTML as well so if we
view that HTML in the browser this is
how it looks like at the moment so we
have this little text the data will be
loaded on demand as you scroll down the
page and then we have a table here and
that table has got an ID TBL employee
and then within the table we have a
table head section so within the head we
have ID name gender and salary that's
what I displayed here and then we have a
body section so what we want to do now
is call the web service retrieve the
Rose using the equity Ajax loop through
each of them build a table draw and
append that tabled row to the tea body
section of this table so let's see how
to do that so first of all within our
ready function I am going to create
another function so this our JavaScript
function I'm going to call this load
data because that's what the purpose of
this function is going to be it will
load data by issuing a Ajax request and
to this function I am going to pass
current page okay
and what do we want to do we want to
issue an AJAX request and to do that we
are going to make use of this Ajax
function so let's specify the options
for the Ajax request so the first one is
going to be the URL that if you want to
issue the request to that URL is this
web service employee service dot ASM X
and within that web service we have a
function which we want to call and the
name of that function is get employees
and if you look at this function it has
got two parameters page number and page
size we have to supply values for those
parameters as well so that's the URL
that we want to call and we want to
issue a post request so I'm going to use
the method option and specify the
request type as post and since that
function has got parameters we need to
supply values for page number and page
size so I'm going to use the data
parameter and so page number so the
parameter here I mean the property here
should match the parameter that we have
here so let's actually copy that to make
sure so page number where are we going
to get the page number we are going to
get it from the function parameter so we
have a parameter coming into this
function so let's pass that here current
page and page size is the second
parameter so page size where are we
going to get that from I'm actually
going to hard-code that to 50 so page
number is coming from this parameter
page size is hard-coded 250 and the data
type that we are expecting from the
server is JSON and when the request
completes successfully I am going to
associate a callback function so this
function is going to receive the data
when the request completes and what do
we want to do with that data we want to
display those rows within this table TBL
employee so first of all let's find this
table this table has got an ID
dbl employee so I'm going to create a
variable here and let's call this EMP
table equals let's use the jQuery ID
selector and find the table we actually
want to append the rules that we are
going to build to the body section of
this table so I'm going to actually find
the body section so find a tea body
that's present in table that IDT will
employ all right now we know that this
data is a JSON object in fact it's a
JSON array we want to look to each
employee role that we have caught within
that JSON array so I'm going to use
jQuery each function so dollar data and
on that let's call the jQuery each
function and to this function let's pass
those two parameters the index of the
employee object and the employee object
itself so every time we get the employee
object so what do we want to do we want
to append to this employee table the row
that we are looping through so we want
to dynamically build a table row and
append that to this EMP table so I'm
going to use append function and what do
we want to do we want to create it here
and within the TR we are going to have a
TD so within the first TD we are going
to have the ID property value
EMP . ID and then what do we want to do
we want to close the TD and open another
TD okay so let's actually copy this and
to that what do we want to do in that TD
next we want to display the name of the
employee and to that let's append you
know we want to close the TD open
another TD EMP next we want to retrieve
or display gender and then another +
close that TD open another TD and then
we want to display salary and finally we
want to we need a plus symbol here
finally we want to close the TD and
close the TR so a little bit of string
building here but this should you know
be very clear so basically we are within
each TD we are displaying employee ID
employee named employee gender and
salary okay so as it loops through its
going to build a TR every time for every
row and then append that TR to the body
section of this table it's as simple as
that
okay so very simple load data function
here okay now we want to call this
function when the page initially loads
when the document is ready so I'm going
to call load data function and specify
that we want to load the first page of
data so I'm going to create a variable
let's call this current page number and
let's initialize that to one and let's
pass that variable to this function okay
so when the page initially loads this
function gets called and it should load
the first set of 50 rows so let's save
all these changes let's go and run that
and look at that when the page loads it
actually is loading first 50 rows and
look at this when we hit the bottom of
the page by scrolling down it doesn't
load any data on demand now what do we
want to do when we hit the bottom of the
page we want to load the next set of 50
rows let's see how to achieve that now
as we are scrolling on the page
you know what event is raised scroll
event is raised right we want to handle
or capture that event so let's go ahead
and do that so dollar vender dot scroll
so we want to associate you know some
code with that event so when that event
occurs we want to execute some code now
we don't want to load data when we
simply scroll like this you know if we
are at the top of the page when I scroll
to the half I don't want to load any
data at that point I want to load data
only when I hit the bottom of the page
right so we have to detect somehow that
the user has crawled down to the bottom
of the page and how can we do that
discuss that in detail in our previous
video session so please watch that video
before proceeding with this video so how
to detect if the user has hit the bottom
of the page
so we basically use the vendor so let's
use an if condition here so window dot
scroll top what is this function going
to do this function is going to return
as the current vertical position of the
scroll bar if that is equal to dollar
document dot height minus window height
so if this condition is true if the
current you know vertical scroll bar
position equals the document height
minus window height then that means the
user has hit the bottom of the page so
that's when we want to load additional
data and to load additional data we can
make use of this function but we want to
load the next page of data so at the
moment initially when the page loads we
are displaying the first page of data
when we hit the bottom of the page we
first want to increment this value by
one so I'm going to say current page
number plus equals one so incremented by
one and then call load data function and
pass the variable so we want page number
two if you are on page number two then
we re building limit it to page number
three and then pass that all right so
let's go and save those changes run the
page one more time and look at this now
initially it loads the first set of 50
rows and when we hit the bottom of the
page look at what's going to happen it
actually loaded the next set of 50 rows
remember we have got 200 rows in the
table so now when we hit the bottom
again look at what is going to happen
it's going to load rows from 1 0 1 to
150 and look at this when I hit the
bottom you know it should load the next
set of 50 rows so from 151 to 200 now
after 200 we don't have any rows so
nothing happens so we have displayed all
the data
in the table so here we have the stored
procedure that we have created this our
web service code it is the HTML of the
page and the jQuery code thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
