continue learning more about arrays in
our last tutorial we learnt about basics
of arrays we understood that arrays were
a way to collect multiple values using a
single variable and also that areas were
fixed-sized ordered connections they
were used to store collections of same
type of variables we learn that array
indices start at zero we also understood
how to declare arrays there were
multiple ways to declare arrays but one
of the recommended way is to provide a
data type followed by the bracket and
then to write the name of the array
there is another way also which is not
preferred where we provide the brackets
after the reference name we also learned
how to create arrays and initialize
arrays using some default values so
these were the arrays most programming
language gives you a way to same sets of
data in memory and they are usually
called collections in our last tutorial
we had seen about any declarations in
this tutorial we will learn more about
arrays now let's understand more nitty
gritties about arrays using some
examples any such actually objects by
objects I mean arrays are stored in heap
memory and not on stack memory by
objects will also mean that arrays have
some fields like length we can use
length field of array to find out the
number of elements in an array also
accessing an invalid array index causes
and exceptions let's see it is an
example so here I have a integer array
where I have initialized the array with
five integers 1 2 3 4 &amp;amp; 5 now if I print
the array 4 then I see the value 5 as
the output no type array nicest start at
0 so 1 has the index 0 2 has the index 1
3 has index 3 2 4 s index 3 and 5 s
index
note that the 5th index does not exist
but if I provide here's 5 then let's see
what happens we get any index out of
bounds exception this is what I had
mentioned here if we exist an invalid
area index we get an exception note that
we also have to learn that error
elements have some default values by
default by default values I mean that
whenever you declare any type of array
the array is initialized with some
default values so when you declare an
integer array then the values of an
array element is initialized with the
default value of integer so here in this
program I have declared multiple arrays
the first one is an integer array of
size 2 Here I am trying to print the
default value of integer array at index
1 similarly I have double array I have a
boolean array I am a string array and
then I created a dummy employee class at
bottom and I have also created an area
of employee class if I execute it I will
get 5 statements on the system out
console which will tell me the default
value of these array elements let's run
this you will understand that the
default value of an integer array
element with 0 the default value of a
double array element is 0 point 0 the
default value of boolean arrays false
the default value of string arrays null
note that string is an object and an
object is usually referenced by some
value here a element is also acting like
a reference and since the reference is
not pointing to any valid object the
value is null default value of an object
array is also null so this is what we
mentioned
air elements have default values now
size of an array can be defined at
runtime
now this is pretty interesting to
understand we had mentioned that
whenever we declare array then we have
to mention the size of the array while
we are creating an array then what does
this mean that we can provide the
runtime size of an array let us
understand by using a program let's say
I want to declare an array but I don't
know its size initially I want to take
the size from the user so I can use this
kind of class I can ask user to enter
size of an array and once he enters an
integer I do start as an array size and
then I can declare an array array is
equal to MU in and then I can provide
this array size now this way I have
declared an array and then then what I
can do is I can say the size of array is
a rate dot now when you pour say array
dot uses some previous available one of
the interesting field is length as an
array is an object and length is the
valid field we can use this and when we
run this it will ask us the size of an
array I entered ten and then we get the
input is and then we get output as the
size of arrays ten this is how we took
an input at the runtime and used it to
initialize and edit initialize that size
array so size of an array can be defined
at runtime and it is a length field
which can be used to get the length of
an array now these were the basic things
of arrays finally arrays can be
partially filled what I mean by this is
here I have declared an integer array
now this
arrey Z right now empty all the values
are initialized to zero now I can say
that edit integer 3 the index 3 will
have an value 5 and then something as
value at index 5 will have a new 10 here
what I am doing is this should be the
name of an array so I am assigning a
value of 5 to the element at index 3 and
I am assigning a value 10 to element at
index 5 however the elements at other
locations are not assigned any value
this is fine this is what it says is
arrays can be partially filled so in
this tutorial we learnt more about
arrays we learnt about default values in
arrays we also learnt about array index
exceptions in our next tutorial we are
going to learn about more advanced
features and more it was collections to
store elements goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
