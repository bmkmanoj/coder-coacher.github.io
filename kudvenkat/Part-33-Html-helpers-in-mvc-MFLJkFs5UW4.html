in this video we'll discuss the purpose
of HTML helpers and some of the standard
HTML helpers that are available in
asp.net MVC please watch 4:32 before
proceeding so what's an HTML helper and
HTML helper is a method that's used to
render HTML content interview HTML
helpers are implemented as extension
methods will discuss more about
extension methods in a later video
session for now understand that HTML
helpers or extension methods that are
used to render HTML content in a view
now let's see how to use some of the
standard HTML helpers that are available
in asp.net MVC for example to produce
the HTML for a textbox with the ID is
equal to the first name and name is
equal to first-name there are two ways
we can do that option one we can
literally type all the HTML that is
required or we can use the textbox HTML
helper let's actually look at that in
action let's flip to visual studio so
let's generate a textbox to enter first
name so we can use the input element
input type is equal to text ID is equal
to first name and name is also going to
be first name and let's set a value of
empty string because when we have this
textbox rendered we don't want to
display anything to the user so
obviously now when the waveform renders
as you might expect we have a textbox
control there now instead of typing all
the HTML that is required I can use the
textbox HTML helper ok and to use an
HTML helper we use add HTML dot text box
and then look at that we can pass the
name that we want to use for the textbox
so the name is going to be first name
let's go ahead and run this as you might
expect it's going to generate a text box
control and then if I right-click on
that and view page source
notice that the HTML that is generated
it is exactly similar to what we have
type ID is equal to first name name is
equal to first name type is equal to
text and value is equal to an empty
string now let's say when this text box
is rendered instead of having an empty
text I want this named John to be
populated okay so how do we do that if
we look at this text box HTML helper it
is overloaded and we can pass the value
as a parameter so I can use this
overloaded version and pass the value of
John so let's run this now and as you
might expect in the web and the text box
is rendered we have a value of join
there now let's say you know I want to
have for this text box control a red
background color the font color to be
white and bolded so how do we achieve
that simply by setting the style
attribute now if you are using the input
you know if we have literally typed all
the HTML then we can set the style
attribute on that HTML in a declaration
but then here we are using the HTML
helpers so when we are using the HTML
helpers to set the style attribute
notice that we have another overloaded
version where we can pass all the HTML
attributes as an object type okay so if
you look at the slide here look at that
I'm passing the style attribute okay to
this text box HTML helper and notice
that I am passing it as an anonymous tie
okay so here look at the style we are
setting the background color to red
color to white and font weight to ball
and just to speed things up I have that
string already typed so let me copy that
and then let's go back to visual studio
so here I'm going to use this overloaded
version maybe our going to pass HTML
help attributes so we are going to pass
that as an anonymous type and then I am
going to set the style attribute
okay so with this change when we run
this as you might expect the textbox is
going to have in other styles that we
have specified now we can also set other
attributes like title for example if we
want so I'm going to set the title
attribute to something like please enter
your first name so you can pass any
number of HTML attributes within this
anonymous type and they will be applied
to the textbox control look at this when
I hover my mouse over I get this as a
tooltip please enter your first name all
right now some of the HTML attributes
like class read-only you know these are
reserved c-sharp keywords so obviously
when I try to use those HTML attributes
to get this let's get rid of these two
right here and let me try to use the
class CSS
I mean class attribute to set a CSS
class look at that since classes it is a
keyword it turns into a blue color so
how do I set this as an attribute simply
precede that with the next symbol and
then you can set a CSS class okay so
obviously I'm going to have these styles
within a CSS file so if you look at my
solution Explorer within this content
folder I have the site dot CSS and let's
call our CSS class as you know maybe red
text box and then I'm going to paste
these styles within that CSS class so
let's use this as the class for our
textbox control and then let's say I
want this class to be I mean this
textbox control to be read-only again
read-only is a keyword so the moment we
type it turns into blue so let's proceed
that with an @ symbol and then let's say
we want the textbox to be read-only by
passing and true so obviously now when
we run this oh look at that it didn't
pick up the styles that's because we
define the styles in a style
but then we didn't refer that stylesheet
within our view so let's drag and drop
that on to this view look at that it has
generated the link tag for us
automatically let's fix this let's use
tilde symbol there so till indicate the
current root directory so that's the
root directory from the root directory
get into the content folder and then
refer to site dot CSS so now when we run
this it should have those Styles apply
look at that and then I'm not able to
change anything within the text box
that's basically because it's set to
read only alright now to generate a
label we can use label HTML helper so if
you look at this text box it's used to
end the first name so I want to label
the first name there and to achieve that
I'm going to use another HTML helper
label and we can specify the name which
is first name and then you know label
text I want the label text as first name
so now when we run this the text box
should have a label entrant of them
first name is that one all right and
there are several other HTML helpers as
well to generate a text box to enter
password so that the input is masked we
use the password HTML helper so instead
of text box I'm going to use a password
HTML helper and give it a name
something like password no obviously
when we run this now and then when you
try to type something into that look at
that it is masked and then to generate a
multi-line text box okay so there might
be scenarios where we want you know we
want the user to enter multiple lines of
text in which case we need a multi-line
text box in that case we can use this
text area HTML helper so I am going to
use this text area and then there is an
overloaded version where you can specify
you know the name for the text box you
know any value if you want to pre
populate that and then I'm
of rows and columns and any HEA HTML
attributes that you want to specify so
the name let's say for example this is
going to be something like comments from
the user and I don't want to populate
anything so the string value is going to
be empty rules let's say five rows and
then maybe 20 columns and then I'm not
going to pass in HTML attributes so now
when we run this as you might expect we
get a multi-line text box control look
at that as we start typing you know we
get a scrollbar as well and to generate
a hidden text box now you might be
wondering why would we need a hidden
text box a hidden text box that will not
be visible on the form so if I use a
hidden text box and let's say we want
this to store the ID of the employee so
if I run this so that that text box
control will not be displayed on the
webform base that because that's a
hidden text box control look at that
input ID ID is equal to ID name is equal
to ID type is equal to hidden so that's
a hidden text box control now what is
the use of this hidden text box control
hidden text box is used to store ID
values ID values are not displayed on
the page because they doesn't make any
sense to the end-user but then we need
them to update the database table and
the form is posted back to the server
okay that's why we may use hidden fields
and to generate hidden fields we can use
that hidden HTML helper is it possible
to create our own HTML helpers
absolutely we'll discuss creating HTML
custom HTML helpers in a later video
session is it mandatory to use HTML
helpers in an MVC application context
you know type my own HTML here I mean
it's not mandatory we can type the
required HTML but using HTML helpers
will greatly reduce the amount of HTML
that we have to write in a view views in
general should be as simple as possible
all the complicated logic to generate a
control can be encapsulated into these
/ methods to keep our views simple in
our next video we'll discuss generating
list controls using HTML helpers on this
slide you can find resources face p.net
