in this video we'll discuss working with
dates in JavaScript to create data
object in JavaScript we use the date
construct up the example here writes the
current date and time to the web page
let's look at this in action so to get
the date object in JavaScript we use the
date constructor so this variable T here
will hold the current date and time
let's write its value to the web page so
when we run this we should get the
current date and time printed notice
that today is January 6 2015 and the
time is 20 hours 36 minutes and 0 6
seconds and notice we also have the
timezone information at the moment the
timezone on my machine is GMT so let's
change the timezone to something else
let's actually change the timezone to
Indian Standard Time
that is is stay and let's refresh this
page notice that we now get the time in
India at the moment in this example here
we're using the constructor without any
arguments so in this case it's going to
return the current date and time it is
also possible to create a date object
with specific dates and there are two
ways we can do this in this example
right here notice that we are
constructing a date object with specific
date and in this example or we are
passing a string that contains well you
know a given specific date so here the
month is January and the date is 13 and
the year is 1980 the numbers that you
see here are the first set of numbers
represent the hours next minutes and
then seconds so this date constructor is
going to take that date string and then
construct a date object out of it and
store it in this variable and then we
are writing its value to the document so
to speed things up I have already typed
this code so let's copy and paste it
within visual studio
so when we run this we should get you
know the date printed so here we are
using the date string to construct a
data object another way to create a
specific date object is by using numbers
for year month day hours minutes seconds
and milliseconds and here is an example
for that
so the ER is 1980 and the month number
is 0 so the important thing to keep in
mind is that in JavaScript month numbers
start from zero so for January it's 1
for February I mean for January it is 0
February it is 1 and for December it is
11 and the next number that we have here
is the date and then we have hours
minutes and then seconds finally
milliseconds so in this example we're
using numbers to construct the date ok
again to speed things up I have this
already type so let's copy that let's
actually print an HTML break
and then paste this code so if you
notice we get the same date object in
both the cases here by using numbers to
construct the date in this example we
are using a date string to constructed
the date so when we run this in both the
cases we should get the same date
printed there we go here we have some
useful data object methods so all of
these are instance methods meaning you
call it on the data object so get folia
is going to return the fullier that is
with all the four digits get month will
return the month number remember in
JavaScript month numbers start from zero
so it's going to return the month number
now there may be situations where in
your application you want to return a
month name instead of month number so
let's see how to do that so at the
moment here we have got a data object
now on the data object then we say get
month it returns the month and at the
moment the month is January so it's
going to return that month number which
is zero and let's write its value to the
webpage
so it should print zero now now let's
say instead of month number we want to
actually print month name so how to
achieve that we have to write a custom
JavaScript function for that so let's
write that function now so I'm going to
write a function let's call this get
month name from month number and we pass
this function month number parameter so
here I'm going to create a variable and
this is going to hold all the month
numbers so here I'm actually going to
create an array of month names and this
is going to contain months from January
to December to speed things up I have
already typed the month names so let's
copy and paste them here so within this
arena we have all the month names
starting from January till December and
then what we're going to do is return
the respective month name from this
array so I'm going to index it with the
parameter that is coming into this
function which is month number so for
example to this function if we pass
month number as G 0 so month names of 0
is going to return jannat if you pass 1
it's going to return February if you
pass 11 it's going to return December so
let's call this function here and then
actually print the month name so I'm
going to call the function right here
and pass it month number so this
variable contains the month number so
let's pass that to this function so
month number is 0 and for 0 it will
return January so when we run this we
should actually get January printed
there we go
get date is going to return the day of
the month that is you know from 1 to 31
and get Day returns the day number of
the week just like month numbers day
numbers start from zero zero is Sunday
one is Monday and so on so there may be
situations again in your application
where you want to get the week day name
instead of day number of the week so
let's see how to achieve that now it's
going to be very much similar to this so
when we say here dot cat day it's going
to return the day number of the week
okay that's actually called a stay to
give it a meaningful name and then let's
write the value that is present in this
day variable to the webpage remember
January 13th 1980 Sunday so it's going
to return zero for that day okay now
instead of weekday number we want the
weekday name so to get that let's write
again a custom function let's actually
make a copy of this function and let's
call it get week name from week number
and let's rename this variable name to
week number and this variable to week
names and instead of month names here we
are going to contain weekday names and
again to speed things up I have already
typed this so let's copy and paste them
here so here we have got the week day
names and then what you're going to do
is return the respective weekday name so
we pass the vehicle number to this array
so we are indexing that with the
parameter that comes into this function
so weekday names of zero is going to
return Sunday weekday names of 1 is
going to return Monday so on and so
forth so now let's call this function
right here so get
week names I mean week name from Vietnam
and then pass the day number for it and
let's run this so it should print Sunday
so how to get the day of the week from
the day number we have just seen that
example now now the important thing as
far as working with dates is you know
converting the date to a specific format
so how to convert the data object to
ddmm yyy format now notice for example
if we write the value that is present in
you know the date of birth variable so
it contains the data object so when we
run this we get the date in this format
now instead of this format I want the
date to be in DD mmm yyy format if the
day is less than 10 for example if it is
8 then we want two digits for the date
0-8 similarly if the month has got only
two digits then we want you know a zero
to be prefixed before that single digit
month number so let's see how to achieve
that so I'm going to again write a
custom function for that let's call it
format date and this function is going
to receive date object as the parameter
and then it's going to format the date
into DD mmm yyy now for now instead of
passing it as a parameter let's actually
create a variable let's call it date and
initialize that with a new data object
the reason I am doing this is because we
get int Elise hands on this date object
within this function and later we can
remove that variable and pass it as a
parameter to this function so the first
thing that I want to do is get the ear
part so ver here equals date dot get
fullier so this is going to return all
the four digits of the ear and then the
next thing I want to do is get the month
so where month equals date dot
get a month remember month numbers in
JavaScript start from zero
so let's increment the month number by
one now if it's a single digit month
number then we want to prefix zero in
front of it
so if month is less than 10 then month
equals zero plus month so we are
prefixing zero before it similarly we
want to get the date so let's call it
day equals date dot get date should
return as the date that is from 1 till
31 and again if the day is a single
digit day I mean if it is one or two or
anything less than 10 then we want to
prefix zero before that single digit so
day equals zero plus day and then
finally return the day I mean the date
in the format that you want so we want
the date to be in DD mmm yyy so I'm
going to return the day first and then
prefix a forward slash and then the
month and then prefix a forward slash
and then the now at the moment we have
you know this data object as a variable
here but we don't want that we want the
date object to be passed as a parameter
so I'm going to get rid of this line
right here and then pass the date object
as a parameter to this format date
function so now let's go ahead and call
this function right here and give it the
date of birth so format date and then
pass the date of birth object to it
so now it should print the state in ddmm
5x5 format so notice that we get the
date first and then the month and then
the ER notice that we also have 0 before
that single digit month a number now in
some cases you may want if it's a single
digit month or day then in that case you
want to print that single digit if that
is the case simply comment this section
where we are prefixing zeros before
single digit month and day numbers okay
so now if we go and run this we will get
single digit for the month since the
date is double digit we get the double
digits for example if we change the date
to something single digit like journey
the 8th 1980 we should get single digit
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
