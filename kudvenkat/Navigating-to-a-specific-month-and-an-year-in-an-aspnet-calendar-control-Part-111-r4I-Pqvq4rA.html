am venket this is part one 11 of asp.net
video series in this video we'll discuss
about navigating to a specific month and
ania
in asp.net calendar control this
question was asked by three to four
YouTube subscribers of my channel there
are several reasons or situations in
real time where we need to navigate to a
specific month and ania in an asp.net
calendar control for example if the date
of birth of a person is in the Year 1960
we may have to click on the calendar
control several times to navigate to
that Tia now just imagine in OVR and the
year 2013 January 2013 let's say I'm
filling a webform here and the date of
birth of a person is in the Year 1960
now if I have to select the date of
birth of the person from this calendar
control just imagine how many clicks
would it take to actually navigate to
that year using this a previous month
button I have to keep on clicking until
I read you know 1960 I'm still in 2011
okay so obviously the build the built-in
UI that the standard asp.net control has
you know doesn't allow me to skip years
and months but then we can provide
through drop-down list controls like
this way the user can select any of for
example at the moment we had in 2011
let's say I want to go to 2001 as soon
as I select the year look at that the
calendar changes to January 2001 but in
2001 let's say I want to go to them you
know maybe month October I select
October and the calendar changes to
October 2001 all the user needs to do
right now if the date of birth is 10th
October 2001 I select the date and click
on this button I get that particular
date okay similarly if you want to
navigate to the Year 1960 all you have
to do is populate this drop down list
you know that year and then you will be
navigated so let's see how to achieve
this and it's very simple to achieve
this all you have to do is have two
drop-down list controls populate them
with the years and months that you want
and then change the visible date
property of this calendar control
programmatically that's it so let's go
ahead and see how to do that so
obviously I need a drop-down list
control to display years so I'm going to
have this text here and then drag and
drop a drop-down list control and the
long
the same lines let's put some space
there and then maybe I want some static
text month and then it drop down this
control there as well and the next thing
is we want the calendar control itself
so let's drag and drop the calendar
control and then finally a button
control okay and then let's change the
text of this button control maybe get
selected date okay so now the the next
step is to basically populate this year
drop-down list and to do that I'm going
to get my year's you know instead of
adding them programmatically on the
webform I'm going to get my the years
from an XML file ok so within this
project I have this folder called data
folder and then within that folder I
have this year's dot XML file and if you
look at this XML file we have years a
root node and within that we have
several years here and each year has got
number and value properties I mean
elements ok so we have from 2000 to 2013
you can have as many years as you want
within this XML file now if you want to
add an XML file to your project all you
need to do is right click on that folder
add new item and then click on the data
tab and then from there select XML file
give it ears to XML and copy and paste
this XML data there I'll have this XML
data on my blog so you can copy it from
there similarly I'm going to have
another XML file for months to store
months and if you look at months I have
in a months root node and then month and
within which we have the month number
and then the month name ok so obviously
what I want to do is I want to read this
year's XML data from this XML file and
display that within this waveform ok so
how do we do that to read data from an
XML file the simplest way is to use the
data set so I'm going to use the data
set and data set is present in system
data namespace so let's import that and
let's create an instance of the data set
objects so data set let's call that D S
years is equal to new data set and what
we want to do we want to read the XML
file so d s years
we have a method called read XML all you
have to do is specify the name of the
XML file so I'm going to use server dot
map path which maps the virtual path to
the physical path so the file is present
in the root directory of this web
application project within data folder
and the XML file name is ears dot XML
okay so once we have the XML file all we
need to do is for the drop-down list
ears drop-down list so years drop-down
list is called as drop-down list 1 so
let me call it as drop-down list 1 dot
data source we will set D s ears as the
data source and finally call the data
bind method that's it but then before
that we also need to set the data text
field and the data value field within
the years drop-down list which column
you want to be displayed as the text in
which value you want to be displayed as
in I mean you want as a value within the
drop-down list we'll have to specify
that so drop-down list 1 dot data text
field is equal to in both the cases I'm
going to use your number so I will just
in number here and similarly we also
need to specify the data value field and
that's also going to be the number
that's that so let me go ahead and run
this actually let's specify this before
we bind the drop-down list and we are
done okay so once we run this now we
should actually see there's an error
okay we need another closing parenthesis
now let's run this when the waveform
loads up as you might expect the years
drop-down list should be populated so I
have all the years from 2000 to 2013
along the same lines I need to populate
the months drop-down list let's go ahead
and do that now you know instead of
having all this code here I'm going to X
and calculate this inside a method right
click on the selection and then select
extract method and I'm going to call
this load years
okay I click okay so it creates a
private method for me automatically
along the same lines I'm going to create
another method called load months
okay so let's create that private method
so private word I'm going to call that
load month and then what is this method
going to do it's going to read the XML
months dot XML file and then load the
data into the months a drop-down list
actually let's get rid of this one and
that one okay so I'm going to call this
data set SDS months new data set and we
want to read the XML data from months
dot XML file okay so let's copy the name
of that and then specify that here so
months dot XML and then within the
months file what is the data text field
the data text field is going to be named
and the data value field is going to be
Napa so data text field is going to be
named and data value field will be
number and then we want to and that's
going to be drop-down list too okay and
similarly drop-down list to dot data
source and drop-down this to dot data
bind and the data set is going to be
months here okay and what we want to do
we want to invoke this method here
so load month and we want to call these
methods only when it is the initial get
request because we don't want to be
doing this on every page load on a
postback we don't want to do this we
only want to do this on the initial get
request upon post back since this
control is added at design time it's
going to maintain its state for us
automatically anyway so let me go ahead
and run this at this time you should see
both the years and months populated from
those respect to XM XML files so I have
the months and I have the years now what
should happen as soon as I change the
year you know look at this when I select
2008 the calendar visible date should
automatically be changed to 2008 so
let's see how to do that obviously it
should happen when the selection in the
drop-down list changes so I should set
the auto post back
of this drop-down list control to true
so let's go ahead and do that on webform
9 I'm going to set the auto post back
property for both of the drop-down list
controls to true so I selected both of
them I'm going to change both of them
together so save that and then when the
drop-down list selected index changes
double click that to generate the even
handler when the selected index is
changed on that drop-down list what we
want to do this is a very simple quote
one line of code calendar one dot
visible date is equal to look at that
the visible date property actually
expects a date/time to be passed in so
I'm going to say new date time and we
can specify year month and day
okay so let's retrieve the year from the
drop-down list so int year is equal to
we want to retrieve that from the years
drop-down list and the ID of the
drop-down list is drop-down list one so
I'm going to say drop-down list 1 dot
selected value we need the value and
then we want to convert that to an
integer so convert dot to int 16 that's
it and along the same lines I'm going to
retrieve the month as well so let's
change the variable name to month and
convert to in 62 2016 and the month is
going to come from drop-down list 2 and
we want to retrieve the value not the
text because the text will show the
month name ok so finally what's left out
we have to change the visible date and
I'm going to specify the year as here a
look at that I'm using this constructor
of that date/time class here and then we
need to specify month which what we
already have from the drop-down list and
the day I'm going to hard call it as 1
okay so that's it along the same lines
whenever the month changes within the
drop-down list I want to do exactly the
same thing so let's copy and paste that
there okay so we are done now finally
when the user clicks this button what we
want we want the date that the user has
selected so calendar one you want to
print that onto the web
so response dot write calendar one how
do we get the selected date using
selected date property and I want to
convert that to a short date string I
just want the date and time I mean I
just want the date I don't need the time
so I'm converting it to short date
string and another thing that we can
actually do is we can actually say
calendar one dot select the date is
equal to also the same thing so what's
going to happen the calendar will be
change it to that date the visible date
and then on that date it will select the
first day of that month and here okay
and then if the user wants to change
that they can change it so okay so
that's the code okay so let's go ahead
and run this and we should have the
behavior that we are expecting so the
web form loads up and look at this
currently I am in 2013 and I can choose
maybe I want to navigate to 2001 look at
this as soon as the EI changes the
calendar flips to January 1 2001 but I
don't want to go into January I want to
maybe go to November so November 2001 by
default the first date is selected but
let's say the birth date is number 11 I
can select the date click the calendar
and I am able to skip months and years
select the date that I want fit easily
in fact you can actually navigate all of
this HTML and all of this HTML and all
of this code into its own user control
in the previous sessions of this video
series we have seen how to create user
controls how to add them to web form and
use them there and in fact we also have
discussed how to load these user
controls dynamically so if you are new
to use a controller I'd strongly
encourage you to watch those video
sessions first and then once you have
this code encapsulated inside and user
control you can reuse them on any web
form in in your entire web application
project on this slide you can find
resources for asp.net c-sharp and sequel
server in TV questions that's it for
today thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
