video we'll discuss the differences
between HTTP GET and HTTP POST methods
HTTP stands for hypertext Transfer
Protocol HTTP is the most common
protocol used for communication between
a web server and a client for example to
request the home page of prism
technologies website we would type this
URL presume techcom for slash home dot
aspx and then once I hit enter we are
issuing a get request for the home page
of prism technologies now within this
address bar of Google Chrome I can't see
the protocol that is used but then if I
copy that address and paste that into
your notepad notice that they using HTTP
protocol so to establish the
communication between the client that is
the browser on this laptop and presume
technologies web server and this HTTP
protocol has got two common methods that
is HTTP cat and HTTP POST which are used
they establish the communication between
the client and the web server so in this
video we'll understand when we actually
use HTTP GET and when do we use HTTP
POST and when these Bernard is request
raised okay so this get request is
generally used to get data from the web
server where as a post request is
generally used to submit a post data to
the server for example let's say I want
to submit feedback about a trainer I
click on this feedback link on prism
technologies website so we are issuing a
get request to that page and obviously I
have this form here where I can fill in
the feedback about the trainer and then
once I click the submit button what are
we doing we are submitting the data that
we had entered on this form to presume
technologies web server so we are
posting the data to the server let's
actually understand this get and post
request with an example so here I have
an asp.net web applications project and
then on this web form one dot aspx I
have three text boxes where we can enter
first
last name and email and then a sublet
button and within the button click event
handler what are we doing we are
retrieving the details that the user has
submitted and then we are appending the
values within those text boxes as query
strings and we are issuing a redirect to
webform to dot aspx and within the form
- I have three label controls and within
the page load event of this platform -
we are retrieving know the data from the
query strings and then setting that data
as the text for the respective label
controls okay so now when we actually
navigate to you know when we type this
URL that form stem is the name of the
project that from one dot aspx and once
I hit enter what are we doing we are
issuing a get request for this waveform
one dot aspx but before we do that let
me fire up this fiddler
okay so fiddler is a web debugging tool
so web application developer you so in
order to debug and troubleshoot
production issues okay now if you want
to download this tool it can be
downloaded from this URL
I'll have this link available on my blog
in case if you need it right now let's
go back to the browser and then look at
this platform one dot aspx you know i
typed that in the address bar and once i
hit enter we are issuing a get request
to this platform one dot aspx actually
let's clear all the traffic that we have
here and then issue another get request
so let's go to fiddler look at that so
there is a request for web forms one dot
aspx and look at the method that was
used what is the method a get method get
request is issued to the web server okay
and now we have the form one dot aspx so
let me fill in some data and then once
we click the submit button what are we
doing we are going to post this data
look at this within the URL we don't
have anything now once we click the
submit button what's going to happen
this form will be posted or submitted to
the server and this data I need to be
transmitted to the server okay so once I
click Submit
within the server what did we do I mean
we submitted it this later to the server
and on the server side within the button
click event handler we are retrieving
the submitted data and then we are
appending that to the form to dot aspx
page as query strings and then we are
redirecting the user to that page okay
so basically if you look at the second
request that's captured within fiddler
on webform one dot aspx when we clicked
on that button look at that a post
request and then obviously the data that
you have entered on that waveform need
to be sent to the server so how was the
data sent to the server it was sent as
part of the body so here you know this
is the header and then here whatever you
see here is the body of that request and
within the body if you scroll to the
right you can actually see this DX D
first name which is nothing but the ID
of that textbox you know first name
textbox and then you have presume that's
what we entered as the first name
similarly we have txt last name and the
value is stack and then email as well
okay so basically when we use post
request the data is sent you know using
the HTTP message board a and then within
the button click event we are you know
we are programmatically redirecting to
waveform to dot aspx so this free direct
issues a get request to webform to so
here within fiddler if I select that
look at that the request is actually a
get a request
so to summarize a get request is
generally used to get data from the web
server and a get request is generally
issued when you click on a hyperlink or
when response dot redirect statement is
executed or when you type a URL in the
address bar and hit enter a get request
is generally issued and a post request
is used to submit data to the server or
for example you know you might have seen
many web applications where you fill in
some details and then once you click on
send email button it's going to send an
email so for things like that we use
post request to submit data or to send
the email
etc and a post request is generally
raised when you click on a submit button
or if you have a drop-down list for
example on an asp.net web form and if
you have set auto post bacc property to
true and then when you change the
selection within the drop-down list what
happens the wave form will be posted
back to the server so another request is
sent and what request is that it's a
post request all right now let's look at
the differences between a get and post
methods so get method appends data to
the water now a classic example is here
look at this this wave form - what we
what is the responsibility of this wave
form - you give it some data and then
it's going to display that within these
label controls but various it done it's
done on the server side meaning this
first name last name and email has to be
sent somehow to the server and how are
we sending this data by appending it to
the URL and this is a get request right
because in fiddler if you notice the
request for webform to you know we are
getting this platform too because within
code programmatically we are redirecting
the user to wave form - dot aspx so that
has issued a get request but then for
that wave form to do its job we need to
provide it some data and how are we
doing that by appending that to the URL
on the server side we retrieve the data
from the query strings and then display
within the label controls so basically
get method up in the data to the URL
whereas with post method data can either
be appended to the URL or sent in a
message body and we have seen an example
of that you know on webform one when we
filled those details first name last
name email and then once we click the
submit button what are we doing we are
issuing a post request and this data is
sent to the server as part of the
message body as get requests rely on the
query string so to send data to the
server obviously there is a length
restriction so here we have a get
request and we are sending this data to
the server using query strings so there
is length restriction
you know on the URL which means there is
a length restriction on the amount of
data that can be transmitted using a get
request but with post we don't have that
issue because post uses message body the
HTTP message body to send data and an
important point to keep in mind is that
while it is possible to change the state
of data in database using get request
they should only be used to retrieve
data and not to change this state so for
example if you look at this page load
event on a webform this page load event
is executed you know both when I get and
a post request is issued and there's
nothing stopping you from writing code
here with no page load even something
like this if not is forced back what
does this mean this means if the request
that is coming in is a get request you
know you can write any code here for
example I can write code here to go and
delete data that is present in the
database okay so basically we shouldn't
be doing that a get request should only
be used to retrieve data and not to
change the state in any way anytime you
want to change something you know always
do that using a post request in asp.net
webforms it's very easy to check whether
if a request is a get or a post on this
on the server-side how do we do that
using east post back property so you
know the name itself is self explanatory
is post back look at that what is it
returning boolean true or false if that
returns true then we know it's a
postback request if it returns false
then we know it's a get request but then
in asp.net MVC we don't have this
property this is east post back property
is the property of a webform in all of
this page class we don't have you know
concept of pages and events within
asp.net webforms sorry asp.net MVC and
hence we don't have this east post back
property within asp.net MVC applications
so in our next video we'll actually
discuss how to check if the request
method is
get or a post in a speedo an MVC
application that's it for today thank
you for listening
