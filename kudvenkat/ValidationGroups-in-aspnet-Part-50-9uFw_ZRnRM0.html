venket this is part 50 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll discuss
about validation groups and causes
validation property before continuing
with the session I strongly recommend to
watch parts 47 48 and 49 of this video
series now let me first explain what we
are trying to solve here now we have a
simple web form here with two sections
login section and a user registration
section if the user has already
registered with your website and if he
wants to login
he just supplies his username password
and click the login button and he logs
and now this username and password are
obviously required fields so there are
two required field validators on the web
form in case of the user doesn't provide
the username and password and then when
he tries to click in this login button
then the appropriate user error messages
are displayed in the validation summary
control along the same lines if the user
has not already registered with your
website then we also provide him the
opportunity to register with our website
by providing these fields and again all
these fields email username password and
confirm password all are these mandatory
fields so there are required field
validator controls and in addition to
those four required field validators we
also have regular expression validator
just to ensure we have the right format
for the email and a compare validator to
ensure password and confirm password
matches now if the user doesn't provide
any of these fields and if he tries to
click the register button then it's
going to through those required field
validation error messages okay but on
the other hand let's say if he enter
some junk or something and he wants to
empty all the text boxes instead of
deleting each text box one by one he can
click the Clear button and all of them
would be deleted in one go so that's the
idea of this wave form let's see this
platform in action okay so let me run
this form now and if you look at this
this platform basically by the way it's
already designed it has got all the
validation controls that respect your
buttons and everything there so as soon
as the webform is low
now let's say I enter some jump here and
then look at this I want to clear all
these fields so I click this Clear
button what do we expect we expect the
webform to be posted back to the server
and obviously in the button click event
handler we will have code 3 empty these
text boxes and these should be cleared
but then look at what's going to happen
when I click this this is the first
problem you know my intention here is to
not cause any validation in the first
place
the webform should be posted back to the
server and then all these fields should
be clear but what's happening here since
this is also a button it's causing the
validation to be triggered unless and
until I fix these errors on this page I
will not be able to post the webform
back to the server for processing so how
do we disable the validation from
happening all you have to do as you know
when I click this button I don't want
the validation to be triggered so I want
to disable the validation how do I tell
that to the button control every button
control has a property called causes
validation which is true by default
which means cause a validation event to
be triggered ok but if you set this to
false then on this button click even the
validation controls will not be fired
okay so let's go ahead and also write
the server-side code to MT the text
boxes so we have txt user name dot text
and to empty the text boxes all we have
to do is set them to string dot empty
similarly txt password text box dot text
is equal to empty string and txt confirm
password dot txt is equal to empty
string and along the same lines we want
to set txt email password I mean text to
an empty string okay so now let's run
this once again
let's fill the waveform with some stuff
there and now let's click the Clear
button look at that no validation events
occurred and then the wave form is
posted back to the server
this code got executed and all the text
boxes are cleared as expected ok so
that's the first problem when I click
the Clear button form validation still
happens when I click the Clear button I
just want to clear the text boxes in the
registration section validation doesn't
make any sense here
so how do I prevent validation from
happening on that button click all you
have to do is set the causes validation
property of that button control to false
by default the causes validation
property is true for all the button
controls ok now we have another problem
here that is when I click the register
button look at that you know I get
validation errors here ok user name is
required which is fine password is
required which is fine again email is
required which is fine and look at this
again it's saying user name is required
password is required so where is this
coming from that is this user name and
password ok so it's like whether I click
this button here in the login section or
whether I click register button in the
registration section you know all the
validation controls on the page are
being fired and look at the validation
summary controls each validation summary
control is showing the error messages of
all the validation controls on the page
and it doesn't really make sense if the
user has to log in only he has to
provide is the username and password
click login and if he doesn't have a
username password he will provide these
details and click register button and he
should be able to register with your
website but then for some reason here
all these validation controls are
interfering with each other
ok so how do we solve this problem this
problem can be very easy easily solved
using validation groups ok so the name
itself says we are going to group these
validation controls ok so all you have
to do is tell you know the page that
these validation controls that we have
in this registration section the
button control and this validation
summary control all these are going to
be one group so when I click this button
control only fire these validation
controls and any error message is
associated with them display in this
validation summary control because all
of them belong to the same group and the
same logic applies for the login section
so when I click this login button
fire these two validation controls and
any errors associated with them display
in this validation control so we want to
segregate them into their own groups and
how do we do that with the help of
validation groups in asp.net let's you
have to do that so let's flip the
webform to the design mode and instead
of changing one validation control at a
time what we can do is hold down your
control key and select every control so
I'm going to select you know that that
that that and that validation control
the register button and the validation
summary ctrl + f4 to get to the
properties window and I'm going to
change the validation group of this user
registration section to something like
registration this can be any string but
it has to be the same for all the
controls so now we are telling ok all
these controls form one group and along
the same lines I'm going to select this
validation control here and this
validation control the validation
summary control and the login button
ctrl + f4 get to the property and I'm
going to give this a meaningful
validation group so I'm calling this
login group ok so now these validation
controls this validation summary and
this button control is one group all
these validation controls this button
and this validation summary control is
one group so now if we run this they
belong to different groups so let's
cancel this rerun once again so when the
page loads there are different groups
now when I click this button
only these validation controls will be
fired and the error messages related
associated with them will be so shown in
this validation control
and along the same lines when I click
this button these validation controls
are fired and there are messages
associated to those are displayed here
and look at this on the other hand if I
enter you know a username and a password
okay no validation errors so when I
click login the webform should be
happily posted and no login validation
errors and along the same lines if I
provide an email address a username a
password and a confirm password and
click register
okay invalid email so let's give a
meaningful email there pro team at
pledging tech comm that's a valid email
address I click register
no registration validation errors as
expected okay now yeah the validation
groups basically helps us to group you
know validation controls button and
validation summary control so when I
click that button only the validation
controls related to that group are fired
and the error message is related to that
group are shown in that validation
summary control on this slide you can
