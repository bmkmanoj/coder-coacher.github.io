venket this is part 54 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll discuss
about server dot execute method and the
difference between server door transfer
and server dot execute before continuing
with the session I strongly recommend to
watch parts 51 52 and 53 of this video
series server dot execute is very
similar to server dot transfer let's
actually look at an example of using
server dot execute let's flip to visual
studio here I have a very simple asp.net
web application project with two web
forms on web form one I have two text
boxes where the user can enter their
name and email and once they click this
button server dot execute waveform 2
they will be redirected to waveform 2
dot aspx and on this web form I have two
labeled controls which will then
retrieve the values that we enter in
these text boxes and display them within
those label controls and to just i mean
distinguish between the two web forms we
have this h1 this is web form one and
this is wave form - all right so first
let's code the redirection so once I
double-click the button control we have
the even handle I generated so server
dot execute method I want to use the
execute method to redirect the user and
this method is expecting a single string
parameter which is nothing but the path
of the page we want to redirect the user
to here we want to redirect the user to
web form to dot aspx so till the forward
slash web form to dot aspx ok so once we
redirect the user to wave form - on the
page load event of perform - dot aspx
dot cs we need to write code to retrieve
the values from these text boxes and
display them in the label controls on
this waveform and obviously we have seen
how to do that in the previous session
of this video series when we were
discussing about server dot transfer the
exact same techniques are applicable
here as well so we can use the request
objects form property and if you look at
the request objects form property this
is going to give us a collection of the
previous form variables and if you look
at what it is returning
returning a name value collection name
value pair collection object and that
object is present in system dot
collections for specialized namespace so
let's declare a variable of that type so
system dot collections dot specialized
dot name value collection and let's call
this previous form variables is equal to
request dot form and then we can use
this object to retrieve the text from
the text box
name and text box email so let's see how
to do that
so which is nothing but let's copy the
object name here previous form variables
and then to this we can pass the name of
the textbox control on the previous
waveform which is nothing but the XT
name and then this can be assigned to
label name variable label name dot text
is equal to whatever we get back and
along the same lines we can do the same
thing for DX d email and assign the text
from that textbox to label email so it's
pretty much similar to what we have seen
in the previous session of this video
series all right now let's go ahead and
run this and see if the values that we
enter on webform 1 will be transferred
to the label controls on webform two and
remember here we are using server dot
technique server dot execute method and
look at the URL we are currently on
webform 1 and the URL is webform one dot
aspx so let's say the name is pledge
eeeem and email is presume at regime
techcom and then once we click this
server dot execute method we should be
redirected to webform two so we are on
web form to look at that this is the
primary difference between server dot
transfer and server dot execute now we
are still on webform 1 but you know the
form to result is also shown here and
look at the URL the URL is still webform
1 ok so if you look at the
difference between servers or transfer
and server dot execute is there's
Thermidor transfer terminates the
execution of the current page and starts
the execution of the new page whereas so
we dot execute process the second web
form without leaving the first webform
you will still be on the first waveform
and the output of the second waveform
will be displayed on the first waveform
after completing the execution of the
first webform the control returns to the
second webform let's understand what we
mean by this okay now let me close this
on webform one look at that I have this
button control which I mean which when
we click we go to waveform to dot aspx
now on this waveform I also have a label
control here now all I am doing here and
if you look at the ID of that label it's
called lvl status that's the idea of the
label so what I'm going to do is in this
button click event I'm going to set the
text lvl status dot text is equal to now
look at this when we click the button we
are telling okay server dot execute
waveform to dot aspx which means at this
point it's going to start executing you
know webform - page load event and all
the events on waveform - and then after
the processing of webform - the call is
going to come back to webform 1 ok and
then it will execute this line and
that's the proof for us you know to tell
the call is coming back to webform 1
let's say completed processing webform 1
okay and it should be back here setting
the text to the labor actually let's put
a breakpoint to prove that and let's run
this so when the page first loads we
will be on webform 1 and we'll be able
to enter the txt name the value for txt
name and txt email and once we click
this button on this web form 1 it will
redirect us to webform - I mean in the
sense it will start executing the events
of webform - and then as soon as it
finishes processing waveform to the
control should come back to webform 1 so
let's say please aim and
say the email is test I click server to
execute look at that it hits the
breakpoint so f 10 so server dot execute
it is going to go to waveform 2 so let's
put a breakpoint there so the page load
of webform two should be executed now so
I + f10 so we get two page load of
waveform - it finishes processing that
and then look at that the control come
back to the first webform
okay so completed processing webform one
and it came back and look at that the
output of the webform - and webform one
is combined here whereas if we use
server door transfer it terminates the
execution of the current page and starts
the execution of the new page and the
call doesn't come back to the first page
because it has already terminated the
execution of the current page and to
just prove that let's stop debugging so
debug stop debugging and then what we
are going to do here is instead of
servidor tran execute I'm going to use
server dot transfer here ok it's exactly
the same code and now let's run this
page and obviously as you might expect
actually we want to debug it so let's
put a breakpoint there and then run the
project so we have the breakpoint all
today so we will run this now what
happens since we are using server or
transfer you know the server dot
transfer will end the current waveform
execution so let's say pledgie m-- and
test and i click this button look at
what's going to happen as soon as it
encounters this line server door
transfer it goes there f10 f10 f10 so
this is waveform - and i press f5 look
at that it doesn't come back to webform
1 okay which means it's currently you
know so border transfer terminates the
execution of the current page and starts
the execution of the new page whereas
server dot execute process the second
web form without leaving the first
waveform after completing the execution
of the first waveform the control
returns back to the second waveform
that's the major difference between
server the transplant server dot execute
otherwise there are many similarities
between server door transfer and server
dot execute the URL in the browser
remains the first page URL so if you
remember whether you use server tour try
so execute the redirection is happening
on the server without the knowledge of
the client I mean without the client
knowing that's why the URL in the
browser doesn't get updated okay that's
one similarity let's put back this two
server dot execute and sever the
transfer and server dot execute can only
be used to navigate to sites of pages on
the same web server trying to navigate
to sites of pages on a different web
server causes runtime exception and we
have seen how this runtime exception
happens when we are talking about server
the transfer as well so let me click
this this button server dot execute so
we have the even handler there so when I
say server dot execute and I want to go
to let's say HTTP colon four slash four
slash presume techcom this website is
not hosted on this laptop so obviously
this is present on a different web
server so trying to navigate to that URL
using silver dot execute will throw a
runtime exception so let's run this and
then once we click that button and when
it tries to navigate to an external web
site that's hosted on a different web
server we get a runtime error so again
server dot execute is similar to server
dot transfer in that aspect and server
the transfer and server dot execute
preserves the form variables from the
original request and we have seen how to
do that by default it preserves that but
then you have a boolean property you
know which you can set you know to false
if you don't want to preserve this value
so if I said that to false and then if
we run this as you might expect you know
the previous form values will not be
preserved but then if we okay so let's
say presume and then when I set it to
test now look at that it's not showing
those values that is because you have
intentionally said you know the
preserved form values parameter to false
and actually there is another way to
retrieve just like server door transfer
you know when we transfer from one
waveform to another platform using
server dot execute another way to
retrieve the previous form values is to
use the previous page property and we
have seen how to use that and we
talking about server transfer so the
page class has got previous page
property so we can use this and previous
page returns a page object so I'm just
going to say this as previous page is
equal to that F the previous page if the
previous page is not equal to now then
what we want to do we want to find or I
mean the previous page for web form to
is web form one because we are coming to
waveform 2 from web form 1 so and on the
previous page that's on web form 1 we
know that we have a control called txt
name and we know that that control is a
textbox but if you look at this find
control method it is returning the
control back and we want to typecast
that to be of type text box so I'm going
to typecast that to be of type text box
and then we can retrieve the text out of
it
and then we can set that to LVL name dot
txt and along the same lines we can
retrieve the email the name of the email
text boxes txt email and the label name
is email
okay so let's comment this out so now we
are using previous page technique so
obviously let's run this page now when
we are using you know the previous page
property then this parameter doesn't
have any impact it's always going to
retain those values the previous page
values once the page loads we can enter
the values here supreme test and i click
this button it retains those values okay
another very important point to keep in
mind is that let's say I have a button
on webform two let's insert a row below
and then let's put a button control here
which is going to post back to the web
server and all this button going to do
is it will simply post back to the
server so I'm just going to change the
text to post back we are not going to
have any server-side code for this one
so once I click this button you know
there's an even handler but we are not
going to do anything there okay so let's
run this now so remember we are using
the server dot execute technique here to
redirect the user let's get rid of this
one let's run it once again
so once the page loads we can enter the
values let's say protein and test so I
click this button server to execute so
we are on webform tool now there is a
button on webform to now look at the URL
we are currently on waveform one dot
aspx now and this is waveform two so
obviously this button control is on
waveform 2 now once I click on this
button and once the waveform post back
look at what happens to the output look
at that the output of webform 1 is gone
and look at the URL it got changed to
webform - okay on this slide you can
find resources for asp.net c-sharp and
sequel server interview questions that's
it for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
