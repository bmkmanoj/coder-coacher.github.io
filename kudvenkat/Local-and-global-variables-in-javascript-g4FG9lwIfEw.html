in this video we'll discuss local and
global variables in JavaScript in
JavaScript there are two types of
variables local variables and global
variables let's look at a few examples
here we have a function called hello
world inside this function we are
declaring a variable called greeting and
initializing that with a string hello in
the next line we are modifying its value
creating equals creating Plast
JavaScript so at this time this variable
contains hello JavaScript string and
then we are writing its value to the
document and finally we are calling the
function so when we run this we expect
the string hello' javascript to be
printed on the web page let's try and
access this variable greeting outside of
the function now this variable is
declared inside the function so the
scope of this variable is local to that
function meaning that variable is
available only inside the function but
here we are trying to access it outside
of the function let's see what's going
to happen when we run this notice that
we get this string hallo javascript
printed once on the page that's done by
the function and then we have this error
message greeting is undefined that's
basically because this variable greeting
is available only inside the function
outside the function it's not available
and that's the reason why we get
greeting is undefined error so in this
example variable greeting is a local
variable so local variables are the
variables declared within a function
these variables have local scope meaning
these are available only inside the
function that contains them local
variables are created when a function
starts and deleted as soon as the
function completes execution
what are global variables global
variables of the variables declared
outside a function global variables have
global scope meaning all scripts and
functions on the page can access them
the lifetime of a global variable starts
with its declaration and is deleted when
the page
is closed let's look at an example so
let's move this line outside of this
function so here we are declaring
greeting variable outside of this
function so greeting now is a global
variable
this means this variable will be
available to all the functions on this
page hello world should be able to
access that variable so when this
function is called it is going to change
the value that is present in this
variable and then the function is
writing its value to the document and by
calling the function here so it should
print hello JavaScript to the web page
and let's print an HTML break and then
we are accessing greeting variable again
outside of the function since it's a
global variable now it should be
available even outside the function so
when we run this we expect Hello
JavaScript string to be printed two
times so in this example this variable
greeting is a global variable so what's
a global variable a global variable is a
variable that is declared outside a
function not only that if we assign a
value to a variable that has not been
declared then it will automatically
become a global variable even if it is
present inside the function so let's
look at an example of that so I'm going
to get rid of this variable declaration
so at the moment outside of the function
we don't have greeting variable declared
and inside the function I'm not going to
use the VAR keyword instead I'm going to
directly assign a string to the variable
so in this example greeting is not
defined but we are assigning a value
directly to it so in this example this
variable greeting is going to
automatically become a global variable
so here we are writing its value you
know to the document and then notice
here we are trying to again access this
variable greeting outside of the
function and it is perfectly okay
because of the fact that you know if you
assign a value to a variable that has
not been declared it will automatically
become a global variable so when we run
this piece of code
we expect the string hello javascript to
be printed two times a local variable
can have the same name as a global
variable changing the value of one
variable has no effect on the other if
the variable value is changed inside a
function and if a local version of the
variable exists then the local variable
gets modified if the variable value is
changed outside a function then the
global variable gets modified let's look
at an example so let's define a variable
here let's call it greeting and let's
initialize that to hello from global
variable now since we have defined this
variable outside the function it's a
global variable now what I'm going to do
is declare another variable with the
same name inside the function so at the
moment we've got a global and a local
variable with the same name and inside
the function you know I'm going to
access this greeting variable and append
three question marks to it and let's
change the string here to hologram local
variable and then outside of the
function I'm going to access again the
greeting variable and then append three
exclamation marks to okay so far within
this program we have got two variables
that is greeting a local and a global
variable with the same name now remember
inside the function only local variables
has got meaning so if you try to access
or modify a variable called greeting
inside this hello world function only
the local version gets modified so this
local version of the variable contains
hello from local variable with three
question marks appended to it and then
outside of this function we also have a
global variable with the same name and
at the moment it is initialized with the
string
from global variable and here we are
again accessing greeting variable so
will the global version of this variable
be modified or will the local version be
modified outside of the function in a
global variables have meaning so only
the global variable gets modified so
hello from global variable with three
exclamation marks will be present so we
are calling the function printing the
HTML break and then we're printing the
value within the creating variable so
when this program completes execution we
expect hello from local variable with
three question marks to be printed first
and then an HTML break and then hello
from global variable with three
exclamation marks let's run this and see
if that's what we care notice that hello
from local variable hello from global
variable sometimes due to the concept of
variable hoisting and local and global
variables with the same name can cause
unexpected behavior let's look at an
example so here we have a very simple
example we have a variable called
greeting and this is a global variable
okay and that's initialized to this is
from global variable string and then we
are calling this function hello world
and that function is defined right here
so within the hello world function we
are accessing greeting variable now we
have a global variable with that name
okay and then what we are doing later in
this function is creating another
variable greeting with you know but we
on this page we already have a global
variable with that name so here in this
example we have a global and a local
variable with the same name okay and in
JavaScript this concept called variable
hoist and we already discussed what is
function hoisting function hoisting
means JavaScript moves all function
declarations to the top of the page that
concept allows us to call a function
even before that's defined okay this
code is okay because function hoisting
is cotton is going to move this function
declaration to the top of the page so we
can call the function before
it is defined the same concept is also
applicable to variables so we have a
concept called variable hoisting so what
do we mean by variable hoisting
depending on the variable scope they
will either be moved automatically to
the top of the page or to the top of the
function if it's a local variable that's
called as variable hoisting so here
notice in this function we have this
local variable greeting so at runtime
what actually happens is you know this
variable declaration will be moved to
the top of the function because that's a
local variable and at the moment we're
greeting will not be initialized to
anything because only the declaration
will be moved to the top and then we are
printing its value directly you know to
the document object since we don't have
any value defined this is going to print
this message undefined okay so do the
concept of variable hoisting and local
and global variables in this script have
the same name so a combination of this
can cause unexpected behavior you know
undefined because here our intention is
basically to print the value that is
present in this global variable and then
initialize another local variable with
this string
but then you know Java Script is going
to work slightly differently if you have
a global variable and local variable
with the same name inside of the
function only the local variable has got
meaning it will not be referencing the
global variable and because of variable
hoisting concept we get that unexpected
behavior undefined so basically so here
we have a global variable and then let's
try to call that function hello world
and let's get rid of all this code and
inside the function
so if we do this then this is perfectly
fine it's going to print that message
hello from global variable because
inside this function we don't have a
local variable of the same name so when
we access creating it level access the
global variable but the moment we
declare a global variable I mean a local
variable with the same name due to the
concept of variable hoisting at runtime
the variable declaration will be moved
to the top and because of that we get
undefined error in JavaScript braces do
not create scope if you look at the
example right here notice this other
number variable is actually declared as
part of this two braces now in many
languages like C sharp in Java breast
braces create scope but not in
JavaScript so this other number variable
in this example it's a global variable
because of the fact that braces do not
create scope in JavaScript so when I say
document or tried other number it will
be available outside of those braces as
well thank you for listening and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
