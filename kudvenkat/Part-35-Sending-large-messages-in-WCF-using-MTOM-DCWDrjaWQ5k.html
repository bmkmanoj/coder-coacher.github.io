this video we'll discuss sending large
binary messages in WCF using M term for
better performance the default message
encoding mechanism and WCF is text text
message encoding is going to base64
encode data which has these two
disadvantages base64 encoding is going
to increase the message size by
approximately 33% it also involves
additional processing overhead in the
sense that the sender has to base64
encode data and the receiver has to be
64 decoded so obviously there is
additional processing overhead involved
so the preferred approach to send large
binary messages and WCF is to use em Tom
message encoding m tom is an
interoperable standard and it stands for
message transmission optimization
mechanism M term doesn't base64 encode
data this also means that the additional
processing overhead to base64 encode and
decode data is remote hence M Tom can
significantly improve the overall
message transfer performance with text
message encoding the binary data is
base64 encoded and it's embedded within
the soap envelope itself with M Tom
binary data is included as a mime
attachment if this statement doesn't
make sense at the moment don't worry
let's look at an example and it should
make it clear so let's flip to visual
studio let's create a new project here
and let's create a class library project
and let's call this download service so
this download service is going to be our
WCF service let's delete this class 1
dot cs file lets auto generate it and
let's add a WCF service to this project
and let's name our WCF service as
download service and this service
contract is going to have one operation
contract let's call it download document
and obviously this operation is going to
return a file to the client whoever
calls this method
so within my C Drive there's a folder
called data and within that I have a
PowerPoint presentation introduction to
WCF let's say we want to you know make
this DVD available from our WCF service
to the clients okay
so now we want to return this document
to whoever is going to call this method
now to return the document I'm going to
create a data contract and to speed
things up I have already typed the data
contract so let's copy it and paste it
right here so we have here at last
called file and it has got two members
data members you know this name property
is going to hold the name of the file
that we are going to send to the client
and this content property look at that
what it is returning it's returning a
byte array so the content of the file is
going to be returned as a byte array
okay so a simple data contract there and
this data contract is present in system
rot runtime rot serialization namespace
so make sure you have that namespace
included all right so now this download
document is actually going to return
this file so don't get confused with
this file class with the file class that
is present in system that IO dot system
dot i you named space so this is our
custom type where as you know the file
size that is present in system dot io
that's from the microsoft.net framework
okay all right
so this is our service contract and
within the service implementation let's
implement the interface I download
service so here you know this download
document is going to return a file so
within the method implementation first
let's go in go ahead and create an
instance of the file class so this file
class is actually present you know
basically right here within our download
service make sure you're creating an
instance of that file class and not
system dot IO file class ok so now
within this folder C colon backslash
data
we have you know this file introduction
to WCF that's what we want to send to
the client so file dot content and if
you remember this content property
expects byte array and we are going to
get that using the file class that is
present in system dot IO dot namespace
and there's a method called it read all
bytes and we need to provide the path of
the file and the path of the file is
going to be C colon backslash data
backslash and what's the name of the
file
introduction to WC f dot PPT so let's
copy that and paste it right there so
this method is going to read the
contents of that file in the form of the
byte array and then it's going to
initialize this content property and
then file dot name let's hard code it to
you know introduction to WC f dot PPD
and then all we need to do is to return
that file okay all right so we are done
implementing our WCF service now let's
host this and to host this let's use you
know I is so let's create a website so
add a new website and we want to select
this WCF and we want to create that
website within our download service
itself so let's get to C colon and then
download service so within this folder
we want to create a project and let's
call this maybe I as host click OK so
that should create a website for us and
within that code we can get rid of these
two files here we discussed in detail
you know hosting a WCF service in is in
part 29 of this video series so if
you're new to is hosting a WCF service
please watch that video series and let's
rename our servers to download service
dot SVC and within this service file
let's actually remove this code-behind
file and we need to specify the fully
qualified name of our service here
so it's download service and its present
in download service namespace so if you
look at our service its download service
present in download service namespace
and that's what we are specified in this
dot CSV file and one more important
thing that we need to do is add a
reference to this project
okay so right click on the project add a
reference and we want to add a reference
to download service and the final step
is to open is and then create a virtual
directory for this one and to open is
within the run window type I net MGR and
then expand sites and we want to add an
application here and let's call this
maybe download service and let's use the
asp.net version 4.0 Apple and we have to
select the physical path where is our
project legend present that's present in
download service and within that we have
this is host project that's where you
know we have our service file click ok
and we are done so now right click on
this download service and select this
option switch to content view lets you
know browse to this SVG file and make
sure you know the service is working as
expected
ok so we got an error there that's
possible it could be because we haven't
build this solution so let's actually go
ahead and build this control-shift be to
build the solution so build succeeded
now let's go ahead and refresh this okay
so there we go our services working is
expected now let's go ahead and create a
client application right now so let's
flip to another instance of Visual
Studio create a new project let's create
a Windows forms application and maybe
let's call this simply client click ok
let's drag and drop a button control on
to this form
so we need a button control and then
let's change the text on the button to
something like a now download file
all right
and then let's quickly resize this so
let's go ahead and add a service
reference to our download service that's
the URL so let's copy that and specify
it right there click OK
and one more thing which we have
actually forgotten to do is to actually
specify the configuration for our
download service now you know we have
some default configuration that is
generated here let's actually go ahead
and copy this configuration will go this
configuration just a bit so let's copy
and paste it within the web dot config
file of the WCF service ok and look at
this configuration we have you know
discussed this in several videos in our
previous video session the only section
that's new here is this binding section
but apart from that you know we have
specified service behavior to enable
metadata exchange we are going to
include the exception details and fonts
that's the service behavior there and
then look at this here we have the
service the service name is download
service and then for the endpoint we
have the address binding and contract
and notice that we have also specified
something called binding configuration
we'll discuss that in just a bit but
notice that it's the contract as I
download service which is nothing but
the contract that we have here and if
you look at the binding we are using WS
HTTP binding ok and that's the base
address where our service is available
and what is this binding configuration
look at this this is pointing to
something called WS HTTP and if you look
at the bindings section here that is
where
by the binding configuration and here
look at the name this is what is our you
know this element this attribute is
referring to so notice message encoding
here we have specified that as text now
even if we don't specify this you know
the effect is going to be the same
because the default message encoding
mechanism is text okay but for to be
explicit let's actually specify it there
so at the moment we are using text
message and coding okay so now let's
actually flip to the client application
and then generate a reference to a WCF
service once again so let's update the
service of reference actually we didn't
give it a meaningful name so let's
actually get rid of that then add it
from the scratch once again so let's
delete that and that and let's add a
service reference let's actually copy
the URL click go so download services
phone there and let's give it download
service as the namespace click ok so
that should now generate a proxy class
for us okay so within the button click
event so what do we need to do we want
to invoke the download document method
of this download service so within the
download service namespace there is
something called download service client
which is or proxy so let's go ahead and
create an instance of that and then this
client is going to have a method called
download document and if you look at the
return type what is it returning it's
returning a file object and that's
present within the download service
namespace so let's go ahead and specify
download service dot file let's call it
file equals that ok and then obviously
this file has two properties that is the
name and content okay now what we
basically want to do is the file that we
have downloaded we want to save it to
this folder within the DC drive there is
a folder called downloaded files so into
this folder we want to download that
file so
copy that part there and then say system
dot IO dot file and this method has got
a method called write all bytes so you
specify the path where you want to write
all the bytes and then give you the
bytes that you want to write to that
file to that file and it's going to do
that job okay so in the service if you
notice we are using read all bytes to
read the bytes from the file and to
write the bytes to your file we are
going to use write all binds okay and
obviously we need to specify the name of
the file so it's going to be a sequel
and back slash download files back slash
instead of hard-coding the name we can
use the name property of the file object
that we are receiving so save it with
the same name to that file and we need
to provide it with the bytes and where
are the bytes coming from the content
property so this content property is
going to return a byte array so save
them to this file there okay and then
maybe we will show a message to the user
so message box dot sure maybe we want to
simply say file dot name you know
whatever that file is downloaded all
right
with all these changes let's go ahead
and run the application but before we do
that let's go to the app dot config file
of the client and they look at this here
we have again the bindings section so
it's using the same kind of endpoint
address binding and contract look at the
binding it is using WS HTTP binding and
look at the binding configuration
attribute so it's pointing to something
with this name and if you look at the
bindings element here you know this has
got that name binding name equals this
and look at this this lot of
auto-generated code here now do we
really need all this not really let's
actually get rid of this in
I think here to keep it simple so I'm
going to delete everything out from
there and then what we are going to
specify here is message encoding now
this is option you don't have to do it
because if you don't specify message
encoding the default is going to be text
anyway so irrespective whether you
specify this attribute here or not the
effect is going to be the same okay but
to be explicit let's specify there let's
go ahead and run our client and click
this button download we should get a
message okay so now look at this we are
getting an error what is the error
saying the maximum message size quota
for incoming messages you know 65,536
has been exceeded to increase the quota
use the max receive message size
property on the appropriate binding
element so what we have to understand
here is that these binding elements have
got something called message quotas and
the default message size that's allowed
you know is 65 K but if your message
that you're exchanging is bigger than
that then you will have to increase your
message size okay and how do we do that
by specifying this attribute max
received message size property and you
have to specify that property both on
the client and the WCF service as well
okay so let's go ahead and do that and
that's there for a security reason you
know to prevent denial of service
attacks okay so now let's actually go to
our WCF service so here is our download
service let's go to the app dot actually
within the web config file because
that's what we have used to host the WCF
service and here we have message
encoding text and we also need to
specify max receive to message size
let's actually set it to something
700,000 bytes
okay and within this we also need to
specify reader quarters and this has got
something called max array length we
need to specify that as well so let's
specify that also to 700,000 okay
now let's flip to the client application
and do the same thing so max receive
message size is going to be 700,000 and
let's also specify reader quarters and
max are a length so 700,000 all right
but these changes let's actually run our
client application click download and
look at that
introduction to WCF PPT is downloaded
let's quickly verify that within the
downloaded files notice that we have the
file there now what we need to do here
is let's actually fire up fiddler and
you know watch the data that is
transmitted between the WCF service and
the client so I have fiddler installed
on my machine so let's fire up fiddler
let's actually delete this traffic
that's already captured so now let's go
back here click the button once again
okay so introduction to WCF PPD is
downloaded ok click ok now if we look at
this here first of all let's go to
inspectors look at the content type here
it says application soup XML okay and
then if you look at the text view here
notice that the soap envelope is
beginning here and then look at this
text right here this is what is the PPD
byte array and this entire data is now
base64 encoded ok and then this is
present within the soap envelope itself
so the soap envelope is beginning here
and then if we scroll all the way down
look at that the soap envelope is
closing here so the data is base64
encoded and it's part of the soap
envelope itself and if you look at the
content-type application slash
soap XML okay and if you look at the
statistics look at the bytes received
it's 600
sixty three thousand six hundred and
seventy seven bytes okay so let's open a
notepad and paste it there so with the
text message and coding that is what is
the traffic that is sent from the WCF
service to the client those many bytes
are transmitted now let's keep this
fiddler open let's go back to our WCF
service now to make your WC of service
use M Tom message encoding all you need
to do is change this message encoding to
M Tom so we have done this on the WCF
service let's also do the same thing
within the client application so here
message encoding let's specify M Tom
okay with these changes let's run the
client once again and then click this
button download now we should be using M
Tom message encoding click OK
let's go back to fiddler so here is the
request now first of all look at the
bytes received four hundred ninety nine
thousand six hundred and forty nine
bytes now compare that with you know
text message encoding so this is M Tom
look at the amount that is you know
reduced so obviously in the data
transfer performance this significant
performance improvement okay and again
if you look at this inspectors tab look
at the content type
it says multi-part are related and look
at this it's a mime attachment look at
this we have a mime attachment and look
at the soap envelope itself here get the
soap envelope begins here and it ends
right there okay and then look at that
the mime attachment is right here and
look at the data here it's actually
binary data if you view this in notepad
you can actually see that binary data
but then the point that we have to
understand here is with M Tom you know
we don't have that base64 encoding which
is going to bloat the message size by
approximately 33% you know we have the
binary
yes and as a mime attachment okay so
that's the mime attachment ID and look
at that this is all the binary data you
know directly within the message as an
attachment okay
so it begins here the binary data this
soap envelop basically is ending right
there all right so obviously you know
depending on the number of parts that
are exchanged between these service and
the client proves that M Tom is better
for sending and receiving large messages
you know with the WCF service and it's
an interoperable standard as well so a
java application or a C++ application
which can understand M Tom can
interoperate with your application
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
