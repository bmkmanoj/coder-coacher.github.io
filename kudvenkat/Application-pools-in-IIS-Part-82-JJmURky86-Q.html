venket this is part 82 a phase B dotnet
video series in this session we'll
discuss about water application pools
creating application pools application
pool identities associating an asp.net
web application with an application pool
first we'll look at how to associate an
application with an application pool and
then we'll discuss about application
pools now here I have a very simple
asp.net web application project on this
web form one I have some static text now
if I run this by pressing control f5 by
default Visual Studio uses the built-in
is Visual Studio has got built-in is
that is being used to actually run this
project look at the URL localhost colon
1 4 1 1 8 that's the port number /the
name of the web form okay in the task
manager you can actually look at that so
if you double click that there asp.net
development server so this is the visual
studio built in is this is fine if we
are just developing applications but
then after development if we want to
make our applications available to the
end-users either on the internet or on
the intranet then we have to deploy this
to actual iis and there are two ways to
do that one from within the visual
studio itself ok if you want to deploy
this application to is from within
Visual Studio right click on that web
application project go to the properties
and within the properties tab click on
the web tab and look at that by default
it is using Visual Studio development
server instead of that I want to use
local is web server and this is the URL
using which I am going to access my
application and look at the URL it says
HTTP colon localhost
I mean colon four slash four slash
localhost application pools demo that's
going to be the name of the virtual
directory which gets created in iOS okay
now does this name has to match with the
name of the application
not necessarily you can give this
virtual directory any meaningful name
that you want ok I'm going to give that
app 1 ok so when I click on this
button create which will directly that's
going to create a virtual directory
within is but before that let's actually
get to is and to get to is there are two
ways one way is click on the start
button go to control panel and within
control panel click on system and
security Administrative Tools is manager
that's one way which gets us to is and
the other way is to simply click on the
start button type run and plus enter
within the run window type I net manager
click OK that should bring up is as well
and explain that root node within is and
then expand sides and expand default
website and look at this here at the
moment we don't see you know an
application with name app one but the
moment I click on this button create
virtual directory it's going to create
that which will directly there look at
the message the virtual directory was
created successfully click OK get to is
refresh this default website and look at
that we see that app one there now if I
come to visual studio and press control
f5 look at the URL up we didn't save
that so let's go ahead and change save
that first and then now press ctrl f5
there so now it should actually use the
I is rather than the built-in visual
studio development server okay so we are
running this asp.net web application
project using is and now this
application is using one of the
application pools so what our
application pools so if you look at this
I have application pools here ok by the
way we have just seen how to create an
application within is using Visual
Studio can't I do that directly within
Visual Studio you can do that as well
okay let me delete this app one here and
let's see how to create an application
directly here to do that right-click on
the web you know default website folder
add application and look at that you can
give it an alley ass I'm going to call
that app one and then you can select the
application pool here we'll talk about
application pools in just a bit and then
give the physical path where is this web
application project present this web
application project
is actually present in C Drive to figure
that out right-click on the project and
say open folder in Windows Explorer look
at this this is where it is present C
colon backslash application pools demo
that's the solution folder and this is
the web application folder so my web
application is present in C colon
backslash application pools demo
backslash application pools demo so
within I as we have to specify that
physical path so click on the ellipsis
button navigate to C Drive application
pools demo and application pools demo ok
and click OK
that's it now if I go ahead and press
control f5 I am still able to access it
there the same way so we can a the
deploy or application directly from
within Visual Studio or you can do it in
is ok now these applications you can
create as many applications as you want
depending on how many web applications
you have you may create that many
applications within is now all these
applications can be present within the
same application pool or you know half
of them present in one application pool
and half of them may be deployed to
another application pool ok so now let's
talk about what are these application
pools so an application pool can contain
one or more web applications in is it is
actually possible to create one or more
application pools now is it possible to
create my own application pools
absolutely and how do we do that
just right-click on the application pool
and application pool and then give it a
name meaningful name now whatever you
see here our built-in application pools
now if I right click and say add
application pool I am creating my own
application pool let's call this for
example a pool one and select your
dotnet framework version I have taught
net framework version 4.0 so I am going
to target that so that a pool one is
created currently within this
application pool I do not have any
applications but whereas asp.net version
4.0 has got three applications and you
know you can see the rest of that there
ok so
applications in different application
pools run in its own overcut process by
default when we actually run an
application okay it's going to run
inside the asp.net worker process I have
Windows 7 on my machine so the asp.net
worker process here is w3w P dot exe and
to look at the worker process
right-click on your taskbar and go to
the task manager and within the task
manager click on show all processes on
the processes tab click on show process
from all users and then press W key on
the keyboard look at that W 3 w P dot
exe this is the executable which is
actually executing or running my asp.net
web application project and look at the
description there that is IES worker
process manager now if you don't have
application pools for example let's say
if we don't have application pools all
asp.net web applications are run using
the same worker process and then what's
going to happen if that worker process
dies or recycles for some reason all the
web applications get affected okay but
the application pools what's going to
happen so applications in different
application pools runs in its own worker
process okay so every application pool
has got its own worker process so
obviously you know there are four now
five application pools here each
application pool has their own worker
process now if I deploy two applications
to this pool I can deploy the rest of
two applications to this pool and if
there is something wrong with this
application pool only the applications
within that pool are affected but
whereas applications within this pool
are not affected and it's also possible
that you can configure security
differently for different application
pools okay so that's the advantage we
get application we can maintain
isolation between applications okay so
errors in one application pool will not
affect the applications running in other
application pools and also remember each
application pool has its own worker
process for example if an application
pool is recycled only the applications
in that
are affected and they may lose state
information is stored inside worker
process but applications in the other
pool are not are unaffected in fact
we'll look at this example practically
in the next video session deploying
applications different to different
application pools enables us to achieve
the degree of application isolation that
we need in terms of availability and
security okay now how in terms of
availability if one application pool is
affected
you know the applications only within
that pool are not available but
applications from the other pool are
available and similarly hot the
applications that require to have high
level of security I will deploy them to
an application pool that has high level
of security configured and various
applications that doesn't require that
high level of a security I can deploy
them to another application pool so
basically it gives you that flexibility
of you know availability and security
depending on your application needs for
examples applications that require high
security can be present in one
application pool and other applications
can be in a different application pool
another example hosting providers
internet service providers for example
can place competing business
applications in different application
pools so that they do not accidentally
access the data belonging to the
competitor a speed or Net Applications
execute inside the asp.net worker
process called ab3 WP dot exe the
applications are executed by the worker
process using the windows identity okay
now if you look at this okay the
application pools there are different
application pools here and then within
this application pool we have several
applications and those applications are
used or executed using the worker
process the is worker process called w3w
P dot exe now under what identity is the
worker process going to execute the code
that depends on the application pool
identity so if I right-click on my
application and go to advanced settings
on the application pool look at that
there is something called identity and
look at the application pool identity
here okay if I click the ellipsis button
there look at the built in accounts that
I have I have local service local system
Network service application pool
identity these are the built-in accounts
that are used okay you can configure at
an application pool level which account
you want to use and these account some
of them have high security and some of
them are least privileged accounts will
talk about these accounts in just a bit
but remember whenever the worker process
executes your application code that's
going to have an user account associated
with that worker process so which user
account is it using that depends on the
application pool identity that they
select here okay by default it's going
to use the application pool identity
we'll talk about these security settings
you know in the next video session in a
very great detail okay but remember
there is something called application
pool identity that can be configured on
a pair application pool basis so the
applications are executed by the worker
process using a Windows identity the
Windows identity that is used is
dependent on the application pool
identity the application pool identity
can be any of the following built-in
accounts we have seen them local service
local system network service in addition
to these built-in accounts we can also
use a custom account by providing the
username and password so for example if
I take this app pull one go to the
Advanced Settings and I go to identity
click on the ellipsis button these are
the built-in accounts that I can use or
I can use a custom account by selecting
that and then specifying the username
password and then you know re-enter the
password to confirm by default when a
new application pool is created it uses
the application pool identity and that's
what we have just seen okay we created
this new application pool here which is
Apple one and look at that by default it
is using application pool identity but
it's possible to change the application
pool identity by going to advance it
settings and using this ellipsis button
and these are the different user
accounts that we can use with the
application pool identity in a local
system this is a local system account
which is completely trusted account and
this has very high privileges and there
is nothing you know that is not possible
with this account you can do anything
with this account on that machine in
fact it has you know more privileges
than you than the administrator and it
can also access the network resources
okay whereas if we look at network
servers it's a restricted or limited
account which is generally used to run
standard least privileged services this
account has less privileges than local
system account or the administrator and
this account can access network
resources it's there in the name network
service it can also access network
service but remember this is a least
privileged account usually used to run a
standard least privileged services local
service again this is a restricted or
limited service similar to network
service the difference is local service
as the name States it can only access
local resources not network resources
application pool identity whenever we
create a new application pool you know
is creates a virtual account with the
name of the new application pool and
runs the application pools worker
process under this account this is also
a least privileged account okay so
usually when if you remember we created
this app pull one and when we created
that it automatically creates a virtual
account with named Abdul one in fact to
look at that I can actually come to this
waveform one view code and I actually
can say response dot right and then
system dot security dot principle within
this I can say Windows identity it has
got a static method called gate current
and then dot name okay so let's write
you know the current user account that's
executing our code okay but then before
that let's ensure our application is
associated with that
application is app one I want to
associate that with Apple one how do we
do that simply right-click on that
application within is managed
application go to advance it settings
and here select your application pool
whatever application pool a pool one I
click okay okay and now I go to
application pools I have a pool one now
what is the identity it is using
application pool identity okay so let's
go ahead and run that now so when I
press control f5 it should print the
name of the user account under which the
application code is being executed look
at that is app pool backslash a pool one
that's the name of the account okay so
when a new application pool is created
is creates a virtual account with the
name of the new application pool so here
the name of the application pool is a
pool one so is has actually created an
account with that name a pool one and my
application code is now executed you
know using the account privileges that
this app will one account has got and
that's a least privileged account and
always keep in mind running applications
using a low privileged account is a very
good security practice because if there
is a bog you know a malicious user
cannot take the advantage of that bug to
hack into your application or system and
we have seen how to associate an asp.net
web application with an application pool
okay so the whole idea is that when we
use application pools we have that
isolation between applications depending
on our application needs we can deploy
them to the right application pools okay
which provides us with you know custom
security for different applications and
custom you know probably the
availability again if there is a problem
with one application pool only the
applications within that pool are
affected applications in the other
application pool remain unaffected on
