in this video we'll discuss output cache
attribute in MVC output cache attribute
is used to cache the content returned by
a controller action method so that the
same content does not need to be
generated each and every time the same
controller action method is invoked
let's understand this with an example
we'll be using this table TBL employee
for this demo let's flip to visual
studio the first step is to add an ad
dotnet entity data model based on that
table so let's add a new item click data
on that installed templates area dotnet
entity data model and let's name it
sample data model we want to generate
our model from the database click Next
and we want our connection string to be
saved as sample DB context within the
web config file click Next
this is going to connect to the database
and retrieve all the tables views and
stored procedures and we are interested
in this table TBL employee so let's
select that and we want our models to
live end models a namespace click finish
so this should generate an entity with
named TBL employee but let's change the
name to employee let's save all the
changes and let's build the solution so
that this employee entity is compiled
the next step is to add a controller so
let's right-click on the controller's
folder add a controller let's name this
home controller and let's use this
template MVC controller with read /
write actions and views using entity
framework and the model class is going
to be employee and the data context
class is going to be sample DB context
let's click Add so this should generate
the home controller and all the views
index create edit delete details let's
make some modifications to the index
action method within the home controller
now look at this this index action
method is returning the list of
employees that are present within this
table but since this table is so small
this action method is going to return
that list in less than a second so let's
introduce some latency and
do that I'm going to use system dot
threading dot thread dot sleep so we are
basically making the thread sleep for
some time and we have to provide at the
time in milliseconds so let's make it
sleep for maybe three seconds so 3,000
milliseconds all right and let's make
some changes to the index view now
within the table in the first row I want
to print the date and time at which the
Employee List is retrieved
okay so let's use a TD and set the
column span to four because every row in
this table has got four rows and I want
a width of this table to span across
those four CDs you know we are setting
the column span at 4 and to print the
current date and time you know we can
use at day time dot to string they timed
up now dot to string let's print a
message here saying employee list
retrieved at and if we want to print
that at symbol we have to escape that
with another @ symbol so at that date
and time and let's put this inside a
bold tag all right and then let's use a
div text to set the style attribute
and let's set font family to area and
let's move this closing tag to the end
and the final modification is to set a
border for our table so let's set the
border alright with all these changes
let's build the solution and let's fire
up a browser and navigate to the index
action within the home controller and
the first time this index action method
is going to take at least three seconds
because we made the thread sleep for
three seconds and every subsequent
request is also going to take three
seconds look at that I click this
refresh button look at that it's still
processing and the data is returned at
that point of time
so I hit enter look at that we got the
data now so every time we make a request
in order to slash home slash index this
index action method within the home
controller will be invoked and it's
going to take at least three seconds to
return the data now if we cache the data
then this method will not be executed
every time you know a request is made
instead the data will be simply returned
from the cache so the performance of the
application will be much better so how
do we cache data using output cache
attribute so output cache and we need to
specify how long you want to cache the
application data you definitely don't
want that to be remaining in the cache
indefinitely and to specify the duration
we use you know this duration parameter
and you specify the time in seconds okay
so duration equal to let's say I want to
cache this data maybe for 10 seconds
okay
so let's build it the solution now the
first time we make a request is going to
take at least three seconds
it retrieves the data and then it caches
that and gives it to the view and the
view is send it back are sent back to
the client
so the next time when we make a request
to the same action method since the data
is already
- it's going to return that from the
cash so it shouldn't take three seconds
so first time we hit so it's processing
now let's look at the time okay now if I
make another request okay that I get it
right away and the time doesn't change
so the data is cash and we instantly get
the data back because the method doesn't
need to be reacts acute at every time
but once the cash expires you know the
method needs to be look at that it's
still processing the method needs to be
reacts acute it and then you know the
data is written but then within ten
seconds if I make a request I'm going to
get the data from the cache so this
controller action method is processed at
most every ten seconds all right so here
we are cashing you know the entire view
here okay now is it possible to cache
only a portion of a view absolutely and
one of the ways to do that is by using
child action methods so let's see how to
do that with an example let's get rid of
this thread dot sleep statement and
let's also remove this output cash
attribute from the index action method
and let's have another action method
let's make a copy of this and let's say
I want to return you know total count of
employees so let's call this get
employee count and then all this is
going to do is return a string and what
is it going to return simply employee
count equals so it's going to return
this message employee count is equal to
so how are we going to get employee
count we can use DB dot employees dot
count function so DB dot employees is
going to return us all the employees but
I want the count of them convert that
the string and then let's also print the
date and time so employee count is equal
to whatever at whatever date in time
so at and how do we print date and time
date/time dot now dot to string is going
to print the current date and time all
right
and then let's decorate this with child
action only attribute so that nobody can
make a direct URL request to this action
method and then we want to cache the
data that is returned by this action
method so I'm going to use output cache
attribute and then let's specify the
duration I want to cache this for 10
seconds and then we need to invoke this
action method within our view so within
the view just after the closing tag of
the table let's include two break
statements and then we need to invoke
this child action method and how do we
do that at HTML dot action helper can be
used and all you need to do is specify
the name of the action method what is
the name of our action method get'
employee count all right with all these
changes let's build the solution let's
come and navigate to the index view
so look at that we have the employee
count here now every time i refresh this
view this time changes but not the time
here because that portion of the view is
cached so to cache a portion of a view
we can make use of you know the child
action methods now is it mandatory that
we have to use child action methods to
cache a portion of a view not
necessarily even if you if I remove this
child action only attribute will the
solution
look at the date and time now if i
refresh that once again look at that
this changes but this doesn't change so
we are still able to cache portions of a
view so i refresh that again look at
that the time on the top changes but not
this time which is displaying the
employee count okay so we don't
necessarily have to use child action
only attribute to cache a portion of a
view but if we don't use child action
only then somebody will be able to
invoke this public method within a
controller by issuing a URL request okay
so if you want to prevent that from
happening and if you want to cache
portions of a view then we can make use
of child action only but if you want to
cache
you know portions of a view at the same
time if we also want to allow users to
be invoking this action method directly
then you don't have to decorate that the
child action only attribute and we have
discussed about caching concepts in
parts 119 to 128 in asp.net tutorial
those concepts are still applicable for
asp.net MVC so if you're new to cash-in
I strongly recommend to watch those
videos that's it for today thank you for
listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
