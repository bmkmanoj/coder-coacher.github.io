this video we'll discuss how to load
JSON data from the server using jQuery
CAD function this is continuation to
part 56 so please watch what 56 before
proceeding first let's look at the
syntax of ket function this function has
four parameters the first three
parameters are similar to the load
function the fourth parameter is
datatype this parameter specifies the
type of data that we are expecting from
the server the data type can be XML JSON
script or HTML this means using the get
function we can work with any type of
data be it XML JSON script or HTML if we
don't specify the type of data that we
are expecting explicitly then by default
jQuery is going to make an intelligent
casts let us understand this with an
example this is the same example that we
worked with in a previous video session
notice we are using gate function here
and this function is making a request to
this page get help text dot aspx and so
you look at this page this page is
returning HTML data but then if you look
at the sketch function notice that we
are only specifying the first three
parameters the URL to which we want to
make the request the data that we want
to send to the server and the callback
function but we are not specifying the
type of data that we are expecting from
the server so we are not specifying this
fourth parameter data type but in spite
of that the application continues to
work as expected right so if we want we
can be explicit and specify the data
type so here we are expecting the type
of data to be HTML so I can specify HTML
like that so let's save the changes
reload this page and it should continue
to work in the same manner look at that
so now let's see how to retrieve JSON
data from this server so the first thing
that we have to do is modify this get
health text or aspx page to return JSON
data at the moment it is returning HTML
so for this page to return Jai
and data we can get rid of this
development because we are no longer
returning the HTML and within the
code-behind file the first thing that I
am going to do is create a class let's
call this help text and this class is
going to have two public properties and
the both of them are going to be of type
string let's call the first property key
so this property is going to hold the
help text key and the second property
let's call it text this property is
going to hold our help text associated
with the key all right and within this
get help text by key function instead of
this variable I am actually going to
create an instance of this class help
text so help text help text equals new
help text and we are going to populate
these two properties key and text so
here you know whatever response we get
from the database so we actually get the
help text from the database so we are
using this help text object and I'm
going to populate the text property and
similarly let's populate the key
property to the help text key so we are
receiving that as a parameter into this
function so let's use the parameter all
right so we have the help text object
and we are returning that help text
object after populating both the
properties now we have a compilation
error here because this function at the
moment is returning string so let's
change the return type to help text all
right so at the moment our get help text
by key function is returning in a health
text object so within our page load
event we want to convert that help text
object into JSON format and to do that
I'm going to use JavaScript serialize a
class this class is present in a
different
name space that is system web dot script
dot serialization so here let's go ahead
and create an instance of JavaScript
serialize a class let's call it J is so
new JavaScript serializer
and this object has got serialize method
and to this function we want to pass the
object that we want to serialize so the
object that we want to serialize is
whatever this function returns get help
text by key so I'm going to cut that
code and paste it right there so let's
get rid of this so what is this function
going to return jason serialized
I mean serialize method of the
JavaScript serialize a class it's
returning a string back that is the JSON
string so let's store it in a variable
let's call it jason string equals
whatever we get back and the final thing
that we want to do is write it to the
response stream alright so at the moment
this github text or aspx page is
actually returning a json string so now
let's go back to this HTML page 1 dot
HTML and look at this let's get rid of
now we are not getting HTML data so let
me actually remove that data type
parameter let's build the solution and
let's go ahead and reload this page and
see what's going to happen look at this
when the field receives focus we get the
entire JSON string displayed look at
that we get both the key and text
properties the entire JSON string but
that's not what we want we want just the
text property from the JSON object so to
achieve that here the first thing that
I'm going to do is specify the type of
data we are expecting the type is JSON
and you know this is the callback
function so this response parameter is
going to receive that JSON object and
this object is now going to have
those two properties text and key we
want to display the text property value
so I'm simply going to say response dot
text so let's save the changes let's
reload this page and look at this when
the field receives focus now we get only
the text if you want the key as well
maybe you can say response dot key and
let's separate them with a column symbol
so let's save the changes let's reload
this page and look at this and the field
is focused now we get both the key and
text properties thank you for listening
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
