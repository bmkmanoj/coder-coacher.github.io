in this video we'll discuss how to
prevent browser default actions first
let's look at some of the browser
default actions for example when you
click on a link the browser navigates to
the page is specified in the link and
when you right-click on a web page the
browser displays the context menu in
some situations you may want to disable
prevent these clauser default actions
for example some of the websites disable
right-click and the reason they say they
have disabled right-click is for
security because they don't want
end-users to right-click and copy their
content but are you achieving anything
by disabling right-click not really
because if the end-user disables
JavaScript support in the browser they
will still be able to right-click and
copy your content so you're not really
achieving anything but a sibling
right-click you're just annoying users
so don't disable right-click in the
browser having said that let's see how
to prevent these browser default actions
there are actually two ways we can do
that the easiest way is by simply
returning false when that event occurs
and here is an example when we right
click and when the context menu is about
to be displayed this event is raised on
context menu and notice that we are
simply returning false so this is going
to prevent that context menu from
appearing let's look at this in action
so here we have the body section and
within that we have this h1 element so
at the moment I am able to write like so
when we select these text and
right-click on that I will be able to
copy it now let's see how to disable
this context menu from appearing when
the right leg so on the body element on
context menu
return false so let's save the changes
reload the page and look at this when I
right click nothing happens another way
to prevent the browser default action is
by using the event object let's look at
that example now so instead of using
this on context menu attribute let's
write a JavaScript function
and let's name this prevent default
action and this method let's pass the
event object event object equals event
object or vandal dot event so this or
condition is for ie8 and earlier
versions F even dot prevent default so
there's a method called prevent default
and this method is supported only in ie9
and later versions and all the other
modern browsers ie8 and earlier versions
doesn't support this prevent default
method
so for IE 8 and earlier versions we are
going to use return value property of
the event object and we are going to set
that property to false and for ie 9 and
later versions and all the other modern
browsers we are going to use prevent
default function and we are going to
call this function when context menu
event occurs
so document dot on context menu we want
to call this function all right so with
these changes let's reload the page and
now let's right click notice that
nothing happens let's look at another
example now let's see how to prevent
link navigation when we click on a
hyperlink so instead of this h1 tag
let's use an anchor tag and set H ref to
presume techcom
right now let's reload the page so we
have this hyperlink now when we click on
this hyperlink by default it goes to
presume techcom our page now we want to
prevent that default action right so
here we already have a function which is
going to prevent the default action so
all I'm going to do is on click I'm
going to call this method prevent
default action
so now let's reload this page first of
all notice that I am not able to right
click that's because of this line of
code and when I click on the link it
doesn't go anywhere and that's because
we are calling that function on click of
that event right now you can use the
event object as we have done so in this
method or on click of the hyperlink
simply return false let's reload the
page notice that when I click on the
hyperlink nothing happens thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
