banquette this is part 92 of asp.net
video series this is continuation to
part 91 if you haven't watched that part
I would strongly encourage you to do so
before continuing with the session in
this session we'll discuss about
authenticating users against the list
that's stored in a database table in
part 90 we discussed about
authenticating users against the list
that is stored in web config file now
that was easy to do because forms
authentication class exposes a static
method called authenticate now to that
method we pass in the username and
password and the authenticated method
will will take the responsibility of
comparing that username and password
with the list that's stored in the web
tour config file so it was pretty much
easy to do in part 91 we discussed about
registering users to a database table
okay if they don't already have a
username and password we have discussed
about how to register them with our
application in this session we'll
discuss about authenticating users
against a list that's stored in a
database table so obviously if we have
to authenticate users against a list
that's stored in a database table then
we will have to do all the hard work in
terms of writing the stored procedure to
authenticating users and then to invoke
that stored procedure from the dotnet
application let's see how to do that
with an example let's flip to visual
studio now in sequel server we have this
table called TBL users at the moment we
don't have any users but if you remember
in the previous session we have
discussed about registering users so if
you haven't watched that part I would
strongly encourage you to do so so let
me go ahead and run this application and
register a user so I am on the login
page let me click on this link click
here to register and on the registration
page we can provide the details let's
say I want a user name of test password
of tests and the confirm password test
and the email is going to be tested test
comm click register now let's go ahead
and check the users table okay so we
have a test user there now what I want
to do is I want to enable you know I
want to basically authenticate against
this list that I have in the database
now in part 90 we discussed about
authenticating users
against the list that stood in
web.config file so if you look at this
web config file I have some users here
in part 90 we have discussed how to
authenticate users that are stood here
but in reality do we really store use a
less than web config file now so this is
not a practical thing to do so let me go
ahead and remove these users here
because we are not going to use them
anymore we are going to make use of the
users that are there in the database
okay and then if you look at the login
page at the moment let's get the login
page so on the login page so we are
using that authenticate method of the
forms authentication class which takes
this username and password compares that
with the list that's there in the web
config file but now we don't want to do
that we want to be authenticating users
against this list that we have in the
database so the first thing to do is
obviously to create a stored procedure
which will take in username and password
as the parameters authenticate them and
return they you know whether the
authentication is successful or not
so just to save some time in typing I
have the stored procedure already
created so let me copy and paste it
there so if you look at the stored
procedure the name of the stored
procedure is sp authenticate user it
takes in two input parameters both of
type and we're cat username and password
what are we doing here we are creating a
variable of type integer account so this
is the key statement so select at count
is equal to count off username from TBL
users where username is equal to
whatever parameter that we are passing
in the username and password so if there
is a match for the username and password
that we have passed into the stored
procedure then this count will be at
least one so if the count is 1 then we
know that the username and password that
we have passed into the stored procedure
match with one of the entries in TBL
users table okay so if there is a match
then I am selecting one as return code
otherwise minus one as return code one
means the user is successfully
authenticated minus one means it's an
invalid username and password so what we
will do we will invoke the stored
procedure from our dotnet application so
let me go ahead and create the stored
procedure
okay so there is an incorrect syntax
that's because we are missing a comma
there so let's put that comma plus f5
command completed successfully so we
should have that stored procedure let's
refresh this stored procedure folder so
SP authenticate user now we need to go
ahead and not indicate I mean we need to
go ahead and call the stored procedure
from the dotnet application but let's
quickly test if it's working as expected
so if you remember within this database
I have test user and this password is
all you know encrypted basically so let
me copy both of these and then use them
as the parameters here so test is the
password and test is the username and
that's the password password is
basically encrypted so let's sell test
test so I'm passing in the right
password okay let's put a comma there to
separate the parameters let's execute
this now okay a written code is one on
the other hand if I just enter some new
characters in the password it should
return minus one plus a five minus one
so the stored procedure is working as
expected all we have to do right now is
to invoke that stored procedure again
just to save some time in typing I have
written this method again it's pretty
simple and straightforward ad or net
code if you haven't watched the series
on ad or dotnet I would strongly
encourage you to do so okay so I am
having a private method here a private
method that returns boolean true or
false and the name of the method is
authenticate user and what is this
method going to do this method is taking
in two parameters username and password
okay both of them are type string and
then we are creating the connection
string and creating the sequel
connection object creating the instance
of CTL command and we are telling we
want to invoke the stored procedure SP
authenticate user since this is a stored
procedure we are specifying the command
type s stored procedure and then this
procedure expects two parameters at
username and password so we need to
create those two
two parameters here at username at
password and then the values for the
parameters are coming in as input
parameters into this method so wherever
we invoke this method we will pass the
values for this user name and password
parameters so those are the two values
therefore those two parameters and we
are then associating that parameter
objects with the command object and
finally open the connection and then
return code we are retrieving the return
code look at that the stored procedure
returns a single value okay whether it
is one or minus one it returns a single
value that's why we are invoking the
execute scalar method and the return
type of execute scalar is object type
but we had but we know that we are
expecting an integer that's why I'm
safely typecasting that to be of type
integer and then look at that what you
are doing see ultimately this method
should return a true or false true if
the user is authenticated false if the
user is not authenticated so we knew
that if the stored procedure returns one
that means the user is successfully
authenticated so we are check comparing
the written code with one return return
code is equal to one so this expression
that I have highlighted should return it
true if the return code is one otherwise
it returns it forms because minus one is
not equal to one so that returns a false
okay so all that is left out right now
is to invoke this method so within the
login click button login click initially
we were using the authenticate method of
the forms authentication class but now
since we want to authenticate users
against a list that's stored in the
database instead of using that method
all I'm going to do at the moment is
replace that with this authenticate user
method so we are invoking that method
authenticate user we are passing in the
user name from the textbox and password
from the textbox that said if this
method returns true we are redirecting
the user from the forms from from the
login page ok as we will show invalid
username and password to message to the
end user that's it so
we have done until now is created the
stored procedure which is simple and
straightforward and then we invoke that
stored procedure in this private method
within the login button Clegg we invoked
this method instead of the authenticate
method of the forms authentication class
ok so let me go ahead save these changes
run the application and see if it works
as expected
so the user name is test so let me type
and test let me type in a wrong password
first and click login look at that
invalid username and a password on the
other hand let me type in the correct
password it is still saying invalid
username and password and guess why okay
look at that I am typing again the right
password but I still get the same
message that is because if you remember
the passwords in this table are
encrypted but then look at how we are
passing in the passwords to the database
okay we are retrieving whatever the user
has typed in the text box passing them
to this method authenticate user okay so
we are passing in the password there and
the way we are passing it to the look at
this this is the sequal parameter that
is taking that value and passing it to
the stored procedure now if I type in in
the text box test as the password so it
will be passed as test to the stored
procedure now if I pass the value test
to the stored procedure as the password
will this return one no because why the
password that stood in the database is
encrypted so if I press execute it
returns minus one it doesn't match with
the password that I have there within
the database
so before comparison I actually have to
encrypt the password and then pass it
and how do I do that within the forms
authentication class we have hash
password for storing in config file
method we have discussed about this in
the previous session so we give it the
password and specify the hashing
algorithm it's going to hash the
password and return that as encrypted
password so let me create a variable and
let's store in that so encrypted
password is equal to that and we want to
pass the password into this method so
I'm going to pass that and we also need
to specify the hashing algorithm we used
sha-1 when we were registering the user
so we need to use the same algorithm
okay so if you remember on the
registration page when we were
registering the user B we used sha-1 as
the hashing algorithm and we are using
the same here and then what we need to
do we need to pass that encrypted
password for comparison to the stored
procedure ok that's it
with this change now let's go ahead and
run this now when we enter the password
it will encrypt that and then send it
across so test and test I click login
now look at this invalid value for
password for password format parameter
oh yeah look at that it should be sha-1
not sa h1 let's correct that fetch a 1
so let's run this once again the
algorithm is sha-1 so test and test is
the password and click login
look at that we are on the login page ok
so in this session we discussed about
authenticating users against the list
that's stored in the database table on
