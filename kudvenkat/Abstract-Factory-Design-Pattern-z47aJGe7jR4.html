n of the design patterns tutorials in
this session we will discuss what is
abstract factory design pattern
implementation guidelines of abstract
Factory and we'll take a look at an
example to implement at shack Factory
and we'll also discuss the major
differences between abstract Factory and
factory method please refer to the
previous parts of the tutorial before
proceeding let's take a look at the Gang
of Four Defamation about abstract
factory pattern as per the Gang of Four
definition the abstract factory pattern
provides a way to encapsulate a group of
individual factories that have a common
theme without specifying the concrete
clashes to simplify knapsack factory
pattern provides an interface for
creating families of related or
dependent objects without specifying
their concrete classes abstract factory
pattern belongs to creational patterns
and is one of the most used design
patterns in real world applications we
can say that abstract Factory is a super
Factory that creates other factories now
let's take a look at the implementation
guidelines of abstract Factory we need
to choose abstract factory pattern run
the application need to create multiple
families of objects or products and when
we need to use only one of the subset of
families of objects at a given point of
time and then we want to hide the
implementation of the families of
products by decoupling the
implementation of each of these
operations now if you take a look at the
illustrator diagram of abstract factory
representation the client is a class
which uses abstract Factory and abstract
product interfaces to create a family of
related objects abstract Factory is an
interface which is used to create
abstract product concrete Factory is a
class which implements the abstract
factory interface to create concrete
products
abstract product is an interface which
declares the type of product concrete
product is a class which implements the
abstract product interface to create
product if this is confusing at this
moment don't worry as we are going to
take a deep dive on implementing these
points using a simple example now let's
consider a business requirement where a
company decides to hand out computers to
contract and permanent employees based
on the designation and employee type
with below specification let's say a
permanent employee who is a manager is
eligible for Apple laptop and rest of
non managers are eligible for apple
desktop whereas in case of contract
employee who is a manager is eligible
for Dell laptop and rest of non managers
are eligible for Dell the stops diable
business requirement can be achieved by
leveraging on abstract factory pattern
now let's bring up the visual studio and
learn how we can implement the abstract
factory pattern without previous working
example let's open the employee table
and add a new column called computer
details let's define the data type as
our CAD let's make it as 215 and let's
click on update click update database
update completed successfully now let's
switch the models and open employee
model da TDM X and let's right click on
this model and the update model from the
database let's click on refresh expand
the tables and let's refresh the
employee table the changes are updated
successfully now let's create a new
folder under factory folder by click add
new folder and name this folder as
abstract Factory let's
some enumerations to support the
business requirement let's right-click
and add new item and let's choose the
class and name this glasses in
numeration let's create some
enumerations related to our business
requirement let's first create public
enum computer types which are laptop and
desktop let's create another enumeration
and let's call this enumeration as
branch as we know that we need to hand
out apple and Dell brand desktops or
laptops let's also create another
enumeration and name it as processors
and let's create some processors as I
three I Phi and i7 let's now create
abstract product interfaces which
declares a type of product so I click on
abstract factory folder add new item
let's create an interface and name this
interface as I brand which returns brand
name so let's name this meta name as get
brand and the brand could be anything
which could be Dell brand or Apple band
let's create another interface add new
item choose interface and let's call
this interface as I system type
this interface will have a method which
returns the system type and name it as
get system type let's make this
interface as public now let's create
another interface named I processor
right-click and new item choose an
interface the name this interface as I
processor which returns a processor and
let's create a method get' processor and
make this interface as public these
three abstract product interfaces
together compose a product which in our
case would be a laptop or desktop that
the specified configurations let's so
implement these interfaces into concrete
product classes let's right click on the
abstract factory folder and new item
choose a class and let's name this class
as Mac dot CS which implements I branch
let's implement the I brand method over
here which is get brand and let's return
branch dot Apple dot to string that
resolved this issue by using the
enumeration and let's return bands dot
Apple dot two string let's create
another class right click add new item
choose class and let's name this class
as tell which implements the I branch
let's implement the I brand interface
and that's written in numeration dot
branch dot
Dell dot two string to save some time I
have already implemented dot I processor
interface for concrete products which
are high five and i7 I have also
implemented the I system type to return
the respective laptop or desktop as
system types now that we have families
of related products let's create an
interface which composes these products
right click on abstract factory folder
and new item choose an interface let's
name this interface as AI computer
factory let's add the products that we
have created to this interface which are
AI processor let's name this as
processor I brand ranch and I system
type as system type now let's create
concrete factories which implements this
abstract factory interface to create
concrete products let's right click on
this abstract factory folder add new
item choose class and let's name this
class as Mack factory so that it creates
Apple laptop and desktop now let's
inherit the I computer factory I
computer factory and implement them
interfaces now when we need to create a
Mac factory let's say this is creating a
new desktop then the brand would return
as return new Mac as a brand and the
processor would be i7 so let's say we
will be creating a Mac desktop that I
seven processor
pi7 and the system type would be
returned new desktop let's also create a
Mac laptop Factory let's create it over
here
public class Mac laptop factory which
inherits I computer Factory now let's
implement the interfaces implement
interface and let's say the brand will
be written new Mac and the processor
will be written new i7 processor and the
system type will be returned new laptop
now if you also the Mac factory and the
Mac laptop factly both has got the same
brand as well as the processor the only
difference between these two is the
system type so let's refine it further
and install inverting the I computer
factory for Mac laptop factoring let's
inherit from the Mac Factory let's say
Mac laptop factory in her it's the Mac
Factory and let's remove these
implementations and change this
implementation as virtual system type so
that we can override it here let's now
create concrete factories which
implements the abstract factory
interface to create Dell products let's
right click on the abstract factory
folder add new item choose class and
name this class as Dell factory
which inherits from I computer factory
let's implement the interface methods
implement interface and let's return
written new Dell as a brand and let's
return the processor as I five return
new Wi-Fi and let's return the system
type as return new desktop let's so
create a laptop factory for Dell similar
to the Mac laptop factory let's say
public class Dell laptop factory which
inherits Dell factory and we just need
to override the system type so let's
declare virtual over here and public
over I PI system type is your system
type and let's return new laptop now
that we have implemented the abstract
interfaces as well as concrete
implementations to those abstract
interfaces and products let's see how we
can address the business requirement
right click on the abstract factory add
new item and choose a class and let's
name this class as employee system
factory let's create a method click
which returns a computer factory and
let's call this method as create which I
accepts the employee as the input
parameter
with all this issue by using the brought
models let's declare the return value as
I computer factoring i compute a factory
return value equal to null if a dot
employee type ID equal to one which
means his opponent employee then if the
employees job description is manager
then for all the managers we are going
to give laptop factories of Apple which
means written value equal to new Mac
laptop factoring other than managers we
are going to return or assign the return
value equal to new mark factoring that
means all the Mac desktops now if he is
a contract employee which means else if
e dot employee type ID equal to 2 which
means contract employee then if a dot
job description equal to manager we need
to assign the written value as written
value equal to MU Dell laptop factoring
else written value equal to MU del
factoring let's return the written value
turn written value now let's create a
client class which will be responsible
to derive the system details based on
the created concrete factories let's
right click on abstract factory folder a
new item choose class and named this
class as employee system manager
and let's create a I computer Factory in
the score I computer factory centralizer
let's create a constructor public
employee system manager which acts EPS
input parameter as I computer factory
computer Factory and let's assign
underscore I computer factory is equal
to AI computer factoring let's create a
method public string get system details
which uses this AI computer Factory and
retrieve the respective brands processor
and system type let's say I brand brand
equal to underscore I computer factory
dot plant and I processor processor
equal to underscore I computer factory
dot processor i system type system type
equal to underscore I computer factory
dot system type let's assign the return
value as string written value equal to
string dot format of 0 and 2 which means
brand dot
get brain , system type dot get type and
processor dot get processor return
written value let's resolve this error
by making this I computer factory as a
public interface blink and let's switch
back let's rearrange all the classes
under the abstract factory folders based
on the representation diagram which we
have illustrated in the starting of this
tutorial let's create a folder abstract
product I click a new folder a name it
has abstract product and let's move I
brand I processor I system type under
the new folder let's create a folder
called concrete product right-click a
new folder and say concrete product and
move all the concrete product
implementations under this folder which
are Mac tell processors and computer
systems let's create another folder a
new folder and name this folder as
concrete factories and let's move
implementations related to abstract
factory interface so let's move Mac
factory Dell factory and employees
system factoring into this folder let's
create another folder and name this as
client new folder client and let's move
the employee system manager under this
folder
let's also create a folder named
abstract interface and that's mu I
computer factory and then in that I hope
now you are clear with what we have
implemented till here
let's now integrate these changes and
implement the requirement in the
employees controller let's open the
employees controller let's create the
abstract Factory here I computer factory
factory equal to new employee system
factory dot create and let's pass the
employee as a input parameter for the
create method now let's use the client
which we have created which is employee
system manager manager equal to new
employee system manager and which acts
of this abstract factory manager dot get
system details will retrieve the
respective systems that we are handing
off to the employees so let's say
employee dot computer details equal to
manager dot get system details
let's go switch to the views expand
employees and let's go to the index view
and let's add this new column that we
have created in the header which is
module dot computer details let's also
add this in the table data
choose the existing one and change this
to computer details let's compile this
application and let's run this
application let's click on employees and
create a new employee name as George job
description as manager P 3 4 5 6 as the
number and department as ID let's choose
the employee type ID as permanent and
let's click create
notice that George who is a permanent
employee and the manager is allotted an
Apple laptop i7 let's create another
employee and let's name the new employee
as Sebastian and let's put the Job
Description as developer and the number
as d 2 3 4 5 department as ID and let's
do the apply type as permanent here as
well let's click on create look at that
Sebastian is created as developer with a
computer details as apple desktop i7 now
before creating a temporary employee
let's try to debug this application and
see how it behaves let's put a
breakpoint over here at the create
method and let's run through this
application let's create a new employee
let's name this employee as Andreo job
description as manager number RS c 3 4 5
6 department as ID and let's change the
employee type to contract let's click on
create now let's step into this code
notice that since the employee type ID
is equal to true and the job description
is manager we are creating
dell laptop factory and we are returning
the abstract factory back to the client
let's step in through the client look at
that the abstract factory is getting
initialized over here and then we are
invoking the gate system details which
invokes the respective brand processor
and system type and retrieves the
corresponding values let's press fi now
notice that and you who is a contract
manager is allotted with Dell laptop
with IFI configuration with this we have
successfully addressed the requirement
by using the abstract factory design
pattern now let's take a look at the
major differences between abstract
factory in fact another pattern the
abstract factory design pattern adds a
layer of abstraction to the factory
method pattern abstract factory pattern
implementation can have multiple factory
methods similar products of a factory
implementations are grouped in abstract
Factory
as you have noticed abstract Factory
uses object composition to decouple
application from specific
implementations factory method users
inheritance 2d couple applications from
specific implementations I hope now you
got familiar with the abstract factory
design pattern in the next session we
will discuss and learn another
creational pattern please feel free to
post your comments and feedback in the
comments section thank you for listening
