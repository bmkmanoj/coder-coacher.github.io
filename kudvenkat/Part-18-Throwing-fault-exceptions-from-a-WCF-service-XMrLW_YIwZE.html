this video we'll discuss throwing Paul
exceptions from a WCF service this is
continuation to part 17 so please watch
part 17 from the WCF video series before
proceeding with this video a WCF service
should be throwing a fault exception or
fault exception of T instead of taught
net exceptions and that's because of two
reasons reason number one an unhandled
dotnet exception will cause the
communication channel between the client
and the server to fault
once the communication channel is in a
faulted state we cannot use the client
proxy anymore we will have to recreate
the proxy from the scratch we discuss
this in detail in part 17 of the WCF
video series on the other hand fault
exceptions will not cause the
communication channel to fall let's look
at this in action let's flip to visual
studio so this is the same calculator
service that we worked with in the
previous session of this video series so
if denominator so if this denominator is
equal to zero then let's throw divided
by 0 exception divided by 0 exception is
present in the system namespace so let's
go and bring in system namespace so
divide by 0 exception so if denominator
is 0 we are explicitly throwing / 0
exception and this is a dotnet exception
ok and this exception is obviously
unhandled within the WCF service so
let's go ahead and build our WCF service
so the service is running right now
let's flip to the client and again this
is the same client application that we
worked with in the previous session
let's update the service reference so
the service reference is being updated
now
let's go ahead and run the client
application
so now let's pass in the numerator s10
and denominator as zero and if the
denominator is zero this service is
going to throw an exception and what
type of exception is the service
throwing a dotnet exception instead of
fault exception so as a result of this
what's going to happen the communication
channel between the client and the
server is going to get into faulted
State let's actually look at that in
action so once I click divided you know
in a bit we should get divided by zero
exception message attempted to divide by
zero and then if I try to use declined
proxy once again look at this what's
going to happen you know we get an error
and what type of error we get look at
this we get communication object faulted
exception so the communication channel
between the client and the servers in
faulted state we cannot use the same
proxy class anymore we'll have to
recreate it from the scratch okay so
that is one of the downsides of throwing
dotnet exceptions
instead of fault exceptions so what you
know if we don't want our communication
channel to be faulted then through fault
exceptions okay so instead of throwing
the dotnet exception we are going to
throw a new fault exception and then you
know this fault exception constructor
has got several overloaded versions
let's specify a reason so the reason is
going to be you know denominator cannot
be zero and we can also specify a fault
code so let's specify a new fault code
and then let's use this constructor way
we can specify you know the name for the
fault code and let's call this divided
by zero fault
now the service here is throwing a fault
exception instead of a dotnet exception
and let's see what's going to happen now
let's close this service host that's
already running let's rerun our service
and host it let's close the client and
then let's update the service reference
and then let's run the client let's go
ahead and divide 10 by 0 click divide so
denominator cannot be 0
look at this this is the reason that we
have specified here you know The Fault
exception reason and then we have here
fault code as well now if we want to
display this fault code within the
client application now we can use this
fault exception object
so let's actually display fault code as
well so fault exception dot there's a
property called code and look at the
return type it's returning fault code
object and from that fault code we just
want the name all right so that's the
client application so let's go and rerun
the client application once again let's
divide 10 by 0 so now we should get
default code as well look at that you
know fault code is divided by 0 fault
and that's default reason all right now
look at this when I try to divide number
10 by 2 look at this we are using the
same proxy we are not creating a new
instance of the proxy class and look at
this it still works
okay so if we threw a fault exception
from a WCF service then it's not going
to fault the communication channel
between the client and the server
servers so that's one of the reasons why
a WCF service should be throwing fault
exceptions
instead of target exceptions now what is
going to happen when we throw a dotnet
exception the WCF service is going to
think that something very bad has
happened and it's going to shut the
communication channel down between the
client and the WCF service alright and
there is another reason why we should
actually be throwing fault exceptions
instead of dotnet exceptions that is if
we want our WCF service to be
interoperable then we should be throwing
fault exceptions now here both our
service and the client or
net so if we threw a dotnet exception
then the client application is also a
dotnet application so it's it can
understand that the dotnet exceptions
but on the other hand if the client is a
java application or some other
technology then you know the client
cannot understand these dotnet exception
objects so if we want our WCF service to
be interoperable then you know the
services should be throwing fault
exceptions instead of dotnet exceptions
because dotnet exceptions are platform
specific and can be only understood by a
client that is also dotnet now we have
discussed that a WCF service should be
throwing a default exception or fault
exception of T so what is this fault
exception of T now this fault exception
of T is going to allow us to create
strongly type soap false
we'll discuss this our next video
session that's it for today thank you
for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
