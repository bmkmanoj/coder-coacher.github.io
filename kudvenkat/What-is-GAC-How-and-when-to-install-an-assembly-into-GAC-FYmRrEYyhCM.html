am venket this is part four of dotnet
basics in this session we'll understand
what GAC is how and when to install an
assembly into GAC now GAC stands for
global assembly cache and it contains
all these stronger named assemblies the
advantage of installing an assembly into
the GAC is that you know that specific
assembly can be shared with multiple
applications without having to have a
copy of that assembly in each of the
projects where you want you said let me
explain this with an example now let's
say I have this console application all
it does is prints out this message onto
the console and to this solution I want
to add another project okay let's say I
want to add a class library project so
we shall see sharp class library and
let's call this class library project
and click OK
so this should add this class library
project within the solution and let's
say within this project I have a sample
class which has got a static method that
returns a string so public static string
and then get name maybe which returns a
simple string so written a string like
this
all right so every simple assembly class
library project now obviously when we
build this project as you might expect
we have an assembly generated and I want
to use that assembly within this project
now if you look at the console
application within this control
application we are using the console
class that is present in the system
assembly so where is the system assembly
coming from from the references folder
if you look at the reference here you
know this project has a reference to the
system assembly now where is the system
assembly coming from now keep in mind
this is a dotnet framework assembly and
when we install dotnet framework on this
machine
this assembly got installed into the cat
okay we will see where it is present in
a bed okay so basically if you want to
use an assembly external to this project
then you have to add a reference to that
assembly and to do that you right click
on the references folder add reference
and basically there are two ways to add
a reference to this project this class
library project ok we will talk about
that in a great detail in a later
session but for now understand that if I
have to add a reference to this class
library project then I go into the
Browse tab and we know that this project
is present in introduction to c-sharp
folder within the C Drive so we go to
introduction to c-sharp folder within
the C Drive and we have the class
library project get into the bin debug
and then select the assembly and the
moment we do that that gets added to the
references so class library project and
now what has actually happened when we
added this reference let's look at that
so when I open this project within
Windows Explorer ok so this is the
console applications project now
obviously this is introduction to
c-sharp and we compile that project we
get an awesomely for this project so
when I get into the bin folder
okay so I have introduction to c-sharp
assembly that's fine
ok let's rebuild this once again
okay so I have introduction to C sharp
that's fine but if you look at this this
project bin folder introduction to C
sharps project bin folder has also got
this class library copy of the assembly
so how did we get this so that's what
happened when you actually added it
reference to this class library okay so
so obviously if I have to use this
assembly let's say in ten different
projects and when you add a reference
what's going to happen a copy of that
assembly is made into all of the ten
projects where you want to use that okay
but whereas if you install that assembly
into the GAC you don't have to do that
okay so the reason why this assembly get
copied into the bin folder of this
control application is because if you
look at the properties of that assembly
so there is a property called copy
looker which is set to true which means
copy that assembly locally into the bin
folder of this controller application
okay but if you set that to false then
it doesn't get you know copied into the
local directory but then there are other
implications which we'll talk about in a
later session but on the other hand if
you look at the system assembly when I
right-click on that and get to the
properties this copy local property is
set to false which means you know for
all the assemblies that are present in
the gap you know when you add a
reference to those assemblies by default
the copy local will be false which means
a copy of that assembly will not be made
into the bin folder of that particular
application so what's the advantage of
installing an assembly into the GAC
you can potentially share that assembly
with multiple applications without
having to have a copy of that assembly
in each of the projects where you want
to use that but again can we install an
assembly into the gag every time now
okay now if there is really a need to
install an assembly into the gap if you
think that it's going to be potentially
shared by multiple applications then go
ahead and install that into the CAC but
otherwise you shouldn't be doing that
okay so it's recommended to install an
assembly
into the gag only when required and
shared by applications otherwise they
should be kept private now there is
another specific reason why you
shouldn't be installing an assembly into
the gag now you shouldn't add an
assembly into the gag if you wish to
deploy your application to another
machine using xcopy deployment now what
do we mean by xcopy deployment xcopy
deployment is basically simply copying
an application from one machine to
another machine or one location to
another major location you just copy the
contents of that folder that application
folder so when you do that only the
contents I mean that some leads and
other files that are present within that
Applications folder gets copied over to
the new location or to the new machine
but the contents that are present in the
GAC they don't get copied over so
obviously the dependent assemblies
doesn't get copied over to the target
machine because of which your
application will not get properly
executed when you do an ex copy
deployment and when you have strong
named assemblies in the gag okay
that's why if you intend to do an ex
copy deployment for your application
then the assembly should not be you know
installed into the GAC they should be
kept private and they should be present
in the application folder that is
containing the exe ok all right
so let's now talk about the GAC itself
now it's Sun it's done it turns out that
until the introduction of dotnet 4.0 we
only had one version of the gag and the
location for the GAC until the
introduction of dotnet 4.0 is C colon
backslash windows directory backslash
assembly now this path may be slightly
different from machine to machine on
some of the machines you might have
named the windows installation directory
as when NT in that in that case the part
for the GAC is XIV in NT and assembly
and if you look at this this is what the
CAC here's you have the assembly name
version number culture and public key
token okay now with the introduction of
dot
4.0 we have another gag okay so if you
look at the slides here okay with the
introduction of dot point dotnet 4.0 we
have two gags and one for dotnet 2.0
23.5 okay for all the versions from
Watney 2.0 to 3.5 all these version of
the assemblies get installed into this
version of the GAC C backslash Windows
backslash assembly but if it's a dotnet
4.0 assembly then that gets installed
into this location so if somebody asks
in an interview you know what are what
is the path for GAC they're basically
two parts one for dotnet versions 2.0 to
3.5 and another one for dotnet 4.0 all
right so now to install an assembly into
the dag you use a tool called GAC
utility global assembly cache utility
tool okay basically there are two ways
one of the ways is simply to drag and
drop you know from one folder to another
folder just drag and drop the assembly
it gets copied over or you can use this
cat utility to GAC util dot exe so we
will see how to install an assembly into
the GAC using this clack GAC utility
tool okay so now if you look at this
project we have this class library
project and you have already seen it has
generated an assembly for us so let's go
ahead and see that and try to install
that assembly into the GAC and keep in
mind this is Visual Studio 2010 so if
you are building an application using
Visual Studio 2010 by default we are
targeting dotnet framework 4.0 so this
assembly is making use of dotnet
framework 4.0 so it gets installed to
this new gap which is C Windows
microsoft.net backslash assembly ok so
now let's try to install this assembly
into the GAC okay
and to do that GAC unity is a command
line tool so obviously we need to get to
the Visual Studio command prompt so all
programs Microsoft Visual Studio 2010
Visual Studio Tools Visual Studio
command prompt right click run as
administrator so this should bring a
Visual Studio command prompt now you
know that
the part where we have our assembly is
this part so get copy that part and
change the directory to that path by
typing CD and then the part of the
directory and then we want to use CAC
utility here so CAC utility CAC Utah dot
exe again dot exe is optional here and I
want to install an assembly so - I so we
specify our intention using this I
switch I want to install an assembly and
then the name of the assembly itself so
the name of the assembly that I want to
install is class library DLL so paste
that now when I press ENTER I get an
error but we'll solve that in a bit
so what is the error message that you
are getting failure adding assembly to
the cache attempt to install an assembly
without a strong name so obviously if
you want to install an assembly into the
GAC the assembly has to be strongly
named ok but if you look at this
assembly it's not strongly named and if
you remember in the previous session we
have discussed you know how to sign and
assembly you know using a private and
public key pair and then convert that
into a strong named assembly if you
haven't watched that video I strongly
encourage you to do so ok so if you
remember we have generated a key pair
using SN e XE tool in a previous session
so this is the key file which contains
our private and public key pair again if
you're not sure about this please watch
our previous video so copy the name of
the key file and we know that if we want
to sign the class library assembly with
this private public key pair we use the
assembly info dot CS file and within
that we use the assembly key file
attribute
so assembly key file attribute and to
the constructor of this attribute we
pass in the name of the key file that
contains our keys okay
and since backslash has a meaning we
need to escape that with another
backslash okay so now if I rebuild a
solution what's going to happen this
class library assembly gets signed with
this private public key pair so now this
assembly is a strongly named assembly
and we can install that into the gap
without any issues let's see how to do
that again so the same command gack
utility dot exe - hi class library dll
so now assembly got added successfully
to the cache now so to check if it is
successfully added which version of the
gag should we be checking we should be
checking the second one because we are
using Visual Studio 2010 and Visual
Studio 2010 mix makes use of dotnet
framework 0 up framework 4.0 by default
ok so let's get to that path so it's
present in C colon backslash Windows
backslash microsoft.net backslash
assembly so within this path you have
another folder called gag MSI l
Microsoft intermediate language and if I
open that you should see this class
library folder here and within this
folder you will have your version number
basically we are targeting dotnet
version 4.0 so that's what you can see
underscore the version of the assembly
if you look at the version of our class
library assembly it's 1 dot 0 dot 0 dot
0 so that is that version here and then
another underscore and at the public key
token okay so this folder uniquely
identifies our class library dot DLL and
since this is dotnet framework 4.0 we
got that assembly installed into this
new CAC for dotnet 4.0 assemblies ok
now to uninstall the assembly from the
GAC you use you know the
the same tool but you use a different
switch - I for installation - you for an
installation so I can use the same
command except that I need to use - you
and if I press ENTER the assembly
doesn't get installed I'll explain why
in a bit so it says ok it didn't give us
any error it is just saying number of
assemblies uninstall is equal to zero
that's because when you are uninstalling
an assembly you cannot provide this
extension dot DLL so you have to get rid
of that so dot DLL and when I press
ENTER you see that one of the assemblies
is basically uninstalled here ok so if
you look at this assembly it got
uninstalled so you don't see this that
folder class library folder here anymore
now as I told you by default if we have
Visual Studio 2010 we are targeting
dotnet framework 4.0 okay but it's
possible you can change the targeted
dotnet framework and the way we do that
is right click on the project and get
into the properties and now here you can
change the dotnet target framework now I
want to target let's say for example
dotnet 3.5 I select that you get a
warning just say s as a result of
switching you know from 4.0 to 3.5 some
of the references might get invalid but
that's fine let's go ahead and build our
project now so when I build our project
now what what have we done now we have
switched the target framework from 4.0
to 3.5 so obviously now if I try to
install this assembly into the GAC it
gets installed into our another you know
into the version which for which I mean
for dotnet basically 2.0 and 3.5
assemblies so which is C Windows
assembly so it gets installed into this
location let's see that so gakuto - i +
library dll when I press ENTER so
assembly successfully added to the cache
so we get to that version of the
assembly so it's present in C colon
backslash Windows backslash assembly so
you should see the class library
assembly here so the name of the
assembly the version number is this one
and this is the public key token okay
now let's do another thing let me add
let me change the version of this
assembly to 2.0 so by default the
version is 1.0 I'm changing the version
to 2.0 and then rebuild the solution and
then I'm trying to install this assembly
once again and let's see what's going to
happen so now this assembly got
successfully added to the cache once
again and if we get into the windows I
mean into the GAC once again you should
see there two versions of class library
one is version 1.0 and the other one is
2.0 okay so now assemblies with the same
name but has got different version can
live side by side in the same folder and
this is called side by side execution
within dotnet assemblies with the same
name with the same public key token but
different versions can live together and
execute together alright so and this
feature is called as I told you
side by side execution and this is one
of the common interview question what do
you mean by side by side execution
within dotnet or they can also ask you
can two different assemblies with the
same name live in the same folder of
course all right so now if I go ahead
and uninstall try to uninstall the
assemblies look at that when I say - you
and when I press ENTER now what's going
to happen so you're saying okay
uninstall and assembly with name class
library and if you look at that I have
got two assemblies with that name so
when I try to exclude this command
what's going to happen
both the assemblies gets uninstalled
okay let's see that so when I press
ENTER so it's trying to uninstall both
of the assemblies so if you look at the
message here number of assembly is
uninstalled - okay let me say I don't
want both of the assemblies to be
uninstalled I want just one of the
assemblies may be version 1.0 to be
uninstall is that possible
absolutely but you have to specify the
fully qualified name
okay so to uninstall an assembly to
uninstall it specific assembly using GAC
utility what you do I mean it's exactly
the same command except that you specify
the version number and public key token
as well okay
so in this case version 1.0 assembly
alone will be uninstall okay but keep in
mind when you're using you know the
fully in full name of the assembly make
sure you don't have a space between
comma and the letter V and similarly
between this comma and this letter P if
you have space it gives you an error
message all right
on this slide you can find resources for
a speed Orient and c-sharp interview
