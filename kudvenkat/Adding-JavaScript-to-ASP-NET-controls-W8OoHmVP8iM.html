asp.net tutorial in this video we'll
discuss different options that are
available to add JavaScript to asp.net
server side controls let's understand
this with an example let's flip to
visual studio here I have an empty
asp.net web application project to this
project let's add a new webform and to
this waveform let's add an image button
image button is a server-side control
now what we want to do is when we move
the mouse or the image button we want to
display a green button and when we move
the mouse away from the image button we
want to display a blue button I already
have these two images I'll have these
images available on my blog in case you
need them so let's copy these images add
a new folder to our project let's name
this images and paste the images into
this folder now when this image button
initially renders we want to display
this blue button so image URL equals the
images are present in this images folder
slow for slash images forward slash the
name of the image is blue button dot PNG
so let's go and run this now when the
page renders we should see the blue
button now when we move the mouse over
it should change to green and when we
move the mouse of a it should be blue so
on mouse over equals we can specify the
JavaScript that we want to execute in
response to mouse over event
declaratively here so this dot source
equals false lashes for slash blue
button dot PNG and similarly
onmouseout actually onmouseout blue
button and onmouseover we want to
display green button okay so let's go
ahead and run this look at this
onmouseover green button and when we
move the mouse away it becomes blue
button so basically if you look at this
image button we've got five attributes
here ID run at image URL onmouseover and
onmouseout out of these five attributes
these three ID run at an image URL these
attributes respond to server-side
properties of the image button whereas
these two attributes onmouseover and
onmouseout they don't correspond to any
server-side properties
so in that case asp.net is going to
render those attributes as is to the
client browser and the client browser
knows these are client-side events and
there is some JavaScript associated with
them so when those respective events are
triggered the Associated JavaScript will
be executed by the client browser so in
this example here we are specifying the
JavaScript that we want to execute
declaratively in the HTML markup now
here the JavaScript is present in line
this JavaScript can also be present in
separate functions and we can call those
functions whenever these events are
triggered okay
so what I mean is we can also have maybe
a script section so script type equals
text slash JavaScript and then here
maybe we can have a function let's name
this change image on mouse-over and
within the function document or get
element by ID the ID of the image button
is image button 1 dot source equals
four slash images four slash green
button dot PNG similarly we can have
another function and let's name this
onmouseout and the name of the button is
blue button okay and onmouseover we want
to call this function and onmouseout we
want to call this function change image
onmouseout so let's go to and run this
one more time
actually reload this and then it should
behave exactly the same way in this case
we have the JavaScript and separate
functions and then we are calling those
functions when those events occur so in
both of these examples we are
associating the JavaScript with the
image button control declaratively we
can also do that programmatically so
let's see how to do that so this is the
example that we just discussed now let's
see how to add JavaScript
programmatically so let's get rid of
this script section let's get rid of
these two events so at the moment this
image button has got only the
server-side attributes ID run at image
URL so within the code behind page in
the page load event the ID of the image
button is image button 1 so image button
1 dot attributes dot add and if you look
at this advant that it has got two
parameters and both of them are of type
string the first parameter is K so using
this parameter we specify the name of
the client-side event to which we want
to associate JavaScript so the
client-side event is on mouse-over
and using the seventh second parameter
we specify the script that we want to
execute in response to onmouseover event
this dot source equals four slash four
slash green button dot P and J similarly
onmouseout blue button dot P and J so
let's go ahead and run this the behavior
again should be exactly same in this
case we are associating JavaScript our
programmatically in code now let's see
how to associate JavaScript to
client-side click event so if you look
at this image button when we click this
image button there are click to click
events one is the client-side click
event the others are the other one is
the server-side click event now when the
client-side click event occurs we want
to execute some JavaScript in response
to that client-side click event okay so
first of all let's go ahead and generate
this server-side click event handler so
let's double click this image button so
it generates the suicide click event
handler and then this one is associated
this server-side method is associated
with this image button using this on
click attribute so if you look at this
on click attribute this is associated to
a server-side event so you can't use
this to specify the JavaScript that you
want to execute in response to the
client-side click event so for example
if I say you know maybe I have a
function like this script you know
function let's call this alert maybe so
let's say we want to call this
javascript function and the client-side
click event occurs we can't use you know
something like that if we do it look at
what's going to happen that's
close this and when we run this look at
that we get a compiled Asian error and
basically the error says we're form one
does not contain a definition for alert
so basically what's happening is you
know it's looking for a function on the
server side with this name within the
code-behind file do we have any function
with that name alert we don't and that's
the reason why we get that error and the
reason it is looking for server side
method is because this is this attribute
is related to a corresponds to server
side click event okay that's why we
can't use this on click attribute to
associate JavaScript that we want to
execute in response to client-side click
event if you want to do that then you
will have to use another attribute which
is on client click and then you specify
the function that you want to execute
let's say we want to display a
confirmation dialog box when the user
clicks the image button we want to
display a confirmation box asking him
are you sure you want to submit the form
if he clicks ok then we want to allow
you know somebody's inform to the server
if he clicks cancel then we don't want
to submit the form to the server so I'm
going to use the confirm function return
confirm are you sure you want to submit
the form
okay so here we're using onclientclick
attribute to specify the JavaScript that
we want to execute in response to the
client-side click event and this
on-click attribute is used to associate
this server-side click event handler
function and the server-side click event
handler function is image button one
underscore click so let's go and specify
that here and when that button is
clicked let's display a message saying
serve a slide click event handle all
right so let's go ahead and run this now
so the page renders when we click this
look at that we get a message are you
sure you want to submit the form and
when I click cancel the page is not
submitted to the server once we click OK
the page will be submitted to the server
and notice that we get the message from
the server server side click even
handles okay so in this example we are
associating JavaScript that we want to
execute in response to the client-side
click event declaratively using on
client click attribute can't we do the
same thing programmatically we can but
when we do it programmatically don't use
on client click instead you will have to
use on click so let's actually copy this
so that we don't have to again type it
so at the moment if we run this so when
we run this now look at this when we
click the button now we don't have that
JavaScript you know function executed in
response to the client side click event
because we don't have any JavaScript
associated now let's also see it the
JavaScript code to the client side click
event programmatically image button 1
dot attributes dot add so here should I
use on client click or on click when you
space
defy it programmatically you will still
have to use on click if you use on
client click it will not work so on
click so the same JavaScript code so
let's run this one more time now when we
click the button we should get the
confirmation dialog box are you sure you
want to submit the form cancel the form
is not submitted click OK the form is
submitted server-side click event is
processed
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
