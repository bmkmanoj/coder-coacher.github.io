in this video will understand closures
in JavaScript with an example so what's
a closure a closure is an inner function
that has access to the outer functions
variables in addition to its own
variables and global variables the inner
function has access not only to the
outer functions variables but also to
the outer functions parameters you
create a closure by adding a function
inside another function so anytime you
have nested functions you have got a
closure there let's look at an example
let's create a function let's name it
add numbers and this function is going
to have two parameters first number and
second number and inside this function
let's create a variable let's name it
return value and let's initialize that
with the string result is and inside
this function I'm going to have another
function and let's name it add and this
function is going to return return value
variable by concatenating that with the
sum of first number and second number
now notice that we've got a function
inside another function so this is our
inner function and this is our outer
function remember in a function we'll
have access to the outer function
parameters and variables so in this
example add function will have access to
return value variable that is present in
this outer function and its parameters
first number and second number and then
the outer function is going to call the
inner function that is add so here we
have a very simple example for closure
now let's see how to invoke this add
numbers function so I'm going to create
a variable here let's call it result and
then let's call add numbers function and
this function expects two parameters
first number second number let's pass 10
and 20 as the values
and then whatever result we get let's
write that to the page so now when we
run this we expect result is 30 output
so what's happening here so when we call
add numbers function it executes you
know the code that's present in the
outer function so it's going to
initialize this return value variable
with this string and then it calls add
function and what is hand function doing
it's concatenating the string result is
with the sum of first and second number
okay
so that's why we get result is 30 as the
output now let's remove the set of
parentheses that we have here and see
what's going to happen let's run this
page and notice what we get we get the
inner function expression so here we
have the inner function add look at that
you know we get the entire in a function
definition okay that's because we
removed the parentheses so here the
outer function is going to execute this
line of code and then it's going to
return the inner function expression
okay and that is a sign now to result
variable let's actually change the name
of the variable to my funk so at the
moment this my funk is having the inner
function expression in addition to that
this inner function expression at the
moment will also have access to this
variable return value and it's two
parameters first number and second
number okay
now when we use parentheses here it's
going to execute the inner function
expression and at that point this inner
function will have access to return
value and first and second number
parameters and whatever result we get
back let's do that in result variable
and we are writing that to the page so
now when we run this we get the same
output result is 30 now we can you know
we know that this add number
function here is going to return the
inner function expression so in this
variable we actually have inner function
expression now if I include another pair
of parentheses here this will execute
the inner function expression that means
we will get the result straight away
here so we can do this as well so now
when we run this we get the same output
that is result is 30
now if closures are still confusing
don't worry in our next video we'll look
at another practical example and that
should make everything clear so here we
remove the pair of parentheses so it's
actually going to return the inner
function expression and we are storing
that in this add func variable and in
order to execute the inner function
expression we are using parentheses at
the end of that variable and here very
including this additional set of
parentheses next to add numbers function
which is going to execute the inner
function expression thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
