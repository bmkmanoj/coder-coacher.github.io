venket this is part 36 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll learn about
the wizard control in asp.net before
continuing with the session I strongly
recommend to watch part 35 of this video
series where we have discussed about the
multi view control wizard control
enables creation of multi-step user
interface wizard control provides with
built-in previous/next functionality so
what we want to do in this demo is that
we want to create a result control you
know where we want to capture his
personal details first and then when I
click the next button I need to capture
his contact details and when I click
next show the summary and then when we
click finish we want to save that to a
database and then show a confirmation
page if you remember in part 35 of this
video series we have achieved this exact
same thing using a multi view control
now the difference between a multi view
control and visit control is that the
multi view control is a collection of
multiple view controls whereas a visit
control is a collection of multiple
wizard steps as you can see here and
another difference is when we use multi
view control you know we have to provide
these buttons you know that we use to
move between multiple views you know go
to step two go to step one or go to step
three we have to provide these buttons
but whereas with visit control the visit
control is going to provide those
buttons for us they are inbuilt you know
within the wizard control based on the
step type the wizard Control identifies
when it has to show next when it has to
show previous and when it has to show
finish patterns will actually look at
that in a bit okay so if you haven't
watched part 35 of this video series yet
I would strongly encourage you to do so
before continuing with the session
because if we understand how to work
with a multi view control then it's
pretty straightforward to work with the
wizard control so in this example we are
going to first capture the personal
details and then his employee contact
details and then finally show the
confirmation and then when we click
finish save the data to a database and
show a confirmation page so a facade is
a collection of wizard steps and the
step type property of the Vizard
determines what button
you know to show whether it start button
next or previous or finish buttons
okay let's flip to visual studio let's
drag and drop a visit control onto the
webform so we know that F wizard is a
collection of these arts tabs okay now
if you look at what we want to achieve
we want to have three wizard steps
personal details and contact details and
finally the summary so let's have three
wizard steps so let's copy this and
paste it here so we have three wizard
steps and on the first step I want to
capture their personal details okay and
in the second step I want to capture
their contact details and finally on
step three I want to capture the summary
I mean we basically want to show the
summary to the end user so if we flip to
the design mode and we can see that
there okay so the steps are done and the
first step is basically to capture the
personal details now we know that wizard
step is going to provide these buttons
to navigate between these wizard steps
for us so we don't have to write
anything for that but to capture you
know the first name last name and gender
we need these text boxes and these text
within a table so we need this HTML for
that so I already have that typed here
just to save some time in typing so if
you look at this I have a very simple
HTML table here which has got three rows
and then within each TR I have two TDs
you know the first TD showing the text
first name and then a text box to
capture that similarly I have text last
name and a textbox to capture last name
and then gender gender is a drop down
list with two list items male and female
so let's copy this and paste this in the
first step of the wizard control okay so
I'm going to paste that there and then
if we flip to the design mode look at
that this is shown in the first wizard
step and the next visit step is
basically show their contact details and
obviously we are going to get these
buttons but then we need the HTML to
capture the email address and
mobile number two text box controls and
the text email address and mobile number
and these are going to be present inside
a table so I have a table with style in
a border one pixel solid black and then
two TRS with two TDs within the HDR TD
email address text and then text box to
capture the email address mobile number
and a text box to capture the mobile
number
so copy this and then paste this in the
second step of the wizard control so
let's flip to visual studio so that's
the first step of the wizard control
this is the step to contact detail so
let's expand that and paste that here
okay so that's step two and finally we
want to show this summary again we need
the HTML for that you know the label
controls and then the actual text your
first name last name etc and these two
headings here personal details and
contact details and we have that here
the HTML so there is another table let's
copy this by the way this all this HTML
code will be available on my blog for
you to copy and download it okay so
let's paste this in the third step of
the wizard control so that's it we are
done with the steps and the HTML that is
required within each step so if we run
this now as it stands so it should first
show us the wizard step one okay so I
enter my first name let's say Mike
Hancock and then maybe his gender is
male and when I click this next button
look at that it will automatically
navigate us to the next step if you
remember in part 35 of this video series
where we have we have discussed about
multi beyou control we have to write the
code for that explicitly but wizard
control knows what are these steps in
that Vizard in sequence and then it
navigates us to the correct step and now
I enter my email address here let's say
my cat Mike calm and maybe our phone
number 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and when I
click this next button it will take me
to the
summary page but then look at this it is
not showing or remembering those details
so obviously for this we have to write
code so when I navigate from step two to
step three then I have to pull the
details from the controls that I have
entered data you know from step one and
step two and populate that on this final
step in the label controls that we have
here okay so let's do that now so let's
go to the code behind page and if you
remember you know when I actually click
the next button that's when I have to do
that
so obviously this Wizard controller has
you know a an event next button click
which gets fired whenever you click the
next button
okay so double-click that to generate
the event handler and if you remember
you know we don't have to do anything on
the first step and I move from personal
details to contact details we don't
really have to do anything but then when
I move from contact details to summary
that's when we need to capture you know
the text that we have entered in these
controls and then show them within the
label controls here so if you look at
the step index you know here the step
index is zero because that's again zero
index based zero is this step this step
is the first step and this is the second
step so 0 1 2 so the step index when the
step index is 2 that's when we want to
write the code to retrieve data from
these textbox controls and populate this
label control so let's do that now
so if look at this visit
navigation eventargs so when you are
navigating across the bazaar you know
this object is going to give us the next
step index and the current step index so
if the next step index that we are going
to go is equal to 2 that means we are
going to go to the confirmation page
then what we want to do we want to
populate you know first name label with
the text that is present in txt first
name textbox so txt first name dot txt
and similarly LBL last name the text is
equal to
text from the last name text box and LBL
gender dot text the gender is coming
from the drop-down list
so drop-down list dot selected value and
we want the mobile number dot text is
equal to that's coming from txt mobile
number dot txt and finally LBL what else
we have the mobile number and email
address so LVL email dot txt is equal to
DX t email dot txt that's it ok so now
when we run this and we actually get to
that step you know it's going to
populate those label controls for us so
let's fill in the data so first name
let's say my last name Hancock male
click Next email address let's say Mike
at Mike calm and it's mobile number
click Next okay so it's filling in all
the details for this but a little odd
thing is I don't want this you know side
this you know side tab to be present
here I want the sidebar to be on the top
aligned always is there a way to
customize that absolutely let's see how
to do that I go to the desired control
and this is called the sidebar of the
wizard control we'll talk about all
those you know how to customize the
speed of wizard control in the next
session of this video series so go to
the properties and then there is a
property called style sidebar style
where you can actually configure all the
properties here so sidebar style here
and now all I want to do is the vertical
alignment I don't want that to be in the
center I want to be it on the top so
that it appears there okay and another
thing here when I click finish I want to
save this data to a database table and
go to the confirmation page but now when
I click that nothing is happening
basically okay so let's see what to do
when I click that finish button again
you know there isn't even that this
wizard control raises you know when you
click that finish button and it's called
finish button click event so finish
button click event double click that now
we will write the area dot net code to
save the data to a database table and
finally we'll navigate to the
confirmation page so first let's have
the confirmation page here so to the
project add a new item webform and let's
call this confirmation dot aspx click
add that to add the confirmation page
and then maybe here we'll have a big h1
saying data saved to the database okay
so we're not going to actually write the
code to save to the database table
that's a do dotnet code and we know how
to do that we have discussed about a do
dotnet in a do dotnet video series if
you haven't watched that I would
strongly encourage you to do so before
continuing with the session so response
dot write we want to navigate to that
page confirmation dot aspx that's all we
are done so now when we run this we'll
be you know able to navigate on the
finish button we will navigate to
confirmation page so let's name Mike and
cock mail click Next enter the email
address Mike at Mike calm enter his
phone number click Next look at that and
when I click finish I go to the ok
response dot what did we do there Oh
responds to at redirect not response dot
right so let's redirect the user so
obviously then get when we get to the
confirmation page we will be redirected
ok let's fill in some data there click
Next email address mobile number and I
click Next there it shows those details
when I click finish
data saved to the database we are on the
confirmation page and the interesting
thing is look at that the browser button
the browser is actually remembering the
history it's treating all these as
different pages but if you notice the
URL it's just one waveform so it's very
similar to how we have worked with multi
view control on this slide you can find
resources for asp.net c-sharp and sequel
server interview questions that's it for
today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
