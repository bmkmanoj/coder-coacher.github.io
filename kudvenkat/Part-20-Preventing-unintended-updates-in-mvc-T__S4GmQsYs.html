is part 20 of asp.net MVC tutorial in
this video we'll discuss preventing
unintended updates in MVC please watch
part 19 before proceeding with this
video if you remember in part 19 we have
made this name field a read-only field
and we also discussed how easy it was to
use tools like fiddler to create a post
request and then we have changed the
name property of the employee within
that post request and once we submitted
that post triquid
to the server using fiddler we were able
to very easily change the name of the
employee in spite of it being a
read-only field and that was happening
because of the way we implemented this
edit controller action method in this
video we'll discuss how to prevent these
type of unintended updates I am going to
make a few changes to this edit
controller action method the first
change that I am going to make is
instead of passing this employee object
as a parameter I'm going to pass the ID
of the employee that we are going to
edit okay and then the next change is I
am going to move this line from there to
here so we have this employee business
layer object and this object has got
employees property which is going to
list all the employees and out of that
list
I want that single employee whose ID
matches with the ID that we are passing
into this function okay so this is going
to return an employee object back the
employee that we are editing so I'm
going to store in a variable of type
employee and then I'm going to use this
update model function now we discussed
about update model and try update model
in the previous sessions in our MVC
video series okay so update model and
I'm going to pass employee object so
what is this function going to do it for
us it's going to inspect all the posted
form values and going to populate the
properties of the employee object
automatically using those posted form
values okay now
I am passing this employee object to
save employee method which is going to
save the state of the employee to the
database table and we are redirecting to
the index action but then even with this
code we will continue to have the same
problem why is that because if the
posted form contains you know data for
name property it is going to use that
and bind the employee object so in the
previous session we used fiddler to
generate that post request and then in
that request if I change the name of the
employee and then post it to the server
you know this default model binder will
automatically populate that change in
value with the name property of the
employee object and we are passing it to
the save employee method so it's going
to you know change the name of the
employee again so we will continue to
have that problem okay but then what we
can do here is there is another
overloaded version if you look at the
sub date model it has got several
overloaded versions look at that we have
ten overloaded versions I'm going to use
one of the overloaded versions where we
can specify explicitly the properties
that we want to include in model by Lee
okay so this employee object has got
several properties highly name gender
City date of birth out of these
properties you know I only want ID
gender city and date of birth to be
binded to be model binded meaning
whatever you know whatever the user
posts using that form we don't really
care we are only interested in ID gender
city and date of birth properties we
don't want name to be included in model
binding okay and look at that it's a
string array so I'm going to specify
that here the properties that I want to
include in modal binding so this is the
overloaded version we are using since
it's a string array I'm going to create
a new string array and then I am simply
going to specify my properties here and
just to speed things up I have this
properties already type its a comma
separated less it's a string array so ID
gender city and date of birth
okay now even if you're posted form
contains a value for the name property
it will not be included in model binding
meaning that value from the posted form
will not be used to update the name of
property of the employee object since we
are loading this employee object from
the database it continued to have that
old value and then only ID gender City
and date of birth will be updated from
the posted form values and will be a you
know we pass that employee object to
save employee and that gets saved let's
run this and see if it works in the
first place okay and another thing to
keep in mind look at this I have an
error here it says that you know you
have there is already a member called
edit with same parameter types now if
you look at our employee controller
there are two controller action methods
with the same name you know this edit
controller action method since it's
decorated with HTTP GET it's going to
respond to the get request whereas this
one is going to respond to the post
request but then if these methods have
the same name and same number and type
of parameters you know we will have that
compliation error to fix that I'm going
to change the name of this method to
edit underscore post but then the moment
we do that you know we will not be able
to respond to the post request on this
URL okay so to make this controller
action method to respond to the post
request of that URL I am going to
decorate this with actual name attribute
and specify the action name as edit with
that change let's go ahead and run this
and see if the update works as expected
so I'm going to navigate to employee and
index action
let's click Edit let's change the gender
of this XYZ employee to female let's
save that so it works as expected
now let's fire a fiddler
okay so it's asking me there's a new
version there for now I'm going to click
on no let's select all this Rick let's
delete them let's go back to our server
I mean click Edit and then let's click
on save so that a post request will be
generated so this is the post request
and then I'm going to go on to the
composer tab drag and drop this post
request onto the composer tab so here we
have that post request now look at that
name is XYZ let me change name to ABC
from XYZ and I'm going to change gender
from female to male city from London to
Chennai okay so we've changed name flama
XYZ to ABC gender from female to male
city from London to Chennai now let's go
ahead and execute this query now before
that let's actually check the data of
that employee so XYZ female London let
me click this execute button okay so
that got executed let's go back to the
database execute that look at that the
name of the employee has not changed but
I was able to change the gender and
Chennai
so even using tools like fiddler I
wasn't able to change the read-only
field and why is that because we have
explicitly specified what properties we
want to include in model binding okay
and this list is also called as
whitelist or a blacklist this is a very
common interview question as well you
know they can ask you how do you prevent
you know properties from being binded
automatically you can use include and
exclude list this is an example of
include list it is also possible to
exclude you know in this employee object
we have got total five parameters ID
name gender City and date of birth out
of them
I want to exclude just name property
okay so if you want to specify and
exclude list
you can do that as well instead of using
include list and if you want to specify
and exclude list I can use this version
update model look at that which is going
to take the model object and then there
is another parameter called prefix
include their properties and exclude
properties let's actually do the
practically let's flip to visual studio
so here we are using the include list
instead of that I'm going to use another
overloaded version look at that there is
another overloaded version where we can
specify look at this version Here I am
passing the employee object in the next
parameter is a string parameter of type
you know a prefix parameter the next one
is include properties I am going to pass
null for these two parameters and
finally we can specify exclude
properties so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to specify a null there and
null there and you know obviously I'm
going to use this overloaded version you
know this list now is going to access
act as an exclude list and instead of
specifying ID gender City date of birth
I am going to specify I want to exclude
name property from modal binding so it's
going to include all the other
properties except name property so with
this change it should still continue to
work in the same way as it did before
all right
on this slide you can find resources for
asp.net c-sharp and sequence of
interview questions that's it for today
thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
