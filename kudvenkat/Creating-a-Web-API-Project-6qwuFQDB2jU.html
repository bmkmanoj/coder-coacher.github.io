tutorial in this video we'll discuss
creating a new asp.net web api project
explore and understand the web api code
auto-generated by visual studio for this
course we'll be using Visual Studio 2015
so let's flip to visual studio here I
have Visual Studio 2015
Enterprise Edition running as an
administrator to create a new asp.net
Web API project click on file new
project and within the new project
dialog box
let's select visual C shaft which is
present under installed and under
templates and then from the middle pane
select asp.net web application we are
going to create this within the C Drive
and let's name this Web API demo let's
click OK on the subsequent screen we
have the option to select the type of
web application that we want to create
do you want to create an empty web
application web forms M easy Web API etc
we want to create an asp.net Web API
project so I'm going to select Web API
and we don't want to host this in the
cloud so let's keep this checkbox
unchecked and click OK
so this is going to take a few seconds
to create the asp.net Web API project
for us I am able to create the web API
project successfully but just in case if
you run into these two errors when
creating the web API project that is
package installation error or fail to
initialize the PowerShell host then here
are the steps to resolve those errors
and successfully create a Web API
project the first step is to close all
instances of Visual Studio that are
running on your machine the second step
is to launch Windows PowerShell so to
launch windows powershell click on start
and then select all apps and then scroll
all the way down to W and here you
should find windows powershell folder
and within that we have windows
powershell so right-click on that and
select run as administrator from the
context menu if you get a secure
ready prompt click yes and they should
launch Windows PowerShell here you may
get another security prompt now one of
the choices there is to plus R which
stands for run ones if you do get that
security prompt press R and hit enter I
don't have that security prompt so I
don't have to do that and once you have
pressed R and hit enter so at this
prompt right here we have to execute a
command and that is set execution policy
and we want to set this to all signed
and hit enter when the command is
successfully execute the third step is
to relaunch Visual Studio as an
administrator and then we want to launch
the package manager console window to do
that click on tools and then NuGet
package manager and here one of the
choices our package manager console
select that and this should open up the
package manager console window here you
may get another security prompt and one
of the choices is to plus R which stands
for run once and if you do get that
security prompt plus R and hit enter and
then attempt to create the asp.net Web
API project using the same steps that we
have just discussed and you should be
able to create the Web API project just
in case if you get other errors and if
they are preventing you from creating
the web API project leave those errors
as comments on this video if anyone has
got similar errors and if they have
resolved them they may reply to you so
here we have the Web API project created
successfully now let's explore and
understand the Web API code that is
auto-generated by visual studio if you
have worked with asp.net MVC in the past
then this folder structure should be
very familiar to you notice we have got
folders for models views and controllers
within the controllers folder we've got
both MVC controllers and Web API
controllers Web API controllers are
different from MVC controllers the
values controller is an asp.net Web API
controller notice the values control up
inherits from API controller class which
is present in system dot web dot h t DB
namespace the home controller that is
present right here this is an MVC
controller and notice the home
controller class inherits from a
different page class which is controller
class and this class is present in
system dot web dot MVC namespace notice
in the values controller class we have
get post put and delete methods these
methods respond to get put post and
delete HTTP verbs notice we have got two
overloaded versions of the get method
one without any parameters and the other
one which take the ID parameter both of
these methods respond to the get HTTP
verb depending on whether a value for
the ID parameter is specified in the URI
or not now let's look at the default
route that's in place for a web api
project within our global dot a si X
file we have application start even
handler method this event is raised when
the application starts notice here we
have lot of configuration with
configuration for filters bundles etc
the one that we are interested in is the
configuration for our web api and the
configuration for web api is present in
register method of the web api convict
class so i'm going to right click on
this register method and then select go
to definition from the context menu
which is going to take us to the
register method in the web api convict
class this class is present in app
underscore start folder so notice here
we have the Web API config dot CS file
which contains over Web API convict
class and the register method and within
this register method we have the default
route configured for our web api web api
routes are different from MVC routes m
easy routes are present in this file
route config dot CS now if you look at
the default route that's in place for
web api it starts with the word api and
then we have got a forward slash and
then the name of the controller and then
another forward slash and
the optional ID parameter at this point
let's run our project by pressing ctrl
f5 which is going to take us to the
default Start page now look at the
default web api out it starts with the
word api so within our URL right here
localhost colon a port number and then
for slash and then this word api and
then another forward slash and then the
name of our controller what is the name
of our controller it is values
controller we don't have to specify the
full name of the controller it's enough
if we just specify values so when we do
that web api is going to take this word
values and then append to that this word
controller and then web api is going to
look for a class with name values
controller the browser right here is
issuing a get request and this get
request gets mapped to the get method
within the values controller now with no
values controller we have two overloaded
versions of get method so which get
method is going to respond to this URI
now notice within the URI we don't have
a value for the ID parameter so
naturally this overload version of the
get method which doesn't have a
parameter is going to respond to the
request so let's hit enter and see what
we get notice we get a security error
authorization has been denied for this
request this is because of this
authorized attribute right here which is
naturally related to security we'll
discuss this in detail in a later video
to keep things simple for now let's keep
it commented build of a solution and
once the build completes successfully
let's reissue the request now at the
moment you know look at the URI right
here it's API four slash values so Web
API is going to look for values
controller if you specify products here
then it's going to look for products
controller and if you look at the
complete URI right here it's localhost
colum a port number in a real world
application it might be your domain in
for example
it could be HTTP : four slash four slash
presume tech comm four slash API four
slash values so at this point our build
should have been succeeded let's reissue
this request and if you look at what is
this get method doing here it is
returning to strings value 1 and value 2
so when this request results
successfully we should get those two
values in the browser so it's taking a
few seconds since we have rebuilt our
solution so as soon as the request
completes successfully notice we have
got value 1 and value 2 as expected we
have another overloaded version of the
get method that takes ID parameter if
you remember with the default web api
route that is in place the ID parameter
is optional notice the defaults here ID
parameter is optional and that's the
reason we are able to call the get
method without a value for the ID
parameter in the URI now if we specify a
value for the ID parameter in the URI
then this overloaded version of the get
method that has the ID parameter will be
called and if you look at what this
method is doing its simply returning the
string value no matter whether you
specify the value for the ID parameter
s1 or 1000 we are simply going to get
the string value so let's issue this
request and see what we get notice we
get the string value as expected what do
you think is going to happen if the
controller that we have specified is not
found the controller that we have
specified here is values so Web API is
going to look for values controller and
then since we are issuing a get request
here the get method is going to respond
to this request now let's see what's
going to happen if we comment that the
values controller so I'm going to
comment this class completely let's see
what changes build our solution as you
can see in the status bar here the build
completed successfully
so let's reissue the request and see
what we get look at the error message
that we have got it's very meaningful no
HTTP resource was found that matches the
request URI for slash API
four slash values 4/1 no type was found
that matches the controller named values
so basically it's saying it can't find
values controller that we have specified
in the URI right here which is we're
remaining four in this video we've just
seen how to perform the get request in
our next video we'll discuss how to
perform the rest of the actions that is
put post and delete thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
