am venket this is part 53 of asp.net
video series in this session we'll
discuss about server dot transfer and
the difference between server dot
transfer and response dot redirect
before continuing with this session I
strongly recommend to watch parts 51 and
52 of this video series the following of
the different page navigation techniques
that are available in asp.net we
discussed about the hyperlink control in
parts 13 and 51 of this video series and
response dot redirect in part 52 in this
session we'll discuss about server
transfer let's look at a simple example
of using server transfer here I have a
very simple asp.net web application
project which has got two web forms web
form 1 and web form - and if you look at
the web form phone it's got a very
simple design here there is an h1 tag
which shows you know the heading s this
is web form 1 and then I have two text
boxes where the user can type in their
name and email and then 2 button
controls and in the code behind at the
moment we don't have any code the idea
is that when I click this button
transfer to web form - you know the user
should be navigated to web form - and if
you look at web form to look at this on
this web form we are asking the user to
enter the name and email and on web form
- we are trying to retrieve that name
and email you know which the user has
entered on web form 1 and display them
in these label controls here and then
here here we have an h1 saying that this
is web form - let's see how to achieve
that using server dot transfer technique
so obviously when I click this button I
want to move the user to web form 2 dot
aspx and obviously to do that we can
either use hyperlink control or response
to or redirect and we have seen how to
do you know how to navigate users to
different web pages using those
techniques in the previous sessions of
this video series in this session we'll
see how to use the server door transfer
the server object has called the
transfer method and if you look at the
transfer method you know this method is
expecting a string parameter and this
parameter is the path of the page where
you want to navigate the user
in this case we want to navigate the
user to web form to dot aspx so double
quote till that which indicates the
current of web application root
directory forward slash web form to dot
aspx that's where I want to navigate the
user ok now let me run this all we are
doing is we are navigating the user to
waveform to dot aspx when we click that
pattern okay so as the page loads notice
the URL we are on web form one dot aspx
now I am clicking on this transfer to
web form to button look at that I am one
waveform - and look at the URL it still
says web form one dot aspx but at the
moment we are on web form - so the
redirection is happening without the
user knowing that he is on a different
web form ok now what we want to also do
here is along with transferring the user
we also want to move these values now
there are several ways to retrieve these
values on the destination page ok so how
do we retrieve those values on the
destination page so which is web form -
dot aspx so when the page loads whatever
data that I type into these two textbox
controls should be retrieved on this Web
form 2 dot aspx how do I do that now
when the web form loads this waveform -
when this loads on the web server memory
you can actually use the request objects
on the request object there is a
property called a form and if you look
at this form look at the help text here
it says gets a collection of form
variables so when this page is getting
loaded you can use this requested form
object to get deform variables of the
previous web form
okay so request dot form and if you look
at what is this property returning look
at the intelligence it returns system
dot collections dot specialized dot name
value collection so it's going to return
us back a name value collection pair
that's present in system dot collection
but specialized the name space so let's
use a variable of that type to hold the
return value so system
action start specialized dot name value
collection so let's call this as
collection or to give it a meaningful
name I'm going to call this previous
form collection okay now we know that in
the previous form we have a control with
ID if you look at the idea of this
textbox control the idea of this one is
txt name and similarly if you look at
the ID of the next textbox control
it's txt email so what we can basically
do is to retrieve the text that the user
has typed into these two text boxes we
can actually refer to that text boxes in
this name value collection pair so this
is this object is a name value
collection pair so now if I open a
square bracket there are two ways of
accessing that you can either use an
integral into Excel but that's not
readable so I'm going to use the name of
the control here the name of the control
is if you notice it's txt name is the
name of is the ID of the textbox so we
are going to use that so txt name that's
it so now if you look at what this is
going to return this is going to return
a string back which is nothing but the
value that is present in that control
and all I want to do is said that as the
text for labor so we have a label on
this page label name dot text is equal
to whatever is returned from this
control and similarly I want to retrieve
whatever is present in the email text
box and set that as the text for label
email and where are these labels control
present these label controls are present
on this waveform so if you look at these
these are the IDS label name and label
email okay that's it now let's go ahead
and run this so obviously the waveform
loads and notes the URL we are on
webform 1 dot aspx now the user can
actually type something into the text
boxes and then when he clicks the
button transfer to webform - we will be
let's call the name as presume and email
let's say presume at presume techcom now
when I click this transfer to waveform
to look at the URL it's currently
webform one dot aspx I click transfer to
webform to dot aspx I am still on the
same URL the URL doesn't change in the
browser but I am on webform - and look
at the values we are able to retrieve
them prism and presume at pledging
techcom now so when we use server door
transfer technique it's possible to
retain the values the posted form values
okay and now if you look at the way we
are redirecting the user we are using
the server door transfer method so from
webform one to transfer the user to
perform - we are using server door
transfer now this method has got another
boolean property preserve form and by
default this is true if we don't specify
it it's going to preserve the form
variables but if I said that to false
look at what's going to happen all I
have done is I have used another
overloaded version of this transfer
method and then passing false to this
second parameter okay so let's run this
now and when the form loads when we
enter some data into the wave form and
then click that button transfer to web
form - you know it's not going to
preserve this value so I'm going to
enter test and test in a name and email
click on that look at that
I don't retrieve I'm not able to
retrieve them and that's because you
know you have said don't preserve the
form values okay now we have seen one
way of retrieving the values using you
know requested form property okay now
there's another way since we are using
server dot transfer technique another
way to actually retrieve you know the
previous form values is by using the
previous page property now this is a web
form and if you look at this web form
this web form is inheriting from the
page class so this page class has got it
has got a property called previous page
property and we can use that previous
page property to retrieve the values
that the user
type into this text boxes let's see how
to do that
so obviously the page class has got a
previous page property so if you look at
this property what is this property
returning back it's returning a page
object back so I'm going to say page
let's call this previous page is equal
to page tour previous page okay now if
previous page not equal to null so we
are saying if previous page not equal to
null then what we want to do on the
previous page find the control so we can
use this find control method on the
previous page so if I am coming on the
waveform - and if I am coming from
webform Vaughn aspx - webform - then the
previous page for webform - is webform
one and on webform one we want to find a
control you know with ID txt name and
txt email and how do we do that we use
the find control method and if you look
at the find control method it X it is
expecting the ID of the control that we
want to find in this case we want to
find txt name textbox and we know that
this find control method is going to
return a control back but we know we
will get a textbox back so I'm going to
typecast that to be of type text box and
then we can actually retrieve the after
we typecast it to text box we can
actually retrieve the text property from
that and set that as the text property
for the label control that's it and
along the same lines we can retrieve txt
email control and that's also a text box
but in this case I want to set the text
of the email okay so now we run this so
we are using the previous page property
you know basically to retrieve the
values of the controls on the previous
page so we are currently okay let's
navigate to webform one let's run that
and when the page loads let's say test
is the name and test is the email
transfer to webform to look at that I am
able to retrieve the values and an
interesting thing to note here is that
even though you pass false to preserve
form parameter of server the transfer
method you know we are still able to
retain those values because we are using
the previous page property okay now this
previous page property is initialized
only if you come by a server door
transfer method or when you do a cross
page post back we'll be talking about
cross page post back in a later video
session but if you land on this page
using response to at redirect then this
previous page property will be null and
you wouldn't be able to retrieve you
know values from the textbox and I mean
from from these text boxes okay so let's
see if that's the case so let me insert
a row below and then let's put a button
control here
and when I click this button let's say I
want to redirect the user instead of
server door transfer I can do this
response dot redirect and I can redirect
the user to web form to dot aspx so
let's copy and paste that there okay
let's run that actually let's put a
breakpoint so that we know you know the
previous page property is actually not
so what we are going to do now right now
is when we click that button when we
land on this page we are trying to
retrieve the previous page property and
store that in this previous page
variable now since we are landing on
this page by clicking this part and look
at that when I click this button you
know we are redirecting the user using
response toward redirect technique okay
so let's put a breakpoint on the form to
dot aspx dot CS I'm going to click this
button and we are using response to at
redirect tool and on web form to let me
press f10 look at the previous page
property it's actually now okay so we
are not able to retrieve the form values
that's why it will basically be empty
okay but if you remember we haven't
typed anything let's type just to make
sure
I click the button I land on this page I
press f5 and look at the name and email
they're still empty we don't get those
form values back okay so that's server
door transfer so the important things to
keep in mind you know these this is a
very common interview question what is
the difference between silver door
transfer and response torte redirect
just like hyperlink control and response
to a tree direct method server door
transfer is used to navigate to other
pages or sites running on the same web
server server or transfer cannot be used
to navigate to sites or pages on a
different web server what happens if you
try to do that you will get a runtime
error okay using hyperlink and response
dot redirect we can redirect the user to
any site or any page whether if they are
present on the same web server or on a
different web server but when we use the
word or transfer we can only redirect
the users you know to pages or sites
running on the same web server now let's
say I have a button here on this
platform one transfer to external web
site let's double click that so that the
human handler is generated and let's use
server dot transform method to transfer
the user to presume techcom so HTTP
colon for slash presume techcom and I
want to go to for slash home dot aspx
page so presume techcom is definitely
not hosted on my web server on my laptop
so it has to go to a different web
server so obviously this is going to
throw a runtime exception let's see if
that's what happens so when the page
loads I'm clicking this button transfer
to external website look at that I get
an error so server transfer cannot be
used to navigate to sites or pages on a
different web server and server door
transfer does not change the URL in the
address bar and we have just seen that
and server dot transfer is faster than
response dot redirect as the redirection
happens on the server in ingest one
request and response cycle we are spoken
about response to at redirect in the
previous session so if it's a response
dot redirect look at that
makes a request to the web server you
know when I click the button in the
button click event we have response
toward redirect so the webpage postback
request will be received at the web
server and then the web server will just
send a response header back and then the
client will then initiate a new get
request for the new page so there are
two requests and then the web server
sends the response for they in a
redirected page
so obviously this one start redirect the
redirection is happening in to request
response cycles whereas in server
transfer you know you click the button
the page pulls back the redirection from
the transfer rather from webform 1 to
webform two happens on this server
immediately and the new page response is
sent back to the client that's why if
you notice the URL doesn't change
because the redirection happens on the
web server but whereas in the case of
response to redirect the redirection is
happening on the client the client will
issue a new get request after the
postback request so if you use response
to or redirect you have an extra round
trip involved to the client whereas when
you do a server door transfer you don't
have that extra round trip
that's why server door transfer is
slightly faster than response toward
redirect so servidor transfer is faster
than response toward redirect as the
redirection happens on the server in one
request response cycle whereas response
door redirect involves to request
response cycles but server door transfer
the form values from the original
request are preserved and we have just
seen that but if you use response to or
redirect you know the form values the
original request form values are not
preserved so these are some of the
differences between server door transfer
and response to redirect on this slide
