in this video we'll discuss creating
registering and using a service in
angular whether you are using angular 2
angular 4 or angular 5 the steps to
create register and user service are the
same we discuss the basics of angular
services and why we need services in
detail in parts 25 27 and 34 of our
angular 2 tutorial course so if you're
new to angular services
I suggest please check out these videos
this is the same project that we've been
working with so far in this video series
now when we navigate to the list route
we see the list of employees this
employees data at the moment is
hard-coded within our list employees
component here we have the array of
employees now we want to offload this
responsibility to an angular service so
let's go ahead and create a service we
are going to place our service in its
own file so I'm going to add that file
to the employees folder let's name the
file employee dot service dot t as a
service in angular is nothing but a
class so I'm going to create a class and
name this class employee service now
when we create a component in angular we
decorate the class with add component
decorator
similarly when we create a directive we
decorate the corresponding class with at
directive decorator along the same lines
when we create a service we decorate the
service class with add injectable
decorator we don't have this injectable
imported yet so let's go ahead and
include the required import statement to
import it this injectable decorator is
only required if our employee service
has an injected dependency in our
upcoming videos in the series we are
going to inject angular's HTTP service
into this employee service to issue a
call to a remote web
service to retrieve employees data so at
that point this injectable decorator is
definitely required at the moment we
don't have any injected dependency so we
may remove this injectable decorator and
our service still works exactly the same
way
however angular team recommends to
always use this at injectable decorator
irrespective of whether your service has
an injected dependency or not to ensure
consistency and future proof that's the
reason we have included this at
injectable decorator now I'm going to
create a private field and I'm going to
name it list employees we're going to
use this private field to hold our list
of employees the type for this is going
to be employee array this employee type
is present in this file employee dot
model dot TS
so let's include the required import
statement to import our employee type at
the moment the employees list is
hard-coded with an list employees
component so let's cut the employees
from here and then paste them within our
employee service so of a list of
employees are present in this private
field list employees now let's include a
method within our service I'm going to
name it get employees and this method is
going to return an array of employee
objects and all this method is going to
do is return the private list which has
the list of employees at the moment we
have our list of employees hard-coded
within our employee service in a later
video we'll discuss how to retrieve this
employee list from a database table so
we have just completed creating our
employee service now for us to be able
to use this service we have to register
it first we can register service in
angular either at a component level or
at a module level when we register a
service at a component level then that
service is available only to that
component and it's children
when we reached a service at a module
level it's available to all the
components within our application in our
case we want this employee service to be
available within many components like
list create update
they lead etc so let's go ahead and
register our employee service in a
module at the moment within our project
we only have one module that is a root
module let's register our employee
service within our root module of a root
module file is AB dot module dot TS
let's include the required import
statement to import the employee service
and we also need to make it part of the
providers array now all that is left to
do is use this employee service within
our list employees component so let's
first import our employee service and
then use the class constructor to inject
our employee service I'm going to create
a private field I'm going to call it
underscore employee service and the type
of Thurs is employee service so when an
instance of this lists employees
component is created angela is
automatically going to inject an
instance of employee service into this
component and we can access that service
instance using our private field
underscore employee service so let's
call our service within our ng on in it
lifecycle hub if you are new to
lifecycle hooks please check out our
angular 2 course now on the service
instance we are calling get employees
method we know this method returns an
array of employee objects let's assign
that employees array as the value for
this employees probably that we have
right here let's save all our changes
notice on our list page we still see the
same set of three employees at the
moment of our application is retrieving
these employees from our employee
service so a service in angular is at
loss irrespective of whether a service
has an injected dependency or not always
degree the analyst service class with
ADD
double decorator for consistency and
future-proof if a service is registered
at a component level then that service
is available only to that component and
to its children on the other hand if a
service is registered at a module level
then that service is available to all
the components in the application to use
a service in a component inject the
service into that component using the
class constructor thank you for watching
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
