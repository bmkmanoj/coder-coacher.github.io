video we'll discuss the difference
between group join and NI join let's
understand the differences with an
example let's flip to visual studio
here I have a new console application to
which I have already added department
and employee classes these are the same
classes that we worked with in the
previous session notice that here we
have got three departments ID HR and xx
we also have got five employees out of
which three of them belong to Department
ID one and two of them belong to
Department ID two which means with 90
Department we have three employees and
within HR we have two employees in
department xx at the moment we don't
have any employees let's perform a group
join between these two collections to do
that we would write a link very that
would look like this in this video we
are not going to go into the specifics
of group join we discussed group join in
detail in part 21 of this video series
here we are going to primarily focus on
the differences between group join and
inner join and inner join query would
look like this notice the primary
difference between these two queries is
the usage of this into keyword along
with the join operator we don't have
that into keyword within the inner join
link very here so when this group join
query is executed against this
department and employee data it's going
to produce hierarchical result set so
the employees are going to be grouped by
department so this group join linked
very is going to produce a data
structure that would look like this
notice here the employees are grouped by
department here we have the IT
department and all the employees
belonging to that department similarly
we have the HR department and employees
belonging to the HR department within
department xx we don't have any
employees so it will be an empty list of
employees there now since this result
set is an hierarchical result set in
order to retrieve department and all the
employees belonging to a specific
department then we would have to use at
least two for each loops the first for
each look is going to look through each
department within the result set and the
second for each loop is going to loop
each employee within that given
department so I have this exact same
code already typed within the main
method
so here is that group join query notice
the usage of this into keyword along
with the join operator and to retrieve
department employees we are using two
for each loops so when we run this as
you might expect departments and
employees names will be printed notice
that within the output we also have this
department xx in spite of it not having
a matching element with an employee's
collection so we can see that this group
join is similar to an outer join in
sequel
what would in order join in sequel do
even though there are non matching
records even that will be retrieved you
know with an outer join similarly a
group join you know in spite of it you
know not having any matching element
that element is still retrieved so
that's group join now let's look at
inner join so here we have the inner
join query notice that we are not using
the into key were there so this inner
join query is going to produce a flat
result set so this result set here it's
not a hierarchical result set it's a
flat result set there is a one-to-one
mapping between department and employee
objects and another important thing to
notice here is that there is no row for
department xx so this join query is
similar to an inner join and sequel so
inner join is going to produce only
matching elements between the
collections involved in the join non
matching elements will be excluded from
the result set now since this is a flat
result set it's enough if we use just
one for each loop to retrieve both the
department and employee names as you can
see here again I have already typed this
code so let's copy it and paste it
within our main method so when we run
this as you might expect you know
employee name and department names will
be printed and since department xx
doesn't have any employees within it you
know that will be excluded from the
result set now if we have to perform
group join using extension method then
we use this group join extension
and to implement inner join we use the
join extension method so in short join
is similar to inner join and seeker and
group join is similar to outer join in
seek well that's it for today thank you
for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
