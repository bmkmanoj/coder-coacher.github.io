tutorial in this video well discuss the
significance of the angular CLI
configuration file dot angular - CLI dot
Jason this is the configuration file
that the angular CLI uses notice within
the project folder we have a file with
that name dot angular - CLI dot JSON as
you can see this file has several
settings in it the settings from this
file are used when we generate angular
features like components pipe services
etc when we run unit and end-to-end test
when we build the application etc we'll
be revisiting this file many times
as we progress through this angular CLI
course name property specifies the name
of our angular project which in our case
is AB for root property specifies the
root directory of our application by
default it is SRC
but is here we have a folder SRC and all
the project files are present within
this folder we can change this default
name to anything we want
by using source - dir option in
generating a new angular project using
the engine new command out dir
this probably specifies the output
directory for build results by default
it is named test assets this property
specifies the assets of our application
to copy over when building your project
by default whatever we have in the
assets folder and this favicon dot ICO
or copied over index this property
specifies the main HTML page of our
application which is index dot HTML main
this property specifies the name of the
main entry point file which is main dot
TS this file contains the code to
bootstrap our root application module
app module polyfills this property
specifies the name of the polyfills file
and let us build on the latest standards
of the web platform targeting such a
wide range of browsers is challenging
because not all browsers support all
features of the modern
browsers this can be compensated by
using polyfill scripts that implement
missing features in JavaScript test this
property points to this file test dot es
which is right here and it's the main
entry point for unit tests and it loads
all the dots back and framework files ts
config this property points to this file
this config dot r dot jason and that
file is right here and it contains the
typescript compiler configuration for
our angular application and we have a
similar file here at es config dot spec
dot jason and test config property
points to that as you might have guessed
already this file this config dot
Specter jason contains the typescript
compiler configuration for unit test
whereas this one contains the compiler
configuration for our angular
application prefix we'll discuss this
property in just a bit but before that
let's discuss the stylus property this
property specifies the global styles for
our application which by default is
style start CSS instead we can also use
less or sass now if we want to change it
to less or sass we can use this style
option when generating a new angular
project using the ng new command let's
look at this in action now we want to
generate a new angular project so I'm
going to use ng new and then the name of
our angular project I'm going to name it
app 5 by default this project is going
to make use of CSS if you want to change
these styles to less or sass we can do
that by using the style option if you
want to use less you specify less like
that if you want to use sass you specify
sass like that now when I press enter is
going to generate a new angular project
and install all the required NPM
packages there we go project created
successfully now let's change the folder
to app 5 and then open our project using
visual studio code now if you look at
the Styles property within the angular
CLI configuration file notice it is set
to sass instead of the default CSS
and if you look at the root component
within the source folder notice again
this root component is using SAS as the
style because the setting is stored
inside the anglers Eli configuration
file when we generate a new component
it's going to use SAS as the style for
that newly generated component let's
look at this in action let's clear the
screen first to generate a new component
using angular CLI we use this command ng
generate component and then the name of
the component I named our component ABC
we can use this command or its shortcut
ng G for generate C for component and
the name of whole component ABC when I
press Enter key now it's going to
generate a new component with name ABC
and place this component inside its own
folder notice it also has updated this
root module file with our newly
generated component and if you look at
this component it is using SAS as this
tile instead of the default CSS so every
time we generate a new component it's
going to use SAS as the style if you
want to use CSS instead then you can do
so by using this style option along with
this ng generate command let's look at
that in action so ng generate component
and let's generate a component with name
XYZ and I don't want to use SAS as this
tile for this new component instead I
want to use CSS so I can use the style
option with this ng generate command and
specify I want to use CSS now when I
press ENTER it's going to create a new
component with name XYZ which it's going
to place inside its own folder and if
you look at the style this component
uses using it is CSS instead of SAS
prefix this property specifies the
selector prefix to apply for the
generator components look at this
property value it is app and if you look
at the components that we have generated
so far look at the root component type
script file right here and if you look
at this selector of this root component
look at the selector prefix app and
again if you look at this ABC component
that we have generated
again the selector for that has a prefix
app same is the case with this X Y Zed
component notice the selector prefix
here again his app we can change this
using the prefix option when generating
a new angular project using the ng new
command let's look at that in action
clear the screen first go back to C
Drive and let's generate another new
project let's name this app sex and with
this project we don't want to use that
default selector prefix app so I want to
change that to something else so I'm
going to use dash dash prefix option and
the value that we want to use as the
selector prefix let's say I want to use
plug team as they select a prefix of we
specify that value and when we press the
Enter key is going to generate our new
angular project there we go
the project is successfully created now
let's change the directory to app 6 and
then open our project using visual
studio code now if we look at the prefix
property value within the angular Z like
configuration file notice it is presume
and if we look at the root component
that is generated which is inside this
app folder here's the root component
type script file look at this selector
prefix it is presume as expected now
every time we generate a new component
it's going to use the prefix property
value that is present within our angular
CLI configuration file pragya let's look
at this in action clear the screen first
and let's generate a new component ng
generate component and let's name or
component ABC now the selector prefix
for this newly generated component ABC e
should be pragya let's confirm this so
within our source folder inside the app
folder we should see this ABC folder if
you don't find this folder click this
refresh icon right here and the folder
should show up and if you look at the
component class notice the selector
prefix it is presume as expected and if
you look at our angular CLI
configuration file we know this property
prefix has frozen so every time we
generate a new component it's going to
read this
like configuration file and use this
Pragya as the selector prefix now if you
want to override that you can do so by
using that dash dash prefix option along
with the ng generate command let's look
at that in action
ng G C and let's name our component XYZ
with this component we want to use a
different prefix so I'm going to use
dash dash prefix option and then let's
say we want to use tag as the prefix now
when we press ENTER it's going to create
a new component and for this newly
created component the selector prefix is
going to be attacked let's confirm this
expand the source folder and then within
the app folder we have our X Y Zed
folder and if we look at the component
class notice the selector prefixes tag
instead of Pragya so we are able to
override the value that we have within
this prefix property by using dash dash
prefix option again with ng generate
command there are several other settings
in this file
well discuss what those settings are and
their purpose in our upcoming videos as
we progressed through this course so the
settings from the angular CLI
configuration file are used when we
generate angular features like
components pipe services etc run unit
and end-to-end test build the
application etc the important point to
take away is that the values in the
angular CLI configuration file depends
on the options that we have used with
the ng new command when generating a new
angular project for example if you do
not use the dash dash prefix option with
the ng new command then the default
value app is stored in the configuration
file for that prefix property this means
every time we generate a new component
it's going to use that prefix property
value as the selector prefix for that
newly generated component for some
reason for a newly generated component
if we want to use a different selector
prefix then the one that we have in the
configuration file then we can do so by
use
- - prefix option with the ng generate
command so this leads us to another
important conclusion some of the options
like - - prefix can be used with several
commands like ng new and ng generate we
have just seen that in action thank you
for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
