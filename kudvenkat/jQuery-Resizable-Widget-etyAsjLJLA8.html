this video well discuss jQuery resizable
reacheth let's understand this with an
example
here we've got a development this
development along with this stylus
applied will be rendered like this we
also have one line of jQuery code here
so basically we are finding the
development using its ID and then we are
calling the jQuery UI resizable function
so this line of jQuery code is going to
make this development a resizable
development I have this exact same code
already typed so if we view this page in
the browser this is how it looks like
notice on the development we've got a
resize handle using which we can resize
this development resizable widget has
got loads of options and events
available to customize its behavior
let's look at these options one by one
first let's look at also resize this
option is useful if you want to
automatically resize other elements on
the page based on the resizing that you
are doing to the current element let's
understand this with an example so at
the moment on this page we've got only
one development so let's make a copy of
this and I'm going to change the ID of
the dev to blue there and let's change
the background color to blue and the
text inside the development to blue
there let's save our changes reload this
page and look at this now when I resize
red there nothing happens to blue there
what I want to do is as I am resizing
that there I also want to automatically
resize blue there to achieve that we can
use also resize option also resize so
along with the element that we are
currently resizing we also want to
resize an element with ID blue dev so
let's save our changes reload this page
and look at this when we resize red
there
it also resizes blue dev animate
animates to the final size after
resizing so let's use this option so I
am going to specify animate
to true and let's get rid of the other
development that we have here save our
changes and let's go ahead and reload
this page and look at this when I
increase the width
look at that the increase is animated
now at the moment the problem is it's
not displaying any outline as we are
resizing it if you want an outline to be
displayed then use this class on your
page you I - resizable - helper so let's
go ahead and specify that class within
this Style section you I - resizable -
helper and I'm going to specify border
style here so I'm going to specify a two
pixel dotted black border so let's save
our changes let's go ahead and reload
our page and look at this now we have an
outline aspect ratio this option
specifies whether the element should
preserve aspect ratio that means when
you increase you know when you resize
for example with do you want resize
height to the same ratio similarly when
you resize height do you want to resize
with also to the same proportion if you
want to preserve that aspect ratio then
set this option to true at the moment
look at this when I change where nothing
happens to hide similarly when I change
height nothing happens to the web to
preserve that aspect ratio set aspect
ratio option to true let's save our
changes and look at this when we change
width height changes proportionately
auto-hide specifies with the devii size
handles should hide when the user is not
hovering over the element if you look at
this resizable development notice that
resize handle it's always visible now if
you all want to auto hide that that is
when you are not hovering over the
element if you don't want that resize
handle to be visible then set
auto-hide option 2 true so let's go and
do that auto-hide I'm going to set that
to true reload the page and look at this
at the moment we don't have the resize
handle but the moment we mouse over that
development we get that resize handle
using which we can resize the
development containment this option
constrains resizing to within the bounds
of the specified element or region let's
understand this with an example
yeah I have a development so let's copy
that and paste it within our form
section and I'm going to move this
development inside this container dev so
let's cut that from there and paste it
here so now for the red there the parent
is this container there let's save the
changes and let's reload this page so
the red live is now present within the
parent dev and look at this now when I
increase you know when I resize that I
am able to resize it beyond the bounds
of the container element and let's say
for some reason I want to limit it to
you know the bounds of that parent
element if that's the case use
containment option so I am going to
specify containment and I'm going to set
it to the ID of the parent element the
ID of the parent element is container so
let's copy that and specify it as the
value for containment option so we are
using ID selector here let's save the
changes and let's go to and reload our
page now look at this beyond the bounds
of that parent element you cannot resize
that okay the maximum you can do is
until the bounds of the parent element
ghost this option specifies whether a
semi-transparent the helper element
should be shown for resizing so let's go
ahead and set that option to true save
the changes and let's reload this page
look at this now a semi-transparent
helper will be displayed so until that
point it
be resized max hide min hide max with
min with so basically these options
specify the maximum and minimum height
and width to which you can resize the
element to so in the interest of time I
have already typed the values for these
options so let's copy them and paste it
let's actually remove the parent element
here so let's get rid of that parent
there save our changes and I'm going to
copy the options that I have just paste
the options that I have just copied so
basically here we are saying minimum
height should be 100 pixels minimum
width should be 100 pixels
max height is 300 max width is 300 so
beyond 300 pixels I should not be able
to increase height of width and the
minimum to which I can resize it is 100
pixels height and hundred pixels width
beyond that I should not be able to
reduce its height and width let's save
our changes reload this page and look at
this I can reduce its width but only
under 100 pixels
similarly height to a minimum of 100 and
fit then height I can increase them to a
maximum of 300 you know pixels now let's
look at you know start/stop and resize
events so start event is triggered at
the start of resize operation stop at
the end of resize operation and resize
this is triggered during the resize
operation let's look at an example so
here we have an example of using also
resize option and this constrains
resizing to within the bounds of the
container there so here we have an
example of handling all those three
events so this is what we want to do we
have a development here now as we are
resizing this development you know we
want to display the dimensions at
start/stop and during resizing so what
is the height and width of the
development at the start of resize
operation what our height and width when
we stop resizing and while we are
resizing okay and to get this table
layout we are using an HTML
table here and this table has got three
TRS and each dr has got two TDs and
notice we have a development to display
star dimensions stop dimensions and
resizing dimensions that is the
dimensions during resize operation okay
and we have a red div element here so in
the interest of time I have already
typed this table HTML so let's copy that
from our note that and paste it right
here just above the development and I'm
going to include an HTML break and let's
format this a bit alright so now what we
want to do is handle start/stop and
resize events okay so within our jQuery
ready function I'm actually going to
create a function that's going to be
reusable and let's call this function
get dimensions and to this function I'm
going to pass two parameters the event
object itself and the UI element that
trigger the event okay so what I'm going
to do here is create a variable let's
call it HTML equals and we want this
word height equals and we want to
display the height so how am I going to
get the height I can use this UI element
the parameter that is coming into this
function and this is going to have size
property and on that I'm going to ask
for height and let's append an HTML
break and HTML plus equals so whatever
we have in that variable we are going to
appear now width so width equals I'm
going to use the same parameter UI dot
size but this time I'm going to use
width property and this function is
going to return whatever we have in that
variable HTML and we are going to call
this function when those events are
triggered that is start stop and resize
so let's go ahead and handle start event
so this is going to call this function
when that event is triggered so
basically any event handler
jQuery UI is going to receive these two
parameters event object and the UI
element that triggers the event and
inside this event handler function I'm
going to call our get dimensions
function and pass the event and UI
objects okay so what is this going to do
this is going to return that string
which contains the height and width and
we want to display that in the
respective development so star
dimensions we want to display that in
this div element so I'm going to use the
jQuery ID selector and specify the ID
and let's include the HTML function and
pass the HTML to this function so let's
quickly test our start and see if this
works as expected so let's save our
changes and reload this page when we
start to resize this it should display
the initial height and width initial
height and width of 150 pixels so that's
what it's displayed and we want to do a
similar thing while we are resizing it
that is during the resize operation and
when we stop resizing operation so I am
going to make a copy of this and specify
here the event desktop so when stop
event is called this function is called
I mean let's top event is raised and we
are going to pass those parameters and
whatever we are going to get back we
want to display that in a different
development and the ID of that
development is stop dimensions so let's
go ahead and specify the ID here
similarly during resize operation okay
this event will be called as we are
resizing the development and we want to
do the same thing but the element that
we want to update is resizing dimensions
so that's the development so let's
specify that here let's save our changes
and let's go to and reload our page and
look at this when we start we get the
height start height and width that is
150 and
at the height and wealth you know as we
are resizing the resize event is
triggered and we get the height and
width as soon as I stop resizing we get
the height and width at stop here is the
jQuery code that we just discussed thank
you for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
