this video we'll discuss how to wrap an
unwrapped elements here we have the list
of jQuery methods that help us wrap and
unwrap elements since these methods
modify the Dom they belong to Dom
manipulation category let's understand
these methods one by one with examples
first let's look at trap method wrap
method wraps in HTML structure around
each element in the set of matched
elements let's understand what we mean
by this statement with an example here
we've got three developments and look at
the jQuery selector here dollar div what
is this selector going to do it's going
to written us all these three
developments on that jQuery collection
object we are calling the wrap function
and look at what we are passing is a
parameter to the wrap function we are
passing another HTML structure as a
parameter so this wrap function is going
to take that HTML structure and wrap
each element that this jQuery selector
is going to return so when we execute
this code on this HTML on the Left the
HTML on the right will be produced so
here we have the original do and notice
surrounding that we have the container
div and that happens for all the three
div elements so let's look at this in
action let's flip to visual studio so
here we have the three developments and
we have the ready function wired up now
if we view this page in the browser this
is how it looks like let's launch the
browser developer tools by pressing f12
and look at the three developments in
the Dom now within the ready function
let's include dollar dev which is going
to give us all the developments and on
that let's call the wrap function and
then let's specify the HTML so there
class equals container there and let's
close the development and let's also
create this container div class so let's
include a style section and the name of
the style class is going to be container
there and let's specify a few styles we
want background color to be red and font
color to be white
and font-weight to be bold and finally a
margin of three pixels all right so
let's save these changes and when we
reload this page look at what's going to
happen first of all the styles are
applied to all the three developments
and look at what happened to the HTML in
the Dom so that's the you know original
div element and surrounding that we have
caught container div and look at all the
three developments it happened for all
the three developments so that's what
the wrap method does it's going to wrap
the specified HTML around each element
that this selector is going to return
now let's look at the unwrap method what
is this function going to do it's going
to remove the parents of the set of
matched elements from the Dom so let's
understand that with an example so if
you look at the HTML that we have in the
dorm at the moment so that's the inner
div and the parent for that div is this
div container there okay so now if we
call unwrap on the set of developments
what is this going to do now what does
the unwrap method with remove the
parents of the set of matched elements
so what is the parent of this
development this container div so we're
calling unwrap on developments so it's
going to remove all the container div
elements so let's save the changes and
when we reload look at what's going to
happen the styles are removed and look
at that we have the original divs in
place but the container divs are removed
because they are the parents of these
matching developments so they are
removed and that's what the unwrap
function does an unwrap function does
not take any parameters now let's look
at wrap all wrap all method is going to
wrap a specified HTML structure around
all elements in the set of matched
elements if you look closely there's a
subtle difference between wrap and wrap
all functions so what is wrap going to
do wrap is going to wrap the specified
HTML
around each element whereas wrap all is
going to wrap the specified HTML around
all elements so here look at the example
the calling wrap all on the set of same
developments so this specified HTML will
now be surrounding all these three
developments so we have all the three
developments and surrounding them we
have our container div so let's look at
that in action so instead of lab let's
use wrap all and when we reload this
page look at that so we have the
original three developments and
surrounding that we have our container
div so that's what wrap all does and
let's look at wrap in arm this method is
going to wrap in HTML structure around
the content of each element in the set
of matched elements so if you look at
these developments the content is Devon
div to dip three and look at what we are
doing here we are calling wrap inner on
the set of developments and this is the
HTML structure so what is this going to
do this is going to wrap this HTML
structure around the content of the
developments so the content of the
development is div one notice that
around that content we have the
container div so that's what wrap inner
does and surrounding that we have the
original div so let's look at this in
action so instead of wrap all let's use
wrap inner and when we reload this look
at that so that's the content div one
surrounding that we have container div
and surrounding that we have the
original dev and that happens for all
the three developments now if we call
unwrap
what is going to happen is this
unwrapped function going to remove the
container div or the div with ID
attribute it's going to remove the div
with ID attribute because that is the
parent
okay so when we reload this page look at
that
you know the div elements with ID
attributes are gone and we are only left
with container divs thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
