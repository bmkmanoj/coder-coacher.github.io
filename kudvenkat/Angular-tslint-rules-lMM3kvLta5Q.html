in this video we'll discuss some of the
common angular lending rules we find the
lending rules in an angular project in
this file called TS lint Jason as you
can see there are several lending rules
depending on your project requirements
you may add remove or modify these rules
in this video let's discuss some of the
common rules that we have in this file
the first rule that we look at is the
code mark rule code mark rule specifies
whether you want to wrap your strings in
single or double quotes this rule is
present in our lending configuration
file and if you want to find that rule
within this file launch the find window
by pressing ctrl F and then search for
your rule in this case we want to search
for quote mark and as you can see the
default is single meaning strings must
be wrapped in single quotes if you want
to change that you can do so for example
if you want to wrap your strings within
double quotes you may change this to
double and if you look at the code that
we've got that is generated by the
angular CLI notice by default all the
strings are wrapped in single codes and
I have just run the ng lint command on
this new angular project and as you can
see all the files have passed linting
now let's introduce some linting errors
let's wrap the string title within our
app component in double quotes instead
of single quotes like that at the moment
notice visual studio code is not able to
report this lending error in our next
video we'll discuss how to enable visual
studio code to report linting errors so
we have the opportunity to fix them as
we are developing our application at
this point if we run ng lint command it
should report this code mark rule
violation as a lending error but before
we do that let's discuss few other
linting rules next we have no trailing
whitespace rule this rule this allows
trailing whitespace at the end of a line
now if you look at all these lines that
we have here we don't have a trailing
whitespace at the end of any of these
lines now let's introduce a white space
right here save our changes so this is
another linting error
semicolon rule this rule specifies that
a line should be terminated with a
semicolon if you look at the code that
we have within our angular project
notice every line is terminated with a
semicolon if we miss a semicolon then
that's another landing error
next we have common format rule this
rule specifies that single line comments
must begin with a space within our route
component let's introduce a single line
comment this is a comment now notice
this comment starts with a space if I
remove this space this is another
linting error component class suffix
rule this rule enforces that a component
class should end with the suffix
component if you look at our route
component class notice the class name
ends with this word component if I
remove this word component from the
class name then we are introducing
another linting error finally we have
use life cycle interface rule this rule
enforces that you add the implements
keyword for every lifecycle hook you use
in our angular 2 tutorial we discussed
ng on in it lifecycle hook to use a
lifecycle hook in our angular project
there are three simple steps first
import the lifecycle hook interface in
this case the interface is owned in it
and then we make of a class implement
the interface and then finally provide
the implementation for the interface
member this interface on and it has got
just one member which is ng on a net so
we need to provide implementation for
that method so these are the three steps
to implement a lifecycle hook this
second step right here making the class
implement the lifecycle hook interface
is optional whether we make that last
implement the interface or not the
application works exactly the same way
but it is good to make the class
implement the interface because we will
get
compiled I'm checking for example if we
misspelled the lifecycle oak interface
method name notice we get an error right
away when I hover the mouse over this
red squiggly look at what it says class
up incorrectly implements interface or
Nanette so to have that compile time
checking it's always good to make the
class implement the respective lifecycle
hook interface but from a functionality
standpoint whether the class implements
the respective lifecycle hook interface
or not it's not going to make a
difference in any way now this linting
rule use life cycle interface rule
enforces that we had the implements
keyword for every lifecycle hook views
within our project we are implementing
ng on a net life cycle hook so we are
implementing on init interface now if we
remove this implements keyword it's not
going to make a difference in any way
from the functionality standpoint but
this linting rule use life cycle
interface rule will report that as a
linting error so let's save all our
changes so far and then run ng lint
command once again there we go
lint errors found in the list of files
we have deliberately violated these
linting errors for each rule that we
have violated we got a corresponding
lending error and notice all these
linting errors are within our root
component file which is a proc component
not here's in addition to the file name
we also have the line and column number
where we have that specific linting
error at the moment we've got six
linting errors comment we'll start with
a space there's a trailing whitespace
double code should be single code
remember all strings must be wrapped in
a pair of single quotes instead of
double quotes we are missing a semicolon
we are missing implementing life cycle
hook interface on in it and finally the
name of the class
app should end with the suffix component
some of these lending errors support
automatic fix to have these finding
errors fixed automatically all we need
to do is run the lint command with fix
option so let's do that quickly ng
and - - fix there we go
it's able to fix three linting errors
it's not able to fix these three I think
it fixed trailing whitespace double code
should be single code and missing
semicolon it's not able to fix common
mud start with a space implement life
cycle hook interface and the name of the
class app should end with the suffix
component so let's fix these three
linting errors manually so first let's
start with comment must start with a
space and then the component class
should have the suffix component and it
also should implement on init interface
let's save all our changes and Renova
ng lint command once again there we go
all files pass linting as expected so to
fix those lending errors that support
automatic fix use the fix option along
with the ng lint command use the type
check option to control the type
checking we discussed this option in our
previous video use the format option to
format the output the default is pros
but we can also use JSON stylish verbose
etc to see the list of all options that
we can use with engine length command
there data types and default values use
ng lint - - help there we go we have all
the options as expected at the moment
which is studio code is not able to
display linting errors within the editor
in our next video well discuss how to
enable Visual Studio code to display
linting errors here so we have the
opportunity to fix them as we are
writing our code thank you for listening
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
