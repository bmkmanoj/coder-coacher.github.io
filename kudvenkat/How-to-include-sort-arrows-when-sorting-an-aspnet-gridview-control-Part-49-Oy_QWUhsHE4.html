fainted this is pad 49 of asp.net
gridview tutorial in this video we'll
discuss about how to include short
arrows when sorting an asp.net grid view
control please watch but 48 of the
asp.net grid View tutorial before
proceeding with this video now when the
data in the grid view control is sorted
in ascending order then I want to
display an up arrow next to the column
by which the data is sorted in ascending
order on the other hand if the data is
sorted in descending order then we want
to display a down arrow in the first
image here are the up arrow next to the
name column indicates that the data in
this grid view control is sorted by name
column in ascending order the down arrow
next to the name column in this grid
view control indicates that the data is
sorted by name in descending order let's
see how to achieve this obviously the
first thing to do is to include both of
these images into our asp.net web
application project I have this images
within this folder so let me copy them
let's flip to visual studio let's create
a folder with named images and let's
paste the images into this folder
alright so at this point we have the
required images now what event are we
going to make use of to achieve this I'm
going to make use of row created event
so when is this row created even fired
the row created event inspired whenever
a row with the grid view control is
created the header is also a row within
the grid we control so when the header
row is created you know we have this
event fired so we're going to make use
of this row created event so first let's
go ahead and generate the event handler
method for this row created event and to
do that let's flip to visual studio
let's get to the properties of the grid
view control by pressing f4 click on the
events icon and then double click on
this row created event to generate the
row created even handler method all
right now the next question is how are
we going to determine by which column
the data is sorted in this grid view
control we are going to make use of two
custom attributes you know if you
remember in part 48 of the asp.net view
tutorial
we discussed about adding to custom
attributes that is custom sort filled
I mean current sort filled and parent
sort a direction please watch part 48 if
you haven't done so already okay so
we're going to make use of those two
attributes so if I flip this waveform to
the source mode notice that the current
sort field is going to specify by which
column the data is sorted at the moment
and then the current sort direction is
going to specify whether the data is
sorted in ascending or descending order
so I'm going to make use of both of
these custom attributes all right and
just to speed things up I have this code
already implemented so let me copy that
let's flip thee to the code-behind file
and let's paste that code here so what
are we doing here if we look at the
first line the first line text if we
have both of these attributes current
sort field and current sort a direction
if both of them are not null then we are
going to do some processing if any of
them is missing then you know we will
not be able to display images you know
at least it will not work for us so we
are checking both of those attributes or
not now if that's the case then we are
checking the route type is the route
type header remember the row created
event is also fired for data rows we
don't want to do any processing if if it
is fired for the data rows so that's why
I am checking if the row type is header
and if the row type is header notice
that what is the header row or for that
matter what is a row a row is nothing
but a collection of a table cells okay
so what we are doing here we are looping
through each table cell within that row
so for each table cell indeed or true
dot cells what are we doing we are
checking whether if there are any
controls within that table cell so if
you look at the header row it's a
collection of tables there and each a
table cell has got controls in them in
meaning look at this employee ID name
gender and city what are they are they
hyperlinks or link buttons that actually
link buttons so each table cell has got
controls in them okay
so I am calling this method to check if
the table cell has got controls this
method is going to return true if there
controls in that people cell okay if
there are controls there could be one or
more controls and then I'm actually
trying to retrieve look at that the
first thing here we are doing is we are
creating a variable of type link button
and then initializing that to null and
then notice this we are checking you
know the first control in the table cell
and I am using the controls collection
property and then passing in zero
controls of zero you know look at what
is it being what is it returning it is
returning a control back but we are
checking is that a link button okay is
the first control within the table cell
is it a link button if that's the case
we are typecasting that to be of type
link button and assigning that link
buttons reference to our variable of
type link button that we have created
okay and then we are checking here if
that sort link button is not now and
then and if the current sort field the
attribute matches with the command
argument of the sort link button so if
you look at this link button here when I
click on that link button you know a
command a sort command is basically
raised and then the command argument
property of that link button contains
the name of the column by which we want
to have the data sorted so we are using
that command argument property and then
matching that with the current sort
field attribute if both of them match
then we know for sure the data is sorted
by that column so at this point we know
by which column the data is sorted but
the next question is do we want to
display an up arrow or down arrow how do
we determine that so that purpose we are
going to make use of current sort
Direction attribute okay so if we flip
back to the code so we determined by
which column the data is sorted and then
we are creating an image here
dynamically and then look at that and we
are checking if the current sort
direction is equal to ascending meaning
we know that for sure the data is sorted
in ascending order and by this column
okay in which case we are setting the
image you are a property of the image to
Aparo else we are setting it to the down
and then look at this there is a there
is one non-breaking space between the
header text and the image so how did we
get that space there because we added
that space using this little control
here okay so to the literal control
constructor we are passing ampersand
nbsp semicolon you know this is the HTML
for a non-breaking space and we are
adding that little control to the
controls property of this tables here
and finally we are adding the image
that's it
so let me run this now and it should
work as expected so when the grid we
control first renders the data will be
sorted by employee ID so they should be
an up arrow next to the employee ID
column I click on that once again notice
that we have at our own arrow I click on
name column the data is sorted in
ascending order up arrow I click on that
once again data sorted in descending
order and I have a down arrow alright
on this slide you can find resources for
a speed or Nessie and sequence of
interview questions that's it for today
thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
