video we'll discuss customizing the
auto-generated create view please watch
by 26 before proceeding with this video
if you recollect from part 25 this
create view is auto-generated for us
let's navigate to the create view notice
that at the moment we are using a
textbox control as the user interface
element for gender it's ideal to have a
drop-down list control let's see how to
replace this textbox control with a
drop-down list control let's flip to
visual studio let's get to this create
view this is the piece of code that's
actually generating the textbox control
for gender notice that at the moment we
are using editor for HTML helper to
produce a drop-down list I'm going to
use another HTML helper called
drop-down list I'm going to replace this
line of code with this code let's format
this properly notice that at the moment
this drop-down list HTML helper is
accepting three input parameters you
know the first parameter is the field
for which we want to generate the
drop-down list in this case it's gender
and a drop down list is basically a
collection of select list item objects
so the second parameter is that list so
here we are passing a list of select
list item okay so within this list the
first item is male notice that both the
text and value properties of the select
list item object are set to male and the
second select list item is female again
both text and value are set to female
and then within this gender drop-down
list I want the first item as select
gender so that is being passed as the
third parameter and then the other
change that I want to do is I want
select Department as the first item
within the department drop-down list
so for department you know this is the
piece of code that's actually generating
the department drop down list and notice
that at the moment we are passing string
dot empty and that's why the first item
within this drop down list is an empty
string instead of that I won't select
the department so I'm going to pass
select the department there and then
let's also change the font of this page
to area let's use the div tag to do that
and I'm going to set the style attribute
on this div tag let's set font family to
area okay let's go ahead and run this
with all these changes let's navigate to
the create view notice that we have a
drop-down list for gender and the first
item is select anda and then we also
have the first item within the drop down
list at select Department okay there is
another problem with this view at the
moment at the moment on this view none
of these fields are required so without
even filling any data if I click on this
create button look at what's going to
happen a row is inserted and let's look
at in the database so if we execute this
query select star from TBL employee
notice that a record is just inserted
name gender City Department ID all of
them are now now I want to make them
required fields now how do we make them
required fields we can use the required
attribute on the properties of the
employee object if you recollect from
par 25 you know entity framework has
generated an employee entity based on
this table TBL employee so within this
employee data model dot designer dot cs5
we have employee class and that has got
you know the properties ID name gender
city all the employee properties now we
can use required attribute on these
properties but this is not the right
place to do because this is an
auto-generated file in the future if for
some reason if this file is
auto-generated
again all of our changes will be lost
that's why I'm going to add another
employee class to this models folder
let's add a class file with named
employee dot CS and then I'm going to
paste this code within that this is
again a straightforward code we
discussed about you know similar code in
our previous session as well so now this
metadata type attribute is present in
system dot component model dot data
annotations namespace ok so what are we
doing here very straightforward look at
that within this employee data model
designer dot C as the employee class is
actually auto-generated for us so if you
look at this employee class this sorta
generator and notice that this is a
partial class ok so we are creating
another you know partial class here so
these two classes together make that
employee class ok and this class is
decorated with metadata type attribute
and then we are specifying you know this
class is actually type of employee
metadata so here this employee metadata
class is going to contain all the
metadata for the employee class so now
notice that within this employee
metadata I have all the properties of
the employee class name gender City and
the department ID ok and then all of
them are decorated with required
attribute and then I'm using a display
attribute here for department ID I'm
using display attribute and setting name
to Department you know why is that
required you'll understand that in a bit
actually let's get rid of this one right
now and with these changes let's go
ahead and run this and see if these
fields on that UI are actually made
required so let's navigate to create
view and then click on create notice
that I get all these the name field is
required gender field city field and
then look at this department ID field is
required ok now we know that behind the
scenes this drop-down list contains both
department ID and Department value
but then since this is stored as
department ID within the employee table
you know and that's what is the property
within that employee class by default
you know the validation message is going
to be the department ID field is
required now this doesn't make sense to
the end user you know end user sees them
as departments so it would make more
sense to actually have an error message
stating the department field is required
okay and to achieve that I'm using this
display attribute right there setting
that to name so with these changes let's
run this now and then that should say
instead of you know a department ID it
will now use Department so create look
at that the department field is required
and at the moment notice that these
error messages are using you know black
color let's say for example I want to
format this color to red is that
possible absolutely
and also you know maybe I want red
asterisks here and then the detail error
message you know I want to display them
in a validation summary control that's
possible as well we'll discuss all these
in a later video session on this slide
