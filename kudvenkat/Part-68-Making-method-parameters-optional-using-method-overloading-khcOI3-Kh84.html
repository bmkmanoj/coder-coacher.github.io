venket this is part 68 of c-sharp
tutorial in this video well disk is
making method parameters optional using
method overloading
please watch about 67 of this video
series before proceeding in part 67 we
discussed using parameter arrays as an
option to make method parameters
optional in this video we'll discuss
using method overloading as another
alternative to make method parameters
optional
we'll be using the same example that we
started in part 67 that's a function to
add two or more numbers let's flip to
visual studio so if you look at you know
this class program I have this function
add numbers look at the parameter list
here at the moment I have got three
parameters the first two parameters are
of type integer so these parameters are
going to contain the numbers the first
two numbers that the end user want to
add and the third parameter is of type
integer array so if the end user wants
to add more than three numbers then all
those numbers are going to be part of
this integer array okay and look at the
implementation itself which is very
straightforward we have here a variable
of type integer which is going to hold
the sum of the first and second numbers
that we are going to pass in and then if
the end user has passed in more than two
numbers they're going to come into this
array so what we are doing here are we
are checking okay if rest of numbers is
not equal to now then we know for sure
the end user has passed something into
this parameter okay
so in which case we loop through each
number within that array and then we add
that to our result variable finally we
print that out okay so now at the moment
if I invoke this function look at this
when I say add numbers then I have to
supply arguments for the three
parameters okay look at this if I just
specify the first two parameters first
and second number you know the moment I
do that look at that I already got a
read as quickly there and look at the
error message what does it say no
overload for method add numbers takes
two arguments
we don't have overloaded version of add
numbers which is which takes just
numbers I only have one version of had
numbers and it takes three parameters
okay so obviously you know if I want to
add just two numbers you know I passed
the first and second number for the
third parameter I can simply pass now
you know that's fine this this is going
to work as expected but you know I
really here the third parameter is not
optional you're passing a value of now
now let's say for example I want to
provide the end-user with a method let's
say for example if the end user wants to
add just two numbers then I want him to
supply values only for the first and
second parameter okay so how do we do
that we can make use of you know method
overloading as an all other alternative
so I'm going to copy the signature of
this function that's already there and
let's paste it there and then what I'm
going to do so this is the overloaded
version which is going to allow the end
user to add you know just two numbers
first number and second number so I'm
going to get rid of this third parameter
from there okay and then what I'm going
to do I'm going to call the function
like this so copy paste there so for the
first number I am going to pass whatever
is going to come into this function as a
parameter and second number is going to
be that one and for the third parameter
I'm simply passing now okay so now when
I actually tries to try to use this
function look at this the moment I open
paranthesis look at that it says I have
two overloaded versions of the side
number the one which takes two
parameters and the other one which takes
three parameters so if the end user
wants to add just two numbers I can do
certain and 20 and then I close the
parentheses look at this now I am NOT
passing now I'm just specifying the two
parameters the arguments for the first
two parameters so I'm using this
overloaded version so obviously if I run
this you know you know the output which
is 30 on the other hand if the end user
wants to add maybe four numbers then I'm
going to use the overloaded version
which takes three parameters and the
third parameter here is an integer array
so I can create an integer array new
integer and then let's say I want to add
30 and 40 I
Sparsit like that run that and you
should see the output of those three
numbers I mean four numbers okay in our
next video we'll discuss making method
parameters optional by specifying
parameter D Falls on this slide you can
