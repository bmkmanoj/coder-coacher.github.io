this video we'll discuss different ways
of associating known types in WCF this
is continuation to part 7
so please watch part 7 before proceeding
there are four different ways to
associate known types option 1 use known
type attribute on the base type here
employee class is the base type
full-time employee and part-time
employee are deriving from the employee
base class in order to associate these
two derived at tides as known types with
this base type in this case we are
applying known type attribute on the
base style keep in mind this option is
global this means that all service
contracts and all operation contracts
are now going to respect these two
derived types as known types for this
employee base type option to apply
service known type attribute on the
service contract notice that here we are
associating the known types using
service known type attribute okay
now only this service is going to allow
part-time employee and full-time
employee types as known types of this
employee base type if you have another
service and if you want that service to
respect you know these two types as
known types then again you need to
decorate that service with the service
known type attribute so this gives us a
little granular control just in case if
you have a service which uses employee
base type and there if you don't want to
allow these to derive the types as known
types then don't decorate that with
service known type attributes so it's
going to give you that granularity now
option 3 is going to give you even more
granularity ok let's say within a
service contract if you want just one of
the operation contracts to respect those
two known types then apply that on
service known type attribute or only on
that operation contract
look at this here we have not specified
service known type attribute on save
employee so this method I mean this
operation contract is now not going to
respect these two types as known types
let's actually look at this in action at
the moment the service is running it's
the same example that we worked with in
the previous session so now look at this
I am able to get employee so everything
is working now now let's go back to our
service so within our I employee service
so at the moment within our employee
class we are using known type attribute
so let's comment these two here and then
within our I employee service so let's
use service known type attribute here
and then we need to specify the type
let's use type of keyword and what's the
type we want full-time employee as a
known type as well as part-time employee
okay now we don't have that service
known type attribute on the save
employee so let's close the host that's
already running and let's run the
service once again so the host is
running now now get employee should work
so if we enter ID to look at that it's
still working but then let me try to
save you know the same employee with a
different ID so we are using three at
the moment if you look at our database
table we have caught two employees let's
try to save this and see what's going to
happen look at that we get an exception
okay and you know the exception makes
sense as far this part-time employee
strength TC realize in you know that and
it has no knowledge about that time okay
and look at that it says consider using
a data contract reservoir or ad D type
corresponding to part-time employee to
the list of known
times a very meaningful error message
okay so if you want more granular
control then apply it at the respective
operation can operation contracts
options for we can specify known types
in the configuration file so this is
equivalent to applying the known type
attribute on the base type in the sense
that it is applicable globally all
service contracts and all operation
contracts are going to respect the known
types and how do we do that we use
system run time dot serialization
element within that data contract
serializer and then declare the types
element within that first we add the
base type okay and look at this employee
is the type the name of the class which
is present in employee service namespace
and this employee class is present in
employee service assembly because when
we compile this project employee service
you know we will get an assembly called
employee service dot DLL so that's the
name of the assembly and then we also
need to specify the version number
culture and public key token now where
do we get the version number from if you
look at the employee service there's
this properties and then within assembly
info dot CS file you should say by
default the version is one dot 0 dot 0
dot 0 and then we need to specify the
culture you know since we didn't specify
any culture the culture is going to be
neutral and the public key token will be
not because we didn't strongly name this
employee service assembly now if you
want to know what what is meant by
strong naming assembly and how to strong
name and assembly then please watch part
3 from the dotnet basics tutorial so
once we specify the base type then in we
need to associate the known types using
known type element so we specify the
known type as full-time employee again
this class is also present in the same
assembly version culture public key
token you know
same as the main time and here we are
associating part-time employee as known
tab let's also look at this in action so
let's go back to our service and then
remove it remove this service known type
attribute from the operation contracts
as well so at the moment we haven't
specified known types anywhere
so now let's go and specify within the
configuration file so within the route
configuration element system dot runtime
dot serialization and within that we
specify data contract serializer and
then declared types and then we are
going to add a type so first we need to
specify the name of the type itself in
our case the name of the base type is
employee class which is present in
employee service namespace so employee
service dot employees the name of the
class and the assembly that it is
present then is employee service and
then we need to specify the version
which is the equal to 1 dot 0 dot 0 dot
0 and then culture which is equal to
neutral and then finally we need to
specify the public key token as well and
that is going to be now alright so that
is the base type ok and to this base
type we want to associate derived types
using the known type element ok I am
going to make a copy of this one and
then this is going to be a self closing
tag ok so what is the drive type that we
want to associate we want to associate
full-time employee so let's copy that
and then specify the name of the type as
full-time employee and then let's make
another copy of this and then the other
type that we want to associate is
part-time employee so let's copy that
and then specify it here
all right so straightforward
configuration there
all right this let's close the host
that's already running let's read on
this service so now since we have
specified this in the configuration file
these settings are going to be
applicable globally all service
contracts and all operation contracts
where we are using the employee base
type are going to respect these two
types that is full-time employee and
part-time employee derived types as
known types okay so let's go ahead and
refresh this page so let's try to get
the employee look at that get works and
let's try to save this employee as a
different employee so save employee so
employee saved let's go back and check
if that is saved look at that we got
another employee all right that's it for
today thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
