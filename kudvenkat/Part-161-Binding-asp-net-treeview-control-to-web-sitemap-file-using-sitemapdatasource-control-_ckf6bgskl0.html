this video we'll discuss binding tree
view control to web dot sitemap file
using sitemap data source control this
is continuation to part 160 so please
watch part 1 16 from the asp.net
tutorial before proceeding with this
video in part 158 we discussed binding
menu control to web dot sitemap file
using sitemap data source control
binding tree view control to a web dot
sitemap file is very much similar let's
understand this with an example
so if we want to bind the tree view
control to web dot site map file the
first step is to add a web dot sitemap
file in part 158 we have already added
the web dot sitemap file so this is the
project that we have been working with
in the previous sessions of this video
series and this is the web dot sitemap
file that we have added in part 158 so
that's the first step and the second
step is to drag and drop site map data
source control at the moment if you look
at this platform 14 we have a tree view
control here but then at the moment this
is being bound to an XML file using XML
data source control so first of all
let's get rid of this binding and to do
that let's get rid of this data source
ID attribute because we don't want this
to be bound to an XML file we are going
to bind this to a web dot sitemap file
and the second step is to remove these
data bindings as well so at the moment
we have a tree view control that's not a
bound to any file let's get rid of this
XML data source control as well all
right now let's drag and drop site map
data source control the site map data
source control will automatically read
data from web dot sitemap file so that's
our second step and the third step is to
associate the tree view control with
sitemap data source control using data
source ID attribute of the tree view
control so let's set data source ID
the attribute and this is going to be
equal to the ID of the sitemap data
source control that's it we are done
let's go ahead and run this now so tree
view control should be reading its data
from web dot sitemap file now so we get
our data now from web dot sitemap file
but look at the problem here the problem
is it's displaying dummy root which is
present in web dot sitemap file now we
don't want that dummy root to be
displayed and to achieve that all we
have to do is set this shoe starting
nude attribute of sitemap data source
control to false so let's go ahead and
do that
so within the from 14 dot aspx let's set
show starting node attribute to false
let's give it a run and now look at that
we don't have that dummy truth node
displayed and now when we click on any
of the items here look at that I'm going
to click on upload resume a so upload
resumes opened in the same window but we
don't want that let's say when we click
on the link in a tree view control we
want that target page to be opened in a
new window if that's the case all we
need to do is set the target attribute
of the tree view control to underscore
blank let's go ahead and do that so
target equals underscore black let's
give it a run so let's click on upload
resume look at that the page is now
opened in a new window and we have our
original page here when we click on edit
resume again that's open and then in a
new window and we have the original page
here that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
