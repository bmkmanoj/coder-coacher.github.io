questions and answers video series in
this video we'll discuss writing a
select query to retrieve all student
names that starts with letter M without
using the like operator so here is what
we want to do we're going to make use of
this students table in this example
based on this table we want to write a
select query that returns us all these
student names that start with letter M
look at the name column within the
results all the names start with letter
M if the interviewer has not mentioned
not to use the like operator then we
would have very easily written this
query using the like operator so our
query would have been like this select
star from students wear name like M
percentage so this is going to return us
all the student names that start with
letter M but the interviewer has
specifically told us not to use the like
operator in sequel server there are
three inbuilt functions that we can use
to achieve exactly the same thing we can
use character index function or left or
substring functions let's look at using
one by one first let's use the character
index function select star from students
where character index off now we want to
find the index of character M in the
name column and if the index of
character M within the name column is
one then that means M is the first
character within the name so we want all
such names so when we execute this query
notice we get all the names that start
with letter M now let's look at using
the left function so let's make a copy
of this query and instead of using care
index function let's use the left
function so from the name column I want
the first character from the left side
and if that is equal to M that means
those names start with letter M so we
want all such names again when we
execute this query notice we get all the
names that start with letter M finally
let's look at using substring function
select style from students where
substring of so we want a substring from
the name column and we want to start at
character position 1 and we want only
one character if that is again equal to
M then we know the name starts with
letter M so when we execute this again
we get all the names that start with
letter M so here are those three queries
that we just looked at thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
