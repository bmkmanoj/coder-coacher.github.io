tutorial in this video we'll discuss how
to implement polymorphism in JavaScript
with an example object-oriented
programming languages like C sharp and
Java support polymorphism first let's
look at a c-sharp example and then we'll
see how to implement the same thing in
JavaScript let's flip to visual studio
within the code-behind file of this
waveform one dot aspx let's create a
shape class this shape class is going to
contain a public virtual method which is
going to return a string and let's name
this method draw the reason we made this
method virtual because we want the
derived classes to be able to override
this method so this method is simply
going to return a string saying I am a
generic shape now let's create another
class let's name this circle and this
class is going to inherit from the shape
class and this class is going to
override the draw method which it is
going to inherit from the shape class
and the overridden draw method within
this circle class is simply going to
return a string saying I am a circle
let's create another class let's name
this class Squire and this class is also
going to inherit from shape and this is
also going to override the draw method
and the overridden draw method within
the Squire class is simply going to put
it in a string saying I am a squire now
let's create another class public class
and let's name this class triangle and
this class is also going to inherit from
shape but this class is not going to
override the draw method so at the
moment we've got four different classes
shape circle Squire and triangle
shape classes the base for all the other
three classes within circle and Squire
class we have overridden the draw method
but within triangle class we dint
overwrite the draw method now within the
page load event let's create a shape
array let's name the variable shapes and
this array is going to contain four
shape objects first a new shape object
itself and then a new circle and then a
new Squire and then finally a new
triangle and then let's use it for each
loop so for each shape and the shape
sorry that we have just created so
within this shape sorry we've got four
shape objects so on each of the shape
object call the draw method and whatever
response we get we want that to write to
the web page so let's use response dot
right and then to the response let's go
ahead and append an HTML break as well
so the output of each method is
displayed on a separate line so let's go
ahead and run this and inspect the
output that we get look at the result it
says I am a generic shape I am a circle
I'm a squire and then finally again it
says I am a generic shape so first the
object that we have within the array is
the shape object itself shape objects
object has this draw method which is
going to return the string I am a
generic shape so that's what gets
printed and the second object that we
have a circle so the circle object also
has the draw method so circle object has
overridden the draw method and it
returns the string I am a circle that's
why circle objects is I am a circle the
next object is Squire so Squire also has
overridden the draw method so that's why
it says I am a squire and the last
object within the array is the triangle
object and if you look at the triangle
class it don't override the draw method
as a result it ends up using the base
class
draw method which says I am a generic
shape so the triangular object when you
invoke draw method it ends up using the
base class method and that is the reason
it says I am a generic shape now we know
that javascript is also an
object-oriented programming language so
JavaScript also supports the concept of
polymorphism so let's see how to
implement the same example in JavaScript
so within this HTML page let's first
create a shape object so shape function
and basically this shape object is going
to have a draw method so shape dot
prototype dot draw equals function and
the draw method within the shape object
is simply going to return a string
saying I am a generic shape now let's
create a circle object fire circle
equals function and for the circle
object we want the shape object to be
the parent so circle dot prototype
equals object dot create and we are
going to use the shape objects prototype
so basically here we are saying you know
for the circle class the parent is going
to be the shape object since shape is
the parent for the circle it can inherit
this draw method but we want the circle
to override the draw method so circle
dot prototype dot draw equals function
so here we are going to override the
draw method within this circle object
and the draw method within the circle
object is going to return this string
saying I am a circle so let's make a
copy of this and then create a square
object
so now let's change the name to square
so here we have the square object the
parent for the square object also is
going to be the shape object and within
the square object we are going to
override the draw method and the
overridden draw method within this choir
object is going to return this string
saying I am a square now finally let's
go ahead and create the triangle object
so let's change this name to triangle
and even for triangle the parent is
going to be the shape object but the
triangle object is not going to override
the draw method okay so now let's go
ahead and create a shapes array so we're
shapes equals so first we want to create
a new shape object itself then a new
circle then a new Square and then a new
triangle now let's use a for each loop
on this shape sorry object so shapes dot
for each so you know for each shape
object that is present in this shapes
array we want to call a function and
then pass the shape object to that
function and what we want this function
to do with that shape object is called
the draw method and whatever response we
get we want to write that to the web
page so I'm going to use document dot
write shape object dot draw method and
then let's also up in an HTML break so
we get the response of each method on a
separate line all right so with all
these changes let's go ahead and run
this now so look at this we are on HTML
page one dot HTM so it says now I am a
generic shape I'm a circle I'm a squire
and
I am a genetic shape so basically we
have these four objects within the side
the first one is the shape object itself
when the draw method within the shape
object is called it will call this
method and it says I am a generic shape
and then we have this circle object
which has overridden the draw method and
the overridden method says I am a circle
so when we call drawn the circle object
it says I am a circle similarly Squire
has over Internet so we get IMS square
but if you look at triangle it didn't
overwrite the draw method so the
triangle object ends up using the parent
objects draw method the parent object
the shape object and the shape objects
draw method says I'm a generic shape so
the output is I am a generic shape you
know when the object is triangle it is
the same example that we just discussed
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
