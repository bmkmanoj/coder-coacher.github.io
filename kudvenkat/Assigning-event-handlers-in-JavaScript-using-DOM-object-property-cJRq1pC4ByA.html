in this video we'll discuss assigning
event handlers to events using Dom
object property first let's understand
what is storm dorm stands for document
object model when a browser loads of a
page the browser creates a document
object model of that web page here we've
got simple HTML so within HTML we have
got head and body and under head we've
got title and within body we've got
script and developments and under there
we have h1 element here you can see a
graphical representation of the document
object model that would be constructed
by the browser for this sample HTML
notice that the root object is the
window object and underneath that we've
got document object and under that we
have HTML and under that we have head
and body on the head we have got title
and on the body we've got a script and
div and under there we have h1 so notice
that this document object model is
created as a tree of objects now we can
use JavaScript to access and modify Dom
objects and their properties for example
we can use JavaScript to add modify and
remove HTML elements within the DOM and
even change their attributes along the
same lines we can also use Dom object
properties to assign even handlers to
events let's look at an example so this
is the same example that we worked with
in the previous video session in this
example notice that we are using the
attributes of this HTML element to
associate even handlers to events for
example when mouse over event occurs we
want this function to be executed so we
are assigning this function to this
attribute of this HTML element now
instead of using attributes we can also
use Dom object properties so we can
rewrite this example like this so I'm
going to use the document object so
document dot get element by ID and then
we pass the ID of the button which is
BTN and then we are going to use these
Oh
property so we have on mouse-over
property so to this property I'm going
to assign the even handler function that
we want to execute when mouse-over event
occurs so then mouse over event occurs
we want to call this function along the
same lines when Mouse out event occurs
we want to call this function so since
we are using the document object
properties here we can get rid of these
HTML attributes and we can change the
implementation of these even handler
methods so we can delete that and then
we can use this keyword here so this
keyword reference is the current element
in this case notice that this function
is assigned to this property so this in
this case references the button element
so here we also we can use the disk
keyword and let's do the same thing
within this function as well so now
let's run this and the behavior should
be exactly same when we hover the mouse
over the button so onmouseover notice
that the background color is red and
focal I mean font color is hello
onmouseout background color is black and
the font color is white so in this case
we are actually having the code that we
want to execute inside and named a
function that is a function that has got
a name and then we are associating this
function name with this property so when
mouse over event occurs this function
executes now instead of that we can have
this code inside an anonymous function
and then associate that anonymous
function directly with this property
what is an anonymous function anonymous
function is function that does not have
any name so when I remove the names here
so these functions are now anonymous
functions so what I can do is take this
function definition
and then get it off the name from there
and then paste it right there so to this
property now we are associating this
anonymous function
so when mouse-over event occurs this
anonymous function will be executed
let's do the same thing for this as well
even at this point the behavior of this
program should be the same
notice that onmouseover and onmouseout
so this is the same example that we
discussed just now so here we are
assigning an anonymous function to mouse
over and mouse out events using the
properties of the Dom object now if an
even handler is assigned using both that
is an HTML attribute and a dorm object
property the handler that is assigned
using the dorm object property overrides
the one that is assigned using the HTML
attribute let's understand what we mean
by this with an example so here we have
a button let's change the code here
let's actually have two functions let's
call this handler one and let's say we
want to display an alert message saying
and Lara assigned using HTML attribute
and let's say here handler assigned
using Dom object property now so far we
know that there are two ways to
associate an even handler to an event of
a given element one is by using the
attribute like this so on click of this
button I want to call handler one so we
are associating this handler that is
handler 1 to this button click event
using the HTML attribute and with script
here within JavaScript we can use on the
document object property to associate
this handler let's change the name to
handle it too so within the script I'm
going to use document dot get element by
ID and the ID of the button is BTN and
let's say on click we want to
eight handler - now if you recollect
from you know what we have discussed
before here the root object is the
window object and if you look at the
code here we are saying document dot get
element by ID can I do this can I say
vendo dot document dot get element by ID
absolutely so we are going from the root
window dot document and then we are
using the dot get element by ID function
so this should exactly work the same way
as document dot get element by ID so now
notice that we have in a 1 handler
assigned using the attribute of the HTML
element and that this second handler is
assigned using the attribute of the Dom
object so now let's see which one is
going to work so when I click the button
notice that handler assigned using Dom
object property execute so when I click
OK I don't get any other alert message
that means basically you know the
handler that we have assigned using the
on the Dom object property has
overwritten the handler that is assigned
using the HTML attribute so if we were
to comment this line then this handler
will be assigned to the click event so
now when we click this handler assigned
using HTML attribute message appears so
this is the same example that we just
discussed
now using this approach that is
assigning even handlers to events using
Dom object property we can assign only
one event handler method to a given
event now if you look at the code that
we have caught here notice that you know
we are assigning two handlers okay click
handler one and click handler two to the
same event of the button control that is
the click event
now here handler two overrides Handler
one so whichever handler that we have
assigned last that basically events
let's look at this in action
so let's say here we are alert in this
message handler 1 and here we are
alerting handler to let's get rid of
this handler that we have assigned using
the HTML attribute
and then let's assign handler one first
and then handler two next and let's run
this piece of code so now it should
output handler to notice that we get
handler two now if we reverse the
handler assignment now the last handler
that is assigned is handler one so this
function should be called notice that we
get handle one so basically the handler
that is assigned last events thank you
for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
