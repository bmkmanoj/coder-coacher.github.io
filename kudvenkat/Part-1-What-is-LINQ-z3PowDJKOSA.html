this video we'll discuss what's link
benefits of using linked linked
architecture and different link
providers that are available so what's
the link link stands for language
integrated query link enables us to
query any type of data store be it
sequel server XML documents objects in
memory like list of customer list of
order arrays etc be it entities or be it
datasets why should we use link what are
the benefits of using link to understand
this let's say we are developing a
dotnet application and this dotnet
application requires to fetch data from
different data sources like databases
XML documents and from n memory objects
like list of customer list of order
arrays etc now for a developer who is
working on this application for him to
be able to fetch data from these
different data sources he has to
understand the technologies and the
syntax that is specific to the
underlying data source for example to be
able to retrieve data from a sequel
server database he needs to understand
ad or dotnet and transact sequel that is
specific to sequel server database
similarly to be able to retrieve data
from an XML document the developer has
to understand XPath and XSLT and to be
able to fetch data from n memory objects
the developer has to know how arrays and
generics work length enables us to work
with these different data sources using
a similar programming style without
having the need to know the syntax and
the technologies that are specific to
the underlying data source and another
benefit of using Lync is that it
provides intelligence and compile time
error checking as well well this is an
example of that in just a bit but before
that let's look at the architecture of
link now we all know that we can develop
a dotnet application in any dotnet
supported programming language like C
sharp VB or J sharp similarly a link
query can also be written using any of
this dotnet supported programming line
now between the actual link query and
the actual underlying data source there
is another component called link
provider and it is the responsibility of
the link provider to convert that link
query into your format that the
underlying data source can understand
let's say the application is trying to
fetch data from sequel server database
if that's the case this link query will
be fed into a link provider called link
to sequel which is going to convert that
link query into transact sequel that the
underlying sequel server database can
understand similarly if the link where e
has to fetch data from an XML document
you know the same linked query is going
to be fed into this link to XML provider
which is going to convert that link
query into X part which the underlying
XML document can understand similarly we
have different link providers like link
to objects linked to entities linked to
data set we even have third party link
providers like for example link to
Twitter so if we want to query Twitter
we can use link to Twitter similarly we
have link to Amazon link to Google etc
now let's look at an example of using
link but before that let's actually
write some ad or dotnet code and now see
what are the problems with that and then
we'll try and rewrite the same example
using length so let's flip to sequencing
or management studio so this is the
table that we'll be using for the demo
so here we have both male and female
students all we want to do is write area
dot net code to retrieve only male
students and then display them within
the grid view control and to achieve
that I have already created an MT
asp.net web application project here and
all I have done so far is within the web
config file I have a connection string
here which points to this sample
database
and I also have a webform one here where
I have dragged and dropped a grid we
control and within the code-behind file
I have brought in the required Adria
dotnet namespaces and here you see the
regular ad or net code now I'm not going
to discuss in all the specific details
of radio dotnet here because we have
already discussed that in ATO dotnet
video series so if you're new to a do
dotnet please watch videos from ato
dotnet video tutorial so what are we
doing here we are reading the connection
string from web config file and using
that connection string we are building
the sequel connection object and then
here we have the actual sequel command
that we want to be executed against
sequel server so a do dotnet and this is
the transact sequel that is specific to
sequel server database look at the query
itself the query is straightforward we
are saying select all these columns from
students table where it gender equals
male now this query is buried inside
this opaque string which means here
notice that we don't have any form of
intelligence and since we don't have
intellisense here you know this query is
error-prone meaning we can make some
spelling mistakes for example you know
instead of first-name we could very
easily misspell it it's a first name one
and you know that's the sequel query
right and then here we're constructing
list of students you know and here we
have the actual student class so this
student class is straightforward with ID
first name last name and gender
properties okay now so we are
constructing list of students here open
the connection executing the command and
then we are looping through the reader
object and while we are looking through
your creating an instance of student and
then we are retrieving data from the
reader and populating the respective
properties of the student object adding
the student of jekt to the list
closing the connection and then we are
setting that list of students as the
data source for the grid view control
and invoking data bind so let's quickly
run this and see if it
so it should be able to fetch only the
male students and that's what we see
here now since we don't have
intellisense inside this opaque string
you know it's very easy to make a
spelling mistake like that and if we do
that and look at this when we build a
solution we notice the status bar here
we don't have any compilation error okay
it says pill succeeded but when we
actually run this at run time notice
that we are going to have that error so
you know regular ad or dotnet since the
queries are buried inside opaque strings
we don't have intelligence or we don't
have compile time error checking with
link we get that as well now let's see
how to rewrite the same example using
link okay for that let's actually delete
this wave from one dot aspx and let's
add an over from one again and let's set
font family here to area
and let's drag and drop a Calitri
control okay now let's get to the
code-behind file now we need to add
another component here that's called
linked to sequel classes will discuss
link to sequel in detail in a later
video session but for now let's go ahead
and add a new item and click on the data
tab under install the template select
link to sequel classes and let's call
this sample dot DB ml and click Add ok
so now let's open the silver Explorer so
using this we are going to connect to
actual sequel server database from
Visual Studio and right click on data
connections and select this option add
connection so here specify your server
name I'm working with you know local
installation of sequel server here so I
can specify dot and then here we should
be able to see the list of databases
that are available or you can also give
the name of the server here the name of
sequel server on my machine it is meant
at - PC and I'm going to use Windows
authentication to connect to that sequel
server and we want to work with sample
database
ok so that should add a connection to
sequel server from visual studio and
then once we expand tables we should be
able to see the students table so now we
are going to drag and drop the student
table onto this designer surface which
is going to generate you know student
class for us ok so within the sample dot
designer dot CS file we should see a
class for student now we are not going
to get into the specifics of link to
sequel here we'll discuss that in detail
in a later video session so all we have
done so far is generated a class for
student table ok and then within our
code behind file we are going to write a
link very now another thing that we need
to understand here is in addition to
the actual student class we also have
something called sample data context
here so this is the gateway into the
database so we have to create an
instance of the sample data context
class in order to be able to retrieve
data from the sample database okay so
the first thing that we need to do
within the code-behind file is to create
an instance of that class sample data
context let's call this data context
equals new sample data context now what
we want to do is retrieve data from
sequel server database using a link
query okay so and whatever that link
query is going to return we are going to
set that as the data source for the
gridview control okay so with the link
query we first write the from keyword so
from okay and then we specify name of a
variable here let's call it student okay
n now we specify our actual source where
are the students present now students
are present in this data context so data
context dot students okay and now we
don't want all the students if we want
all the students we can simply say
select student okay and then when we say
grid v1 dot data bind so when we run
this we should get all the students
because we are not filtering them so we
have all the male and female students
okay now if we want to filter them we
use a ver keyword so where student dot
gender equals we only want male
employees okay so this query this link
very right here should return male
employees that are present in students
table so let's quickly learn this and
see if that's what is the output that we
get so notice that we only get male
students and again notice that here we
have Intel
cents as well the moment I say student
dot it shows all the properties of the
student object okay now if I misspell
for example gender to gender one and
then if I try to build the solution
notice that we'll get to know about that
at the compile time itself so we have
you know intellisense and compile time
error checking okay but with ATO dotnet
we don't have that because the queries
are buried inside that opaque strings we
don't have intelligence and as a result
of that we don't have compile time error
checking as well alright and another
thing to notice is so this is a link
very now we want this query to be able
to retrieve data from underlying sequel
server database but can sequel server
understand this link very now sequel
server can only understand transact
sequel so there has to be someone in
between who is going to convert this
link query into transact sequel that the
underlying database can understand and
who is that going to be that is what is
the link providers job so link to sequel
is going to take that link very convert
that into transact sequel and send it to
sequel server database and to prove that
you can actually fire up sequel profile
ax and then run the application and see
the corresponding transact sequel query
that is generated so let's run a trace
and then let's go ahead and run this so
now when we go to sequel profile ax stop
the trace notice that this is what is
they transact sequel that is generated
so here we have some dynamic sequel that
is generated by link to sequel provider
so when we execute this query we should
only get male employees right so we have
looked at the same example okay
now you know we have seen how to write a
linked query to work with you know
databases now let's say for example you
know I want to work with in memory
objects like an array for example let's
say I have an integer array here so in
detail array let's call it numbers
equals let's say one to ten numbers and
to just speed things up I have already
typed those numbers so let's copy and
paste it right there so we have numbers
from 1 to 10 now out of these numbers I
want to retrieve even numbers and then
display them within the grid view
control ok again to achieve that we can
use link query ok so let's comment this
so this one right here is linked to see
file because this is going to work with
link to sequel provider and then convert
that into a transaction now let's see
how to work with objects in memory using
link very so the same idea accurate v1
dot data source is going to be so we
first write the from keyword and let's
give this analyze from number n so what
is the data source here numbers you know
the array that is an in-memory object
now what we want we want only in our
even numbers so I'm going to say we're
number mod 2 equals 0 so if we divide a
number by 2 and of the reminder is 0
then we know for sure it's an even
number so that's what is the condition
that we are specifying next to the vert
operator and then what we want to do if
that is true then we want to select such
kind of a number and this is you know
this logic is going to be applied on
every number within this object numbers
which is an array of numbers okay and
then simply invoke data bind so now when
we run this we should actually say only
the even numbers within the grid we
control 2 4 6 8 10
now look at this within the example that
we have looked at
so far bit worked with different data
sources one data source here is transact
sequel server database and the other
data source is in memory objects but the
LINQ query is pretty much similar locate
depending on the data source it's not
going to change that much it is the
actual sequel provider that is going to
convert that link query into a syntax
that is specific to the underlying data
source that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
