am venket this is part 23 of asp.net
grid-view tutorial in this video we'll
discuss about inserting updating and
deleting data from grid view using
sequel data source control basically we
want to do all the crud operations you
know we want to be able to select data
from a table and display that within the
grid view control we want to edit delete
and then we also want to insert records
into a database table using this grid
view control and if you notice we are
actually using the footer of the grid
view control to perform insert operation
okay and also notice that we want to
validate data while we insert and edit
data so when I am inserting you know we
don't want to allow users to be
submitting you know blank name gender or
City the same is the case when we are
editing data for this demo we'll be
using TBL employee table so let's flip
to visual studio drag and drop a grid
view control onto the waveform let's
sort of format that let's choose brown
sugar theme let's drag and drop sequel
data source control onto the webform
let's configure this let's choose our
connection string from web config file
click Next select TBL employee table we
want to select all the rows so select
star from TBL employee click on the
Advanced tab click on generate insert
update and delete check box because we
want to enable editing updating and
deleting on the grid view control click
OK click Next test your query click
finish now let's associate this could be
controlled with signal data source
control since we have you know edit and
delete statements you know we have these
options enable you know enable editing
enable deleting so we have edit and
delete buttons okay
so that should enable editing and
deleting now if you look at the slide we
are using the footer control of the grid
view to actually perform insert
operation so we need to display the
footer control and to do that by default
you know the footer is not visible so go
to the properties of the grid view
control and there is a property called
show footer simply set that to true and
we will have the footer visible
okay now look at this you know we have
this link button insert link button
within the employee ID column
whereas text box control within the name
column you know a drop-down list within
gender so basically if I want to include
these controls you know in these columns
of the grid view control now I need to
convert these columns into template
fields by default you know the grid view
control has generated bound fields you
know this employee ID name gender and
City by default these are bound fields
now if I have to include a footer
template so that I can include these
link buttons and other controls then I
need to convert these bound cells into
template files and there are two ways to
do that we can change the HTML directly
here or we can use the designer you know
that's an easier option so let me select
on the a no click on grid view task and
then click on the Edit columns link and
then from the selected fields you know
click on employee ID column I want to
convert this into bones I mean a
template fear so click on this link and
with this filled into a template fear
which should automatically convert that
bound field into a template fear and do
the same thing with name gender and city
as well so that should automatically
convert this for you know bound fields
into template field so if I flip the
webform now to the design you know
source mode look at that everything is
now converted into a template real okay
but then you know obviously if you look
at this gender bound field you know we
don't want to display text box control
as the editing interface we want a
drop-down list control as the editing
interface so what we need to do is
replace the text box control with a
drop-down list control so I'm going to
get rid of that go to the tool box drag
and drop a drop-down list control and
then obviously we need three items
within this drop-down list what are they
select the gender male and female those
are the three things that we need to
display so let's in a format that
properly plus control K and D all right
and then obviously when I put this row
in edit mode
I want the gender of that person to be
selected within the drop-down list by
default and to do that we need to set
the selected value property so selected
value is equal to
whatever is being returned by this bind
method okay so let's actually copy that
and paste it right there
okay let's copy this and paste it okay
all right so at this time we should have
editing functionality working as
expected now what else we need to do we
need to include you know the link button
within the footer of every car you know
link button within the footer of
employee ID column you know along the
same lines text box gender and city
within the respective footers of those
columns so now when we click Edit here
look at that I have drop-down list here
and look at the values they get properly
selected as well okay
so within the footer control let's
include the link button so obviously we
want the link button in employee ID
column of the grid view control so
employee ID column is this one so here
within that template field let's include
a footer template let's drag and drop a
link button there and let's give it a
meaningful name link button insert and
then we want the text on that link
button as insert okay so now if I flip
this waveform look at that I get the
link button next we need a text box
control a drop-down list and a text box
control so let's flip this again to the
source mode let's actually get to you
know the name bound field so this is the
name template field and then within here
we need to have a footer template and we
need a text box control
so let's drag and drop a text box
control and then let's give it a
meaningful name
txt name and we want the same thing for
CT as well so let's keep gender for now
because we need a drop-down list within
the gender so we will come back to that
so let's go to City and then paste it
there and let's give this a meaningful
name let's call this txt City and within
the footer template of gender we need a
drop-down list
so let's drag and drop a drop-down list
there actually we can copy and paste
this okay but we don't want any you know
value to be selected within the
drop-down list when we insert a row
because everything will be blank if you
look at the slide you know it's a new
row so select gender will be selected by
default and then the user needs to
select the gender of the person when he
is inserting so we don't want anything
to be selected so I'm going to get rid
of that property there okay so at this
point we should get the interface you
know the insert employee interface so we
get that so gender we have them you know
all we need to do is when I click insert
we need to insert that into the database
table but before that let's take care of
validations look at this we want to
validate data of and inserting and
editing so we need some validation
controls required field validator
controls and so obviously when editing
you know obviously employee ID is not
editable so we need we don't need any
validation control there but name is
editable so we need a validation control
there so let's I mean just to speed
things up I have you know a required
field value data here configured with
all the properties I just explained
those properties let's format this
properly control kd2 format that alright
so required field value data so I've
given it a meaningful name rfv required
field value data edit name is the ID
then it is equal to server error message
name is a required fear control to
validate we want to validate this text
box one okay and text this asterik for
color I want a red color you know so
that's why we have set it to red so this
is when editing you know an employee's
record but when I am inserting an
employee's record then we have a text
box here so we need to validate this as
well so I'm just going to paste that
there so required field value data and
I'm going to call this you know give it
a different ID you cannot have two
controls with the same ID so since this
is for validating when we are inserting
a new employee so I'm going to call this
rfv
insert name okay so done it is equal to
server name is a required field control
to validate it's going to be txt name
okay so let's put it there and text for
color alright next we need to validate
you know the gender when editing we want
to make sure that effort you know the
user has selected gender from the
drop-down list except select gender you
need to select either male or female
okay so let's put that there so RFA this
is going to be edit gender okay because
this is within the Edit item template
this template will be used when we are
editing a row okay and obviously this is
gender so the error message is going to
be gender is a required field and we are
validating drop-down list one so that's
the control to validate text is equal to
star for color is equal to red there's
one more property that we have to set
when we are validating you know
selections within the drop-down list
that is initial value so what's the
initial value going to be within the
drop-down list its select gender if
somebody selects select gender from the
drop-down then we know for sure that's
not a valid gender so that's the initial
value and we want to do the same thing
when we are inserting data so obviously
we need to have a footer template so
within the footer template we need to
have this validation control so let's
paste it right there so we are actually
again here there's a problem because
look at this drop-down list the ID is
drop-down list one here it's drop-down
list one so let's give this a meaningful
name DDL gender because we cannot have
two drop-down list controls with this is
you know two controls with the same ID
alright so here let's change the ID of
the required field validator let's
actually call this RF a required field
validator insert gender okay done it is
equal zero server error message gender
is a required field and the control to
validate is DDL gender so let's put it
there
texts a strike for color red
initial-value select gender finally we
have to do that for City so let's copy
and paste that there let's copy the
required field value data from name and
then use it for city but we have to
change the IDs
so let's paste it right here and
required field value data this is going
to be edit City so let's give that
meaningful name there edit City when it
is equal to server error message city is
a required field control to validate we
want to validate text box three so let's
set that as the control to validate text
Asterix for color red and then let's
copy and paste this finally in the
footer template so this one is going to
be rfv required field value data insert
city when it is equal to server error
message cities that required field
control to validate the XD city so most
of it is actually copy paste you know
text a strict for color red so we are
done and finally we also need a
validation summary control because look
at this
you know those asterisks you know
symbols are displayed next to the
controls where the validations have
failed but detailed error messages are
displayed in the validation summary
control so I'm going to drag and drop a
validation summary control next to the
grid view control so let's put a
validation summary control and again
within validation summary control we
want the error messages to be in red
color so let's set for color to red so
with those changes let's run this now so
at this time we should have validations
in place while editing as well as while
inserting so I click at it look at that
i blank out name and then I click update
I get this name required which is as
expected but look at this you know the
validation controls that are present
with an insert are also for head we
didn't expect that to happen because I
am editing a row no I'm
dating a row only these validation
control should be fired if I select
gender and try to update look at that I
get that again I remove that so total a
you know when I am clicking update only
these set of validation control should
fire whereas when I click insert the set
of validation control should fire so
basically whether I click insert or
update look at that all of them are
fired which is not working as expected
so basically we need to group this
insert button with these set of
validation controls that I have within
the footer okay and the Update button
should be linked with these set of
controls that we have within that row
when I am editing that okay so let's
actually group this insert button with
these validation controls and to do that
we can make use of validation groups we
discussed about validation groups in
detail in asp.net video tutorial so
please check those videos right so let's
use validation group and then group you
know the link button that's there here
and then these validation controls and
then we also need to associate that to a
validation summary control so let's do
that now so within the footer template I
have this link button so link but every
you know this link button has got a
property called validation group I am
going to set that to insert and I'm
going to use the same group name for all
the validation controls that are present
within the footer control okay so for
the validation control here I'm going to
set the same group so that's for name
and this is going to be for gender
required field validator and finally for
City okay and then we need to set that
for validation summary control as well
okay but then we will have another
problem now but it's easy to fix okay so
now I click insert look at that I get
the error messages as expected I click
Edit and then let's blank that row and
then I try to click update look at that
I don't get the validation summary
information here but I get those little
asterisk symbols indicating that there
is a problem on the other hand other
hand look at this when I click insert
look at this only these three validation
controls are fired and and the respect
to detail their messages are displayed
here but then that doesn't happen when I
do you know when I click this Update
button why because we don't have a
validation summary control to display
those validation error messages because
remember we have changed the validation
group name of this validation summary
control so now this validation summary
control will only be used with
validation controls that are present in
the footer okay so let's have another
validation summary control and knock off
the group so it's going to work with the
you know rest of the validation controls
while we update the data so when now
when I run this you know the validation
should work as expected so I click Edit
let's blank this out and let's try to
click update
look at that it's working and look at
that it's working as expected
so I cancel that I click insert you know
everything working as expected now all
that is left out is when I click this
insert button we need to insert you know
whatever row information that I enter
here into the database table using this
grid view interface so let's see how to
do that obviously that should happen
when I click this link button insert
which is present in the footer template
of employee ID template field so let's
go to the footer template so this is the
link button and if you look at the ID
this elbe insert and let's generate the
even handler the click event handler for
that one since this is a link button I'm
going to say link button lb insert is
equal to new link button so lb insert
click plus equals so that's the event
handler so let's copy okay now instead
of hooking it dynamically since we
already have a link button there I'm
going to use this even handler method
and specify that within
put a template you know using the on
click attribute so on click what we want
to do we want to call that method lb
insert underscore click within the
code-behind file so obviously what we
have to do here are write code to insert
row into the database table okay so
obviously what we need to do when we
click this insert is basically retrieve
the name gender and city values and then
give it to you know insert parameters of
sequel data source control
remember when we were configuring sequel
data source control we generated you
know we check that check box generate
insert update and delete statements so
that has generated these statements I
mean delete command select command
update command and insert commands and
along with that we also have insert
parameters for example so if you look at
this insert command insert into TBL
employee name gender city for these
three columns we want to supply values
to these three parameters because this a
parameterised query and so obviously if
you look at the parameter names they are
named gender and city we need to supply
those values to these parameters okay
and then we can use that sequel data
source one control to do the insert for
us okay so let's see how to retrieve the
value so where these values for those
parameters are coming from from these
text boxes and a drop-down lists that
are present within the footer control
okay so these are the parent insert
parameters of sequel datasource one
control so I'm going to say a sequel
datasource one dot insert parameters and
this is a collection so you can you know
retrieve a parameter by ID or by name
okay so I can use the name one of the
you know one of the parameters is name
so where do I get the value for this
parameter so the value for this is going
to come from the grid view control you
know within the footer of this grid view
control we have this text box control so
we need to retrieve it from there so to
do that we have to use you know little
bit of code here so grid v1 dot footer
control I mean footer row so with
in the footer row we need to find a
control so if you remember with in the
footer control we have given you no
meaningful IDs for example to retrieve
the name we need to use so within the
footer control there is a textbox with
name txt name that's going to store the
value that we type in so we need to
retrieve it from that textbox
txt name is the ID of the textbox
control so we have to say find control
with name txt text box so let's copy
that and paste that within the find
control method and notice this find
control method this is actually going to
return an object you know a control back
but what are we expecting out of it a
textbox so let's type guess that to be
of type text box and then use the text
property to retrieve whatever value that
is present within that so it's as simple
as that so let me get this in two lines
so we can see it so all we are doing
here is we are populating we are setting
a value for the insert and name
parameter and we have to do the same
thing for gender and city so sequel
datasource one insert parameters you
know the second parameter is going to be
gender where is gender going to coming
from gender is coming from DDL gender
drop-down list
okay and that's a drop-down list so I
need to typecast that to be of type
drop-down list and drop-down list has
the selected value property to retrieve
you know whatever value that the user
has selected and finally what we need to
do we need to set the parameter value
for City so let's do the same thing here
the name of the parameter is city and
it's going to be a text box oh and it's
called
txt city is the name of the control and
that's a text box control so that's it
so we have set the values for parameters
finally there's one more thing that we
need to do the sequel data source
control has got a method called insert
so when you call this method that's when
the sequel data source control
take these parameters and then execute
the insert command so the sequel data
source control has got an insert command
so that will be executed when we call
that insert method on the sequel
datasource one control this is the
insert statement all right so that's all
there to it
so let's run this now we should see it
working as expected so we should be able
to you know edit data so I want to
change Mary to maybe Mary three and her
gender from male to female
okay from New York to NY and update that
so that works as expected now if I want
to insert a new employee let's call Jane
female and let's say Sidney let's insert
look at that that gets inserted and just
to make sure it's inserted within the
database table you see that it's right
there okay and obviously validations are
working as expected as well okay so in
this video we have basically discussed
about all the database credits using a
grid view selection insertion updation
and deletion okay
in our next video we'll discuss about
doing exactly the same thing but using
object data source control on the slide
