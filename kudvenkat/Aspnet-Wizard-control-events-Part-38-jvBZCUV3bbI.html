am venket this is part 38 of asp.net
video series in this session we'll
discuss about the asp.net Wizard control
events before continuing with the
session I strongly recommend to watch
parts 35 36 and 37 of this video series
let's flip to visual studio drag and
drop the facade control onto the web
form we know that exact control is a
collection of rosada steps by default we
get three Vizard steps let's copy and
paste this to get the third wizard step
and let's get rid of this ID property
and change the step title the step three
let's flip to the design mode and let's
go to the properties of the wizard
control by right-clicking on that and
select properties and to view the list
of even supported by the wizard control
click on the events icon the first demon
that we will examine today is the active
step changed event this even gets fired
whenever the active step of the desired
control is changed and to change the
active step of the wizard control you
can do that by clicking on this
navigation buttons next previous etc or
by clicking on the sidebar buttons to
generate the even handler for this
active step change the event double
click on the text box there which will
generate the even handler now let's say
all I want to do here is to print the
active step index of the wizard control
to do that response dot write and I want
to print a message saying that active
step change to two okay now how do I get
the active step of the wizard control
wizard one dot there is a property
called active step index and this is an
integer property and obviously if I want
to print that I need to convert that to
string using the two string method so
now when we run this and whenever we
change the active step index of the
wizard control by clicking on the
navigation buttons of the side bar
buttons you know that message will be
printed active step change it to one
active step change it to two and
remember this is a zero based index
collection that's why when I am on step
two I'm in step three it actually shows
the step index
- when I am on step one it shows the
step index is zero
alright the next even that we will
examine today is the cancel button click
event now by default the wizard control
will not show the cancel button for the
cancel button to be displayed flip to
the properties page and then there is a
property called display cancel button
which is false by default turn that to
true
okay now this cancel button click is
fired whenever somebody clicks that
cancel button now if somebody clicks
that cancel button and if you want to do
some server-side processing that's when
you will make use of this event handler
double click to generate the event
handler and all I want to do here is
print a message saying that cancel
button click OK
so when we run this and then when we
click the cancel button as you might
expect that message cancel button click
be fired and remember this cancel button
is shown on every step of the wizard
control so you click that cancel button
on any step you will you'll have that
message okay now remember if you just
want to navigate away from the wizard
control maybe to another page or to an
external side then you can simply do
that using a property called cancel that
destination page URL that the page URL
where you want to go to when somebody
clicks that cancel button ok so if your
intention is to just navigate to another
page within your application or to an
external site you don't really need an
even handler a server-side event handler
to do that you can just do that using
this cancel destination page URL
property alright so the next even that
we will look at today is the next button
click event handler before we'll talk
about the finish button click in just a
bit but first let's look at next button
click event obviously as you might
expect this even gets fired
whenever somebody clicks the next button
ok let's generate the event handler and
the important thing to notice here
is the type of object that's coming into
the event handler method Buzard
navigation even documents okay
the this object exposes current step
index and the next step index properties
okay so if you ever want to do some
processing based on the current step
index or the next step index you know
you can make use of this object okay now
let's say all I want to do is I want to
print the current step index number and
the next step index number whenever
somebody clicks this button so a dot
current step index and just to indicate
that it is the current step index let's
put that there and since this is an
integer we need to convert that to
string and let's put an HTML break there
so that it comes in its own line okay
let's copy-paste that and change this to
next step index okay and another thing
to notice as far as this Wizard
navigation event arguments object is
concerned there's another property a
cancel property and if you look at the
intellisense it's a boolean property
meaning it expects a true or a false now
look at the look at what intellisense
States here it gets or sets a value
indicating whether it gets or sets a
value indicating whether the navigation
to the next step in the wizard should be
canceled so if you set this property to
true then it wouldn't allow us to
navigate to the next step in the wizard
control okay so edad cancel is equal to
true if I said that to true I wouldn't
be able to go to the next step let me
run this and see what actually happens
so the page loads and then when I click
that so currently I am on step one of
the wizard control when I click this
next look at that okay current step is
equal to zero next step is equal to one
but then I am still non step one why is
that because you have said e dot cancel
is equal to true
that's not loving you to move to the
next step in the wizard control so if
for any reason you want to prevent the
user from moving to the next step maybe
because he didn't fill in a required
feel so you don't want to allow him to
go to the next step of the wizard
control unless and until you do that and
you know he does that then you can make
use of that property so there are
variety of real time scenarios where you
can actually make use of that event okay
so let's do this programmatically let's
say on step one instead of always
disabling the in a movement to the next
step let's drag and drop a checkbox
control onto the webform and let's call
this checkbox cancel and then let's say
cancel navigation is the text so if
somebody checks this checkbox this one
step one of the resort control so if
somebody checks this checkbox and then
when they click the next button they
shouldn't be allowed to go to the next
step but whereas if they don't check it
then they can go to the next step so if
I want to programmatically do that I can
say if checkbox dot cancel I mean check
box cancel door checked if that is
checked then e dot cancel is equal to
true okay you can either do this or you
can simply say u dot cancel is equal to
checkbox one check box cancelled or
check because checkbox cancel dot
checked returns a boolean property okay
it true if it is checked a false if it
is not checked if it is checked we don't
want to go to the next step so u dot
cancel will be true in that case and
will not be allowed to move to the next
step so let's go ahead and run this at
this time and then when I select cancel
navigation and click the next button
look at that current step index is zero
the next step index is going to be one
but if I uncheck that and then when I
click that I am moving to the next
okay so let's look at the finish button
click as you might expect the name
states this event is fired
whenever somebody clicks the finish
button on the final step of the facade
control double-click to generate the
event handler and look at the object
it's the same object so on the finish
button as button click as well you'll
have access to the current step and the
next step okay let's copy that paste it
there and when I run that and when we
actually move to the final step of the
wizard control look at that the let's
click the finish button once again the
current step index is 2 and the next
step index is also 2 because that's the
last step we don't have any more steps
that's why current step index and the
next step index are the same there
okay and previous button click as you
might expect this event is fired
whenever somebody clicks the previous
button on the wizard control and if I
double click to generate the event
handler look at that you again have
access to the current step index and the
next step index and if you want to
cancel the navigation to a previous step
you can do that using the cancel
property e dot cancel and sidebar button
click whenever somebody clicks the side
bar buttons any of these buttons then
this even gets fired and again you have
the same object here and access to the
same properties okay so those are the
different events of the wizard control
and pre-render event this event is fired
just before the wizard control is
rendered on this slide you can find

server interview questions that's it for
today thank you for listening have a
