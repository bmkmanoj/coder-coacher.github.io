am venket this is part 6 of video dotnet
video series in this session we'll learn
about preventing sequel injection using
parametrized queries and stored
procedures will also learn about
executing stored procedures and
parameterize queries using the ADA
dotnet command object before continuing
with the session I strongly recommend to
watch parts three four and five of this
video series so in part 5 of this video
series we have seen how sequel injection
can actually happen so let's quickly
recap what we have seen in part 5 so I
have a very simple application where we
have a text box button and the gridview
control so if you look at the source for
this waveform you can see that we have a
text box a button control and the grid
view control and then when we click this
button control we have this code in the
code-behind file before we examine what
this code is doing let us see what
actually this application is trying to
do in the database I have a table called
TBL product inventory which has got
lists of products okay now these are the
products that will be shown in this the
grid view control now if a user enters
the first one two or three characters of
a product and then when he clicks get
products we want to list all the
products which start with those letters
in this case he has entered IP so we are
listing all the products that start with
IP iPhone and iPads in this case so to
achieve that we have this code so
connection string we are reading the
connection string from web config file
using the configuration manager class so
if you look at web config file we have
the connection string there the name of
the connection string is DB CS so we are
reading the connection string and using
that connection string we are actually
building the sequel connection object
and then we are building the sequel
command object and look at the way we
are building the sequel command object
we have this hard-coded string select
star from TBL product inventory where
product name like and then to this
hard-coded string we are concatenated
whatever the user types into this
particular textbox
okay so this is dangerous and this is
what is opening the doors for sequel
injection attack to happen and in this
session we are going to look at how to
prevent sequel injection okay and so
obviously what's going to happen if the
user types you know the IP he's a good
user he just wants to use your
application so he typed the IP and then
click get products and he'll you see the
products here you know the application
works as expected without any problem
but on the other hand here a malicious
user types in something like this you
know what is going to happen if he typed
something like this this is going to be
dynamically concatenated to this
particular string you know as a result
of which we get a query like this that
you can see here you know select star
from TBL product inventory where product
name like so this is treated as one
query and then this is treated as
another query they lead from TBL product
inventory so we are able to inject
sequel into this text box which then is
actually used to build the queries by
concatenating that and then we execute
those queries on the database you know
obviously these will be executed as
separate queries and we have the sequel
injection attack happening here and to
prevent this we can use a parameterised
queries or stored procedures so first
let let's see how to actually use
parameterised queries okay so to use
parameterised queries what we have to do
is the first thing we have to change the
way we are forming the command okay we
don't want to be concatenated strings
like this which is dangerous which in
fact opens the doors for sequel
injection attack so what I'm going to do
here is select star from TBL product
inventory where product name like I'm
going to use a parameter here product
name we know that parameters in sequel
server start with at symbol so at
product name that's the name of my
parameter for this query and then I'm
getting rid of everything else there
so that's my command okay and it has got
one parameter there now okay so we are
using a parameterize to query here but
then we have to supply the value for
this parameter so how do we supply the
value for that parameter to supply the
value for the parameter first of all we
need to associate a parameter I mean to
this parameter we need to supply a value
okay and to do that we can actually use
the command objects parameters
collection so parameters dot add now if
you look at that
there are several overloaded you know
versions of the Sadd method you have one
method which takes a sequel parameter
object or you can just pass the name of
the parameter and the data type you know
there are several overloaded versions
like this instead of using that I'm
going to use another method called add
with value where you will have to just
specify the name of the parameter and
the value that you want to pass for that
parameter here the name of the parameter
is set product name so I'm going to copy
that
so at product name and I want to pass
the value and where is the value coming
from the value is coming from textbox
one so text box one dot text okay so
that's it we're done so we have used a
parameterize to query and for this
parameter we need to supply a value and
to do that we are using this add with
value method of the parameters
collection property of the command
object okay and this once you know
simple change that we have to do for
this you know we have to append to this
one the percentage symbol the wildcard
because we are doing a comparison using
like operator select star from TBL
product inventory where product name
like if the user enters IP into the
textbox it will be IP percentage okay
so we have the command you know the
sequel command which is using now a
parameterize query and a value for that
parameter is now added okay
so now let's go ahead and run this and
see what's going to happen so after we
run this you know we should be presented
with the grid view control and the
button and the text box where we can
enter the product name let's say we want
to list all the products that start with
IP click get products and I see the
products here as expected okay now let's
try to inject sequel and see what's
going to happen now to inject the sequel
you know this is what I have it ready
here so let's copy that
and inject that into the text box so now
what's going to happen this entire value
will be treated you know as the value
for this parameter okay so it's not
going to be treated as separate sequel
statement because if you look at the way
we formed our sequel statement we used a
parametrized query we are not
dynamically concatenate in the strings
so whatever text that the user has typed
into this text box will now be treated
as a value for this parameter at product
name okay because of which now we don't
have any product that starts with this
name okay so this entire value is
treated as a value for product at
product name parameter and we don't have
any product in our database table that
starts with this name so obviously the
grid view will be empty but whereas now
if you go to the table and look at that
our data will still be there it's just
that when we executed that query you
know we didn't have any products that
actually started with that this is the
value with this name this entire thing
which user injected into the text box
you know is treated as a value for that
product name parameter in fact we can
see that actually to see that what you
can do you can actually start a sequel
profiler tool so and to start the sequel
profiler you can go to sequel server
management studio go into tools and
click on sequel profiler okay sequel
profiler once the sequel profiler tool
opens
you can click on this start select a
trace button okay so what happens now
any query that comes to the sequel
server for execution that will be logged
in this tool will talk about sequel
profiler tool in a later session you
know this can be used for
troubleshooting various things you know
as far as sequel server is concerned
okay so now let's execute that let's
click this button once again so when I
click this button you know a query will
be sent to the database to look at what
query is sent to the database let's say
look at that this is the query that's
actually sent to the database so if you
copy and paste that into sequel server
management studio look at that it's
using a system stored procedure called
SP underscore execute sequel to execute
an SQL statement and if you look at the
SQL statement that's getting executed we
have select star from TBL product
inventory where product name like look
at this like at product name that's the
parameter that we have passed in and the
value for the parameter look at this
this entire stuff that we triped into
the textbox is now treated as a value
for the parameter and if you look at
what we typed into the text box look at
this this is what we typed into the text
box now we use this I P and then maybe
the single quote okay now what happened
that single quote is escaped by sequel
server automatically okay so so
basically what's happening here is that
the value that we type the text that we
type into the text box is now treated as
a value for that parameter instead of
treating that as a separate command okay
it was treated as separate command when
we were dynamically building strings and
we have seen that in part five of this
video series okay so that's why it's
preventing sequel injection attack so
all we have to do is instead of building
the commands dynamically use
parameterize queries okay another way
obviously to solve this is to use stored
procedures so now let's see how to use
tool procedures to solve sequel
Injection so obviously if we want to use
stored procedures the first thing that
we want to do is to write a stored
procedure which can list all the
products okay so obviously I have a
stored procedure here which is taking
one parameter at a product name and then
when we pass in the value for that
parameter you know something like IP
what it's going to do it's going to
select all the rows from TBL product
inventory where product name starts with
that you know input whatever we have
provided for this parameter all right so
let's create this stored procedure
execute that command completed
successfully let's quickly test if the
stored procedure is working as expected
so if I pass in IP and semi-cool
percentage symbol press f5 I get all the
products that starts with letters IP as
expected now what we want to do we want
to call the stored procedure from our
dotnet application and obviously to do
that
there are simple modifications that you
will have to do for this code okay so
the first thing that we have to do is we
want to call the stored procedure so
copy the name of the stored procedure
and then into the command object instead
of saying okay I want to execute this
command I'm going to say okay this is
the command that I want to execute
locate the name of the stored procedure
and then the next most important thing
that we have to tell is we have to tell
the command object that it's executing a
stored procedure and not a transact
sequel statement and how do we tell that
using command type property so there is
a property called command type okay and
what is the value for that property
there is an enumerator system dot data
dot command type in numerator and here
we are using this tool procedure so I
select stored procedure there so that's
how we tell the command object that it's
executing a stored procedure and not an
ad-hoc sequel statement okay and the
obvious next thing is to provide the
parameter value that this stored
procedure is expecting so the stored
procedure has a parameter called at
product name so we want to supply a
you for that so add product name is the
parameter and the value of basely is
coming from the textbox and to that we
are concatenate in this percentage
symbol because we are using the like
operator and we want to use this
wildcard and that's it that's those are
the only changes that we have to do if
at all if we want to a command object to
be executing a stored procedure on the
sequel server database okay so now let's
run this and say the output so ctrl f5
now we are executing a stored procedure
instead of an ad-hoc sequel statement
okay so I type in IP click get products
and we should have the products listed
as expected and obviously if we try to
inject the sequel there then we should
get I mean the data shouldn't be wiped
out the entire value I mean whatever
text that we are typing here should be
treated as the value for that parameter
at product name in this case okay so
let's click the button and actually
let's stop this trace let's clear that
and start the trace again and see what
actually comes to the sequel server for
execution so we are now executing a
stored procedure so get products look at
that so so this is the delete from TBL
product inventory yep so if you look at
this this is what is coming to the
stored procedure ok now when we click
the button on the UI and we click this
button on the UI this is what is the
command that's coming to the sequel
server execute this stored procedure as
we get products by name which has got
this parameter and look at this this
entire thing what you inject it into the
textbox is now treated as a value for
this parameter so obviously it's not
going to be treated as separate
red statements you know and we don't
have sequel injection anymore okay
that's why the conclusion is that
anytime you want to execute some sequel
commands don't ever concatenate them you
know you know by typing it by
concatenating the strings that the user
has entered into the textbox you know
that is the major reason why sequel
injection attacks can happen and to
prevent sequel injection attacks the
best way to do you know to execute
queries is to use parameterize queries
or stored procedures and this is exactly
what's happening you know if the user if
we are using stored procedures or
parameterize queries if it's a stored
procedure look at that you know whatever
we type into the text box that entire
thing is treated as a value for that at
product name parameter whereas if it's a
parameterised query you know again this
this thing is treated whatever we type
into the textbox is treated as a value
for that product name the same in both
the cases it's just that when we use
parameterize queries sequel server is
using SP underscore execute sequel
system stored procedure to execute that
sequel whereas here it's using the
execute statement to execute the stored
procedure itself that we have defined on
this slide you can find resources for
asp.net c-sharp and sequel server
interview questions that's it for today
