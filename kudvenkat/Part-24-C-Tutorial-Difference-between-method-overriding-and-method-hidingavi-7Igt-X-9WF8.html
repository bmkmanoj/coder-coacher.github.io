blanket this is part 24 method
overriding versus method hiding in this
session we'll find the difference
between method overriding and method
hiding let's look at an example in this
example you can see we have a base class
which is got a print method which just
prints a message console saying I am a
base class printer now I'm going to have
another method another class public
class derived class and this class is
going to inherit from the base class and
this class is also going to have a print
method and in the previous session we
have seen polymorphism where a base
class reference variable can invoke a
derived class object at runtime okay if
you haven't watched the video on
polymorphism I would strongly encourage
you to do so before watching this
session so what I'm going to do here is
in the base class method I'm going to
mark this as virtual so once you mark a
method as virtual in the base class it
indicates to the chain the classes that
any tailed class which is inheriting
this virtual method can actually
override and change the definition of
print method so I can go ahead and
override this so this is overriding
we are overriding the implementation of
the base print method in the child class
okay now if I go ahead and create a base
class reference variable and to this
base class reference variable instead of
assigning the base class object what we
are going to do is we are going to
assign derived class object and from the
inheritance session we knew that a base
class reference variable can point to a
derived class object if you haven't
watched that inheritance video I would
encourage you to do so alright so we
have the base class reference variable
now when I say be dot print and
keep in mind this do the reference
variable is of type based class it's
actually pointing to a child class
object and from polymorphism session we
know that a base class reference
variable pointing to a child class
object at runtime the base class
reference variable will figure out what
type of object is there and if that
object has overridden the virtual method
then the overridden version will be
called so if I go ahead and run this so
look at what's going to happen I'm a
base class print method that's wrong I
mean that's correct in a way actually we
haven't changed you know the text here
so let's change that
since we are overriding that the derived
class we will say I'm a derived class
print method so obviously now if we go
ahead and run this you should see a
message on the screen
I am a derived class print method okay
so what will in your base class derived
overriding your derived class and in the
main method you create a base class
reference variable which points to a
derived class object and at runtime the
overridden print method will be called
in spite of the reference variable being
of type base class that's basically
overriding a method so if you look at
the slide so this is that program so in
method overriding a base class reference
variable a base class reference variable
B pointing to a derived class object
will invoke the overridden method in the
child class so that's what does method
overriding but let's look at method
hiding how do we hide a method to hide a
method you use the new keyword we have
seen this in the previous session right
okay so when we use this new keyword
what's going to happen this derived
class is actually hiding the base class
okay now look at this in the main method
what are we doing we are not changing
the code in the main method the base
class reference variable is still
pointing to a derived class object
but since the variable is of type based
class okay the base class print method
will be called in this case so if a base
class reference variable is pointing to
a child class out of the child class has
hidden the base class print method the
base class method itself will be called
so that's method hiding if you have
hidden a method so if we go ahead and
run this so I am a base class print
method do the child class has hidden
that since the reference variable is of
type base class we actually end up
calling the base class method that's
basically the reference if we go back to
the slides the only difference between
this code and the school is here we have
override here we have new this is method
overriding this is method hiding and
rest of the code is exactly similar the
only difference is and if you have
overridden the method a base class
reference variable pointing to a derived
class object will end up calling the
overridden child class method whereas in
method hiding a base class reference
variable pointing to a child class
object the lin book the hidden method in
the base class that's basically the
difference and that's what is exactly
happening here okay on this slide you
can find additional resources for
c-sharp and asp.net interview questions
and before we actually wind up I would
also like to show you this on the other
hand if I want to invoke the derived
class method and it's actually hiding
the base class method then what I need
to do is derive the class D is equal to
new derived class if I go ahead and do
this then I will end up invoking that
derived class print method so if I go
ahead and run that you know the second
print here
called the derived class method that's
it thank you for listening have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
