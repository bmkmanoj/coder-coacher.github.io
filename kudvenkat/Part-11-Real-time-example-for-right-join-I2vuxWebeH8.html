questions and answers video series in
this video we'll discuss real time
example for using right join one of our
YouTube channel subscribers have faced
these sequence of questions relate to
right join in a sequel server interview
it is the first question from the
interviewer can you list different types
of joints available in sequel server
that's a straightforward question
for which the candidate replied in a
joint left join right joint full join
and cross join and then there was an
immediate follow-up question from the
interviewer that is can you tell me the
purpose of right joint for which the
candidate replied right joint returns
all rules from the right table
irrespective of whether a match exists
in the left table or not and that's the
right answer for that question and then
there was an immediate follow-up
question again from the interviewer and
that is can you give me an example for
which the candidate took these two
tables as an example that is departments
and employees notice that with an
employee's table Department ID is the
foreign key referencing department ID in
departments table let's look at the
sample data that we have here at the
moment notice that all the employees
belong to either ID our HR department at
the moment we don't have any employees
within payroll and admin Department now
based on these two tables if we want to
retrieve all the department names and
employee names and we want all the
department names irrespective of whether
they have employees or not
clear look at that payroll and the admin
departments doesn't have any employees
but still we want those departments also
to be listed in the output so that's one
classic example when we use right join
that's what the candidates said let's
quickly write this query so let's flip
to sequence level management studio I've
created these two tables already and
populated them with sample data is the
sequel script that can do it I'll have
the script available on my blog in case
you need it now we want to select
department name and employee name from
employees table so we are using you know
employees table in the from clause so
that's going to be the left table so we
are going to join that with departments
on departments dot department ID equals
employees dot department ID and we want
department name and employee name now
look at this when we execute this query
we are only going to get the departments
which has got employees okay because by
default if you don't specify the type of
join it's going to be an inner join okay
now when I use left to join we are still
going to get only ID and HR departments
because when you use left join you get
all the rows from the left table
irrespective whether there is a match
with the right in the right table or not
okay but our requirement here is to
actually list all the department names
irrespective over the day I've got
employees or not okay so that's why we
use array joint so that is one example
where we scrape join but then in reality
you know in a real-time application I
don't really see a scenario where P
would actually use this kind of an
output right so that's why I think the
interviewer was not convinced with that
example so there was an another
immediate follow-up question that is he
said I accept you have understood the
purpose of right join but based on the
same you know set of tables can he give
me any other business case for using
right joint and at that point the
candidate you know didn't have any
answer so he said the interview it seems
sorry I can't think of anything else at
this moment but the good news is that in
spite of not answering that specific
interview question the candidate has
called the job of which he was
interviewed so that's a happy ending
there but then after the interview the
candidate emailed me the sequence of
interview questions and then he asked me
when can you think of any other business
case we would be would actually use a
light joint between these two tables and
I think in my opinion this is one
classic example where we use a right
joint between these two tables for
example I want to retrieve all the
department names and the total number of
employees within
each department okay so irrespective of
whether a department has employees or
not you know we still want to display
the department names and the total
employees within that department so at
the moment admin and payroll doesn't
have any employees but still they should
be listed and the count of employees
should be zero there and if you look at
the data that we have here HR department
which is number two has got two
employees in the IT department has got
three employees that's what is the
output here so let's see how we can use
right join to retrieve this output so
let's flip this equals zero management's
to view so what do we want in the output
we want department name and total number
of employees so that's going to stay
there and instead of employee name here
I'm going to say count off employees dot
department ID that's what we want let's
say as total employees okay now let's
actually remove that right joint
temporarily and then since we are using
an aggregate function here we need to
use a group by clause so let's go ahead
and use that so we want to group by
department name and let's also sort the
results by you know maybe total number
of employees okay so now look at this
this is an inner join so when we execute
this look at what we get in the output
we get only their HR and IT departments
okay but our requirement is we want to
you know retrieve admin and payroll
departments as well and we want to show
that those departments doesn't have any
employees so the count should be zero
there so to achieve that we would
actually use a right joint okay so since
here right table is departments it's
going to retrieve all the rows from the
right table okay and then since we are
using count of employees dot department
ID the total employees is going to be
zero
now be careful if you use count of star
here then you will get a wrong or
but so when we execute that look at that
it says you know total employees with an
admin department is one and payroll
department is one that's wrong the
reason why it is you know displaying one
again admin and payroll is because
within you know departments table we
have got one row for admin and one row
for payroll and that's what it's
displaying there so if you really want
you know the employee count then you
will have to use their employees or
department ID so this is another classic
example Babel we would actually use
write join alright that's it for today
thank you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
