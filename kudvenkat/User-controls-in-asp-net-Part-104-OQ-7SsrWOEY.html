am venket this is part 104 of asp.net
video series in this session we'll
discuss about user controls in asp.net
what are web user controls web user
controls combine one or more server or
HTML controls on a web user control page
which can in turn be used on a web form
as a single control if this definition
is a little vague at the moment don't
worry it will be much clearer in the
next 10 minutes let's say for example I
want to capture some dates from the end
user on a web form obviously to do that
we need a textbox control an image
button and a calendar control so when
the user clicks on this image that you
can see here the calendar becomes
visible and then from the calendar as
soon as the user selects a date that
selected date will be populated in the
textbox and the calendar control will
become invisible this is the most common
way to capture dates from the end user
in fact we have discussed about this in
part 32 of this asp.net video series
when we were discussing about calendar
control and obviously to achieve this
functionality considerable amount of
code need to be written in the web form
let's quickly review that code so let's
flip to visual studio so here on this
web form 1 you can see that I have a
textbox control and image button the
image from for the image button is
actually coming from this images folder
so I have this calendar dot PNG that's
what we have set as the image for that
image button and then the calendar
control itself ok so if you look at the
code as soon as the web form loads up we
don't want the calendar to be visible so
let me run this quickly so when I run
this you know the calendar will not be
visible to the end-user which means the
calendar should be hidden so if it's the
page load if it's not the post bacc in
the sense if it's the initial get
request of the webform hide the calendar
calendar one dot visible is equal to
false but then when I click the image
button look at that when I click that
button the calendar becomes visible if I
click that again what's happening the
calendar becomes invisible so basically
they click on this image button should
toggle the visibility of the calendar
control meaning the calendar is visible
make it invisible if it is
invisible make it visible okay so that's
what the click event of this image
button control should do and that's what
we are doing here so image button click
what are we doing if calendar one dot
visible then turn the visibility to
false else turn the visibility to true
okay and on the other hand look at this
I select the calendar you know the
calendar is visible right now if I
select a date as soon as I select the
date what's happening two things are
happening the date that we have selected
is populated within the text box and the
calendar has become invisible okay so
that has to happen within the selection
change the event of the calendar control
so whenever a selection of date changes
in the calendar control two things must
happen first thing
take the selected date from the calendar
and look at the selected date will
actually return at date and time so we
are converting that to a short date
string and then setting that as the text
for the textbox control that we have on
this web form okay and the next thing is
immediately we are turning the
visibility of the calendar to false okay
so that's what is happening here and
then obviously the final thing is when I
click this button control after I have a
date selected that date will be printed
on the web form and how am i retrieving
the date
I am simply retrieving the date from the
textbox and then printing it on the
waveform using the response tour right
now if you look at this you know it's a
simple you know control here to select
the dates I am using three controls here
the calendar text box and that image
button okay and there is you know
considerable amount of code as well here
around ten lines of code okay now let's
say in my project there is a need to
capture different dates for example on
different web forms I am capturing
different types of dates like start
their date of birth registration date
etc now wherever I want to capture these
dates on each and every waveform I will
have to you know repeat this HTML markup
and code okay now instead of doing that
we can actually encapsulated
everything into a single web user
control which in turn can be used on
multiple waveforms okay this way we are
actually reusing the same code which say
a lot of time in terms of development
and testing so in short we can say that
user controls increase reusability of
code implement encapsulation because we
are actually encapsulating all these
three controls into one control and not
only that we are going to hide all of
this front all of this code that you see
here within that user control
implementation so user controls are
actually a way of implementing
encapsulation and this is definitely
going to reduce a lot of development and
maintenance time because though you copy
and paste this code on multiple web
forms you know to make sure that this
code works in line with the other
controls and other pieces of code that
we have on on multiple waveforms
correctly we need to test that as well
not only development we also need to
test that okay so obviously using user
controls is going to reduce a lot of
development and maintenance time as well
okay now let's go ahead and see how to
turn this code into your user control
now to add a user control to your web
form it's very simple and
straightforward just like how you add a
web form to a web project in the same
way you add a web user control right
click on the project add new item in
that from the new item dialog box select
web user control so scroll up web user
control and give that a meaningful name
I'm going to call this calendar user
control okay and click Add now if it was
a web form we get dot aspx extension but
this is a web user control so web user
controls have dot asex
extension and another difference if you
notice for web forms you know you have
the page directive but for web user
controls you will have a control
directive instead of the page directive
okay and then another difference is on
the web form look at this you have all
these basic HTML elements so HTML
opening element closing element and then
you have had closing and opening body
closing and closing or opening and
closing but then a user control need not
have all those okay because a user
control will be used on a web form and a
web form already has that HTML head and
body so there's known
need a reason why a user control should
have them again that's why you simply
will have the markup for your controls
that are going to be part of this user
control so what I'm going to do I'm
going to copy whatever markup that I
have here so I'm going to take all that
markup from here okay and then paste
that in this web user control page okay
so that gives us the UI okay so I have
this UI and then what else I want to do
obviously we want to implement that
functionality look at this webform has a
page load event
similarly web user control also has a
load event okay the page load event so
when the webform loads up what we are
doing we are actually turning the
visibility of the calendar off so I'm
going to copy that and then paste it
within this control here okay and not
only that whenever the image button is
clicked we want to toggle the visibility
of the calendar so I'm going to copy
that as well and paste that within the
calendar control so all I am doing here
is copying and pasting that code from
the aspx page to the asex page which is
nothing but the user control and then
finally whenever the selection in the
calendar changes you know we want to
retrieve the date from the calendar
populate the textbox and turn the
visibility of the calendar to false so
copy that and paste that in the web user
control okay and then I'm not going to
copy this button click event why that's
because when I click the button we are
simply retrieving the date from that
textbox and printing it onto the webform
now when I use this web control you know
this calendar user control on a webform
that's when I will do that okay so at
this point look at this this control you
know we have this image button click
that's implemented here and then finally
the calendar one selection changed
that's also implemented here so let me
go ahead and build the solution so
control shift B look at the status power
bill succeeded okay so we have the user
control
okay now we can use this user control on
any web form now let's say for example
in my project I'm going to have maybe 10
or 20 waveforms where I want to capture
dates from the user instead of copying
and pasting all this HTML markup all
this HTML markup and this code on each
and every web form what I can basically
do is I can use this user control that
you can see here on those web forms in
fact we will discuss about adding this
web control you know the web user
control to multiple waveforms and using
it in the next video session but now
let's quickly recap the differences
between the web form and web user
control so designing and implementing
web user controls is very much similar
to web forms web forms have the
extension of dot aspx whereas web user
controls have the extension of dot asex
web forms begin with at page directive
and they can have HTML head and body
elements whereas web user controls begin
with F control directive and cannot have
HTML head and body we have just seen
that as well just like web forms user
controls also have code behind files so
web forms have in a web form one dot
aspx dot CS whereas web user controls
have you know dot a SC X dot CSS their
code behind files so in this video we
discussed about creating user controls
in the next video session we'll actually
see
using this calendar user control that we
have just created on a web form okay on
this slide you can find resources for
asp.net c-sharp and sequence of
interview questions that's it for today
thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
