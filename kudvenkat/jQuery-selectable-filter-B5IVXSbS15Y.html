this video well discus jQuery selectable
filter option with an example this is
continuation to part 97 so please watch
part 97 before proceeding here's what we
want to achieve when this checkbox
exclude weekends is checked then we
should not be able to select weekends
that is Saturday and Sunday on the other
hand if the check box is not checked
then we should be able to select all
days including the weekends let's see
how to achieve this let's flip to visual
studio this is the same example that we
worked with in the previous video
session at the moment we are able to
select all days including the weekends
now the first thing that we want to do
is get this checkbox on the page so back
in visual studio just above the
unordered list element we want to
include this literal text exclude
weekends and followed by that we need a
checkbox so input type equals checkbox
and let's give it an ID let's call this
CB exclude so when we view the page in
the browser we should get a checkbox now
another thing that I'm going to do is
refactor the code that's present within
our ready function so at the moment we
have an anonymous function that is
responding to stop event now what I'm
going to do is move this code into a
named function so I'm going to create a
function here let's call it get selected
items and I'm going to move the code
that is present inside this anonymous
function into that named function and
another thing that I'm going to do is
cache this selector so I'm going to
create a variable here and let's call
this selectable list so now we have
cached that selector so we can reuse
this variable wherever we want that so
instead of you know using the selector
again I'm going to use the variable okay
so
selectable list dot they're calling the
jQuery selectable function and with the
stop event we want to associate this get
selected items named function right now
when this checkbox is checked we want to
exclude these two days from the
selection okay so we have to detect if
the checkbox is checked or not and that
checkbox has got an ID and the ID of the
checkbox is CB exclude so here let's go
ahead and associate a click event
handler with the checkbox so let's use
the jQuery ID selector again find the
checkbox and associate click event
handler so now we have to detect if the
checkbox is checked or not so for that
I'm going to use this keyword here so
this refers to the checkbox and I'm
going to use the ease function and use
the selector colon checked so this
function is going to return true if the
checkbox is checked otherwise it's going
to return false so if the checkbox is
checked we want to do something else we
want to do something so if the checkbox
is checked what do we want to do we want
to destroy the selectable feature and
recreate that feature once again okay
so I'm going to use this variable here
selectable list and call the jQuery UI
selectable function and then I'm going
to call destroy function so what is this
destroy function going to do it's going
to destroy the selectable feature and
then I'm going to use this selectable
function once again to recreate the
selectable feature using new options so
the first option is going to be stop
they still want to handle the stop event
so that does not change in any way and
in addition to that stop option I'm also
going to specify
filter option so what is this filter
option going to do the value for this
filter option is going to be a selector
so that selector determines what
elements within your
you want to be selectable okay so I'm
going to specify a selector here now if
you look at the list items that we have
caught within our unordered list you
know we don't have any way at the moment
to distinguish between weekdays and
weekends so what I'm going to do is
introduce data - value attribute and set
this attribute to weekdays weekdays for
weekdays and for week and I'm going to
set that attribute to we can so we can
use the value of this attribute to
distinguish between big days and
weekends okay so in the interest of time
I have already typed the required HTML
for those list items so let's pay start
right here so if you look at this HTML
right here notice for all the list items
of weekdays we have that attribute set
to weekday and for weekends that is
Saturday and Sunday we have that
attribute set to weekend so now we have
a way to distinguish between weekdays
and weekends
so now here the filter is going to be
all list items where data - value
attribute equals weekday okay so only
week this now will be selectable within
that unordered list alright so once we
have you know excluded weekend's from
selection look at this if the you know
options are selected like that and if I
check this checkbox exclude weekends
what we want to do is we want to remove
those selections all the selections now
we know that jQuery UI is going to apply
UI - selected class to the items that
are selected so we want to remove that
class from all those list items that are
selected okay so to do that what I'm
going to do here is so use another
selector so we have this selectable
unordered list that's the ID within that
we have list items
and what we want to do is remove UI -
selected class right so that's going to
remove the selections and another thing
that we want to do is when those items
are selected within this development we
are displaying the selected item so we
want to empty that as well and we've got
an ID for that development and it is
result here it is so we want to empty
that development so in addition to
removing that UI selected a class we
want to empty the result development and
to do that we are going to use the empty
function alright so if the checkbox is
checked that's what we want to do if it
is not checked then we want the weekends
to be included in the selection so even
at that point we want to do you know a
similar thing so I'm going to copy and
paste the code that we have in the if
block so now if the check box is not
checked then our filter is going to be
star meaning we want all the list items
to be included within the selection okay
and the rest of the code does not change
in any way so if you look at this if and
else block the only thing that is
changing is the value for this filter so
instead of duplicating code like this
why don't we move this into a separate
function so let's create another
function here let's actually call that
create
selectable list and the variable piece
which is filter value let's pass it as a
parameter and let's copy this code let's
actually cut it from there and paste it
right here okay and instead of
hard-coding the value for the filter
let's pass this parameter so I'm going
to copy that filter value so filter
equals filter value whatever we are
going to pass so if the checkbox is
checked what we want to do we want to
call that function creatable create
selectable list and I'm going to pass
this as the filter value okay because we
want only big days to be included in
selection if the checkbox is checked if
the checkbox is not checked then we want
to still call the same function create
selectable list and this time the filter
is going to be star because we want all
the list items to be included within the
selection all right so with all these
changes let's reload this page and look
at this when we check this checkbox we
don't have any way to tell if the
weekends are excluded from selection we
don't have any visual feedback let's
apply a class and provide some visual
feedback to say that the weekends are
you know excluded from selection so for
that what I'm going to do is within our
Style section I'm going to create
another class and let's call this
exclude it and what I'm going to do is
actually change the background color to
red let's retain font color as white and
I'm also going to change the cursor
style because at the moment when you
hover the mouse over these selectable
items look at that the cursor changes to
a hand symbol but if the weekends are
excluded from selection we don't want
that to be a hand symbol we want that to
be a default cursor
so I'm going to set the cursor style to
default and what I want to do is apply
this class so within our function create
selectable list I'm going to check the
filter value so the filter value we are
passing the filter value into this
function if the filter value equals star
then that means we want all the elements
to be included in the selection
including the weekends and if this
excluded class is already applied then
we want to remove that class from those
weekend elements okay so first of all
let's go ahead and create a variable
here let's call this weekend's
and I'm going to use a selector here so
the selector is going to be I want all
the list items where data - value
attribute equals weekend okay so we are
getting the weekend elements and if the
filter value is star that means we don't
want to exclude weekends from selection
that means if the excluded class is
already applied then remove that class
so I'm going to say weekends dot remove
class and the name of the class is
excluded so let's copy that to avoid any
typos and paste it right there so
excluded else what we want to do we want
to apply that class so that the
background color changes to red so here
we're going to use add class okay all
right so let's save our changes and
reload this page one more time and look
at this when we check the check box look
at that we can sir now the background
color has changed to red and look at
this when we how the mouse over the
weekend elements you know it's not
change it tied to that hand symbol but
now I should be able to select the
weekdays look at that but when I click
on Saturday and Sunday notice that
nothing happens I'm not able to select
those two elements
and within the results that we don't
have you know Saturday and Sunday
displayed but I can select the other
days and the result is updated
dynamically now when I uncheck this
checkbox at this point what it's going
to do it's going to remove all the
selections look at that and now look at
that
Saturday and Sunday the cursor changes
to hand symbol that means I should be
able to select those days and if you
check this once again look at that they
turn back to red and now I can select
only the weekdays so here we have the
HTML and the CSS styles we used in the
demo and here we have the jQuery code
that we just discussed thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
