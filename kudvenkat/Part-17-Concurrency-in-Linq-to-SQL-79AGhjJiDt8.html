tutorial in this video we'll discuss how
link to sequel handles concurrent
updates that is when two or more users
try to update the same piece of data at
the same time by default link to sequel
uses optimistic concurrency to handle
concurrent updates optimistic
concurrency does not involve locking
rows and reading data instead this model
checks if two users try to update the
same record at the same time if that
happens one uses changes are committed
to the database and the other users
changes are discarded and an exception
will be thrown to notify the user let's
prove this with an example
we'll be using this accounts table in
this demo I've already created this
accounts table and here is the sequel
script
I'll have the script available on my
blog now let's flip to visual studio
here I have an empty asp.net web
application project to this project
let's add a new item and we want to add
a link to sequel classes let's name this
sample dot DB ml let's get to server
Explorer and drag-and-drop the accounts
table onto the designer surface now
let's also add a web form to this
project and we want to design this
waveform like this as you can see on the
screen we want three label controls in a
button control these label controls must
be inside an HTML to speed things up I
already have the required HTML so let's
copy and paste this HTML on the web form
I'll have this HTML on my blog in case
you need it so let's go and paste it
right here let's slip this to the design
mode now let's double click on this
bottom control to generate a click event
handler so what we want to do is when
the wave form loads on the page load we
want to display the data that's present
in the accounts table within the
respective label controls so let's go
ahead and create a private function here
to get the data from the database table
so let's call this ket accounts data
let's create an instance for sample data
context let's call this DB DB dot
Accounts dot first or default X such
that X dot account number equals 1 so we
want to retrieve the account where
account number is 1 let's create a
variable of type account and store the
object in that all right now all we need
to do is display the account number
account name or account balance in the
respective label controls so label let's
save the changes LBL account number dot
text account dot account number dr.
string similarly lb l dot account named
or text equals account dot account name
and lb l dot account balance dot text
equals account dot account balance dot
tostring alright so this is the private
function which is going to retrieve data
from the database table now what we want
to do is on the page load if it's not a
postback meaning if it is the initial
get request let's go ahead and call that
method get accounts data and then when
we click this deposit $500 we want to
deposit $500 you know into the same
account so we want to add finder dollars
to the account balance column so let's
go ahead and do that so again we need to
create an instance of the sample data
context class so let's copy and paste
this code in the deposit button click
event handler so we got the account all
we need to do is change the account
balance or account balance equals
account dot account balance plus 500 and
finally we need to call a submit
Changez on the data context object and
then once we have updated the balance we
want to refresh the data within the
label controls so let's go ahead and
call get accounts data function all
right so with all these changes let's go
ahead and run this platform so in the
waveform first loads it should display
the accounts information with respect to
label controls now let's go to sequel
server management studio and then fire
up sequel profiler let's connect to our
local sequel server and run a new trade
so the sequence of a trace is running
now now let's click this deposit $400 so
what should this do they should add
finder dollars to the account balance
okay so that's done now let's go back to
sequel profiler stop the trace and here
we have the update query right here so
let's copy and paste this update query
within sequel server management studio
first of all notice this it's a dynamic
sequel that is generated so we are
updating a towns table set account
balance equals at the p3 so this is a
parameterised query where and if you
look at the where clause notice that
there are one two three parameters okay
so let's look at what those parameters
are okay so at p0 at p0 is account
number and at p1 is account name and
that p2 is the original account balance
so how much money was there in the
account before thousand dollars so all
this from p0 to p2 all these are
original values so that's the account
number that's the original account name
and that's the original account balance
now to perform an update for the account
balance column all we need is the
account number and the new account
balance but if you look at the query
right here we have got along with the
account number and along with the new
account balance we also got the account
name and the original account balance so
why do we have all these checks in the
where class that's to make sure that the
data that we have loaded into the
application for modification purposes
have not been changed since the data is
loaded if someone else have changed the
data then you know there is a
concurrency issue so when we try to
update it it's going to check you know
the original values and then it will
know that okay the original values have
changed so you know it will all link to
sequel is going to discard these changes
and an exception will be thrown let's
actually look at this in action so now
let's go back to our application and
then what I'm going to do is throw in a
breakpoint here on DB submit changes so
the execution is going to stop there so
let's go ahead and run this application
within the debug mode and let's go back
to sequence of management studio so here
we have an update query so which is
modifying the account balance column so
this query right here is deducting
hundred dollars from the account balance
so now let's click this deposit button
so the execution should stop at this
line so we have loaded the data into the
application for modification but we have
not modified that yet in the meantime
let's go back to sequel server
management studio and execute this
update query so the data has changed
since we have loaded it into the
application for modification now let's
continue the execution let's press f5
now look at this we get an exception
change conflict exception okay so
there's a change conflict and look at
the error message it says rule not found
or changed okay so the row that we have
loaded for modification has been changed
okay after we have loaded it and before
we could you know update the data okay
that's why you know the initial whoever
has updated it before us those changes
are committed to the database but these
changes are discarded
and this change conflict exception is
thrown so this is how link to sequel
handles concurrent updates it uses
optimistic concurrency thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
