Venkat in this video we'll discuss the
use of background worker class in
windows forms application with an
example first let's look at the
application that we'll be building today
so this is the application that we'll be
building so basically it has got process
and cancel buttons when I click the
process button you know the program is
going to compute the sum of the first
100 numbers now while the program is
computing the sum of the first 100
numbers you know it is also going to
show us the progress that it has made ok
so in terms of percentages and we have a
label control here
you know the label control is also going
to display the percentage let's actually
look at that in action I have already
built this so when I click process
notice that you know the progress bar is
moving forward and here within the label
control it's actually displaying the
progress percentage and then once it
treat it has reached hundred percent
look at that the sum of first are 100
numbers is 5050 and that's what is
displayed here now let's say when I
click the process button you know it's
still processing the sum of the first
100 numbers if for any reason why I want
to cancel the processing when I click
the cancel button look at what happens
you know first of all the progress that
was made is reverted and then within the
label control it just displays the
message saying processing cancel ok so
let's see how to achieve this using
background worker class ok now so first
of all let's understand the rationale
behind using background worker class so
by default Windows applications are
single threaded this means when we run
the application there will be a single
thread which is commonly called as the
UI thread that is the thread responsible
for doing all the work that is creating
and updating user interface elements
repainting them when required and
executing the application code now let's
say for example we have caught a
function that takes 10 seconds to
complete while the UI thread is busy
processing this function the UI of the
application is frozen and the end user
cannot interact with the controls on the
form
during those 10 seconds now to keep our
application responsive we can create a
new thread ourselves and then ask that
thread to execute the function that
takes a long time to complete so that
the UI thread is free to update the
controls on the form but the problem
with creating threads ourselves is that
it can get extremely complex especially
when we have to update UI controls based
on the status of the thread function
execution okay now let's understand what
we mean by this last last statement you
know the problem with creating threads
ourselves is that it can get extremely
complex especially when we have to
update UI controls based on the status
of the thread function execution now
look at this when we click process you
know based on the progress that is made
we are updating the user interface
elements here and then once the
processing is complete we are also
taking the results from the thread
function and then updating the user
interface elements so if we have to do
something like that you know there is
thread synchronization and all that
stuff that comes into play which can
make multi-threading a little complex
and another golden rule to keep in mind
is that it is dangerous to access UI
objects on a thread that didn't create
them if you look at this application
right here when we run this windows
forms application all these controls are
there on the form at the design guide so
when we run the application we get one
thread for free that is the UI thread
and that is the thread that is creating
all these controls and then let's say we
are creating another thread you know to
compute the sum of this first one 100
numbers if that thread tri tries to
access these controls you know that can
become dangerous in the sense that the
behavior of the program can become
unpredictable okay so the better option
here is to use the background worker
class which simplifies multi-threading
so let's see how to use that before we
look at using the background worker
class let's look at the important
properties and events that this control
exposes so these are the two properties
look at that one property is called
worker supports cancellation now
set this property to true if you want
the background operation to allow
cancellation okay so if we look at our
application here when we click the
cancel button it's canceling the
processing the background operation okay
so if we want the application to allow
that simply said that property to true
and worker report reports progress again
if you want the background operation to
report progress again set that property
to true here we are reporting progress
based on the progress made when
calculating the sum of the first 50
numbers okay so we are going to set
those two properties to true and then
these are the events that I'm that we
are going to make use of now do work
event okay so this is the event handler
where the time consuming operation runs
on the background thread okay so in our
example the code to process the sum of
the first 100 numbers will go in this
function and they do work even handler
method and progress change so this is
the event handler where we write code to
update the user interface elements with
the progress made so far so when the
application is calculating some of the
first 100 numbers obviously it is doing
progress as it's calculating and if you
look at the progress bar and label
controls for being updated with the
percentage that is completed so the code
to update these user interface elements
will go in that even handler method and
then run worker completed basically you
know the name itself implies what what
this means
you know this do work even handler
contains the code to execute the
background operation the time-consuming
background operation once that is
complete you know this event is raised
automatically and keep in mind this run
worker completed even gets raised for
three reasons when the background worker
has completed processing successfully or
when it has encountered an error or
whether you know if we have requested it
to cancel the execution so when we click
the cancel
button they are requesting cancellation
so even if that's the case in a run work
completed event or is fired so this is
where we write code to update the user
interface elements accordingly depending
on whether we complete it successfully
or there was an exception or did the
user request for cancellation okay so
let's go and look at it in action right
now
so first let's flip to windows forms
application here so if you look at this
Visual Studio instance I have created a
new windows forms application I have
named it demo and then at the moment
what I have done is on the windows form
dragged and dropped to button controls
progress bar control and a label control
for the button controls I have set the
name to BT and process for this button
and btncancel for this button okay so
first of all let's go ahead and drag and
drop this background worker on to our
form so when I drop double-click the
background worker control look at that
it doesn't get placed on the form
because that's something that the user
doesn't see okay on the form itself so
it's placed right here background worker
1 and then let's get to the properties
of that so on the properties window
notice that we have got these two
properties worker reports progress
worker supports cancellation so let's
turn them both to true because we want
to report progress and we want to
support cancellation and then let's also
generate the required event handlers so
look at the events to work progress
changes and worker completed so double
click on do work it's going to generate
an event handler similarly let's go
ahead and double click the other to
progress change and finally run worker
completed so here we have the respect to
even handler methods and then let's also
go ahead and generate even handlers for
the button process click and button
cancel click ok so at this point we have
all the even handler methods that we
need now in do work what kind of code
are we going to write so this is the
code that we are going to write and do
work even handler so basically you know
this is a very simple code so if you
look at this code here we have
initialized a variable of type integer
to 0 calling some and then we have a for
loop here I runs from 1 to hundred and
then to introduce some artificial
processing time we are making this
thread sleep for 100 milliseconds and
then we are saying sum equals sum plus I
so that's the expression which is going
to compute the sum of the first 100
numbers and then this is what is
important so look at that background
worker 1 what is this background worker
1 that is the control we have dragged
and dropped onto a form background
worker ok so we are saying background
worker 1 dot report progress and we are
passing I notice I runs from 1 200 and
percentage is also typically from 1 200
so when it has computed some of you know
first 10 numbers I will be 10 meaning 10
percent has completed so we are passing
that number to report progress method ok
so when we call this method this
background worker control is all
automatically going to raise progress
change event we will next see in a bed
how to handle progress change so
basically here we are reporting progress
ok if we have computed the sum of first
15 umbers then the progress that we are
reporting is 50 meaning 50 percent has
been completed so when we invoke this
method keep in mind progress changed
even is raised and in a bit we'll see
how to handle that and then this is very
important as well because we want you
know the program to support cancellation
as well so this background worker one
control has got a property called
cancellation pending so if somebody has
clicked the cancel button what happens
is this cancellation pending that turns
to true ok so when we are computing the
sum of the first 100
numbers we are also checking okay
somebody has requested for cancellation
if that property returns true then
somebody has clicked the cancel button
in which case we want to cancel this
work this operation okay and all we need
to do is we are setting the cancel
property of the EE object to true so
what is this I object this is nothing
but the parameter that is coming into
this event handler so do work even
arguments okay so here we are setting
the cancel property of that object to
true so what is the background worker
going to do when it detects that
canceled property has set to true it's
going to cancer the background operation
now when we cancel the background
operation obviously we want to revert
the progress made so far to zero that's
why we are calling report programs
method and passing zero as the parameter
to the to that method so obviously on
the UI you know this progress will be
reverted to zero okay and then we simply
return from the event handler method
because there is nothing left to do if
no one has requested cancellation then
it's going to come here and look at this
once the for the entire for loop is
completed it's going to come to this
line and look at again here what we are
doing we're setting the result property
of do even arguments object to the total
sound in a bit we'll see how we are
going to make use of this result
property and we are also going to see
how we are going to handle progress
change the event that this background
worker raises so first let's look at
progress change the event and before we
do that I have this exact piece of code
already typed within the notepad so
let's copy that and paste that within
our windows forms application so I click
on the form let's go to the code page
and look at that do work within this
even handler I'm going to paste this
exact same code so thread class is
present in systems or threading
namespace so let's go and bring that
namespace in
now if you need this code I will have
available it on my blog as well if you
want to copy and paste it okay so that
is do work now let us see how to handle
the progress change demon now this is
pretty straightforward if you remember
on the previous slide we are calling
this report progress method on the
background worker so obviously this is
going to raise progress changed event
and if you look at the progress change
the even handler to it we are receiving
progress changed event arguments as a
parameter okay so this object has got
progress percentage property so this is
going to receive whatever number we are
passing here so if we have passed you
know number ten as the value for I to
this method then progress percentage is
going to retrieve that ten and then look
at that we have progress bar control on
the form as well this is the progress
bar control we are setting the value
equal to whatever value that we get into
the cement handler method using this
property and on the label also is we are
displaying the actual number and we are
converting that to string and appending
this person symbol to whatever number we
get okay straightforward background work
progress change again I have this code
here so let's copy that and paste it
with in progress change event alright
now the next step is to implement run
worker completed so if nobody has
requested if you look at the previous
slide if nobody has requested
cancellation and if we have you know
loop through the hundred numbers so
obviously we have this sum of 100
numbers and look at where we are storing
at me at storing it in the result
property of do work even two arguments
object which then gets passed down to
you know this even handler method so
here look at what parameter we are
getting into the same and handler run
worker completed Ament arguments and
this object has got three important
properties edad cancel edo era and
dot result so this result property is
going to contain the result that we have
set here okay so now we are checking if
we dot cancel if somebody has requested
a cancellation okay somebody has
requested a cancellation what did we do
we have set cancel property to true so
that gets passed to this cancelled but
property of this object so if it is
canceled then on the label what we want
to display is processing cancel else if
there is an exception so if there is an
error if that is not equal to null then
we know an exception has occurred in
which case we are just displaying the
exception message within the label else
meaning an exception linty
nobody has requested cancellation in
that case get the result out and display
it within the label control
straightforward so let's go ahead and
copy this piece of code and paste it
right there so so far what we have done
is implemented the even handler methods
of the background worker class now we
need to call the do work operation
somehow so that the background worker
can go ahead and execute this time
consuming piece of code within the
background so that our UI thread is free
okay so let's go ahead and see how to do
that how to invoke that so within a
button process click first we are
checking ok is background worker busy if
it is not busy then go ahead and execute
you know the do work function
asynchronously that's what this method
does run work async now let's see what's
going to happen if we don't have this
condition so if we simply say background
worker 1 dot run worker async so we are
going to run it asynchronously and look
at that I'm not putting any condition
there so if I go ahead and run this now
so this is the application that we are
creating I click the process button it
has started
are saying what is going to happen if I
click the process again we are going to
get an exception why is that and look at
the exception what it says this
background worker is currently busy and
cannot run multiple tasks concurrently
okay because the background worker is
already doing the processing and at the
same time you're clicking the button
again so it can't run to background
operations tasks simultaneously because
we have just one instance of background
worth a class okay so that's why it is
important to include that property if
background worker one dot is busy if it
is processing that it's going to return
true if it is not busy then try to call
the do work operation asynchronously
else probably you can also display a
message within the label control stating
you know busy processing
please wait so something like that busy
processing please wait
okay and when we request the
cancellation what should we do you know
the same logic applies if the background
worker is not I mean if the background
worker is busy meaning if it is still
doing the processing then go ahead and
cancel the processing and how do we do
that we call this method cancel async
operation so cancel async okay now why
is it important to check this if it's
not busy then there is nothing to cancel
so it doesn't really make sense to call
that method so check that property if it
is busy then cancel the asynchronous
operation else probably again you can
just print a message saying within the
label control you know there's no
operation no operation in progress
in progress to cancel okay so let's go
ahead and run this and see if it works
as expected
so click process so it's it has started
processing I click the cancel button
look at that processing cancel if I
click the button again look at that no
operation in progress to cancer now I
click process button I click it once
again basically that is because it
doesn't display that message for a long
time here that's basically because every
200 milliseconds we are updating the
status on this label control so what I'm
going to do here instead of displaying
that message within label 1 which is
getting overwritten with the percentage
that's completed let's include another
label control and probably display the
message within that label control so
let's drag label another label and leave
it right there and within the form we
can simply say label 2 dot text equal
start and now we should get to see that
so process so it's processing when I
click process again look at that busy
processing please wait ok and then once
the processing is completed you can set
that label text to an empty text so that
you so you don't see that message there
and the way to do that is simply within
your do work when that within your run
worker completed that has completed
successfully
probably here we can simply say label
dude or text equals an empty string so
let's run this click process look at
that if we click it once again busy
processing please wait once the
processing has completed then it's going
to display that 100% and then it's also
going to you know set the label to text
to empty so that we don't get to see
that I click the button again it starts
all over I click cancel
processing cancer I click it once again
no operation in progress to cancer
alright hope you enjoyed this video
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great
