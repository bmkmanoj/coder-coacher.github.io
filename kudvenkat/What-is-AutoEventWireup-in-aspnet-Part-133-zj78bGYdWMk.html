am Venkat this is part 133 of asp.net
video tutorial in this video we'll
discuss about Auto event wire up in a
speed or net this is a very common
asp.net interview question a lot of my
youtube subscribers has asked me this
question so I thought I would post this
video to clarify let's understand the
purpose of Auto event wire up with an
example let's flip to visual studio I
have an asp.net web application project
here on this web form one dot aspx I
don't have any controls but within the
code-behind file I have a few even
handler methods page underscore load
page and the school load complete page
underscore pre-render page and is
completing the complete and within each
even handler method I am calling this
response tour right method to write the
name of the event onto the page okay the
important thing to notice here is that
these even handler methods are not
associated to the page events in any way
let me explain what I mean let me drag
and drop a button control onto this
waveform now when I double click this
button control you know we have button 1
underscore click even handler method
generated now this event handler method
is associated with the click event of
this button control using this on click
attribute okay but these page level even
handler methods are not associated to
their events in any way ok so at this
time let's flip this waveform one
thought is be extra HTML source small
and I'm going to set the auto event wire
up attribute basically this is a boolean
attribute meaning you can either set it
to true or false
only at the moment I have set it to true
now let me run this notice that in spite
of these page level even handler methods
not being associated with their events
explicitly the even handler methods are
executed so how is that possible that's
possible because when you set Auto even
wired up to true the page level even
handler methods are automatically wired
with their events we don't have to do
that explicitly on the other hand let me
go ahead and set this to false and now
let me run this at this time notice that
none of the
even handler methods are executed why is
that because if you turn off auto even
wire up you know attribute then you have
to explicitly associate these even
handler methods with those respective
events so how am I going to do that okay
basically we can override the on init
method look at this this waveform one
class is inheriting from system red
pepper to weight or page class within
this page class you know the page base
class we have on init method we can
override that so the moment I type
override and then press space I can
actually see all the methods in the base
class that I can overwrite so I'm going
to override this on init method and
within this on initialization method I'm
going to hook up so this dot load so
with the load even look at the symbol
the lightning bolt symbol may be meaning
that's an email so to the load event
associate you know a new event handler
so basically we are using and even
handle it delegate here to hook up the
event handler method to its event so new
even handler and I want to associate
page load event
I mean page load even handler method so
to the load event of this webform
associate this even handler method okay
so I'm explicitly doing that within this
initialization method along the same
lines I can do that for page load
complete page Pretender and page replead
in the complete and just to speed things
up I have that lines already type so let
me copy and paste them here so it's the
same thing for load complete event
associate page enter school load
complete so on and so forth so the rest
of the events and they're even handlers
so let me run this now at this time
since we have explicitly you know
associated even handler methods with
their events you know the events get
fired okay at this time look at this we
have explicitly associated the event
handler methods and at the same time I
am also going to turn this to true okay
so now let me run this and see what's
going to happen notice that every even
handler method is executed twice why is
that because the even handler methods
are registered twice so this page load
even handler method is registered with
the load event twice once in this on
init method and you know the second time
as we have set Auto even to wire up to
true they're automatically registered as
well so for every event these even
handler methods are called twice okay so
that's the purpose of auto event wire up
so auto emailed wire up is a boolean
property which when set to true the page
even handler methods are automatically
wired with their respective events if
this property is set to false then the
even handler methods need to be
explicitly associated with their
respective events and we have just seen
how to do that using on init method okay
but there are some important points to
keep in mind when using Auto event wire
up so when auto you int wire up is set
to true and if you want the even
handlers to be wired up with their
events automatically the yeren handler
names should follow the standard naming
convention for example page underscore
event name so page underscore load our
page underscore loadcomplete you know
the respective event name has to be
preceded with page underscore otherwise
it may not work for example and we
actually get rid of this one
you know the on init method there and at
the moment we have in Auto event wire up
set to true now instead of page load I'm
going to set that to page underscore
load one so this is not following the
standard naming convention so obviously
now if I run this page under school load
one even handler method will not be
fired but the others will fire look at
that load complete clear and I'm clear
and a complete or fired
but page underscore load is not fired
because you're not following the
standard naming convention alright auto
event wire up can be set in the page
directive or in web door config file so
we have seen how to set the auto event
wire up within the page directive okay
we can also set this in web config file
so that it will be applicable for all
their forms within your pair within your
entire application okay so how do we set
it in web config file within system dot
web all you need to do is use the pages
element and then set Auto event wire up
is equal to true or false okay now if
auto wire
Auto event wire wrap is set both the
waveform and at the webform web.config
lever then which one will have higher
proceedings obviously the webform
setting will override the setting at the
web.config level okay and another thing
to keep in mind if I don't specify this
attribute at all then what is the
default value so I haven't specified any
value let's flip to webform let's and
I'll put it back to page and the scroll
load so if you don't specify it at all
by default it will be true so the even
handlers will automatically be
associated with their events and hence
they will be executed automatically all
right on this slide you can find
resources for asp.net c-sharp and
sequence of interview questions that's
it's a trait thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
