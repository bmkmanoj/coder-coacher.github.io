tutorial in this video well this is
performing the read operation in angular
in our upcoming videos
well discuss performing the rest of the
crud operations that is creating
updating and deleting now let's
understand performing the read operation
with an example here's what we want to
do we want to retrieve and display the
list of employees as you can see right
here at the moment we don't have a model
for representing our employee so let's
create an employee class with all these
properties that is name gender date of
birth etc so let's flip over to visual
studio code let's place all our models
in a folder called models and let's
place this folder inside the app folder
so I'm going to right click on the app
folder and then add a new folder let's
name it models and let's add a new file
to the models folder and we are creating
a model for employee so let's name this
file employee dot model dot TS and this
is how the employee class looks like
notice it has got several properties
like ID name gender etc ID is of type
number name is of type string gender is
also string and we have email which is
of type string but notice we have a
question mark at the end of the property
name so basically this question mark
indicates that this property is optional
so we can either provide a value for
email or phone number notice both of
those properties are made optional by
including a question mark at the end of
the property name and then we have
contact preference so basically this
property specifies whether we want the
employee to be contacted either by email
or phone number
so this basically specifies what is
their contact preference and then we
have date of birth which is of type date
and the department they belong to
whether the employee is active or is he
terminated and then photo path so if we
look at the page right here notice we
are displaying the employee photo so
this photo path property
specifies where that photo is coming
from at the moment with a no project we
don't have a folder called images I'm
going to create images folder inside
this assets folder so let's right-click
on the assets folder and add a new
folder let's name it
images and inside this images folder I
am going to include of our employee
images they are already present right
here I will have them available on my
blog in case you need to download them
so let's copy these images and paste
them within the images folder right here
so let's reveal this images folder in
File Explorer and then paste all of our
images in that folder next let's create
list employees component to display the
list of employees now to create the
component I am going to use angular CLI
notice within the command prompt I am
already in the project folder so I'm
going to use this command to create the
list employees component ng for angular
CLI itself
G for generate C for component and I'm
going to call our component list
employees and I want this component to
be placed inside the employees folder so
I'm going to prefix that folder name at
the moment within our project we don't
have that employees folder so we want
that employees folder to be created and
we're going to place all of our employee
crud related components in that
employees folder so that's the reason we
prefix the employees folder name right
here and then we don't want spec files
to be generated so I'm going to set - -
spec to false and I'm also going to set
- - flat to true basically what happens
by default is angular CLI is going to
place the component files in its own
dedicated folder but we don't want that
we want all of our employee crud
components to be placed in this
employees folder so we want that
component to be placed flat in that
folder without its own dedicated folder
so let's go ahead and press Enter this
is going to create our list employees
component there we go our component is
created
notice it has created the component type
script file the view template and the
CSS file and these three files are
placed in the employees folder inside
the app folder so if we take a look at
visual studio code notice within the app
folder we have got employees folder and
within that we have the three component
files the typescript file the HTML and
CSS and if we go back to the command
prompt notice it not only created these
three component files it has also
updated the root module app module so if
we take a look at app that module dot es
notice it has included the required
import statement to import list
employees component and has also made it
part of the declarations array of our
@ng module decorator if we take a look
at the list employees component
typescript file notice it has also
linked the template file right here
using the template URL property and it
has also linked the CSS file using these
styles URLs property and look at the
amount of boilerplate code the angular
CLI has given us out of the box which
otherwise we would have to write
manually and imagine amount of time it
takes so I personally think angular
Cielo is one of the tools that we should
know how to use it so we can be as
productive as possible next we need to
retrieve employee's data and display
that using the list employees component
that we have just created in a typical
real world application we retrieve the
employees data from a database table but
for now let's hard-code the employee's
data within our list employees component
in our upcoming videos in the series
will discuss how to retrieve employee's
data from a database table so within our
list employees component I'm going to
include a property I will call it
employees because it's going to hold the
list of employees and the type for this
is going to be employee array remember
this employee class that we have created
so here is that employee class with all
those properties so this property is of
type employee array
so let's create a new array here and
this is going to contain our list of
employees I'm going to hard-code
three employees data right here so we
have our first employee whose name is
mark his ideas one gender is male his
contact preferences email so he has
provided his email ID date of birth so
here we first specify the month date and
then the year his department is ID his
active is of type boolean so we specify
true or false if the employee is active
they said that to true and photo part
the photo for this employee is coming
from the images folder inside the assets
folder and within the images folder we
have mark dot PNG so if we look at the
images folder we have mark dot PNG
similarly we have employee two who is
Mary
employee three who is John this is how
we want to display employees data so we
are going to use bootstrap for styling
but in our list employees component view
template let's do the required changes
their ID default HTML that we have here
and then let's include a development
we're going to use bootstrap panels to
style the display like this so if you're
new to bootstrap please check out our
bootstrap course so on this development
I'm going to use to bootstrap classes
the first one is panel and the second
one is panel primary both these classes
are being used for styling the panels
and then we're going to use the angular
ng for structural directive to loop over
the list of employees notice within our
list employees component we have this
property employees which contains an
array of employee objects so at the
moment within the array we got three
employee objects we want to loop over
those three employee objects so we are
using the angular ng for structural
directive so we are going to loop over
the list of employees that we have in
this property employees now at the
moment we don't have word wrap
turned on so let's turn on world rap to
turn on wood rap go to the View tab and
then select toggle vert rap so this is
going to automatically wrap the code
when it flows off the screen in the
panel heading we want to display the
employee name so if we go back to the
slides notice that in the panel heading
we have the employee names so to get
that panel heading I'm going to use
another development inside this
development and we're going to use
another bootstrap CSS class here and
this class is panel heading we are using
this again for styling inside this
development we are going to use an h3
element and we are going to use this h3
element to display the name of the
employee within the panel heading and to
get the name of the employee we're going
to use this variable employee and we're
using angular interpolation here and we
know the employee object has got the
name property which is going to display
that name property within the h3 element
here and for styling again on this h3
element I'm going to use another
bootstrap class and that is panel -
title now we discuss the interpolation
and angular ng for structural director
in detail in our angular 2 tutorial so
if you're new to both of those concepts
please check angular 2 course next we
want to display employee photo and his
details within the panel body
so after panel heading div we're going
to include another development here and
the class on this is going to be panel -
body again this the bootstrap class for
styling and inside this panel body I'm
going to create a column that's going to
be ten units wide
so I'm going to use this class call - XS
- and we want this column to be ten
units wide
inside this column let's create a row
for that by using the bootstrap row
class and this row is going to contain
two columns we are going to use the
first column to display the employee
photo
and the second column to display the
employee details the first column will
be four units wide and the second column
will be eight units wide so let's create
those two columns in this row for that
we are going to create another
development and change the class on this
development to four because we want that
column to be four units wide let's
create another column and we want this
column to be eight units wide and in the
first column we want to display the
employee photo so let's use the image
element and bind to its source property
so here by using property binding but
that's just angular property binding in
detail in our angular 2 course so we
want to bind the source property of the
image element to the photo path property
of the employee object next inside this
column that is eight units wide I want
to create a row so let's make a copy of
this development and paste it right here
and we want this row to contain two
columns the first column is going to
display the field names that is gender
date of birth etc and the second column
is going to display the values male date
of birth value etc so we want each
column within that row to be six units
wide
so let's create a development and use
this class call - XS - six and let's
make a copy of this because we want two
columns each six units wide and in the
first column we want to display the
property name so first we want to
display gender so I'm going to type that
like that gender and then here we're
going to display the gender property
value again we're going to use
interpolation for that so let's use this
double curly braces and just before
displaying the value we want to display
this colon symbol as well so let's
include a cone before the interpolation
so now we are displaying gender in
addition to gender we want the other
properties so we need to include this
same row for every property that we have
in the interest of time I'm going to
copy and paste the code that we have I
mean the code is going to be exactly
similar but it's going to be for
different properties that we have date
of birth contact preference etc so let's
paste that code right here so here we
are binding to either to property
department email etc and we actually
have a typo here we want to display
gender property value so the field name
here is gender so we don't want name to
be displayed for gender so let's correct
this the property name is gender one
thing to note here is that by using the
date pipe right here to format the
display of date of birth again we
discussed pipes in detail in our angular
2 course finally let's take our list
employees component selector which is
bap - list - employees and then include
that as a directive in our route
component so here is our root component
view template let's open that and I'm
going to replace all this HTML with our
list employees component selector as a
directive and then let's run this
project so let's go back to the command
prompt and then execute this command in
G serve - oh there we go we have the
list of employees displayed but the
images are too bad let's limit the
height and width of the image element to
200 pixels for that but in the list
employee component CSS file let's
include an image class have set width in
height to 200 pixels and let's use this
class on the image element within our
list employees component view template
so on the image element right here let's
use that image class which limits the
height and width to 200 pixels so the
name of our class is
imageclass let's copy that and specify
it right here save our changes there we
go we have the employee photo displayed
as expected now I'm going to make one
more change within the route component
so I'm going to place this directive
inside the development with class
container this container class is a
bootstrap class again we are using that
class for styling notice now the
bootstrap panels are not occupying the
entire width of the browser we have one
more display problem here notice these
employee details they're not vertically
aligned in the center to align them in
the center I'm going to include another
CSS class but in our list employee
component CSS file let's name this class
vertical - aligned we have set display
two flags and we Ascenta aligning the
items let's use this vertical align
class in our list employees component
view template so on this development
that has the raw class I am going to use
this particular main class let's save
our changes notice now we have the
employee data center aligned as expected
so we have just seen how to perform the
read operation in our next video we'll
discuss how to set up routing in angular
