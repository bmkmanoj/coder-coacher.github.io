in this video well discus transforming
one XML format to another XML format
using link to XML in part 5 of this
video series we discussed transforming
XML to CSV and in part 6 transforming
XML to an HTML table in this video we
want to transform this format of the XML
to this format so notice that here the
root element is still students
underneath that root element we have USA
element so what is this USA element
that's nothing but this country
attribute now is actually turned into an
element okay and underneath that USA
element we have all the students
belonging to country USA and then we
have India element and all the students
belonging to India present underneath
that element so let's see how to convert
this format of the XML to this format so
let's flip to visual studio here I have
a new console application to which I
have already added the state or XML file
which contains our student data so
within the main method let's first
create a variable of type X document
let's call this XML document equals x
document dot load so we want to load
student data from this data or XML file
so let's open this project folder and
Windows Explorer copy the path
okay so this should load the XML data
from the XML file into memory so now
let's create an instance of X document
let's call it result and within the X
document the first XML element that we
want is students element so that's going
to be the root element it's a new X
element students and within the students
root element we want us a country
element so new x element and the name of
the element is going to be country and
underneath USA element we want you know
student element and all the students
belonging to country USA must be present
inside that USA element okay so we need
to read all students who belong to USA
from this XML document so we are going
to write our link very here so from s M
XML document dot descendents of student
element so this descendant method is
going to return all student elements but
we don't want all of them we only want
students who belong to the country USA
so we want to do some sort of filtering
here so where s dot attribute so how do
we know the students that belong to
country USA notice that it depends on
this country attribute value so we need
to read this attribute value so a strata
attribute what is the name of the
attribute country so if the value of
that attribute is equal to USA then
return those students okay so that's of
a link very so now what we want to do is
select a new x element and the name of
the X element must be student so
underneath USA element we want student
element
so student and you know that student
element is not going to have any
attributes so now underneath the student
element we want name gender and total
marks elements right so new x element
name and where are we going to get the
name from from this element right now
this element is actually getting the
student element but name gender and
total marks a child elements underneath
that element so we need to get a level
down and to do that yes dot element and
the name of the element is name and then
we want the value of that element okay
so that should give us named element and
then we want an element for gender and
total marks so agenda
total marks similarly we need to change
the names of the elements here gender
and total marks okay so let's close the
student element and we need to close the
country element as well so we are done
with us hey students now we want you
know a similar section for country India
so let's copy this piece of code and
then paste it right there
so here the country is going to be India
and from the XML document we only want
to retrieve students who belong to India
and the rest of the code is not going to
change in any way so now all that is
left is to close the students root
element and then the XML document itself
and then finally we want to save the
data that's present in this variable to
a file so result dot say and let's call
this so we want to save it to the same
folder so let's copy this part and let's
call this result dot XML all right so at
the moment we don't have result of XML
file within the project folder let's do
it and run this and notice that result
dot XML so we have the students root
element underneath students root element
we have country USA element and country
India elements within USA we have
students belonging to USA and within
India element we have students belonging
to India
that's it thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
