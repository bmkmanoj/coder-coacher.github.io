am venket this is part 9 of asp.net MVC
tutorial in this video we'll discuss
generating hyperlinks using action link
HTML helper please watch part eight
before proceeding with this video now we
want to retrieve the list of employees
that are present in this table TBL
employee and then we want to display
them on an Employee List page but then
in the employee list page I want to
display only the names of the employees
and those names must be hyperlinks so
for example when I click on mark name I
should redirect the user to the employee
details page maybe show the full details
of the employee upon which we have
clicked for example right here I clicked
on mark I am redirected to employee
details page and I can see marks full
details here so we have employee IDs 1
name mark
gender is mayor city is London and then
on this employee details page I have
another link here back to lists so when
I click on this hyperlink then we want
to redirect the user back to the
employee list so obviously to achieve
this the first thing to do is to add an
index action method to our employee
controller class so what is this index
action method doing look at this we are
creating an instance of the employee
context class and then we are using the
employees property that's present within
the employee context class which is
going to return the list of employees
back to us and then we are passing that
list to the view for rendering ok let's
see how to add this index action method
to our employee controller class so
let's flip to visual studio so we have
the employee controller here let's go
ahead and add an index action method so
let me copy this details method and then
paste it there and let's make the
changes as required so let's call this
index and we don't need any parameter
for this action method so let's get rid
of the parameter we need an instance of
the employee context class which is
going to establish a connection to the
database and then we are using the
employees property route to retrieve the
list of employees
and I am then going to convert that to
list and then we are going to create a
list of employee object and let's call
this employees and then let's hand this
employees collection to the view for
rendering now at the moment we don't
have a view that can you know basically
list the employees so let's go ahead and
add a view to our MVC project and to do
that right-click on the index action
method let's capitalize I in index
action method so click right click on
your index action method and then select
add view from the context menu look at
this the name of the view is indexed I'm
going to use razor view engine and we
want to create a strongly typed of view
okay and then my model class is going to
be the employee object remember we are
going to return I mean we are going to
give this list of employees to the view
for rendering so the model class is
still going to be employee ok and at the
moment I'm actually selecting the
scaffold template as empty we'll talk
about these careful templates in a later
video session so let's click Add which
should add you know index dot CSS HTML
view to the employees folder so I have
the employee folder of a new view is
added ok now look at this the first
change that we have to do for this view
is that looking at the moment the model
is in a 1 employee object and employee
object but in fact what are we actually
passing to the view we are actually
passing a list of employee objects ok so
I'm going to set the model as I
enumerable of employees meaning a list
of employees because list implements
ienumerable interface alright so what's
the thing we have to do now look at the
you know font style I'm here I'm using
Arial as the font family so the first
thing I'm going to do here I'm going to
use a div tag so Dave and let's say this
style is equal to
font-family s area alright okay and then
for the page I want the title to be our
employee list so I'm going to set the
title here as employee list let's copy
that and also set another heading to
employee list all right so what we need
to do now we need you know a bulleted
list or an unordered list okay so let's
go ahead and include an unordered list
that's the HTML and then look at what we
are doing here every employee's name is
rendered as a list item within that
unordered list okay so we need you know
basically we need to loop through each
employee so how do we get you know
access to the list you know we have the
model object here which is going to
receive the list of employees that is
handed over by the controller so I'm
going to use a for each loop so now from
the HTML mode I want to you know flip to
see shop
code mode and to do that I can use the @
symbol you know this tracer syntax so
for each employee so various employee
class present that's a model class an
employee class is present in MDC demo
dot models so let's go ahead and import
this namespace so that we don't have to
type the fully qualified name of the
employee class every time so what I'm
going to do I'm going to use at using
MVC model dot M Placida mode of models
and within that namespace we have our
employee class so for each employee
let's call the object as employee n
where is the list of employees present
in the model so I'm i can simply say at
model so what we need to do we need to
look through each employee object and
then we need to create a list item so
I'm going to create a list item okay
that's the opening and closing tag of
the
and within this list item we need to
generate you know a hyperlink which we
can click and when I click on that
hyperlink we want to redirect the user
to the employee details page so to
generate the hyperlink you know you can
a the hard-coded you know the string
like you can literally generate the
anchor tag there instead of that NBC
provides HTML helpers so I can use the
HTML helper so at HTML dot there is a
you know a helper method action link and
look at the intellisense now to generate
a hyperlink what are the things that we
need to know so obviously we need to
know the text the link text that's one
thing and the next one is the link to
which you want to redirect the user when
we click on that hyperlink okay so
minimum two things okay so obviously if
you look at this action link method it
has got them as parameters the first
thing is the link text so the link text
for us is going to be the name of the
employee so I'm going to say employee
dot name okay and the next parameter
action name so to which when I click
this hyperlink you know we need to
redirect the user to employee details
page and we need to fetch the employee
details and then give them to another
view which can render that so who you
know which controller action method is
actually doing the job of displaying you
know the details of employees we have
this details action method you know you
give it the ID of an employee you know
this a controller action method is going
to retrieve that employee details and
then hand them out to the view and the
details view that we have in this
employees employee folder is going to
render the details of that employee so
obviously we need to invoke this
controller action method details so the
controller action method is going to be
details and then another important thing
is that this method actually expects an
input parameter as well the ID of the
employee okay so how can I get access to
the ID of the employee you know you have
the employee object with you we can use
the parameter employee I mean the
property of that object employee ID okay
and we need to pass it to this
controller action method and look at
this there is another parameter you know
there are several overloaded versions of
this action link method you know we have
ten overloaded versions I'm going to use
an overloaded version which takes these
three parameters the link text the
action method that we want to redirect
the user when the user clicks on that
hyperlink and the route values the
parameters of any so I'm going to use
this object initializer syntax here and
remember the parameter name is actually
ID so I'm going to say new ID is equal
to employee dot employee ID okay so this
should generate the hyperlinks for us
okay so now let's go ahead and run this
and see if we get the output that we
expect so let's navigate to employee
controller and within that index action
method so which should invoke the index
action method within the employee
controller class and look at that I get
mark John Mary and Micah and I have a
semicolon there to get rid of that we
don't actually require the semicolon
right here so let's read get rid of that
save that let's rerun it
so we have the employee names now look
at this si hover my mouse over the
lengths on the status bar you can
actually see right here on the status
bar you can actually see the URL that
the user will be redirected to so I
click on mark look at that I am now
redirected to this page
you know the employee details page look
at that I'm going to the employee
controller detail section method and we
are passing one as the parameter okay
now on this page I need to you know have
another length it says back to list
obviously the same idea so I go back to
the details view and then after the
table I'm going to use the HTML you know
action link so at HTML dot action link
now I just need two parameters here the
link text and the action name watch the
link text that we want back to list so
that's what I am going to specify here
back to list and the next thing is to
which controller action method do we
need to redirect the user index action
method which is going to list the
employees so that's it and then just to
kind of format this problem let's
actually run this and say so I want to
rewrite the user to employ index page
and then I click on mark so I have this
back to list there I click on that link
and I go back click on John we have John
details and to format this properly what
I'm going to do here is I'm going to set
the style you know to area for the
entire form and to do that I'm going to
use a div tag here and then set the
style there
and then close the do tag and we don't
need the semicolon there let's run this
now and everything should be as it was
as it's on the slide so let's go to the
employee index action method so we have
the list of employees that I click on
maybe have Mary's details here I click
on back to list and I am back on the
employee list on this slide you can find
