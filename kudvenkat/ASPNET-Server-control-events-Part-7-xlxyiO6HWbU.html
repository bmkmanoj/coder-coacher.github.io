venket this is part 7 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll learn about
the events at an asp.net server control
level before continuing with the session
I strongly recommend to watch parts 4
and 6 of this video series in part 4 of
this video series we have discussed that
events can occur at 3 levels in an
asp.net web application events can occur
at the application level and examples of
application level events include session
start session and etc and application
level events reside in the global dot
aspx file events can also occur at the
page level and examples of page level
events include page load page
pre-rendered page unload etc and finally
the events can also occur at the control
level examples of control level events
include text change the event of a
textbox control click event of a button
control selected index change the event
of a drop-down list control and you can
find all these standard set of asp.net
server control within the toolbox under
so if you go to the web form and expand
the toolbox under the standard tab you
can find all the standard set of asp.net
server controls you have another tab
called validation tab and here you can
find another set of validation controls
and these controls expose validation
events now all these controls in asp.net
expose their own set of events and these
events can be classified into three
categories you know postback events what
are these postback events these even
submit the webpage immediately to the
server for processing and examples for
postback events include the click event
of a button control now let's understand
what we mean by postback event now look
at this on this web form I'm going to
the standard tab and dragging and
dropping a button control onto this
waveform now when I double click that
button control it's going to generate
the event handler and all I am doing
here is writing a message to the
response stream saying that button
clicked
all right so now let's go ahead and run
this so obviously when we run this
project the request for web form 1 is
going to go back to the web server and
then an instance of this platform gets
created and sent back to the client now
when I click this web form look at
what's going to happen as soon as I
click this the web form is immediately
submitted to the web server for
processing so the request goes to the
server the server creates an instance of
this web form process the page level
events the button click event and then
generates the HTML sends it back to the
client and destroys that platform so
once that HTML reaches the client you
know you see this message button clicked
why because in the click event we said
you know write this message back to the
response stream all right so that's the
post back events which will immediately
submit the web form to the server for
processing now we have another category
of events called cached events now what
do we mean by cached events these events
are saved in the page view state to be
processed when a postback event occurs
and examples of cached events include to
exchange the event of a textbox control
and along the same lines selected in the
exchanged event of a drop-down list
control let us actually see what we mean
by cached events now if you remember we
first dag dragged and drop the button
control and we understood that button
control expose a postback event now
let's drag and drop a textbox control
which again you can find in the standard
tab of the toolbox so I have this
textbox control let's double click that
now textbox has an event called text
changed so anytime you change the text
in a text box text change the event will
be fired okay so when I double click
that I have I have this even handler
automatically generated let's copy this
and paste here and then instead of
saying button clicked I'm going to say
text changed all right so now let's go
ahead and run this webform obviously now
along with the button control we should
also have textbox control now when we
click the button control look at this
that click event is fired the waveform
is immediately submitted to the
server for processing but whereas if we
look at this I am typing some text into
the text box and then I'm clicking away
from the text box look at this did the
page get submitted immediately to the
server for processing now so which means
this even now the text change the event
is now cache in the view state of this
page and when I click the button control
what's going to happen the cached event
will then be fired when the post bacc
occurs so when I click the button look
at look at what's going to happen so
fast the text changed even meaning the
cached event is fired and then the
button click event is fired actually
let's change this slightly let's put a
break element here so that the output
will be a little better all right let's
close this browser window let's run the
page once again actually let's put that
for the text change the event as well
all right let's run this now so now if I
click the button the page will be
immediately posted back to the server
but whereas when I type some text into
the text box look at this the text is
changed in the text box but it didn't
submit the page immediately to the
server for processing but when I post
the page back by clicking this button
control that's when the cached event is
fired okay so until you post the page
back to the server for processing the
cached events are cached in the view
state of this page and then when you
actually post the page back that's when
the cached event and the post back
events get executed together okay so
that's the cached events so these events
cached events are basically saved in the
page view state to be processed when a
postback event occurs to exchange the
event of a text box control and selected
index change the event of a drop-down
list control are examples of cached
events now you might be wondering okay
so now I don't want this text changed
event to wait until I click a button as
soon as I change the text in the text
box
I want the page to be submitted to the
web server for processing is that
possible
absolutely it's possible but you will
have to convert that cashed event of the
textbox control to a postback event so
how do we do that it's very simple to do
in asp.net all you will have to do is
select the control on the webform and
this control has got if you right click
that and if you go into the properties
window it has got this auto post bacc
property which is false by default
select that to true and if you look at
the help here auto post back what is
this doing this will automatically post
back to the server after the text is
modified so when we set this property to
true you're telling okay anytime the
text in this textbox changes submit the
page immediately to the server for
processing meaning convert that cached
event into a postback event let's see if
that's what is happening so let's run
this page now and let's type some text
into that so some text now for the event
to be fired the textbox has to lose the
focus and if it has to lose the focus
you can press tab here the moment I
press tab look at this the page got
submitted back to the server you know
for processing immediately so to convert
a cached event into perspective and all
you will have to do is to change the
auto post back property to true the same
is applicable for a drop-down list as
well alright so now we have another set
of events called validation events so
what are these validation events you
know basically we have a set of
validation controls within the tool box
you can find them under the validation
tab and these controls are used to
validate the user input before the form
is submitted back to the server for
processing we will be talking about
validation controls in detail in a later
session the idea of this video session
is basically to understand the different
types of events that these server
controls expose and how they interact
along with the page-level events in a
later video session we will talk about
all the events the standard asp.net
server controls expose and how to use
them along along the same lines we'll
also see how to use this validation
control
okay but for now just you know let's
take an example of required field value
data control let's rearrange this a
little bit let's take the button control
and put it after the textbook so all I
have here is the required field
validator a textbox in a button control
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
right click the required field validator
control go to its properties and then
there is one property called control to
validate now these validation controls
are used to validate you know the
controls on the webform so I want to you
know make sure that somebody enters
something into this webform before they
click the button in order to submit the
platform to the server for processing so
if I want to enter something is there in
the textbox I can make use of this
required field valid data now you'll
have to tell this required field
validator which control it has to
validate and you do that by using this
property called control to validate now
which control do I want to validate
textbox one all I have to do is select
that property that's it you can change
this error message if you want to you
know there's another property called
error message but we will not change
that now all right so I think I have hit
f5 by mistake all right so now let's go
ahead and run this and then when I click
the submit button without entering any
text I had I didn't enter anything into
the textbox I click the button look at
this required a field validator is fired
the page did get submitted to the server
if it if it got submitted then obviously
we would have caught that you know
button click to message but we didn't
get this which means this waveform is
now not submitted to the web server for
processing okay that's because we have
this validation event happening on the
client
even before the webform is submitted to
the server for processing so validation
events they happen on the client
actually there is a Java Script you know
which is emitted by this control which
runs on the client browser and that that
basically ensures that there is
something the user has typed into this
text box before the user can actually
submit this form to the server for
processing and that's what is validating
on the client so validation events
happen on the client so these events
occur on the client before the page is
posted back to the server
all validation controls use these type
of events so until now we have
understood that asp.net server controls
expose you know three types of events
postback events cached events and
validation events now in the previous
session we have seen even set the web
form level and if you remember these are
the events at the web forum level pre
initialization init init complete and we
have spoken about them in a great detail
in the previous session and if you
remember control events actually happen
after the page load event okay what are
the examples of control events we have
just seen a few of them click event
exchanged event okay so those events
happen after the page load event and
before load complete okay so let's see
them actually in action so if you look
at this so I I have this web browser the
client ok so I have if you look at on
the web form at the minute I only have
button control text box and a validation
control and if you look at the code
behind page all I have is the click
event of the button control text change
the event of the textbox control now I'm
going to copy paste these lines and this
is pretty simple again I've just written
pre-written this just to save some time
in typing and if you look at this this
is pretty simple code all we are doing
is having an event handler for all the
page level events and if you remember
these are the page level events we have
spoken about them in the previous
session so in pre Anette page pre Anette
what we are doing all we are doing is
printing this message similarly page
initialization printing that message and
we have all these page level events and
then the control leave in stem cells
button click 'next Xchange so now when I
run this platform with all these events
in place let's close that control f5 now
the web form should load and if you
don't type anything into the text box
and try
to submit the page look at this first of
all you know when we requested the web
form the web form instance is created
all the page level events are processed
look at this all the page level events
page pre init init init complete etc but
do you find the button click event or
the text change the event you don't
because why this is the initial get
request you didn't submit a page so
during the initial get request only the
page level even skipped process and once
the HTML is rendered back to the client
now user can type whatever he wants into
the textbox make any selections in the
drop-down list etc and then he click the
button to submit the page back to the
server for processing but now let's say
we don't enter anything into this text
box and try to submit this page
obviously there is a validation control
which is running on the client the
validation events happen on the client
even before the waveform is submitted to
the server and this will ensure that you
have entered something into the textbox
before actually submitting it okay so if
I type some text into the textbox and
then when I submit this page okay we
have this text you know if you remember
we turned on the auto post back property
of the textbox to true which converted
it into you know post back here and
let's flip that back to cached event so
how do we do that select the text box
set the auto post back property to false
let's close the webform let's run this
once again and now let's type some text
into the textbox and then when I click
away
it doesn't post the page back
immediately because the event is cached
now and when I click the button look at
what's going to happen the page gets
posted back as usual page pre init init
init complete preload
and then look at this text changed and
button click you don't see the load even
there okay let us see if we have the
even handle of a page load or not
it should be there if it's there then it
should be executed so we have page
preload but we don't have an event
handler for load even then that's the
reason why we don't see it there so
let's have an event for page load and
let's call this page load so let's close
this run that again enter some text
click the button look at this these are
all the page level events until page
load and after that the cached event is
fired and then the postback event and
then the rest of the page level events
page load complete pre-render and
pre-render complete so if you look at
this graph diagram that's what you know
if you have civil control events and
page level events together on a webform
and if it's submitted to the server for
processing how do they interact you know
the page level events happen as usual
until the load event and then any
control level events or process if you
have cached and post bacc events first
the cached events are processed and then
the post bacc events are processed and
finally the rest of the page level
events get processed and the response is
sent back to the server and page unload
happens finally on this slide you can
find resources for asp.net c-sharp and
sequels of interview questions that's it
for today thank you for listening have a
