tutorial in this video we'll discuss how
to show or hide columns dynamically of a
jQuery data table let me explain what I
mean
notice here just above this table we
have all the columns of this data table
listed now if I click on the ID column
link here if that column is already
visible in the data table we want to
hide it if it's already hidden then we
want to display it so we want to control
the visibility of these columns in this
data table using these links on the top
so let's see how to achieve this the
first step here is to get those links on
the page so let's flip to visual studio
this is the same example that we worked
with in the previous video session so I
strongly encourage you to watch the
previous video before proceeding with
this video so now we want those links
just above this data table right so that
data table is present inside the
development so just above that
development I am going to include an
anchor element and I'm going to set a
class so I'm going to call it show/hide
column this CSS class is not defined yet
we'll define that in just a bit and I'm
also going to make use of data -
attributes so data - I am going to set
column index and I'm going to set that
to 0 because this will be the link for
ID column and then we want a dash
similarly we want another hyperlink for
first-name so the column name is going
to be first name and index value is
going to be 1 so if you look at these
table headers here notice ID is the
first one so it's index position is 0
first name is 1 last name is 2 so on and
so forth ok so here we have the links
for ID first name similarly we need
those link elements for gender job title
etc in the interest of time I have
already typed the required HTML so let's
copy that from this notepad and paste
them right there ok so we have the
anchor elements for all our columns
and the column index matches with their
respective index position right alright
so let's go ahead and save these changes
and reload our page so we should get
those links on the top so we have those
links at the moment they are not
clickable hyperlinks that's basically
because we have not said the H ref
attribute okay another thing is we want
that text show / hide columns and let's
actually build that alright and we have
not defined this show/hide column class
yet so let's go ahead and define that so
within our head section I'm going to
include a section for style and I'm
going to specify this class show/hide
column now let's save these changes as
these and reload this page and look at
this at the moment you know when I have
the mouse over any of these links look
at that it's not changing to hand symbol
we want that to change to hand symbol so
I'm going to specify the cursive style
within our show/hide CSS class so I'm
going to set that to pointer and I'm
also going to change the color to blue
okay so let's save our changes reload
this page now they should be clickable
hyperlinks and just to get some padding
between those links and the state table
I'm going to wrap all of those anchor
elements inside a development and set
padding on that so let's include a
development
let's move this closing div right here
and I'm going to set the style attribute
let's set padding to 5 pixels and on the
left hand side we don't want any padding
so I'm going to set padding left to zero
pixels all right so let's save those
changes reload our page so now we got
some padding you know on the top bottom
and on the right-hand side but on the
left hand side padding is zero pixels
so it starts exactly at the place where
the border for this table starts okay
all right now look at this when I have
the mouse over these are like clickable
links now when I click on ID column if
that column is already visible we want
to hide it if it's not visible they want
to make it visible so let's see how to
control the visibility of these columns
using these links so this is the HTML
markup that's required and now we have
to write some jQuery code so here we
have this success callback function so
the function starts right here and it's
closing brace is right here so just
before that closing brace I'm going to
use a jQuery selector and find all those
anchor elements and if you look at those
anchor elements all of them have this
class show/hide column so I'm going to
use a class selector to find all these
anchor elements so let's find those
anchor elements using the jQuery class
selector so this should give us all
those anchor elements and I'm going to
wire up click event handler so we want
to wire up click event handler so when
the click event is triggered on any of
those link elements this is the function
that gets called so what do we want to
do at that point now when I click on any
of these links so if I click on ID link
here and if you look at that ID link
element it has got data dash column
index attribute and that contains its
index position value right so we want to
read that and using that index value we
are going to retrieve the respective
column from the data table and then
control its visibility okay so what I'm
going to do is first we need to retrieve
the table column that we are interested
in the one that we want to toggle its
visibility so I'm going to call this
table column equals and from our
previous video session if you remember
you know we have this variable right
here data table instance which holds a
reference to our data table so I'm going
to use that data table instance
variable and that has got column
function which is going to return us the
column that we are interested in now to
get the column we have to specify the
column index okay so for if you need ID
column then it's column index is zero so
if you pass 0 it's going to return that
ID column if you pass 1 then it's going
to return the first name column ok now
depending on which column the end user
has clicked on okay we are going to
retrieve its column index using this
data - column index attribute so that's
the attribute we want to read so here
I'm going to use dollar this so what is
this referring to here this refers to
the hyperlink element on which you have
played because we are within the context
of the click event handler of that
hyperlink element so dollar this dot I'm
going to use the ATT F function and ask
for data - column index attribute value
so that is going to return us the
respective hyperlink index value and we
are passing that to the column function
which is going to return as the column
from the data table and we are storing
that in this variable now using that we
can control its visibility so table
column dot I'm going to use visible
function and I'm actually going to pass
not of table visible so this is going to
give us the current visibility if it's
visible then we are applying the not
operator so it will turn it off if it is
not visible then it's going to make it
visible so let's save all these changes
reload our page now look at this ID
column at the moment is visible and I
click on that it is invisible now when I
click on it again look at that its
visibility is total similarly for
example if we take gender look at that
gender is gone I click on it again it
becomes visible
all right so here we have the HTML
markup and CSS and here the jQuery code
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
