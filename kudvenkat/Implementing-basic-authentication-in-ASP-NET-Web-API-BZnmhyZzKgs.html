tutorial in this video we'll discuss
implementing basic authentication in
asp.net Web API so here is what we want
to do we're going to have these two
tables users and employees if I log in
with mail username then we want to
authenticate that user and authorize him
to retrieve only male employees from
this employee's table similarly if we
login with female username then we want
to authenticate and authorize him to
retrieve only the female employees so
the first tip here is to create user's
table we already have the employees
table so let's flip to sequel server
management studio here is a sequel
script to create and populate users
table with test data
I'll have the script available on my
blog in case you need it
I've already executed this script so
here we have both the tables with test
data the next step is to update our ad
or dotnet entity data model so let's
flip to visual studio the ad or dotnet
entity data model is present in employee
data access project so let's double
click on this employee data model at the
moment we only have the employee's table
here so let's right-click on the
designer surface here and select update
model from database so this is going to
show us the users table so let's select
the users table and then click finish so
this should add users table to our ad or
dotnet entity data model the next thing
that we want to do is create a custom
class that's going to check if the
provided username and password are valid
so let's right click on our employee
service project ad and we want to add a
class file let's name this class file
employee security within this employee
security class we are going to have a
public method which is going to be
static and this method is going to
return boolean let's name this method
login this method is going to have two
parameters both of them of type string
the first parameter is username and the
second parameter is password now within
this class we are going to make use of
the entities that we have in our
employee data access project so let's
bring in employee data
taxes namespace so within our login
method let's create an instance of
employee DB entities class let's call
the instance entities equals new
employee DB entities so here we are
going to write a link statement which is
going to return true or false it returns
true if we have a matching username and
password in the database table otherwise
it's going to return false so return we
have the entity's instance dot users dot
na user such that user dot username dot
equals so we are going to compare the
user name with the provided username and
we want this comparison to be case
insensitive so string comparison dot
ordinal ignore case so when we compare
the username we are least worried about
the case sensitivity and we also need to
verify if the password match so user dot
password equals D provided password so
if both the username and password
matches then this link statement is
going to return true otherwise it's
going to return false
basic authentication is implemented as a
filter so we are going to create our own
custom attribute so let's right click on
our employees of its project ad and we
want to add a class file let's name this
class file basic authentication
attribute and this class is going to
inherit from authorization filter
attribute class and this class is
present in a different namespace let's
bring that namespace in system dot web
dot HTTP dot filters and we're going to
override a method that's present in this
base class and that method
is on authorization and notice this
method has a parameter action context
this parameter provides us access to
both the request and response object now
with basic authentication the client
sends the credentials using a header so
the request object has got headers and
we check for authorization header so
let's use this action context parameter
we are going to use the request property
to get to the request object and we are
going to check for headers and the
header that we are looking for is
authorization header if it is now then
that means the client has not sent the
credentials in that case we want to send
unauthorized response so let's go ahead
and create a response so action context
dot response equals we are going to use
the action context again dot request dot
create response this method is present
in a different namespace so let's go
ahead and bring in that namespace system
dot net dot HTTP
and we want to return unauthorized
status code so HTTP status code and this
HTTP status code Clause is present in a
different namespace and that is system
dotnet dot HTTP so let's bring in that
namespace and we want written
unauthorized so if the header is not
present then we know the basic
credentials are missing in that case we
return unauthorized
else if the header is there then we want
to retrieve the username and password
right so let's create a variable of type
string and I'm going to call this
authentication token equals again we're
going to use the action context object
dot request dot headers and we're going
to look in the authorization header and
we use the parameter property to get the
authentication token okay so here the
authentication token will be base 64
encoded so basically you know we are
looking for a username and password and
the way they will be sent is username
and password will be separated by a
colon like this and then this won't be a
regular string it will be base64 encoded
string that will be passed to the server
from the client so whatever we have in
this authentication token is going to be
base64 encoded and it will be in this
format username colon password so we
need to do two things in order to get to
the username and password first we need
to base64 decode that and then split it
using this colon and then retrieve the
username and password so first let's
base64 decode it to decode it from
base64 we are going to use the convert
class dot from base64 string and to this
one we are going to pass our
authentication token
so once it is decoded we need to
retrieve that string and to retrieve
that string we are going to use the
encoding class which again is present in
a different name space system dot txt so
let's bring in that namespace dot utf-8
dot get string so this is basically
going to return the decoded string and
let's store that in a variable of type
string let's call this decoded
authentication token okay so in this
variable we have the decoded
authentication token but again we still
have the username and password in this
format so we need to split that using
this : so the next thing that we are
going to do is on this decoded
authentication token let's use the split
method and we are going to split using
the colon symbol and what is the split
method going to do it's going to return
a string array basically in that array
we are going to have two strings the
first string contain the username and
the second string contains the password
so let's stir it in a variable of type
string array let's call this username
password array
so this username password array contains
our username and password now let's
create a variable let's call it user
name equals user name password array of
zero so that's going to give us the
username and similarly to get to the
password we use username password array
of 1 so now we have our username and
password now we need to do one more
thing we need to set the current
principle of the executing thread to
this username so we know you know the
username that we are using to execute
the code so f
now remember we have created a custom
class employee security which is going
to check within the database if de
provided username and password match so
we are going to make use of this class
here
so if employee security dot login and to
this we are going to pass username and
password so if the method returns true
what does that mean we have the username
and password in the database and in that
case we want to set so this thread class
is present in a different namespace
system threading let's bring that then
so we want to set the current principal
of the thread to new generic principal
and again this generic principal class
is present in a different namespace so
let's bring that namespace in that is
system dot security dot principal and we
are going to create a generic identity
here so let's create an instance of
genetic identity class and to this we
are going to pass the username so and it
also requires rules for now let's set
rules to now so basically here we are
creating a generic identity and a
generic principal and setting that as
the current principal for the thread so
if we have a matching username and
password this is what we are doing else
what do we want to do if the username
and password doesn't match then we want
to return unauthorized response so let's
do the same thing here so we have you
know our basic authentication attribute
now we have set the current principal of
the thread to the identity of the user
so now let's modify the get method
within our employees controller to
return you know only male employees
we are logged in with mail username and
only female employees if we are logged
in with female username within our
employees controller let's make use of
the authenticated user name so with our
employees controller we have our get
method here so within this get method I
am going to create a variable of type
string let's call this username equals
thread the thread class is present in
system dot threading let's bring that
namespace in dot current principal dot
identity dot name now remember within
our basic authentication attribute we
are setting the current principal of the
executing thread to the authenticated
user name so we are retrieving that
authenticated user name right here and
we know this username is going to be
male or female now if the user name is
male then we want to retrieve only male
employees and if it's female then we
want to retrieve only female employees
so the authorization we are going to do
it here so we are going to switch on the
username so if the username is male then
we want to return only male employees if
it is female then we want to return only
female employees if it is default that
is if it's not male or female then we
simply want to return a bad request we
don't want any message so let's get rid
of this message from here so if it's not
male a female we are simply going to
return a bad request so here we have
modified the kept method within our
employees controller to return only male
employees if we are logged in with male
username and it's going to return only
female employees if we are logged in
with female username to keep things
simple let's remove this require HTTPS
attribute from the get method
now the basic authentication attribute
that we have just created this can be
applied on a specific controller
specific action or globally on all web
api controllers to enable basic
authentication across the entire web api
applicate
can register this basic authentication
attribute as a filter using the register
method in our Web API config class so
just like how we have registered they
require HTTP attribute in a similar way
we can register the basic authentication
attribute as a filter which is going to
enable basic authentication across our
entire web API application we can also
apply the attribute on a specific
controller for example if we apply it on
the employees controller like how we
have apply the enable course attribute
then it is going to be applicable for
all methods within our employees
controller in our case let's just enable
basic authentication for this ket method
so let's decorate this with our basic
authentication attribute let's save our
changes and give our solution and Bill
let's test basic authentication using
fiddler notice here we are issuing a
request to slash API slash employees
this calls get method within our
employees controller notice this get
method is decorated with basic
authentication attribute but with the
request that we have issued using
fiddler we have not specified any
credentials so when we execute this
notice we get status code four zero one
unauthorized so we need to specify the
credentials as well
so if you look at this basic
authentication attribute that we have
created we are using authorization
header to retrieve the username and
password so with the request that we
have issued in fiddler we are going to
use authorization header to specify user
name and password we are using basic
authentication so we need to specify the
string basic and then followed by that
user name password string and remember
username and password should be in this
format username coolant password we have
a username female and the password for
that is female but we cannot specify the
coolant separated username and password
in this format we will have to
base64 encode this there are many
websites that help us do that if you
just google with this string base64
encode the first website that you'll get
is this one base64 encode dot org and in
this website you can paste your username
password string in this text box and
then when you click this button we get
the base64 encoded string so let's copy
it and specify it in fiddler now let's
execute this now notice we get status
code 200 okay and if you look at the
JSON data that we got notice we only got
female employees because we have used
female username now on the other hand
let's try and use male username the
password is also male let's click this
encode button to get the encoded string
let's copy this and specify it here so
when we execute this we should only get
male employees so if we look at the JSON
data notice we only have male employees
now what happens if we use an invalid
username and password let's say ABC and
ABC we don't have such username and
password
let's encode that first copy it and
specify it right here so now when we
execute this request
we should get unauthorized so notice we
get status code for 0 1 unauthorized as
expected on this slide we have employee
security class code and on this slide we
have basic authentication attribute
class code now if we navigate to
localhost employees dot HTML and when we
click this get all employees button
notice we don't get the data that we
expect and if we inspect this request in
fiddler we got four zero one
unauthorized now if you look at that
HTML page in visual studio we are using
jQuery AJAX to call the Web API servers
but we are not passing the basic
authentication credentials and that's
the reason why we are getting four zero
one on
rise in our next video we'll discuss how
to pass basic authentication credentials
using jQuery AJAX thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
