am venket this is part 5 of dartnet
basics in this session we'll understand
how the dotnet runtime environment finds
the Assemblies that it requires during
program execution
to understand this better we'll actually
look at an example I have a simple
console application here to this console
application solution I'm going to add
another project let's add a class
library project ok visual seizure
programming language class library and
let's call this a class library click OK
so we have a class library project and
within this class library project I'm
going to have a very simple class called
sample and as part of this class let's
have a simple static method that returns
a string and let's say maybe get message
is the name of the function and all this
does is returns a string
all right so we have a very simple class
library project here okay now if we want
to use this class library project within
this console application obviously we
have to refer to that assembly so let's
build a solution so that we have the
assembly generated now go into the
references folder right click add a
reference and we are going to dig
through okay class library project bin
and debug folder we select the class
library assembly okay so we told the
console application we are going to use
this class library so we go into the
console application class and we use the
using directive using class library okay
and we know that within this class
library assembly we have got a sample
class within which we have get message
static method which returns a string and
now if we run this as you might expect
it's going to print that string onto the
console all right now let's see if you
look at this program this control
application it's actually making use of
this class library assembly ok and
that's how customers which we have
created ok now let us see when we
execute this project how does the dotnet
runtime environment finds the you know
in this case the class library assembly
that it requires ok
so now when we added the reference as
you might have expected what would have
happened is it would have copied this
class library projects assembly into the
bin folder of this particular project so
if I go ahead and open this folder in
Windows Explorer if we get into the bin
and debug directory you should see a
class library project I mean assembly
and then the console application
assembly itself so when we run this we
should be able to execute now for this
application to be you know to properly
execute all we need is two files one is
this executable and we know this
executable is the console applications
assembly and this depends on this class
library assembly
because we are making use of the
sampleclass which is present in this
class library assembly so we need that
assembly as well and apart from that
this program also requires the system
assembly from dotnet framework okay
because the console class is present
within the system or some way okay we'll
not worry about that piece at the moment
all we are worried is I mean if you have
understood until now for the console
application to execute it requires this
executable and this assembly okay so
let's just extract those two let's just
copy them and put them into a specific
folder so let's say I have C Drive and
my application ok and let's copy post
those two assemblies here
and now all you need for this console
application to run is these two
assemblies so when I execute this it
works out without any problem okay now
let's do one thing let's delete this
assembly from here
okay I'm going to delete that okay
instead of deleting it I'm going to cut
that and maybe create another folder or
just paste it in this C Drive for the
time being so if you go to my
application here you only have the
assembly so you don't have the main I
mean the dependent of somebody the class
library assembly so when I execute this
at runtime CLR checks this Assembly's
manifest let's see what happens when we
execute this so when we execute this as
you might have expected look at this
system dot IO dot file not found
exception okay so it's not able to load
this class library assembly okay if you
remember what we have done is we have
just moved that assembly from this
folder onto another into another folder
okay so how does the I mean what is the
search logic behind the runtime
environment trying to find this assembly
it's very simple actually you know if
you look at the presentation here all it
does is first of all dotnet figures out
what version is needed okay in this case
what has actually happened is okay let's
close this first
okay so when we execute this program
when we execute this program what
happens is the dotnet runtime
environment checks the manifest of this
assembly okay and in the manifest if you
don't know about what an Assemblies
manifest is please check the previous
tutorials in this video series we have
already discussed about that in a great
detail so what happens at runtime the
run the CLR basically checks this
Assembly's manifest which contains the
information about all the other
dependent assemblies like what's the you
know for example in this case this
console application depends on class
library assembly okay so it checks that
in in this assemblies manifest okay
which version is required and then what
it does if if the dependent assembly is
a strongly named doesn't they look at
this so dotnet figures out what version
is needed usually this information is is
the information about the dependent
assemblies is present in the
applications assembly manifest CLR
checks that as well as it also checks
the configuration files you know every
applicant in this example we didn't use
the application configuration file for
example here we have app config this is
nothing but the configuration file okay
every application usually has that
irrespective of the type of the
application because ours is such a
simple application we don't have any
configuration specified that's why we
didn't use that but in reality we do use
configuration files and there are
several configuration files like
application config file within the
subdirectories you can have more
configuration files which will
effectively override this configuration
file similarly at the machine level we
have a machine that config file that's
another configuration file for all the
dotnet assemblies that execute on this
machine so there are several layers of
this configuration files that can be
present in addition to these
configuration files you can also have
policy files okay so what dotnet runtime
environment basically does is it
basically checks the assembly manifest
it also checks the configuration files
if there is any overridden information
for example
the Assemblies manifest it might be
version 1.0 but in your configuration
file you can overwrite that okay instead
of loading 1.0 assembly load this
assembly you can overwrite that
information using any of these
configuration files so dotnet runtime
environment checks these configuration
files as well
for any overridden information and then
if it is a strongly named assembly it
searches the GAC but in our case if you
look at this assembly class library
assembly we did not sign that that the
private or public key pair so obviously
it is not a strongly named decimal it's
a week named assembly so if it's a week
named assembly dotnet doesn't search the
CAC because we know that you cannot
install a week named assembly into the
GAC ok that's why it doesn't care to
search for class library assembly in the
gag okay then what it does
it checks ok so this is a week named
assembly and there is no overridden
information in the configuration file ok
and it doesn't check the GAC so what it
does now at this point is if the
assembly is not found in the gecko
obviously it doesn't even care in this
case because it's a week named assembly
and if there is a config file in the
config file you can actually specify ok
instead of searching in this location go
to this location search for the assembly
at this location you can specify that in
the config file so it so if there is a
config file and if you specify the
location there it searches the dotnet
runtime environment searches that
location but in our case we don't have a
config file at all I mean there is a
config file but we didn't specify any
information and if as a matter of fact
we moved the control applications
assembly and the class library assembly
into this folder so there are no other
files so obviously in our case we are
not making use of configuration file to
specify another directory to search so
what's going to happen at that point it
will then search the directory where the
executable is present in our case it
looks in this assembly and it didn't
find that here as well so at this point
it searched all the possible locations
for the dependent
it didn't find that finally what's going
to happen the application will terminate
with an error and that's what has
happened because if you look at this in
this folder it didn't find that assembly
and it terminated with an arrow okay but
then in reality this is what is the
dotnet Assembly resolution algorithm
that is usually used okay all right so
if I move the assembly back into this
folder from C Drive it should work so I
have this assembly here class library so
if I take that and if I move into again
this folder and then try to execute this
what happens it finds that assembly
within the folder we have the executable
and it executes that okay another
important thing to keep in mind is that
version checking is not done for weekly
named assemblies now this is very
interesting and important to keep in
mind let me show you that with an
example
let's open visual studio command prompt
so that we can use the il desam tool so
let's run that as an administrator and
then let's invoke il desam okay so we
have this il desin tool let's open this
console applications executable with
this il Dasom and it's present in my
application open that so if you look at
the manifest of the executable in the
manifest you should see that okay this
executable this executable is dependent
on class library assembly version 1.0.0
dot 0 okay now what's going to happen if
I change this version of the assembly to
tube 2.0 is that going to make any
difference absolutely no because why
4-week name doesn't is it doesn't really
care about you know the version number
numbers and that's why these assemblies
can cause DLL hell as well okay so if
somebody I mean if I have downloaded a
program from the internet for example
and when I downloaded that program let's
say accidentally that program had class
library as the name of that
assembly it would have overridden this
assembly and maybe the methods within
that assembly would have been changed
and this specific executable looks for
that specific methods within that
assembly it will not find them and then
you have the application crash and that
is this is what is termed as DLL hell
however we'll talk about DLL hell in a
great detail in the next session with an
example but let's but but like right now
let's understand this okay and if you
open this class library assembly with
them with the il desam tool so let's
open the class library assembly and if
you look at this class library assembly
it's version 1.0 so your executable
needs version 1.0 of class library and
you have that within this folder so it
executed now instead of assembly version
1.0 if I have version 2.0
well my application run it will happily
run why because version checking is not
done for week named assemblies and if
you remember we did not sign this class
library assembly with a private public
key pair so it's still weakly named
let's look at that practically now let
me go ahead and change the version
number of the class library file from
1.0 to 2.0 so I am changing that to 2.0
let's build this project so I'm building
that let's open that folder in Windows
Explorer go into the bin debug copy that
and move that to my application folder
paste it it will ask you to copy and
replace and I'm gonna do that and now
when I run ok we have this open so we
need to close that
let's paste it again copy and replace
that so it's copied and replaced now if
I ran my console application look at
this it's happily running and if you
check the version of class library now
it should be 2.0 so let's open IL Dasom
so if i open class library and if you
look at the version version it's 2.0 but
if you open the executable the
executable manifest tells you it
requires class library assembly of
version 1.0 but this version is 2.0 in
spite of that my console application is
still running without any issues and the
reason is very simple for week named
assemblies the runtime environment
doesn't care about the version number as
long as the assembly is there and as
long as the methods that your console
application is dependent upon are there
with the same name then same return
types your application is going to run
without any issues but on the other hand
if your class library assembly was
strongly named assembly then all this
would have failed let's look at that
example now let's let's make the class
library assembly strongly named and then
we will see how it works for strong name
doesn't lease ok let's go ahead and
delete this assemblies all right so if
we want to convert this assembly into a
strongly named assembly all you have to
do is sign this assembly with a private
public key pair and if you remember we
can use the strong naming tool to do
that and using that tool we have already
generated a key pair in our previous
sessions which is present in our C Drive
so let's copy that and if you're not
sure how to do this please check our
previous videos alright and we use the
assembly key file attribute
and to the constructor of this we pass
in the name of the assembly key file
since it is present in C Drive C colon
backslash backslash to escape the
backslash and now let's do this let's
get rid of this assam this reference and
let's change this version for 1.0 so we
are strongly naming this assembly and we
are changing the version to 1.0 since we
have removed the assembly reference you
know we need to comment this otherwise
our application will not compile so
let's rebuild the solution okay now what
happened we strongly named this class
library assembly okay
so now let's go ahead and add a
reference to that strong named assembly
so add a reference to that class library
assembly so this is strongly named and
we added a reference to that assembly
now we can uncomment this and when we
run this it should work as before
without any issues the only difference
now is that we strongly named class
library assembly okay now let's open the
introduction to c-sharp console project
open that in Windows Explorer go into
the bin debug and take these two
assemblies and let's put them in my
application folder and now if I execute
it should work without any issues now if
you quickly look at class library
assembly and console application at this
point using il Dasom so if we open the
class library assembly and if you look
at that class library assemblies version
1.0
okay and we have the manifest of class
library assembly itself now let's go
ahead and open the console application
so when I open the console applications
assembly and if we look at the manifest
right now look at this it is now this
controller application is now dependent
on this class library assembly whose
public key token is this one and whose
version is 1.0.0 now for some reason
instead of version now now this assembly
this class library assembly is a
strongly named assembly instead of
version 1.0 if somebody puts you know
version 2.0 in here
it wouldn't work now because if it's
strongly named the runtime environment
does check for version correct version
match if there is a version mismatch it
will not bind that assembly to this
executable and immediately throws an
exception let's see how to do that okay
let me change the version of the class
library assembly from maybe 1.0 to 2.0
okay now let's close this il desam let's
go to my application execute this it
works now but if we change the assembly
version 2.0 build that last library
project get into the bin folder of that
project copy that assembly and move that
to my application see what's going to
happen so I copy that move that into my
application folder let's copy and
replace that now let's execute that and
before that let's see let's open IL des
and once again look at the exit control
application and if you look at the
manifest
it requires class library assembly
version 1.0 and this is the public key
token it starts with 58 now let's look
at class library assembly if you look at
class library assembly it's version
12.04 console application requires 1.0
but if you look at the class library
assembly itself it has got the methods
with exact the same signature we need
okay but
ever now if I try to run this
application it's going to fail
okay so let's execute this look at this
you got that file load exception could
not load file or assembly class library
version 1.0 why because here we have
version 2.0 and we didn't have this
problem when the class library was not
strongly named because why the dotnet
runtime environment doesn't care to
check the versions you know whether
versions will match if they are if they
are not strongly named but if they are
strongly named it does care about it and
that's why we have this error all right
so so since this is strongly named it
has to be version 1.0 so on the other
hand if I come back you know change that
to version 1.0 and then build the
solution and put it back into that
folder it should work as before so build
that open folder and Windows Explorer
get into the bin debug take that and
move into my application folder it
should work now so copy it copy and
replace execute this it should work now
we know that the resolution algorithm is
very simple dotnet figures out what
version is needed in this case it
figured out that okay it requires dotnet
version I mean class library version 1.0
and then we didn't override that
information in any of the applications
or machine configuration files so what
it does it searches CAC because it's
strongly named assembly so it searches
cat obviously we didn't put this class
library assembly in the GAC so it
wouldn't find it there and it comes back
okay it didn't find it in the gag so
what it does
okay checks okay is there an application
configuration file and is there any
other you know configuration there to
find the assemblies and obviously we
don't have that then what it will do
finally it will check the application
folder which contains the executable it
finds it there and then successfully
executed on the other hand if you move
it from here to anywhere else then the
program will crash okay now since this
is a strongly named assembly
if you think this applique mean this
assembly is going to be reused by
multiple applications running on this
machine it is safe to move it into the
gap when you move it into the gap then
it need not be present in this folder
let's do that actually let's try to
install that into the gap and obviously
to install that into the gap we can make
use of
gack utility so CD backslash let's go to
my application folder so CD my
application and here we can use the GAC
util - - I and we can use this is the
name of the to assembly so copy it and
paste that so the moment we do that
what's going to happen this assembly is
now going to be installed into the dag
now if I delete that from here and if I
execute this program it should still run
why because we know that it will search
GAC and it will find that assembly there
so let me run that and look at this it
still runs why because our assembly is
now present in the gap so dotnet
Assembly resolution algorithm is very
simple and straightforward there is no
complexity whatsoever no you know no
registration of assemblies nothing of
that sort it's very simple and
straightforward on this slide you can
find resources for asp.net and C sharp
interview question that's it for today
