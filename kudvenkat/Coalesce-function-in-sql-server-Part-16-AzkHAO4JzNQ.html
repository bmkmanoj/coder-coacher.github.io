venket this is part 16 of signal server
in this session we'll understand how to
use coulis function with an example now
according to the MSDN books online
Coley's function returns the first non
null value let's understand what we mean
by this now if you look at this employee
table here we've got ID first name
middle name and last name columns and
look at these employees some of them
have just their first name some of them
have the middle and last name and some
of the employees have just the last name
now we want to write a query which pulls
out the ID and the name of the person as
you can see on the slide now when you
pull out in when you pull out the name
okay if the employee has caught the
first name you pull that out okay but
where as if an employee does not have a
first name and if he has middle and last
name then we want to pull their middle
name okay and if an employee doesn't
have first name and middle name and if
he has only the last name then we want
to pull their last name okay but whereas
if an employee has both first and middle
name then we just want their first name
similarly if he has all of their names
you know first middle and last names
then still we just want their first name
so the priority should first go to their
first name if that's present pull it out
if not then middle name if first and
middle name both of them are not
available only then we pull the last
name okay so that's how our output has
to be all right so in order to do that
pee-yew we can use the coolest function
now if you look at the query here too
the coolest function you're passing in
look at this in the output we want the
ID and the name of the person so
obviously in the Select list we'll have
ID and then to pull out the name we are
using the coolest function we are not
saying first name middle name last name
directly we are passing those column
names into this college function look at
the definition of the college function
it returns the first normal value so
what's going to happen when you execute
this query this college function will
check okay
in this row is the first name available
yes the first name available so first
name is not null so it will immediately
return Sam okay but whereas when it
comes to the second row it checks okay
is the first name available no its null
so what happens it checks the middle
name
okay is middle name present yes then
what is that you know it's not null it's
present so it's going to return that
middle name which is Tod similarly it
comes to the third row it checks okay is
first name now yes it is not so it goes
to the middle name okay its middle name
null yes it is still now so it goes to
last name okay and then return Sara so
we get that but come here to the fourth
row when it comes here the first name
itself is present it doesn't even bother
to check the middle name okay because
Cooley's function returns the first non
null value okay so cool a is first name
middle name last name and we are giving
it an alias name from TBL employee okay
let's quickly write this query and see
the result in action so if you look at
this we exactly have the same table here
and we want to select their ID so select
ID and what else we want we want the
name of the employee okay but we want to
use the coolest function so colace what
do we want we want to pass into this
function first name the middle name and
last name so when we pass these three
columns
whichever column returns the first
normal value that value will be used in
the output and we want to give this
column in a yes let's call it name and
from which table are we trying to
retrieve this from the employee table so
TBL employee so let's execute that okay
so if you look at this we get the output
that we expected
on this slide you can find resources for
asp.net and C sharp interview questions
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
