in this video we'll discuss creating
image gallery with thumbnails we'll be
taking advantage of even bubbling
concept to achieve this here is what we
want to achieve we want to display the
images using thumbnails and then once we
click on a specific thumbnail we want to
retrieve its image and then display that
but in the main image as you can see
here so let's see how to achieve this
for the purpose of this demo we'll be
using the images that can be found on a
Windows machine at this part C colon
users public pictures sample pictures
now let's take the first five pictures
from this folder let's flip to visual
studio here I have an empty asp.net web
application project to this project
let's add a new folder let's change the
name of the folder to images and paste
the images that we have just copied into
this folder and within this HTML page
within the head section let's include a
section for styles so style type equals
text slash CSS now here we are going to
include a style for the image element so
basically this style is going to be for
the thumbnail image elements so if you
look at the thumbnails the height of the
thumbnail is going to be 100 pixels
width is going to be 100 pixels and the
border around the thumbnail to be 3
pixel solid gray color so height 100
pixels width 100 pixels and border 3
pixel solid gray and within the body
section the first thing that we need is
an image element so let's include an
image element here and the height of the
image element is going to be 540 pixels
width is going to be 540 pixels and the
border of this main image element
is also going to be three pixel solid
clay just like the thumbnail element and
let's set the source attribute of this
image element to the first image within
the images folder so source equals false
large images for slash the first image
name and let's give this image an ID
let's call this main image and let's
include an HTML break and then we need
five image elements to display these
five thumbnails so image and the style
class of this image element is going to
be this image style class which we have
written and let's set the source of this
first image thumbnail to the first image
within the images folder similarly we
need four more image elements to display
the thumbnails and to speed things up I
have already written that code so let's
copy and paste it here so we have four
more thumbnails alright so with all
these changes let's run the page notice
that we have thumbnails and the main
image element so now look at this when
we click on thumbnails nothing happens
okay so let's write a function to change
the image in the main image element when
a thumbnail is clicked so lets include a
section for script within the body
section script type equals text slash
JavaScript and here I'm going to write a
function let's call the function change
image enter this function we are going
to pass event object
now in this example we are going to take
advantage of even bubbling concept now
if you look at these thumbnails in our
example we just have five thumbnails but
in real world you may have ten hundred
who knows now this function okay we are
going to associate this function as the
even handler in our four click event to
another element which is going to be the
parent of all these image elements so
I'm going to include a development here
give it an ID let's call it my dev
and all these thumbnail image elements
will be wrapped inside that div element
so what is the advantage I am going to
get out of it now instead of associating
this even handler method as an even
handler for the click event for all
individual image elements I can
associate that with this development
okay when the click event on any of the
image occurs it's going to bubble up to
its parent and this div element is going
to handle that click event for the image
okay so what advantage is that going to
give that's going to you know make the
life of assigning even handler much
easier instead of assigning this as the
even handler for five different image
elements you can just associate as a the
handler for this one development okay so
on click I'm going to call this function
change image and then the event object
gets passed to the even handler method
okay so the event is handled at the div
element level not at the specific image
element level okay so here we are using
the concept of even bubbling so now here
we are going to say event is equal to
event or vendo dot
event now why do we need this or
condition here that's for compatibility
with ie8 and earlier versions in ie8 and
earlier versions if you need to get
window object we use window or even
property okay and I'm going to create a
variable here I'm going to call this
target element equals event dot target
or event dot SRC element okay so what is
this going to do now notice the click
event is handled at the div element
level now this target property is going
to return as a reference to the HTML
element on which the actual click event
occurred here the click event is going
to happen on the individual thumbnail
image elements okay
to get hold of that image element on
which that click event actually occurred
were using the target property so this
target element is going to contain the
image element on which the click event
occurred so if target element is equal
to image now if this is confusing don't
worry we'll understand that in just a
bit actually let's comment that line for
the time being so what I'm going to do
now is so this target element is going
to be our thumbnail so we want to
retrieve the source attribute value of
the thumbnail and then set that as the
source for this main image element so
first I'm going to use here on document
dot get element by ID and the ID of the
main image element is main image and
then I'm going to set the source
attribute of this one to target element
get attribute of source
so very straightforward code we are
taking the target element source
attributes value setting it as the
source for the main image element and
then we are calling this function on
click off that development
okay we are associating it as the click
event handler now let's run this let's
save all the changes now reload the page
and let's click on this notice that the
image is changed as expected now let's
click in between these image elements
and see what's going to happen look at
that I am clicking in between the image
elements and look at what happens to
main image nothing gets displayed that's
basically because when you click in
between the image elements you know the
source attribute of the main image is
going to become now because you know
obviously when you click in between it
doesn't have a source element okay I
mean source a value for source attribute
as a result the main image element
source attribute becomes now so to
account for that situation we are going
to have this check so if the target
element is an image element only then
retrieve the source attribute value of
that target element and then set that as
a source for the main image element so
let's save these changes reload the page
and now look at this when we click in
between nothing happens but when you
click on the image it should change
let's see why it's not changing
so let's save these changes reload the
page click on the image for some reason
look at this the image is not changing
after we have included this check right
here so document dot get element by ID
setting the source
so if target element dot tag name that
check we have to use so that's going to
return us the tag name of the target
element so if the tag name is image only
then do this that's the reason why it's
not working so now when we click on the
individual thumbnail look at that it
works as expected
okay another thing that we want to do is
when we hover the mouse over this
thumbnail we want to change the cursor
style to a hand symbol and then we want
the border to be changed to red color so
let's see how to achieve that so within
the scripts section I'm going to create
a variable let's call this images equals
document dot get element by ID so get
this div element my div and then within
that development get me all elements by
tag name so which basically have this
tag name image so now this variable
contains all these image elements so I'm
going to use a for loop here for why I
is equal to 0 I less than images dot
length I plus plus images of I dot on
mouse over so we are associating a you
know an even handler for onmouseover
event of all these image elements so
onmouseover we want to execute a
function which is basically going to
change
this style so this dot style dot cursor
equals we want the cursor style to be
hand and we want the border color to be
red so this should happen on mouse-over
similarly onmouseout so onmouseout we
want the cursor style to be pointer and
border color to be gray
so with these changes let's reload the
page and notice that when I hover the
mouse over because the changes to hand
and body changes to red
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
