in this video well first discuss the
basics of regular expressions and then
look at some of the resources and tools
available to learn write and test
regular expressions first let's look at
some of the basic regular expressions
and to test our basic regular
expressions
I found an excellent tool called
expresso and here is the URL from where
you can download it so once you visit
that website so here is that website and
on this page expresso download dot HTM
you can actually download the expresso
set up three dot MSI and then you know
double click on that and follow the
on-screen instructions to install it
I've installed this tool already on my
machine and here it is notice that at
the moment we are on test mode and we've
got four windows here so this window
right here is where we write our regular
expression and this sample text window
contains the sample tags you know
against which we want to test our
regular expression and the results will
be displayed in the search results
window and here we have the regular
expression analyzer so let's look at an
example now let's say for example in
this text right here I want to find the
word expression so I want to find the
occurrences of the word expression so I
simply type the word expression so this
is a regular expression by itself so I
want to find this word expression so I
type the word and then I click run match
notice that here on the status bar it
says there are five matches so in this
entire sample text there are five
occurrences of this word expression now
that's the first occurrence look at this
as I select you know the result here it
shows within the sample text where it
has found a match now look at this
expression here is actually part of this
bigger word expressions now let's say we
want to do a whole match word okay we
want this expression to be you know a
whole
if that's the case we have to define a
word boundary so backslash B at the
beginning and at the end indicates that
we want to find this word expression as
a whole word not as part of another word
here expression is part of this word
expressions so now this backslash P at
the beginning and e at the end of the
word defines a word boundary so now when
we click run match notice that we only
get four matches of this word expression
and you know all the four occurrences
notice that expression is a word by
itself it's a whole word and not part of
any other word like expressions now /d
in regular expression indicates a digit
now let's say for example I want to find
all occurrences of numbers or digits
okay within this sample text I simply
type /d and look at this when we click
run match it finds all digits all
numbers within this sample text right
now let's say for example I want to find
a five digit number okay so I can
include five DS like this backslash d
backslash t backslash T five times now
when I click run match notice that I get
all the numbers which have at least five
digits so when I select nine five seven
zero six that's the number there look at
this this 800 is not selected because it
does not have five digits in it and nine
zero two zero right so we get all the
numbers which have got at least five
digits now let's say we want to get all
the numbers which has exactly five
digits so if that's the case we want
that number to exist as a whole number
we don't want for example if you look at
this three four three four five you know
it has got five digits and it's part of
this bigger number right here so we
don't want that
okay we want a number which has exactly
five digits with a net so if that is the
case again we can define a word boundary
like this / b + / pay so we want this
five digit number you know to contain
exactly five numbers separated by a word
boundary so now when we run the match
notice that we only have two occurrences
so there we have a number with exactly
five digits and there we have another
number with exactly five digits now
notice here / D is repeated five times
now since we want a five digit number
that's easy to tie but let's assume let
you know we want a 30 digit number
typing / D 20 times is tedious
error-prone and it also makes your
regular expression long enough so to
avoid these unnecessary repetitions we
use curly braces in regular expressions
so if you want to say I want to have
five repetitions of any digit then you
know include / D and then include a set
of curly braces and within that we
specify number 5 so / D and 5 within
curly braces indicates that we want this
/ D to repeated 5 times so now when we
run the match notice that we get you
know the numbers we just got exactly
five digits now we can also rewrite this
another way we can also say instead of
saying backslash D to indicate a digit
we can also use square brackets and
within square brackets I'm going to say
I want to find any character in the
range 0 to 9 with exactly 5 repetitions
meaning I want a five digit number a
number which contains exactly five
digits it has got the same meaning as
the example before so now when we run
the match again we should get two
occurrences of a five digit number
within this sample text
now let's say we want to find all the
verbs with exactly five letters then you
know let's say within this range A to Z
that is more letter A to Z and cap the
letter A to Z I want to find any
characters with exactly five repetitions
so I want all the words which have got
exactly five characters so now when we
execute this notice that we get all
words which has got exactly five letters
match after match again click etc so
there are 37 matches brackets and
regular expressions are used to find a
range of characters for example if you
include a to Z in square brackets it
implies that we want to find any of the
characters you know in the range from A
to Z similarly I want to find any of the
digits in the range from A to Z a pipe B
within parenthesis means we want to find
any of the characters a or B so these
are the very basics of regular
expressions if you want to learn more
about regular expressions here are some
of the resources now this link right
here from Mozilla has got you know very
good resources to learn the basics of
regular expressions so once you visit
this you that URL and once you scroll
down notice that here we have a table
which specifies the special characters
within the regular expression and the
purpose and meaning of that special
character so for example if we scroll
down notice that slash D matches a digit
character and that's equivalent to 0 to
9 within square brackets so here you've
got lot of basics of regular expressions
now once you are comfortable with these
special characters then you can use this
tool expressor and you can start
building your own regular expressions
using this tool now so far
seen how to use this test mode so we
write our regular expression and then
test it you can also design your regular
expression so you can go to the design
mode and let's say for example I want to
find let's actually delete this which is
already there and let's say I want to
find a five digit number so a number
which is got exactly or at least five
digits okay I can you know a digit which
has got at least five you know digits
within that number so I can click on
this insert notice that it inserts there
and then now when I go ahead and run
match so basically it's returning all
numbers which have got at least five
digits with a net okay so using this
design mode you can actually build your
regular expressions so you can specify
how many repetitions you want you can
specify the position etc and here
there's another tab called expression
library so this has got you know
commonly used regular expressions for
example you want to find all email
addresses so I can select that so here
is the regular expression and in the
sample text so when I click run match
notice that within this sample text
there are three occurrences of you know
an email so my name at host comm that's
a valid email all these three are valid
emails similarly if you want to find all
URLs you know simply double click on
URLs which is going to insert that and
then again from this button it is going
to show all the URLs within that sample
text and here is your regular expression
so very useful tool Express oh and
there's another website called regular
expression library so this website has
got you know loads of regular
expressions and let's say for example
you want a regular expression for email
simply type the word email and click
search and you'll get the different
regular expressions to validate or match
an email so basically for example if you
look at this regular expression right
here it says that it doesn't allow
numbers in the domain name so if you
have numbers in the domain name then
this will regular expression will not
match that so if that's what is your
requirement then probably you can use
this regular expression and if you look
at this regular expression you know it
allows numbers in the domain name so if
that's what is your requirement you can
use that so there is a regular
expression there is a description of
that an example of what matches and what
does not match and depending upon your
requirement you can picture to pick and
choose the one that meets your needs
okay so you have hundreds and thousands
of regular expressions here thank you
for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
