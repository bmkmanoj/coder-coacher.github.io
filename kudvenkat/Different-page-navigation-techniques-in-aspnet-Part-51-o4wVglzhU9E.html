venket this is part 51 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll discuss
about the different page navigation
techniques that are available in asp.net
page navigation techniques this is a
very common interview question this
question can be asked in several
different ways for example what are the
different page navigation techniques
that are available in asp.net or how do
you link pages in an application or how
do you move from one web form to another
web form in asp.net obviously there are
several ways to navigate between web
forms in an asp.net web application for
example we can make use of the hyperlink
control response toward redirect server
or transfer server execute cross page
post back window dot open using
javascript we will be talking about the
techniques from 2 to 6 in the subsequent
video sessions in this session we'll
talk about the hyperlink control in fact
we have spoken about the hyperlink
control in part 13 of the asp.net video
series if you haven't watched that part
I would strongly encourage you to do so
before continuing with the session the
hyperlink control is used to navigate to
another page the page you want to
navigate to is specified by the navigate
URL property using the hyperlink we can
navigate to another page within the same
application or to an external website
that's hosted on the same web server or
on a different web server the hyperlink
control is actually rendered as an HTML
anchor tag let's look at that in action
I have a simple asp.net web application
project here I just have one web form
let me quickly add another web form so
web form 2 dot aspx now let's drag and
drop the hyperlink control onto the web
form now the important thing to notice
here is that the hyperlink control is
actually the asp.net server side control
ok now I'm going to set the navigate URL
property here navigate URL is equal to I
want to navigate to web form to dot aspx
so let me change the name so web form 2
dot is px and let's set the text to
you go to webform - okay all right so
now notice this this is an asp.net
hyperlink control let me run this
project when the page loads you know the
hyperlink control will actually be
converted into an HTML anchor tag
because the browser's will not
understand the asp.net server controls
they only understand HTML and it's the
responsibility of the server to convert
these asp.net controls into the HTML
controls that can be understood by the
browser so if I right-click on the
browser now and view source look at this
the hyperlink control is actually
rendered as an anchor tag okay the
navigate URL property is now specified
as the href property and the text is
actually wrapped in between the opening
and closing tag of the anchor tag okay
so now when I click this one look at the
URL the URL here is webform one dot aspx
now when I click go to webform to look
at that the URL is change it to wave
form - now this is important to keep in
mind you know the hyperlink control
changes the URL in the browser window
and it remembers the history because
some of the techniques that we have you
know to navigate between web forms do
not change the URL and they do not
remember the history so when we compare
this you know somebody can ask you you
know an interview question like what is
the difference between a hyperlink
control and so what are transfer because
server dot transfer doesn't change the
URL okay and another point to keep in
mind as far as the hyperlink control is
concerned now using the hyperlink
control we have seen how to navigate to
a page within the same application okay
but let's say I want to navigate to a
page that's pleasant on a different web
server
now this asp.net web application is
running on my local machine on my local
web server but then let's configure this
hyperlink control to navigate to a
different web site
let's say I want to navigate to presume
techcom and that's definitely not not
hosted on my machine on prism tech comm
I want to go to home dot aspx page so
this page is on a different website
that's present on a different web server
ok can I use hyperlink to go to a
website that's present on a different
web server absolutely and let's change
the text to go to maybe regime tech okay
so let's run this now so go to presume
tech obviously I look at the URL that's
currently localhost webform one but when
I click to click go to presume Tech it's
actually going to presume techcom a
website that's hosted on a different
server ok so using hyperlink control we
can navigate to a page that's present in
the same application or to an external
website that's present on a different
web server ok that's that's important to
keep in mind as well because you know
using some of these techniques again we
cannot navigate to a website that's
hosted on a different web server so when
we compare and contrast these different
page navigation techniques you know we
should be able to point out those
differences and it's and it's important
to understand these concepts discussed
here for two reasons number one there
could be several interview questions
based on page navigation techniques and
number two when you are actually working
on a project you know depending on the
application requirement if you
understand the concepts properly you'll
be able to pick and choose the technique
that best suits your application needs
we will be talking about the techniques
from you know 2 to 6 in the subsequent
video sessions on this slide you can
find resources for asp.net c-sharp and
sequel server interview questions that's
it for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
