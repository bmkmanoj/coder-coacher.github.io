4 of the design patterns tutorial in
this session we will discuss these
initialization in singleton how to use
multi-threading singleton and how to
implement a thread safe singleton class
using your previous example please refer
to the previous parts of this tutorial
before proceeding now let's switch to
the visual studio and bring up the
singleton demo application in the
previous session we have discussed why
we change this constructor to private
and why we have sealed down this class
now let's focus on the gate instance
property the primary responsibility of
the gate instance property is to create
singleton instance however we are
delaying the singleton instance creation
till the gate instance properties
involved this velar instance creation is
called lazy initialization lazy
initialization works fine in single
threaded environment you may be
wondering why this code works only in
single credit environment to answer that
imagine a situation where multiple
threats are invoking get instance
property at the same point of time when
that situation occurs there is a chance
that we can create multiple instances of
this singleton object now let's switch
to the main program and focus on the
code that we have written in the
previous session both student and
employee are invoking the get instance
property in a sequential manner or in a
single threaded manner which means the
employee invokes our get instance
property once the students get invoked
code is completed now let's see how we
can invoke the get instance property in
parallel for our convenience
let's move the code related to employee
and student into two separate methods
the
can do that in two easy steps
so choose the area that we need to move
to a new method now let's choose the
student related code and right-click on
this area and click on quick actions and
refactoring IDE will present us with
extract method option click on that and
now look at that it has created a new
method and the student related code is
moved to this new method let's rename
this method as print student details
now let's do the same thing with the
employee-related code as well choose the
employee-related code area right click
click on quick actions and refactoring
and say exact method let's rename this
method as print employee details now
that we have created two methods related
to employee and student let's invoke
them using parallel dot invoke method of
dotnet framework 4.0 let's see how we
can do that
let's try parallel dot invoke as the
name says parallel dot invoke invokes
the methods as actions let's pass these
two methods as actions to the parallel
dot invoke method you may be wondering
how we can do that it's pretty simple we
can use the lambda expression and invoke
the print student details method and
also we can invoke the employee details
method with a comma separator and create
another lambda expression and invoke the
employee details and close the parallel
dot invoke over here let's just align it
in such a way that it's easy to read now
look at that we have moved the employee
details as well as student details in
the parallel dhating book method alright
now that we have wrapped these two
methods as actions in parallel in work
let's run this application let me just
put a breakpoint at the instance
creation before running the application
now let's run this application by
pressing it file look at that the run
time has hit the breakpoint let's just
run this application by pressing f10
look at that the run time has hit the
breakpoint again twice now let's just
run this application now if you look at
the output and notice that the counter
value has been incremented to 2 this
proves that in a multi-threaded
environment when both employee and
student are invoking the gate instance
property in parallel we are ending up in
creating two instances
of singleton object and this violates
the singleton design pattern principles
let's see how we can avoid the situation
let's close the application or go back
to the code to avoid this situation logs
are the best way to control thread race
condition and they help us to overcome
the present situation let's see how we
can do that let's add a private static
feed only object obj equal to a new
object let's use this object as a log
object and wrap the code block which
creates the singleton instance let's say
log obj and then move this instance
creation under this log object now with
these changes only one thread can enter
into this code block at a given point of
time that means when both employee and
student are racing with each other in
multi-threaded environment lock and
choose that only one thread which
arrives earlier succeeds to enter this
code block and the other will wait till
the first one is completed now let's run
this application and see what happens
run this application now look at that
the output of the counter value is at 1
which means the lock worked very well
and we are able to restrict multiple
instance creation and also we have
overcome the thread safety issues as
well let's stop this application and go
back to the code if you inspect the code
the logs are very expensive to use and
there is no need to use the logs every
time when we invoke the get instance
property so how do we avoid unnecessary
log checking basically we need the
runtime to enter into the log scope only
when the instance is null
so we just need to add another law not a
check before the log check let's put
another null check here if instance is
equal to null then let's enter into the
lock let's stop up this lock code in
this instance null check condition now
let's inspect the output by running this
application the output didn't changed
and this double verification of null
instance checking is called double check
locking please refer to the Wikipedia
article for more details on the double
check locking now you might be wondering
that this double check locking has
complicated the singleton instance
creation isn't it and the answer from my
end will be yes in the next session we
will discuss how to simplify the lazy
initialization and we'll also discuss
the advantages and disadvantages of the
lazy initialization till then thank you
for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
