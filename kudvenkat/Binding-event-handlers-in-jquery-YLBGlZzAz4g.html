this video we'll discuss how to bind
even handlers to events using bind
method in jQuery one way to bind even
handle is to events is by using the
jQuery shorthand functions like dot
click dot mouse over dot mouse out etc
in the previous sessions of this video
series we discussed how to use this
jQuery shorthand functions another way
to bind event handlers to events is by
using the bind method in jQuery here is
an example so the selector right here is
going to return as a button with ID BTN
click main and on that we are calling
bind method the first parameter is the
name of the event to which we want to
bind the event handler in this case we
want to bind the event handler to the
click event of this button so we pass
the name of the event as a string and
then the second parameter is the
function that we want to call when this
click event occurs so we are calling an
anonymous function here and if you look
at this anonymous function all it's
doing is finding another element with ID
div result so this is a development and
within that there we are displaying this
string button clicked when the click
event occurs so let's look at this in
action let's flip to visual studio here
we have the button with that ID BT and
click me with know a jQuery ready
function let's use the ID selector and
find that button so the ID of the button
is PT and click me and on that let's
call the bind method so the first
parameter is going to be the name of the
event so that's the event to which we
want to bind the event handler and the
second parameter is going to be the
function that we want to call when click
event occurs so when the click event
occurs call this function and what we
want this function to do is find this
development with ID div result so dollar
hash div result and let's use the HTML
method and display this string button
clicked within that development alright
so let's go ahead and save these changes
reload this page and look at this when
we click the button button click so here
we using the bind method to bind click
event handler
to this button when this click event
occurs this function gets called and if
you look at this anonymous function we
are not passing the event object but
sometimes you know you may need the
event object for example let's say when
I click this button you know I want to
get the x and y coordinates of the mouse
pointer where the click event occurred
okay so to do that we can use the event
object because the event object has got
the page X and page Y properties so
let's pass event object to this even
handler function and then instead of
simply displaying this string button
click I am also going to say button
click at x equals we want the
x-coordinate of the mouse pointer and to
get that we can use the event object
that is coming into this even handler
function and then use the page X
property and to that let's append y
equals the y-coordinate so event dot
page Y all right so let's save the
changes and let's reload this page and
look at this then we click the button we
get the x and y coordinates depending on
where you click the x and y coordinates
change accordingly right
is it possible to bind multiple even
handlers to the button using the bind
method absolutely if you want to bind
multiple events like this here we are
binding in our event handlers to click
mouse over and mouse out events simply
separate them with a space so here we
are binding you know this even handler
function do all these three events ok so
let's look at that in action so I want
to bind the event handler function to
click event mouse over event and Mouse
out event ok when any of these events
occur this function gets called and look
at this here we are passing the event
object to the event handler function now
I want this piece of code to be executed
only if the event is click event if
that's the case we can use this event
object that gets passed so we can check
if event dot type
equals click so if the event is click
event then execute this code elsif event
dot type equals mouse over then let's
say we want to execute different piece
of code you know we can specify that
here else you know we want to execute
whatever code okay let's say you know
onmouseover this button you know I want
to add a special CSS class so that you
know we get the background color we want
to change the font as well as the mouse
pointer style so let's go ahead and
first create a style class so here let's
include a section for style and then I'm
going to create a style class let's
actually call this button style and
first of all we want the background
color to be red and we want the font
weight to be bold and we want the font
color to be white and we want to change
the cursor to hand so let's use pointer
as the style all right so onmouseover
what we want to do is we want to add the
CSS class to the button element right so
to do that to refer to the element we
can use again this keyword so dollar
this to that we want to add a class so
I'm going to use add class method and we
are going to specify the class name as
button style okay if it is not mouse
over or click even then it's going to
come to this else part in that case we
want to remove that CSS class so I'm
going to use remove class okay if it's
Mouse out we want to remove that CSS
class if it's mouse over we want to add
that CSS class if it is click we want to
display the string you know within the
development so let's save these changes
and let's reload this page
look at this as we move the mouse over
look at the background color changes to
red font is bolded and font color is
white and the mouse pointer style has
changed to a hand symbol onmouseout the
class is removed onmouseover plus is
added if I click the button in our
button click message with X&amp;amp;Y
coordinates ok so in this example we are
binding even handler to three events
okay all right now how to unbind an even
handler use the unbind method so you
know when we call the unbind method look
at this via passing mouse over so in
this case it's going to unbind you know
mouse over event handler okay and if you
want to unbind all the even handlers of
that button element simply call unbind
without any parameters so this is going
to remove all the event handlers so
let's actually understand these two with
an example so at the moment if you look
at the page you know we have the button
style class and this is the HTML that
would produce this and what we want to
do is when I click this button disable
mouse over effect we want to disable the
mouse over effect meaning we want to
remove that onmouseover I mean mouse
over event handler and when we click
enable mouse over effect we want to add
mouse over event handler so let's see
how to use bind and unbind and achieve
that all right so let's go to visual
studio so this button button enable
mouse over effect that's the idea of the
button so right here let's find the
button with that ID and when we click
the button we want to execute this
function so here we are using the jQuery
shorthand function to associate a click
event handler to this button right all
right so when we click button enable
mouse over effect what we want to do we
want to bind mouse over event handler to
this button bTW and click me so we want
to find that button first so let's use
that ID selector and then I'm simply
going to say
bind and we want to bind mouse over and
let's specify the function that we want
to a call when mouse over occurs so here
we are going to simply say dollar this
dot add class button style so when we
click enable mouse over effect button be
a binding mouse over event and a name
and handler for that now when we click
the other button that is BTN disable
mouse over effect so dollar when we
click this button we want to execute
another function and what do we want to
do we want to unbind mouse over event
handler so I'm going to use the same
code and instead of bind I'm going to
use unbind and we want to unbind the
even handler of mouse over event okay so
let's save those changes let's reload
this page and look at this when we mouse
over you know we get the mouse over
effect now when I click disable mouse
over it effect look at this now when I
most mouse over the button we don't have
the mouse over effect and I click enable
mouse over effect you know look at that
that's back in action again and when we
click the button we get the message as
expected
and here is the code that we have just
written thank you for listening and have
a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
