this video we'll discuss how to load a
HTML data from the server using jQuery
AJAX load function first let's
understand what is Ajax Ajax stands for
asynchronous JavaScript and XML Ajax
allow parts of the page to be updated
without having to reload the entire page
let's understand what we mean by this
statement with an example here we have a
web page that captures first name last
name email and income now next to every
textbox we also have a development
whenever a textbox receives focus we
want to display the help text associated
with that text box next to the
development that is present next to that
field
so here income field has the focus so
the help text associated with the income
field is displayed in the development
that's present next to that fear now all
this help text is present on the server
so at any time when a field receives
focus we want to load that help text
associated with that field from the
server if we have to achieve this
without using Ajax then we will have to
do a full page post back to the server
so the server is going to process the
request and send the entire page HTML
back to the client
now just because we want to display the
help text associated with a specific
field look at the amount of data that is
exchanged between the client and the
server the server is sending the entire
page HTML to the client so the amount of
data that is exchanged is more and
another problem as this full page
refreshes cause screen flicker with Ajax
this server is not going to send the
entire HTML back instead it is going to
send just the help text and the client
is going to receive that help text and
it is going to update the development
without having to reload the entire page
so let's see how to you know load this
data from the server using this jquery
ajax load function so if you look at
this load function it has got three
parameters URL data and complete out of
these three parameters URL is the only
required parameter the other two are
optional
so this URL parameter specifies the URL
to which the request is sent data
parameter specifies a JSON object or a
string that is sent to the server along
with the reguar with the request and
this complete parameter specifies a
callback function that is called when
the request completes in our upcoming
videos we'll look at an example of using
data and complete parameters in this
video let's look at an example of using
this URL parameter so the first thing to
do here is to design a web page that
looks like this so let's flip to visual
studio so within the body section we
need a table and this table is going to
have at TR and this TR is going to
contain three PDS so here we want to
display this literal text first name and
then we need a text box so let's use an
input element so input type equals text
and let's give it an ID so let's call
this first name and then we need a
development in the third TD so there and
let's give this development an ID
let's actually call this first name help
deaf okay similarly we need TRS for last
name email and income in the interest of
time I have already typed the required
HTML so let's copy that from the notepad
and paste it right here now if you look
at this HTML it's it's very much similar
to what we have here in the first name
TR so last name and then a text box and
look at the IDs so here the ID of the
textbox is first name and the ID of the
div is first name help div and for last
name the ID of the textbox is last name
and the ID of the development is last
name help dip so the div elements have
got an ID and that is equal to you know
the ID of the input field that is the
text box Plus this little text help div
I have intentionally named them that way
and in a bit you will understand why so
for email the IDS email and the device
email help there similarly for income it
is income for text box and income help
do for the development okay so if we
view this page in the browser this is
how it looks like so we have all the
fields and next to those fields we have
the developments now the next step is to
include the help text right so the help
text is going to be present in another
HTML file and obviously that file will
be present on the server so to our
project let's go ahead and add an HTML
file and let's call this help dot HTML
okay so we don't require all this HTML
here we just need a development so I'm
going to give this div an ID and the
idea of this div I'm going to
intentionally match that with you know
this divided e and again in a bit you'll
understand why is that okay
so div ID equals first name out there
and this div is going to contain the
help text for first name field so you
are first name as it appears in a sport
okay
so similarly we need to have you know
how text for last name email and income
and in the interest of time I have
already typed the required HTML so let's
copy it from here and paste it there
okay so our help text is present in this
HTML file that is help dot HTML and this
is our page way we want to display the
health text okay and so now all that is
left is to write the jQuery code to load
the health text from that health dot
HTML file right so the first thing is we
want you know
associate focus events for all these
textboxes so we want to find all these
text boxes and I'm going to use this
jQuery selector to find all the text
boxes so give me all input elements
where type attribute equals text so this
is going to give us all the text boxes
and I'm going to store these text boxes
in a variable let's call this text boxes
all right so we have all the text boxes
now now with each text box we want to
associate focus event handler so when
the focus event is raised we want to
call this function so what do we want to
do whenever a text box it receives focus
so when for example first name textbox
receives focus we want to display the
health text associated with the first
name field within the development that
is present next to the first name field
right so we need to find the ID of the
development and look at the way we have
named them the idea of this div is first
name help though the idea of last name
help device last name help there
so the ID is equal to the ID of the
input field plus this little text help
div right so I'm going to create a
variable here and let's call this help
there and this variable is going to
contain the ID of this help Dave and we
are going to compute that
programmatically okay so to get that ID
I'm going to get the ID of the textbox
itself so how do we get the idea of the
textbox in our this focus whenever the
first name textbox receives focus you
know this function will be called
and at that point when we use this
keyword this represents the control that
has received focus right and we want to
retrieve the ID attribute value so I am
going to use a TDR function so this is
going to give us the ID of the text box
that has received focus for example
first name textbox has received focus
this expression is going to give us
first
name and to that if we append this
little text help there then we are going
to get the ID that is associated with
that input field right so what's the
next thing to do within this help div we
want to load the help text from this
help dot HTML file right so to do that
we are going to make use of this load
function so where do we want to load
that help text into this div element so
this is the ID of the development so I'm
going to use the jQuery ID selector so
hash is the ID selector and then to that
lets append helped if that's the ID and
on this development i am going to call
the load function so we want to load the
help text from the server into this
development so here we are going to just
specify the URL so what is the URL of
the page the URL of the page is help dot
HTML so help dot HTML okay so when the
text box receives focus it's going to
load that HTML into this development
okay
now not only that when the text box
loses focus what do we want to do we
want to empty the development right so
I'm actually going to make a copy of
this and when the text box loses focus
blur event is raised
so when blur event is raised we want to
handle that find the help div you know
of the text box that has just lost focus
and what do we want to do we want to
empty that div element and to do that
I'm going to use HTML and then pass an
empty string okay all right so let's
save the changes let's go ahead and
reload this page and look at this when a
text box which receives focus look at
that we get the help text your first
name as it appears in passport your last
name you know basically whenever a text
box receives focus look at that next to
each development we are getting the
entire health text
I mean the entire content of this help
dot html' okay that's because here we
have specified a help dot HTML so what
is this going to do this is going to
load the entire content you know from
this page help dot HTML and that will be
loaded into this development but that's
not what we want we want to load the
help text you know when first name text
box receives focus we want to load only
the help text that is associated with
that first name field okay so to do that
what I'm going to do is give a space
here and then I'm going to use the ID
selector again pound and if you look at
this help dot HTML look at the idea of
the development that contains the help
text for the first name field it is
intentionally named first name help
there and you know that matches with the
ID of this div okay and we have you know
this help div for example when first
name text box receives focus you know
this variable is going to contain first
name help div you know that string which
matches with the ID of this development
okay so here I'm going to pass the ID of
this development okay and this variable
contains that ID right so to that I'm
going to append help dev okay so
basically what we are saying here is
within help dot HTML file we have an
element with ID for example when first
name text box receives focus this help
div will contain first name how div
right that's the ID so basically we are
saying here with in help dot HTML there
is an element with ID first name help
div so from that element you know load
that HTML into this element whatever
this selector returns okay
now but keep in mind whether you do this
or whether you load the you know whether
you specify just help dot HTML in both
the cases the entire HTML content of
help dot HTML will be loaded you know
from the server to the client
so on the client it's going to find the
element and then retrieve its content
and then load that into this stiff
okay so let's save the changes let's go
ahead and reload this page and look at
this and the first name textbox receives
focus your first name as it appears in a
passport and when the textbox loses
focus look at that it goes away
similarly your last name and email and
annual income okay and look at how you
know fast it happens so here is the HTML
of help dot HTML page here is the HTML
of our HTML page 1 and here is the
jQuery code thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
