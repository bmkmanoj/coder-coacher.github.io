this video we'll discuss the difference
between each and map methods in take
very this is continuation to part 27 so
please watch part 27 before proceeding
here we have the list of differences
between map and each methods let's look
at a couple of examples first and those
examples should make these differences
clear so let's flip to visual studio
here we have an integer array with
numbers from 1 to 5 now let's create a
function let's name this function a and
this function is going to have two
parameters index and element and all
this function is going to do is multiply
the element parameter by 5 and return
that value now let's make another copy
of this function and let's name this
function function B and another change
that we are going to make is reverse the
order of parameters so this function
will have element first and then the
index where as functioning has index
first and then the element parameter
okay so the moment we have got two
functions now let's create a variable
let's name this result 1 equals let's
use each function so dollar dot each and
if you look at this each function the
first parameter is the object which
holds the elements that we want to
iterate over and that object is this
integer array which has numbers from 1
to 5 so let's pass that as the first
parameter value and the second parameter
is the callback function the function
that gets called for each iteration so
the callback function is going to be
this function a and if you recollect
from the previous sessions of this video
series each callback function you know
will receive two arguments the index of
the element that we are currently
iterating over and the element itself
and that is the order firstly index and
then the element so a callback function
for each method is going to be this
function a similarly let's create
another variable let's name this result
- and let's use map method now and if
you look at map method you know it has
the same set of parameters you know the
element or the object that has the
elements that we want to iterate over
it's going to be integer array and then
the callback function the callback
function for map method is going to be
function B okay and if you look at the
order of the parameters of this callback
function look at that the first one is
the element and then the index so that's
one of the differences between each and
map methods with each method the order
of the parameters is index and element
whereas with the map callback function
the order is element and then the index
okay so the parameters are reversed for
map method alright so what do we expect
in these two variables now look at this
we are iterating over each element in
the integer array and for each element
we are calling this callback function
function a and if you look at what that
function is doing it is multiplying the
element by five so when one is passed
it's going to multiply that five by five
similarly it's going to multiply two by
five three by five all the elements by
five and then it returns that array so
we expect this result one variable to
contain 5 10 15 20 and 25
similarly map method does the same thing
it also multiplies the element by 5 so
even result to variable should contain
an array that contains numbers 5 10 15
20 and 25 right so let's actually write
these values to the document and see
what we get back so document dot write
this result one variable will give us
the result of the each method so let's
put in a string there each equals
whatever we have in the result variable
and let's also include an HTML break in
between so that we get the response from
each in map on a separate line so this
the third document dot write is going to
give us the result of the map method and
result of map method is present n
result to variable so let's save the
changes and let's reload and see what we
get
look at that each method returns us the
original array so what's over original
array contains numbers 1 2 5 and when we
call this each method and then this is
the callback function function a so we
expected that to actually return you
know something like this 5 10 15 25 look
at this map method returns a new array
which contains the x lose whereas each
method returns the original array so
that's the main difference between each
and map method so each method is an
immutable iterator and it returns the
original array whereas map method is a
non immutable iterator and that's the
reason it returns a new array the array
that contains over multiplied numbers
whereas each method is an immutable
iterator
and thus the reason it returns the
original array that's the main
difference between each and map method
and the other difference is the order of
callback arguments so if you look at the
callback function of the each method you
know the order of the ELA
parameters is indexed first and then the
element whereas with map method element
first and index next we can actually
prove that look at this here you know
function B is the callback function for
map method now what do you think is
going to happen if we reverse these
parameters so if we make them like this
index and element so just like function
a look at what's going to happen let's
actually save those changes look at this
at the moment in our the original
numbers are 1 2 3 4 5 and when we
multiply them by 5 we get 5 10 15 20 25
but then we have changed the order of
the parameters here so now this element
parameter will actually receive the
index value okay so that means index
starts from 0 so 0 into 5 will be 0 and
then 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 so we should get now
0 5 10 15 20 so let's reload this
because and and we get that because this
element parameter is actually receiving
the index value and not the element
itself okay so that proves the point
that with map callback function the
parameters the arguments are actually
reversed when we compare them with each
callback function okay so this example
basically proves the first three points
and with map method we do not have a way
to terminate the loop you know we cannot
break out of the loop whereas with each
method when we return false you know
it's going to terminate the iteration
and we can break out of that loop let's
actually prove that with an example so
let's use the same integer array now
instead of using these name the
functions I'm actually going to create
an anonymous callback function so let's
get rid of these two variables as well
result one and result two and with each
method you're passing the integer array
and then here I'm actually going to
create an anonymous callback function so
this is the function that gets called
for each iteration so we are passing the
index and element parameters and what we
are going to do is actually write the
value of the element to the document and
to that lets append a comma right so
let's make a copy of this one and
instead of using each I'm going to use
map and with map the order is element
first and then the index and we are
going to do the same thing now write the
element value to the document okay and
in between let's actually include this
break okay and let's get rid of these
two lines here okay so what we expect
now we expect these numbers 1 2 3 4 5 to
be printed twice because we are simply
iterating over each element and printing
its value and then we are appending a
comma
so let's save the changes and when we
reload look at that we get the numbers
in both the cases one two five one two
five now let's go ahead and include this
check so this is our each function so
we're basically checking if element is
equal to three let's return false okay
and let's do the same thing with map
method as well so basically we're saying
if element is three then return false so
what do we expect when we return false
you know it break it should break out of
this loop this iteration and we expect
the same to happen with both eaten map
and let's actually see what happens so
let's save the changes and let's reload
look at that with each function we have
numbers printed from one to two whereas
with map function we have one two three
is kept and it prints four and five
let's understand why so with each method
what happens you know for the first
iteration gets number one prints that it
goes number two is number two equal to
three you know that's false so it
doesn't execute that it comes here and
prints the value and when it comes to
three so three is equal to three it
returns false when we return false from
the each function what is going to
happen it's going to break that
iteration at that point it will not
iterate through the rest of the items
you know four and five so at three it is
returning false so it will not execute
the statement that's the reason why it
doesn't print three and then at that
point it's going to break that loop
whereas if you look at map method so
first time we have number one is number
one equal to three the condition is
false so it comes here and prints number
one and then is two equal to three now
it comes here prints that is three equal
to three yes and it returns false so it
doesn't print this statement but then at
that point it's not going to break out
of the loop it's going to continue the
next iteration so it brings out four is
four equal two
three now so it will not execute this
instead it will come here Prince four
and then the next element is five is
five equal to three Falls so it doesn't
come here
it prints number five and that's why we
get one two four five with map whereas
with each we get only one and two so
with map we do not have a way to
terminate the iteration
whereas with each you know to break the
termination we can simply return false
so those are the differences between map
and each methods and here is the second
example that we just discussed thank you
for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
