this video we'll discuss the use of
complete parameter of jQuery load
function this is continuation to part 54
so please watch part 54 before
proceeding with this video from the
previous sessions in this video series
we have learned that jQuery load
function has got three parameters URL
data and complete if you look at the
example that we worked with in the
previous video session notice that at
the moment this jQuery load function is
only using the first two parameters the
first parameter here represents the URL
to which we want to send the request and
the second parameter represents the data
that we want to send to the server at
the moment we are not using this third
parameter complete so this parameter
represents a callback function that is
executed when the request completes this
callback function has got three
parameters response status and
xmlhttprequest object if the request
completes successfully then this
response parameter will contain the
response of that request in case if
there is an exception then this response
parameter will contain the information
about that exception status parameter
will tell us if there is an error or if
the request has completed successfully
this XML HTTP requests contain
information about status status text etc
let's look at an example at the moment
you know the load function here is not
using the third parameter complete right
so whenever any of these fields receives
figures we get the help text associated
with that field displayed immediately
right now let's go ahead and change this
chord now I'm going to change the name
of this stored procedure right and let's
go and build the solution so at the
moment in sequel server database we
don't have a stored procedure with this
name so when this code executes we will
get an exception right and let's see
what's going to happen when we get an
exception let's reload this page and
look at this
when these fields receives focus nothing
happens we don't get any information
about that exception right we don't get
the help text
and we don't get any information about
that exception that has occurred right
so if you want to know whether if the
request has completed successfully or
not then we can make use of this third
parameter complete right so let's go
ahead and use that now so within our
HTML page I'm going to use the third
parameter the callback function and this
function has three parameters so the
first parameter is the response the
second parameter is the status and the
third parameter is the xmlhttprequest
object now what I want to do is retrieve
status status text and response and
display that within a development so to
this HTML I'm actually going to add a
development next to the table so let's
include a break element here and then
include it there and let's give it an ID
let's call this maybe div status and we
want to display that information within
this development right so now here so
within this callback function I'm going
to create a variable let's call this
maybe error message or let's call the
status status message equals now we have
three parameters that are coming into
this function response status and XML
HTTP request object so I'm going to use
you know I'm actually going to build a
string here so first I want the request
status so status equals I can use the
XML HTTP request object dot status is
going to give us status and I'm going to
include an HTML break and let's actually
make a copy of this and status message
plus equals next I want status text and
again we can use status text property of
the xmlhttprequest object and finally we
want to you know display whatever
response we get so again let's make a
copy of this
and response equals another response
parameter okay and we can get rid of
this last HTML break alright and what we
want to do we want to display the status
message within the development and
development has got an ID so that is div
status let's copy that and let's find
the development by ID so let's use the
jQuery ID selector find the development
and I'm going to use the HTML function
and to this function let's pass the
status message all right so let's save
the changes let's go ahead and reload
this page and look at this now when the
first name receives focus look at that
we get the status 500 and look at the
status text internal server error and
look at the error message could not find
stored procedure as we get health text
by key 1 so this is information it's
very useful to the developer and
straightaway we know that once we
correct that name let's go ahead and
correct that let's build a solution and
let's reload this page and look at this
when the text box please use focus now
we should get the help text associated
with that view and look at the status
200 status text is OK and the response
is nothing but you know whatever we get
D that is the help text right now let's
go ahead and change for example the name
of the URL to which we want to send the
request now let's change this to get
help text 1 dot aspx now if you look at
our application we don't have a page
with that name so now we should get page
not found exception so let's save the
changes let's reload this page and look
at this now we get status as 404 page
not found and look at this we get that
message saying the resource cannot be
found and straightaway you know when we
get this 404 we know that you know the
page to which we are sending the request
cannot be found so we correct that
and envy reload you know it should
successfully execute the request okay
now at the moment and all the code that
is present within this callback function
this piece of code is executed it expect
you off whether there is an exception or
not now if the request completes
successfully you know we don't want this
code to be executed we want this code to
be executed only if there is an error if
that's your requirement then you can
make use of this status parameter so
basically you can check that's a string
parameter so basically we can say if
status equals error only then execute
this code right so let's save the
changes let's go ahead and reload this
page and look at this now when they
request complete successfully nothing is
displayed within this development that's
because this piece of code will not be
executed on the other hand if we have an
exception so let's change the name of
the file reload this and look at this if
we have an error then the error
information is displayed within that
development so at the moment we get 404
error so if you want to conditionally
execute the code present in the callback
function you can use the status
parameter thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
