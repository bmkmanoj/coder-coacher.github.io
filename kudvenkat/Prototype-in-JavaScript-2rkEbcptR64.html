in this video well discus prototype
object in JavaScript with an example
here we have an employee constructor
function that constructs an employee
object there are several ways in
JavaScript to add a function to this
employee object one way is by using this
keyword so here get name is a function
and we want this function to return the
name of the employee so here this
represents an instance of this function
which is an employee object let's go
ahead and create two employee objects
all right now let's print the names of
employees
so we have this function get name so
let's call that and let's also append
HTML break so we get the names printed
on a separate line so e 2 dot name
equals e to get name let's save these
changes load the web page notice that we
get employee 1 and employee 2 names is
expected so a function is working the
problem with this approach is that you
know if you create 100 employee objects
then there will be hundred copies of
this function so here we are creating
two employee objects so there will be
two copies of this function you know
like any other object oriented
programming language we don't want to be
creating copies of functions instead we
want to share the same function code
across all objects and that's possible
using the prototype object
well discuss an example of using
prototype in just a bit but let's
explore the other options of adding a
function to employee object so one way
is by using this keyword within you know
the constructor function the other way
so let's remove this now the other way
is to associate the function directly
with an object so here we have two
employee objects e1 and e2 so I can say
e 1 dot get name equals function written
this dot name so basically if you have
created 100 objects then you have to
associate to each of those objects you
know a function like this manually so
that's going to be tedious and
error-prone the moment we only have
added this function to e1 object now
that means when we say e 2 dot cat name
it's going to throw an undefined error
so let's save these changes and let's
reload this page notice that II 1 name
is printed but when it tries to call e 2
dot cat name you know we have an
undefined error it says object as in
support property or method cat name
and the other way is you can use the
name of the constructor function so this
is the second approach which we have
just discussed and the third approach is
by using the name of the constructor
function so the name of the constructor
function here is employee so I can say
employee dot get name equals function
written this dot name and we can delete
this from here now the problem with this
approach is that get name in a will
throw an undefined error you won't be
able to access the Skip name function
look at this when we try to load this
page it says object as in support
property or method get name we can use
the prototype property to associate a
function as well so employee dot
prototype dot get name so we are
associating get name function with the
employee object using the prototype
property there are several advantages of
using the prototype object one of the
advantages is no matter how many objects
you create functions are loaded only
once into memory so even if you create a
hundred employee objects there is going
to be only one copy of gap named
function which will be shared by all the
employee objects and using prototype
also allows you to override functions if
required
we'll discuss inheritance and overriding
functions in our next video session so
now notice this when we load this page
it should work as expected so here we
are using the prototype object thank you
for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
