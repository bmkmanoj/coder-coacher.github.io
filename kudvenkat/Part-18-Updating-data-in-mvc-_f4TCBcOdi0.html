venket this is part 18 of asp.net MVC
tutorial in this video we'll discuss
updating data in MVC please watch but 17
before proceeding with this video in
part 17 we implemented this edit view at
the moment the problem is if we click on
the Save button we get an error stating
the resource cannot be found and that
makes sense because at the moment the
employee controller class doesn't have
an edit action method that responds to
HTTP POST operation in this video we'll
discuss correcting this issue so
obviously when we click on the Save
button here we want to see what the
changes that we made to this employee to
the database table so obviously the
first thing to do is to implement astute
procedure that can update the database
table TBL employee and to speed things
up I have the stored procedure already
implemented here so if you look at the
stored procedure it's very
straightforward it has all these input
parameters ID name gender City and date
of birth and then what are we doing
within the body you know we are simply
updating this table setting name to name
gender to gender city to city and date
of birth to date of birth where ID is
equal to whatever is the ID of the
employee so very simple and
straightforward stored procedure here so
that's our first step obviously the
second step is to modify our employee
business layer at the moment if you look
at this employee business layer we've
got one property here employees which is
going to return all the employees and we
also have add employee method if you
give it a new employee object it's going
to add that or insert that employee into
the database table now let's go ahead
and add a method which can actually save
employee details so let's call it public
void save employee and this is going to
take an employee object as the parameter
and then we want this function to invoke
the stood procedure that we have just
implemented save employee and pass you
know the employee object property values
as the values for the parameters of the
stored procedure so to speed things up I
have this function already implemented
let me copy that and paste it here now
this is a very straightforward ad or
dotnet code we discussed about ato
dotnet in a very great detail in aerial
tour that video series so please watch
those videos so what are we doing here
we are using the configuration manager
class to read the connection string from
web config file and then using that
connection string we are building our
sequel connection object and notice the
sequel command it's nothing but this
stirred procedure that we have just
implemented and then we are telling the
command object it's of type stored
procedure by using this command type
property and then the rest of the code
is simply preparing the sequel
parameters you know ID name gender city
and date of birth and then we open the
connection and execute the command
that's it so that's our second step
finally we need to implement our
employee controller so with an employee
controller we need to implement an edit
action method that can respond to HTTP
POST operation so let me copy this
method
and we want this controller action
method to respond to HTTP POST operation
so let's change this attribute to HTTP
POST
and we want this action method to
receive the employee object so when we
click on save whatever you know data
that we have here this will be
automatically posted to the server and
then the model binded in mbc is going to
receive those posted form values and
then it's going to populate this object
for us automatically and then when it's
doing that the default model binder when
it's binding the posted form data if
there are any errors you know when it's
doing that binding we can detect those
errors using model state objects so if
model state dot is valid if that
property returns true then we know for
sure there are no model validation
errors in that case we are creating a
new employee business layer here and
then this object employee business layer
object has taught a method save employee
method so all we are doing here is
passing the say employee object to the
save employee method which is going to
save those employee details to the
database table and once that is done
successfully we want to redirect the
user to the index action so return
redirect to action and to which action
we want to redirect index action which
is going to list all the employees there
ok and then if this model state object
returns false then we know there are
some model validation errors in which
case we want the user to remain on the
same view and then display those model
validation errors so that the user get
an opportunity to fix those errors and
then submit that form back so let's go
ahead and run this and see if it's going
to work as expected
alright let's navigate to the index
action and let's click on edit so Mary
at the moment is female let's change the
gender to male and let's save it and see
if it's going to work as expected so
maybe it's gender is male and we can
check our database table as well so
Mary's gender is male okay on the other
hand let's edit that once again let's
you know
enter some text for date of birth so I'm
entering test
now remember date of birth is of type
date time now this cannot be parsed or
converted to date/time datatype okay so
obviously there will be a model
validation error and when we click Save
look at that I get this error the value
test is not valued for valid for date of
birth okay and why are we getting that
error because look at this this property
will return false and then we are
returning the same view and that view is
going to display that employee object
where the model state validation has
fail and we get the error message as
expected okay on the other hand let's
say I don't want to populate the city
itself and then click on that look at
that the city field is required and you
remember if you remember in the previous
session we have decorated this employee
object you know look at these properties
we have decorated them with required
attribute so model state object knows
all of these properties need to have
values and if they are missing them
again we have this errors property on
this model state object actually let's
run this and debug this so how is this
model state object keeping track of
those errors so let's navigate to
employee index let's put a breakpoint
within our employee controller here
which responds to the HTTP POST
operation let's click on edit let's say
test ok for date of birth and let's
blank out city there and click on save
so it drops into this function and then
let's + f10 there so model state dot is
valid that is false as expected now if
we go into the immediate window and if I
go to model state of date of birth and
dot value look at that that's the value
we try to enter into you know that date
of birth text box the attempted value is
you know test and then if we go to model
state and if we just index that the date
of birth
and look at this editors count is one
meaning there is one error as far as
that property is concerned and if you
not want to know what that error is you
can simply because that use the errors
property and index that so the value
test is not valued for date of birth so
this model state object has this errors
property which we can use you know if we
want to change any of the error messages
that are associated you know with that
property as well let's get more about
that in a later video session alright
on this slide you can find resources
phase B dotnet c-sharp and sequels of
interview questions that's it for today
thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
