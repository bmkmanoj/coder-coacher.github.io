so why should we learn unit testing as a
developer most of the companies are
making sure their application code is
covered by unit tests there are several
benefits of having unit tests they help
us find bugs early significantly reduces
production bugs unit tests make complex
code easy to understand they provide a
form of documentation saves a lot of
development time easier to change and
refactor complex code and developers
become more confident in short unit
tests add a great value to applications
so more and more companies are now
expecting their employees to have good
unit testing knowledge whether you're
looking for a job as a software
developer or you are already working as
