tutorial in this video we'll discuss
uploading and downloading files in
asp.net we want the user interface to
upload and download files to be as shown
in the image here notice that we have a
file upload control here now when I
click on this choose file button I
should be able to select a file from the
client machine and then once I have this
file selected and when I click this
upload button we want that file to be
uploaded onto our web server ok so
within the web server I am going to have
this data folder within the root of our
web application project so the file
should be uploaded into that folder and
as soon as the file is uploaded into the
folder on the web server we also want
those uploaded files to be listed in the
grid view control as you can see here so
we want the name of the file the size of
the uploaded file in bytes and the file
type whether if it's a text Excel bird
or an image okay and in addition the
name of the file it should be rendered
as a link so once I click on that file
name I should be able to download the
uploaded file let's see how to achieve
this so let's flip to visual studio so
here I have a blank asp.net web
application first of all let's go ahead
and add a data folder so this is the
folder into which we will be uploading
our files
alright and the next step is to design
the waveform so the first step is to
drag and drop a file upload control and
we also need a button control so let's
drag and drop a button control and let's
change the text on the button control to
upload and now let's drag and drop a
grid we control
and let's autoformat this could view
control let's choose autumn is the
screen okay now let's set a font family
to area so this there's a div tag so
let's use this style attribute and set
font family to area all right okay now
let's configure this grid view control
so what should the grid view control
display the grid view control should be
displaying the name of the file at the
size of the file and the file type okay
so let's configure this grid view
control so we need three columns so I'm
going to click on this edit columns and
then the first column I'm going to add a
template field because we need a link
button there and once we click that link
button we should be able to download the
uploaded file so I'm going to include a
linker button within this template field
but we'll do that in just a bit first of
all let's include the header text so
what should the header say it should say
file so let's specify the header text as
file and then the next column is going
to be size of the file so size in bytes
that's going to be the header text so
let's use a bound column for this
purpose so size n bytes and then the
data for this column so they say
property called the data field so the
data for this column within the grid
view control is going to come from size
column from the data source so in a bit
we'll specify what the data source for
this creature control is going to be we
discussed grid view in detail in asp.net
grid view tutorial so if you're new to
grid view control please watch the video
series all right so let's add another
bound column and that this column is
going to display the file type so that's
going to be the header text so the
header text is going to be
file type and the data for this column
is going to come from a column called
type within the data source okay and
then one more thing that we need to do
is we don't want you know other columns
to be auto-generated so let's click on
edit columns once again and let's
uncheck this checkbox Auto generate
fields click OK so that this grid view
control is not going to auto generate
columns for us okay and then one final
thing that we need to do here as far as
the scribbler configuration is concerned
is that we need to edit the template
within the template field so click on
this edit the templates link so you know
within the file I mean the file name
should be displayed using a link button
so that when we click that link button
we should be able to download that file
so now let's include a link button
that's the item template within that
template field and then let's edit the
data bindings for this link button
control ok so the text for this link
button so every time the text for this
link button should come from the data
source off the grid we control ok so
what what is rip from where is the text
for the link button going to come from
from which column it's going to come
from a column called a file that will be
within the data source and then we need
to use this eval function and again we
discuss this eval function within the
asp.net review tutorial so if you're new
to this function please watch that video
all right so that's going to be the text
and then I'm going to also set a command
argument or property of this link button
in a bit you'll understand how we are
going to make use of this command
argument and again the command argument
value is going to come from a file
column of the data source okay and then
one more thing that we need to do for
this link button is we need to specify
the command name so we can give any
meaningful command name but I'm going to
give it download because we will be
using this link button to download the
upload for uploaded file
all right so that's the configuration
for the template field so let's edit end
the template editing all right now let's
write the server-side code so when
should be a be able to upload the file
whenever we click this upload button so
let's go ahead and double click this
upload button so we have the event
handler there now first of all when we
run this application at the moment you
know we have the file upload control so
I will be able to select a file from the
client machine so when I click this
choose file look at that I am able to
select a file for example sequel
developer and then once I click this
upload button I should be able to upload
that at the moment when I click this
nothing is going to happen because we
haven't written any code so what should
we do we should be able to upload the
file so first of all we need to check if
the file upload control has a file
selected so file upload one dot has file
so this has file property is going to
return true or false if the file is
selected then it's going to return true
otherwise false so if the file is
selected then what we need to do we need
to upload that selected file so how do
we do that
so file upload one that posted file is
going to give us the file that we have
selected within the file upload control
and I want to save that file that posted
file so I'm going to use the save as
function so where do we want to save
that uploaded file we want to save it to
the data folder that is present within
the root directory of a web application
project ok so how am I going to get the
path of that I can use server dot map
path function so a server dot map part
and then the data folder is present
within the root directory of the web
application project so I'm going to use
the tilde 4 slash data so that's where
we need to upload the file that we have
within the file upload control
okay so that's the directory but then
with what name you want to save that
file you know with the same name as what
is there on the client machine so how do
I get the file name I can simply say
file upload one dot file name is going
to give us the name of the file okay
so this code should now be able to
upload the file let's see if with that's
working as expected so I have the
solution built let's refresh this view
and let's choose a file let's say we
want to upload this image I click upload
now let's go back to our visual studio
let's click on this show all files
within the solution Explorer look at
that the file is uploaded as expected so
once the file is uploaded what is our
next requirement our requirement is to
actually list the uploaded files within
the gridview control so we already have
a grid view control on our web form all
we need to do is now loop through this
directory get all the files that are
present within that directory and then
display the name of the file its size
and the file type within the grid view
control so let's say I have to do that
okay so we should do that within the
click event handler of the button
control because immediately after the
file is uploaded that's when we need to
also display the uploaded files within
the grid view control alright so how do
I get the list of files within this
folder so a folder is nothing but a
directory okay so anytime we need to
work with files and directories within
dotnet we need to import a namespace
called system dot IO so let's go ahead
and import that namespace and within
this namespace there is a class called a
directory class and this class has got a
static method called get files and if
you specify the part of the directory
this method is going to return the names
of all the files within the directory
you know in in the form of a string
array and then we can look through each
file and print its name okay so what's
the path the power
is so again we have to use the server
map a path function and then we need to
specify the path of that folder so till
the four slash data that's the folder so
what is this method going to return this
method is going to return a string array
so what we are going to do here we are
going to use a for each loop so for each
string and let's call it STR maybe file
in the string array that is returned by
this function so we are going to loop
through each name of the file and what
do we need to do we need to display the
name of the file its size and file type
so how do I get the file name so
obviously this variable is going to have
the name of the file but how am I going
to get the size of the file now there's
another class called the file info class
okay so file info let's call it fi is
equal to new file info and then if you
give it the file name so this file info
class is going to retrieve all the
information about that file that is its
name its size the file extension etc so
we can use this object to find out the
name of the file its size its type etc
okay so let's say alright now obviously
we want the name all these columns to be
displayed at the negative view control
and we need to specify a data source for
the grid view control so let's build a
data table dynamically so I'm going to
build a data table and again data table
is present in a namespace called system
data so let's go and include that
namespace
so let's create this data table now so
data table let's call it DJ so we've got
data table and within this data table we
need three columns so file size and the
tie okay so DT dot columns dot add and
then the first column name is going to
be file look at this I'm going to use
this overloaded version where we specify
the column name and the type and the
type is going to be a string so type of
the type of the column in that table is
going to be string because file name is
string so similarly we want file size
and file type okay so we have added the
required columns okay so now what we
need to do now we need to loop through
actually this piece of code let's move
it outside of the for each loop because
we don't want to build the table for
every file we just want one table and
then to that table we need to add a row
okay so we have the table with three
columns and now we are looping through
each file within that directory within
that data directory and then so do that
that to this data table we are going to
add rows so DT dot rows dot add so I'm
going to use this overloaded constructor
I mean this overloaded method add method
way we can specify the values for each
column within that row okay so the first
column is the file name so how do I get
the file name I can simply say fi dot
name so that's going to give us the file
name and then what is the next column
the size of the file so fi dot length is
going to give us the size of the file
look at
intellisense gets the size in bytes of
the current file and then the last one
is the file type whether if it's going
to be a text Word Excel etc I mean
basically file type now it turns out
that the file info object doesn't have
file type of property but what it has is
an extension property the file extension
property okay so it gives us the
extension of the file whether if it's a
dot txt dot do C or dot xlsx so we'll
get the extension but in a bit we'll see
how we can make use of that extension to
compute the file type okay so at this
point what do we have we have a data
table and we have looked through each
file within the data folder and added
the information of that file as a row to
the data table all that is left out at
the moment is to associate this data
table as the data source for the grid
view control so grid view 1 dot data
source is equal to data table and grid
view 1 dot data bind all right
so let's run this and see if we are able
to list the files okay so let's select a
file the word document let's click that
look at that at the moment we have two
files so and we have the size of the
files but the file type look at that we
are actually looking at the file
extension instead of the file type so
let's see how to get the file extension
so I mean we have the file extension
based on the file extension we need to
compute the file type and let's see how
to do that so what I'm going to do at
the moment is add a private function to
this code right here so let's add a
private function and this function is
going to return a string and let's call
it get file type by extension so we give
it the extension
and then based on that it should tell us
what is the file type okay so I'm going
to use the switch statement here so I'm
going to switch on this extension so we
are going to pass the extension of the
file to this function and this function
is going to return as the file type so
the extension I'm going to convert that
to lower so that it will be easier for
comparison so switch case so if it is
going to be dot d of C then what we want
to do we want to return saying that this
is a Microsoft Word document so if it
the extension is dot DL C we want to say
it's Microsoft Word document so I'm
going to return this hard-coded string
Microsoft Word document
okay now Microsoft Word documents can
also have an extension of dot d ocx so
whether if it is dot DL C or dot d ocx
return this for that extension okay so
we need to have a dot there all right
similarly we need to do the same thing
for Excel notepads images etc and to
just speed things up I have that already
type so let me copy that code and paste
it right there so it's it's a similar
quote except that we have different
extensions here and then if it is a
default then we are returning unknown so
if it's not any of this file type then
we are going to get this as the file DEP
that's unknown ok let's build a solution
let's go ahead refresh this view upload
another file maybe the notepad
click upload look at that oh ok
look at that still I don't get the file
type why is that that's because we have
defined of a private function but we are
not really using that so what we need to
do is here we are passing file extension
ok directly to the row but instead of
that I'm going to call this function and
then pass the return type of that
function as the value for that column
okay all we are doing is invoking the
function that's it so let's build our
project let's click this button once
again so now look at that text document
microsoft word document image okay so we
have achieved everything except you know
downloading so when I click this button
right here I should be able to download
that file okay but at the moment when I
click on that nothing is going to happen
why we haven't written the code so let's
go ahead and implement the download code
so within the web form we have this grid
view control and if you remember within
this crib you control this is a link
button okay so whenever we click the
link button within the grid view control
grid view raises an event called row
command event okay so let's go ahead and
handle the true command event so I'm
going to go to the properties of the
grid view control click on the lightning
bolt symbol and there's going to be
something called row command event so
I'm going to double click on that one
that will generate the row command even
handler so here we are going to write
the code to download the uploaded files
so if so that this object grid view
command event arguments object so this
is going to contain all the properties
that we need so if a dot command name is
equal to download and if you remember we
have set the command name property of
the link button within the grid view
control in that template field so within
the grid view control the first column
is a template field and within that we
have this link button and notice that we
have set the command the name as
download so if somebody has clicked this
link button then it's going to raise a
command with the name download so if
that is the command that name so if
command name is Don load then we what we
need to do we need to download the file
so first of all I'm going to clear
anything that is present within the
response strain and then response dot we
need to specify the content type so the
content type is an application content
so application for slash octet stream
and then we also need to append a header
so response dot append adder so content
- disposition and then we need to
specify the file name so file name is
equal to' so where are we going to get
the file name that we want to download
and again if you remember you know look
at this the link button text is nothing
but the file name not only that when we
were configuring the link button within
the template field we have set command
argument property of the link button to
be this file name ok so we're going to
make use of that command argument so e
dot command argument is going to return
us the file name okay and then finally
what we need to do we need to stream the
file so the response dot transmit file
ok and we need to specify the file name
i mean basically the full path of the
file name so we're going to make use of
the server dot map path we have used the
server dot map path several times now if
you need to know what the server map dot
map path is actually doing I have
recorded a video on this in the previous
sessions of this asp.net video series so
please watch that video all right
so till that for slash within the data
folder and how are we going to get the
file name again you dot command argument
is going to give us that and finally
after we have transmitted the file and
the response that's that so let's build
the solution let's go ahead and try to
upload another file let's select the
file first of all so we have Word
document we have notepad image let's now
upload this excel
document look at that we get the file
type as expected let's click on any of
these for example let me click on this
relationship dot Excel look at that the
moment I do that I am able to download
that and I want to download this image
the word document so we are able to
upload and download files alright so
this is the code to upload files that we
have just written and this is the code
to get the file extension I mean file
type based on the file extension and
this is the code to download the file
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
