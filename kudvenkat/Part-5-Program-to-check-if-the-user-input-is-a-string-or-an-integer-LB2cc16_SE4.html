questions and answers video series in
this video we'll discuss writing a
program in C sharp to check if the user
input is a string or an integer this is
straightforward to achieve if you have
used the tryparse function then you
already know the answer one of your
YouTube channel subscribers faces
question in a c-sharp returned test so
let's flip to Jill studio and here I
have a new control application the first
step here is to actually prompt the user
to enter his input so let's say please
type your input and press Enter key at
which point the user will start you know
entering his input and to receive the
input we are going to have a variable of
type string and let's call it an STR
input and let's read the value that the
user has entered using console dot
readline method and notice that we are
storing it in the string variable
because read line is going to return
that input in a string format so now
what we are going to do is create
another variable of type integer let's
call it result and initialize that to
zero okay now we are going to use try
parse function so what is this tryparse
function going to do so basically notice
that it has got two parameters the first
parameter is the string so we are going
to pass the string that we have read
from the console that the user has
entered and then what this dry parts
function is going to do as the name
suggests it's going to try to parse that
value into an integer okay and if it is
successful then it's going to return
true otherwise it's going to return
false okay so the string that we want to
convert to integer is stored in this
variable and look at this this is an
output parameter so we have to use the
out keyword and then specify the
variable which is going to receive the
converted value in this case we want
result to receive the converted value
okay so what is this function doing now
it's going to try to parse the value
that is stored in this variable and then
store it in this
variable that is resolved so if the
conversion is successful the method will
return true and this variable will
contain that integer value if the
conversion is unsuccessful then this
method is going to return false so what
we can do here is use an if statement if
try parts is successful if it has
returned true then all we do is control
the trade line your input whatever is
the input is a number and where is the
input present that student result
variable else
so if tryparse has returned false then
it comes to the else block in which case
we'll print a message saying your input
is not a number and the input is present
in str input variable right so let's go
and run this now so first let's enter
something like T and that's not a valid
integer so when we press ENTER it says
your input 10 is not a number on the
other hand let's run this and enter
something like 999 which is a number
your input 999 is a number so it's that
straight for all we need to know is
understand to use tryparse function
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
