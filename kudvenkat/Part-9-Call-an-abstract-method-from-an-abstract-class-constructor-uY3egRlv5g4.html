questions video series in this video
will answer this interview question can
you call an abstract method from an
abstract class constructor the answer is
yes let's look at an example let's first
create an abstract class let's call it
customer let's include an abstract
method let's call it plant
let's now include a constructor and
within the constructor let's invoke the
print method now notice that we are
invoking this abstract print method
within the constructor of this abstract
class so can you call an abstract method
from an abstract class constructor the
answer is yes now the abstract method
within the abstract class doesn't have
any implementation so what's the use of
calling this abstract method from the
constructor of the abstract class to
answer this question let's create
another class let's call it savings
customer and let's make this class
inherit from the abstract customer class
let's provide the implementation for the
abstract print method let's just print a
message to the console saying that this
is savings customer class print method
invoked all right now let's create
another class and let's call this class
corporate customer
and this class is also inheriting from
the same abstract class customer and
let's change the message to corporate
customer class print method invoked and
now within our main method let's create
an instance of our savings customer
class let's call it SC equals new
savings customer and similarly let's
create an instance for corporate
customer class alright so within the
main method we're just creating
instances of the derived classes now
let's run this and see what's going to
happen look at that savings customer
class print method invoked corporate
customer class print method invoked now
are we invoking the print method
explicitly here no we are not so how is
that getting called now look at these
classes savings customer class and this
cust abstract customer class they are
related with each other through
inheritance now we know that when we
create an instance of a derived class
the parent class constructor is
automatically called and for savings
customer the parent class is customer
class and within the constructor of that
class we are invoking the print method
so this overridden print method will be
get called automatically so if you want
the abstract method to be invoked
automatically whenever an instance of
the class that is derived from the
abstract class is created then we would
call it in the constructor of the
abstract class that's it for today thank
you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
