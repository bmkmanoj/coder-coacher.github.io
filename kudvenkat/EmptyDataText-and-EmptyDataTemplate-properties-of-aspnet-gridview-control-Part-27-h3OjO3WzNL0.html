am venket this is part 27 of asp.net
grid-view tutorial in this video we'll
discuss about empty data text and empty
data template properties of asp.net
could feed control by default in asp.net
grid-view will not display anything on
the webform if there are no rules in the
data source to which the gridview is
bound let's understand this with an
example I have this table TBL product
which has got some sample data we want
to display this data with an accurate
view control so let's drag and drop grid
view control onto this waveform
let's auto format that let's choose
brown sugar scheme let's now
drag-and-drop a sequel data source
control let's configure the data source
let's select our connection string from
web config file click Next and select
your table TBL product click Next
test your query finish now let's
associate that sequel data source
control with this grid view control now
in this table TBL product we have some
rows so obviously those rows will be
retrieved from that table and then
displayed within this could be control
as expected so I have the header and
data rows as expected now let's say you
know I'm going to delete these rows from
this table so delete from TBL product
that's going to delete all the rows so
there are no rules in this table now
let's go ahead and refresh this page now
look at this what happened there's
nothing on this web page okay
now let's view the page source
right-click on the page view page source
now if you look at the page source here
look at this the grid view control is
not at all rendered okay so if there are
no rows the grid view control doesn't
render anything now let's say my
requirement is in such a way that if
there are no rows in the data source to
which the grid view control is bound
then I want to display a message on the
webform saying there are no products to
display and I want the grid view to do
that okay
is it possible absolutely and that's
what this empty data text property is
for so I am setting here empty data text
property - there are no products to
display so obviously there are no rows
in the data source to which the grid
view is bound then this message will be
displayed by the grid view control let's
see that in action
let's actually flip this waveform to the
source mode let's set that empty data
text property of the grid view control
so Mt
data text is a file term let's type that
message there so there are no products
to display now let me run this since
there are no rules within the data
source to which the grid view control is
bound I have this message here so one
option is basically to use empty data
text property there is another way to do
exactly the same thing we can make use
of empty data template look at this here
I'm using empty data template now if you
recollect from the previous sessions of
the grid view control there are several
templates that grid view can use for
example item template edit item template
etc okay similarly we can also have
empty data template and this template is
used when there are no rules within the
data source with which the grid view
control is found okay so let's use empty
data template and then all I'm doing
within this template is putting that
message there okay so now if you look at
this I have empty data text property and
empty data template both of them said so
and just to differentiate I'm going to
use - EDT M empty data template okay so
this is the message here and this is a
message here so since we have both of
them set which one do you think it's
going to use it's going to use empty
data template so if we have both empty
data text property set and empty data
template used then empty data template
has higher precedence over empty data
text okay and then if you want to
control the styles of the message that
is displayed here then we can make use
of this in Oh temple I mean empty data
roof style again grid view control
supports several styles for example you
know if you look at this here we have a
footer style header style rule style
pager style etc you know similar to them
we also have something called empty data
row style and let's say for example I
want the font to be underlined you know
I can basically select that font
underline is equal to true okay so if we
run this now as you might expect you
know
that message will be underlined so use
empty data row style property basically
to set the display styles of the empty
data row alright now if you set both as
we discussed empty data template is
going to be used instead of empty data
texts now what's the difference between
them why do we have two properties here
to achieve the same thing that's because
you know if you want to have greater
control on what you want to display then
use empty data template for example
let's say I want to display a structure
like this a table like structure you
know column headers and then you know a
message within that table like there are
no products to display okay now if you
want to do something like this then you
cannot do that using empty data text
property because empty data text is only
a string you can only specify a string
there but within an empty data template
you can use anything that you want for
example if I want to use a table I can
use a table there okay you can use
anything that any HTML that you want
within this empty data template so it
gives you far more flexibility than
empty data text property so obviously if
I want to display structure like this
then look at what I might what I'm doing
I'm having a table here and then within
that table I have at TR and that TR has
got four TDs obviously to display these
headers product ID name unit price
quantity sold etc okay for TDs and then
I have another TR and then within this
dear look at this I only have one TD but
the width of that TD is spanning across
four columns you know for PDS
that's why we are setting called span is
equal to four meaning span across these
four columns this one theory okay so
there are no products to display okay
now instead of typing all this I have
this already typed so we can simply copy
and paste it there now if you're
wondering how did I you know arrive at
these styles and these colors all these
things what I basically have done is
that's actually inside this data into
the table back so obviously now we have
some data here so when we have the data
empty data template and empty data text
properties will not be used because we
have data so the data will be displayed
so I get this data now if I right-click
on that and when I
say view page source you know whatever
is the HTML that is generated here I
just copied you know those styles from
there okay and then you know I pasted
them here anyhow
so let me copy those that HTML there and
then paste that within the empty data
template here okay let's format that to
format that + ctrl K and D automatic I
mean it will be automatically formatted
for us okay so that's formatted now so
obviously when we run this now that
empty data template should be is now
because we still have data in that data
source let's go and they need the data
okay so now we don't have any data in
this table let's refresh this and see
what's going to happen look at that it's
using that empty data template now
product ID name unit price you know the
column headers and that message as you
expect alright on this slide you can
find resources for asp.net c-sharp and
sequels of interview questions that's it
for today thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
