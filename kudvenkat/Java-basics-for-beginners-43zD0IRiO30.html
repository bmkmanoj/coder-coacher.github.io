previous tutorial we learnt about Java
programming language and how it was born
we also discussed about popularity of
Java programming language in this
tutorial we are going to learn about
life cycle of a Java program we will
create a sample program and understand
what are different phases in its life
cycle we will learn what are the various
keywords in Java programming language we
will see how do we declare the variables
quarter different data types and how to
name the variables water conventions
associated with these so let's get
started in order to understand the life
cycle of Java program we will actually
create a Java program combo console
window on the command prompt I am going
to use notepad to create a simple
program and I name it program dot Java
in this program I am going to create a
class by lean program and this class is
going to have a single method called me
this mean method is very simple it is
going to print out system dot out dot
println hello world
once I say this I see that I have a file
called program dot Java now we know that
Java is platform-independent programming
language because once you write your
program in any third Java file and then
you compile it
then this Java files is passed and
beaten red dot class file which contains
the byte code the byte code can be
executed and is readable by JVM and
every operating system has its own JVM
so JM is platform dependent but due to
JVM the Java language has become
platform independent now let's see this
in action Java C is the command for Java
compiler here C stands for compiler one
size right Java C program for Java the
program gets compiled and we C or dot
plus file generated this dot class file
contains the byte code that can be
executed in the JVM JVM stands for Java
Virtual Machine in order to execute this
program we use the Java command again
and we typed our program and we see the
output hello world now let's understand
this in more detail we wrote a program
in a Java file whose extension was
towards our we compiled it to bytecode
and we generated the dot class while
using the Java C or Java compiler and
then we executed the program in jail iam
using Java command in the program that
we wrote just now you might have
observed some special keywords like
static void main etc from these some of
the words are Java reserved keywords for
example class static
public etc programming languages are
characterized by dozens of keywords and
different rules of grammar on same line
Java programming language also has its
own set of keywords and then there are
grammar rules to write program
statements to understand this better see
the keywords which are displayed on the
slide you might be unfamiliar with most
of them today but trust me by the end of
this course you will know most of them
let's understand how do we declare
variables in Java variables are simply
the placeholders to store some kind of
data Java is strongly typed language
which means that before declaring a
variable or while declaring a variable
you need to specify its type some
programming languages are little bit
relaxed on this front and then they
where they allow creating or declaring
the variables without specifying this
type but Java is strongly typed
programming language we declared our
variable by specifying a type followed
by the variable name for example if I
want to declare a variable X then I
write in to X here int is the data type
and X is the name of the variable we can
declare multiple variables on the same
statement like int X comma Y comma Z we
can also initialize the value while
declaring the variables like in X equal
to 5 into X is equal to 5 y equal to 10
once you have declared the variable you
can always change its value and you can
assign X equal to 10 this is called
variable assignment there are different
data types in Java let's talk about
primitive data types first primitive
data types
a boolean cap byte short int long float
and double say you want to store a value
of two oddballs you would use boolean
data type if you want to store M or F
male or female for sixth attribute then
you would use care as a data type for
integral data which is numeric but
doesn't have decimals you might use byte
short int or long for floating data
types you might use float or double all
these data types consume different
amount of memory for example by consumes
by consumes one byte of memory it allows
us to store values in the range of minus
128 to 127 short in there long consume 2
4 &amp;amp; 8 bytes respectively and depending
upon the number of bits used in a
storage they have different range of
values that they support float and
double allow us to store values and they
consume 4 and 8 bytes respectively tab
is used to store Unicode characters and
it consumes 2 bytes of memory
Boonen is something special that
consumes only one bit of memory but it
allows you to store true and false as to
violet values remember that anything in
Java that is not a primitive data type
is a reference we will learn about
classes interfaces enumerations array in
future tutorials and all these are
reference data types
whenever Java program executes there are
two different types of memories that
come into play stack memory and heap
memory primitive data types and the
program call stack resides on stack
memory whereas reference data types get
the memory allocated on the heap but
their reference variables can reside on
stack
when you declare a variable like in X
here X is the name of the variable while
declaring the variable you have to keep
be little careful while choosing the
variable means a very variable name in
Java starts with letter of an alphabet
or an underscore or a dollar sign
however we encourage you not to use
underscore and dollar in beginning of
the variable names also any variable
name that starts with a numeric
character is invalid like employ hash
one contains a special character hash
that is also invalid variable name in
this tutorial we learnt about what are
different Java keywords and we created a
samples our programmed and executed it
prompt the command prompt we learnt
about the life cycle of Java program we
saw how a Java file is compiled into dot
class file and then that dot class while
containing the byte code can be executed
in any JVM we also learned how to
declare the variables finally we also
saw the different datatypes primitive
and reference data types in Java in next
tutorial we will discuss in detail how
to create classes what are the exes
modifiers and what are the basic tenets
of object-oriented design so stay tuned
see you in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
