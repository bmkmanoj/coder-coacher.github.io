this video well discuss what is Jason
Jason arrays and nested jason object
what is jason jason stands for
JavaScript object notation jason is a
lightweight data interchange format
that's widely used by applications these
days
jason is an easier to use alternative to
xml let's say for example we want to
represent an employee data let's say we
want to capture employees first-name
lastname gender and salary if we want to
represent such an employee's data in XML
format this is how we would do it we
would create an employee element and
within that we would have first-name
lastname gender and salary elements so
here we are representing the employee's
data using XML format now if we want to
represent the same employee data in JSON
format this is how we would do it here
employee jason is a JSON object we would
create a JSON object using a pair of
curly braces and within the curly braces
we have got name value pairs so here our
first-name lastname gender and salary
are the property names of this employee
JSON object Todd here is the value for
first-name property so we would separate
the property names and the values using
a colon symbol and multiple properties
are separated using a comma so here at
the moment we've got four properties
within this employee JSON object but you
can have as many properties as you want
so this is how we would create a JSON
object now if we want to read data from
this JSON object we would simply use the
property names for example if we want to
read the first name property value we
would simply say employee JSON which is
our variable here JSON object dot
first-name similarly if you want to read
salary property value dot salary in fact
if you are using tools like Visual
Studio as soon as you type employee JSON
and as soon as you type dot you would
see in the intelligence all the property
names of this employee JSON object so
let's look at this in action let's flip
to visual studio so within our jQuery
ready function let's clear
variable let's call this employee Jason
equals so we clearly JSON object using a
pair of curly braces so the first
property that we want is first name and
we would separate the property names and
the values using a colon symbol the
value for this property is going to be
taut and the second property is going to
be lastname so we are separating
multiple properties using comma so the
value for last name is going to be
Grover third property is going to be
gender and the value is going to be male
and the last property is salary and the
value is going to be 50,000 so here
employee Jason is in JSON format now
let's say we have a development within
the body element
so let's actually give it an ID let's
call it the result so what we want to do
is display the employee jason property
and its value in this development so we
want the property name as well and its
value okay so let's create a variable
here let's name this result and
initialize that to an empty string so
result plus equals so we want the string
first-name equals
employee Jason so we want to read the
first name property value so I'm using
this JSON object employee Jason dot
first name should give us the value of
that property and look at this as soon
as I type dot within the intelligence we
can see all the property names of the
employee Jason object so we want to read
first name property value and then let's
up in an HTML break so we get each
property name at its value in a separate
line so I'm going to actually make three
more copies of this and lastname equals
employee Jason dot last name
and similarly gender equals employee
Jason gender and finally salary equals
employee Jason dot salary so we have
that string within this result variable
so we want to find this development and
set the HTML for that so I'm going to
use jQuery ID selector and the ID
selector is pound so find element by ID
and the element that we want to find is
resolved there and set it its HTML all
right
so let's save these changes and when we
reload we should say you know all the
property names and their respective
values so here is the example where you
know we are creating a JSON object and
reading the data that's present within
that JSON object and displaying that
within the development now what if you
want to store more than one employee
data in the JSON object at the moment
look at this this JSON object only
stores one employee object but let's say
I also have another employees here and I
want to store hard details as well
within this object so if we want to
store multiple employee data if it's in
the JSON object that's when we use JSON
arrays so a JSON array can contain
multiple objects and to create a JSON
array all you would do is use a pair of
brackets so here we have you know a
square bracket here and another here
okay
and within that square brackets we will
have you know our respective employee
objects which are in JSON format so
within the first pair of curly braces we
have a first JSON object and then the
second JSON object is present in the
second set of curly braces and we
separate these objects using a comma
okay so let's look at that in action
so I use a pair of square brackets so
this is our first JSON object now I'm
going to separate you know the first and
second JSON object using a comma and
then I'm going to use another pair of
curly braces and within this set of
curly braces we are going to have our
second JSON object and it's going to
have the same set of properties so I'm
going to make a copy of that and change
the values so Sarah is going to the
first name Baker is the last name gender
is female and salary is 40,000 okay so
here employees jason is a JSON array
which at the moment contains two JSON
objects okay so now if we want to
retrieve data from the JSON array you
would index start using its index
position so let's say for example I want
to retrieve the first employees first
name to do that I would simply use the
variable name which is employees Jason
this is a JSON array so I'm going to
index that with the index position of
the object that you know I want to
retrieve so employees jason of 0 is
going to return us this JSON object from
that JSON object I want in or maybe
first name property so when we reload
this page we should see Todd within the
development similarly if you want the
second JSON object you would use index
position 1 and that should return Sarah
so to store in a multiple JSON objects
we would use a JSON array another way to
store multiple employees in the JSON
object is by nesting them so at the
moment here we're using it JSON array
but you could also nest them so instead
of using a JSON array I'm going to nest
these JSON objects and to nest the JSON
objects instead of using square brackets
we would use an additional pair of curly
braces so I'm going to use a curly brace
here so that's the opening curly brace
and I'm going to close that here okay
and then this is our first JSON object
so I'm going to put a string here I'm
going to call this Todd :
your first JSON object okay and then
here's our second JSON object so I'm
going to call this Sarah :
and that's our second JSON object let's
actually format this properly by
pressing ctrl K and D okay so we have
toward employee object and setter
employee object now here we are nesting
the objects so let's say for example I
want to retrieve toward employees salary
if that's the case since this is not an
array here we have nested the objects so
I can simply say employees jason dot and
look at that I can see Todd and Sarah
here so we want Todd salary so employees
jason todd dot we should see salary
property and now when we reload this
page we should see cell
Todd salary which is 50,000 similarly if
we want to retrieve any of the
properties of sarah employee object we
would simply say sarah dot salary should
give you salary which is 40,000 now this
JSON formatted data is widely used these
days by many applications in our
upcoming videos we'll discuss where we
could use this JSON formatted data
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
