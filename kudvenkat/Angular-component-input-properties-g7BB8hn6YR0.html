this video well discuss how to pass data
from the container component that is our
Employee List component to the nested
component that is our employee count
component using input properties at the
moment the count of employees that we
have against each of these radio buttons
these counts are a hard-coded within our
employee count component as you can see
right here now these are the hard-coded
values which we are displaying on the
webpage at the moment if you look at
this Employee List component which is
our parent component this component has
the list of employees so this component
has the information about those counts
and this component should be able to
pass values for these three properties
and for the parent component to be able
to do that we will have to convert these
properties within our child component to
input properties to be able to convert
these properties to input properties we
will have to decorate these properties
with input decorator and to do that we
will have to first import input from
angular core so just like how we are
importing component we are also
importing input from angular core and
then we need to decorate these three
properties that we have with input
decorator which makes them input
properties because we have decorated
these properties with input decorator
and they are going to receive the values
from our parent component which is our
Employee List component there is no need
to specify any default values so let's
get rid of those default values as well
so at the moment we have turned all the
properties that we have within our
employee count component that is our
child component to input properties all
that is left now is to pass the values
for those input properties from our
parent component which is Employee List
component here are those two changes
which we have done with our child
component which is employee count
component so the key point to remember
here is to make a property and input
property simply decorated with input
decorator
now let's look at the changes required
within our parent component that is
loyalist component we need to make two
changes within our employee list
complaint one change is within the
employee list component class and the
other change is in the view template
first let's look at the change required
within the component class so let's open
this type script file which contains our
employee list component class and within
this class I'm going to introduce a
method let's call it get total employees
count as the name suggests this method
is going to return us the total number
of employees so let's set the return
type of the method to number and to get
the total number of employees we are
going to use this property which
contains the list of employee objects so
let's simply return this dot employees
dot land
so the length property should give us
the total number of employees now we
want another method which is going to
return the total number of male
employees so let's make a copy of this
method and then change the name of the
method to get total male employees count
and again this method is going to return
number and we want this method to return
us only the male employee is count so on
the employees property here I'm going to
use the first method and then specify
our condition that we only want those
employees whose gender is equal to male
and notice here at the moment we using
triple equals instead of double equals
in a bed we'll discuss the use of single
double and triple equals in typescript
for now let's include another method
which is going to return us the total
number of female employees so let's
change the method name here to get total
female employees count and then here we
want to change the gender to female so
these are the changes required within
our component class so what is the use
of single double and triple equals in
typescript we use single equals for
assignment that is to assign a value to
a page
Abell double equals to compare two
variable values similarly triple equals
is also used to compare two variable
values in addition triple equals also
compare their underlying data types
finally let's look at the change
required within the view template of our
Employee List complaint so let's open
this HTML file notice within the view
template of our employee list component
they using this selector of the child
component that is our employee count
complaint as a directive and what we
want to be able to do is for these three
properties that we have within our child
component all male and female we want to
pass values from the parent component
that is from our employee list component
and for that purpose we've created these
three methods which returned their
respective counts so we want to be able
to bind these methods to these input
properties that we have within the child
component so within the view template
where we are using the child component
selector as a directive we are going to
use property binding and bind to the
input properties of the employee count
component so within square bracket we
specify the name of the property in this
case also we want to bind to this all
input property of the change component
and to that property we want to bind
this method that we have at an apparent
component get total employees count so
let's copy that and specify it right
here now we need to do the same thing
for the rest of the properties notice to
the male input property we are binding
get total male employees count and for
the female input property we are binding
get total female employees count so
let's save all our changes and free load
of webpage notice now we see the correct
set of employees next to each video
button we
have a total of five employees out of
which three are male and to a female now
to this employees array let's add
another employee object notice the
gender of this new employee is male
let's see what changes and then reload a
web page and look at what happens to the
counts notice the counts are
automatically picked up we have total of
six employees now out of which four are
male and two a female so at the moment
using the input properties we are able
to pass data from the Container
component to the nested component but at
the moment when we click these radio
buttons nothing happens in our next
video we'll discuss how to pass these
user actions from the child component to
the parent component using output
properties so we can react and then
display only the appropriate set of
employees in this table depending on our
radio button selections so here we have
the changes we made to the employee list
component class and a few template thank
you for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
