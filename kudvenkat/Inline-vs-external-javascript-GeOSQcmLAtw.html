in this video well discuss different
places where JavaScript can be present
and the advantages of external
javascript over inline javascript
javascript can be stored either inline
on the page as you can see in this
example or in an external dot JS file
first let's look at the user interface
that this HTML provides us with this how
the user interface looks like we've got
this little text number followed by that
we have this asp.net text box control
into which the end user can enter a
number and then once we click this
button check number it's going to call a
JavaScript function which is going to
check whether the entered number is even
or odd for example here we have entered
number 10 when we click the button
notice that it says 10 is even number if
we enter an odd number and click the
button it says Levin is odd number now
let's look at the HTML and JavaScript
that we've got on the page so first
let's look at the HTML that's present
within the form tag notice that we have
that literal text number followed by
that we have this a speed art and text
box control with ID text box 1 and
following that we have an HTML button
now you may be wondering why didn't we
use asp.net button control when we use a
speed or net button control any when you
click on that it's going to post the
form to the server and we don't want
that to happen all we want to do is when
we click that button we want to call a
JavaScript function which is going to
check whether the number that we entered
in this text box is even or odd so
that's the reason why I'm using this
HTML button and when we click on this
button we are calling this JavaScript
function is even and if you look at what
this function is doing we are retrieving
the value that we have entered in
textbox 1 and storing that in this
variable number then we are checking
when this number is divided by 2 if the
reminder is 0 then we are displaying a
message within the alert box saying
number is even number otherwise odd
number now in this example the
JavaScript function is present in line
on the page and we have seen this in
action just now now let's see how to
store this JavaScript function
in an external javascript file and then
reference that external javascript file
on this form and use that ease even
function the same way as we did now so
the first step is to add that external
javascript file to this project so right
click on the project within the solution
Explorer add a new item and under the
web tab select a script file and give it
a meaningful name let's name it
external JavaScript and JavaScript files
have dot J's extension now let's move
this JavaScript function from the page
into that external file so within the
external javascript file we have our
javascript function and we want to use
this function on this waveform which
means we will have to reference that
file on this waveform so how are we
going to do that we use the source
attribute of the script element source
equals and we specify the name of the
file external javascript dot j s and
this file has got that easy even
function and when we click this button
we want to call that javascript function
so pretty straightforward now let's run
this and see if it's going to work the
same way as before so when we enter an
even number check number 10 is even and
when we enter an odd number 11 is odd
number all right now let's look at the
advantages of external javascript over
inline javascript there are several
advantages the first one is
maintainability javascript in external
files can be referenced on multiple
pages without having to duplicate the
code inline on every page let's say for
example in our project we have caught
like 10 web forms and on that all 10
forms we want to use this easy even
JavaScript function now if it's present
in the next terminal javascript file
like this then all you need to do is
reference that file on all of those 10
forms and then use the function now
tomorrow if there is a problem within
that function and if we have to change
it for some reason
then you only have
place to change so maintainability is
much easier on the other hand if you
have this function inline on every page
and if it has to change you will have to
change it on all the ten different files
now what is the problem with that the
problem is number one that process is
tedious because you have more files to
change now and the other one is it's
error-prone you may forget to change it
on one of the files and the behavior on
that file is obviously definitely not
what we expect so
storing JavaScript in an external files
you know makes it reusable and
maintainability will also be much easier
the other advantage is separation of
concerns storing JavaScript in a
separate external dot JS file adheres to
separation of concerns design principle
in general it's a good practice to
separate HTML CSS and JavaScript as it
makes it easier working with them now
just imagine what what does this page
look like if we have all the HTML all
the JavaScript and all the CSS on the
same page obviously the page is going to
look much cluttered you know it's not
easy to read the pages if we have
everything on the given page whereas if
you put CSS in its own CSS file and
JavaScript in its own jscript file and
HTML on the web form you know we have
them clearly separated now if there is a
problem with the logic on the page then
we know that we have to look in the
JavaScript file if it's a problem with
the Styles then we know we have to look
at these styles which is CSS file if
it's a problem with the HTML then we
know we look at this webform right so
separation of concerns and it also
allows multiple developers to work
simultaneously on these different files
and the other greatest advantage is the
performance an external javascript file
can be cached by the browser whereas an
inline JavaScript on the page is loaded
every time the page loads thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
