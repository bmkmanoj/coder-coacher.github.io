tutorial in this video we'll discuss the
most common Visual Studio keyboard
shortcuts that we can use on a daily
basis to be more productive to format a
document use ctrl K Day let's flip to
visual studio here I have an asp.net
webforms application within this
platform one dot aspx page let's paste
some HTML and if you look at this HTML
right here it's not very readable why
because it's not formatted properly to
format this piece of HTML select the
HTML and then + ctrl K D notice how
quickly it gets formatted look at the
dev table TR and TD tags all of them are
properly aligned and the code is more
readable now because it's formatted
properly now using this keyboard
shortcut ctrl K D we can format any
document in visual studio we've just
seen how to format an aspx page let's
see how to format the code-behind page
if you look at the code within this code
behind page right here it's not very
readable because of the fact that it's
not formatted properly to format this
code select the code and then + ctrl K D
look at how quickly it gets formatted to
comment code control KC to uncomment
ctrl K you see for comment you for
uncommon control K is common for example
to comment these two lines of code here
we select those two lines press ctrl K C
to uncomment ctrl K you you can also use
this keyboard shortcut to comment the
HTML so if I want to comment this row
control KC to uncomment ctrl K you to
show intellisense control space now if
you look at the code behind file right
here if I want you know when we plus for
example response dot we get the
intellisense window for some reason if
we press the Escape key we lose that
interrelations window to bring back the
ventilations window one way is to delete
that dot and then plus the dot again now
if we want to bring back the inter
license window without deleting the dot
then it is control space look at that it
brings back
the intellisense vendor alright now the
next keyboard shortcut is toggling
fullscreen alt shift enter now if you
want more working space then you want to
go into full screen mode and to go into
full screen mode it is alt shift and
look at that we are in full screen mode
right now and we have more working space
and to get out of the full screen mode +
alt shift enter again to build the
project shift f6 to build the entire
solution f6 or control shift Bay if you
look at the solution right here at the
moment we have got 2 project class
library 1 and web application 1 at the
moment we have web application 1
selected now if I + shift f6 notice the
status bar it says build succeeded and
if you look at the output window look at
that one succeeded and then it has built
web application 1 now if you want to
build class library 1 project select
class library one project and then +
Shift f6 again it says build succeeded
output window build one succeeded now it
has bared the class library one project
so if you want to just build a specific
project then it is Shift f6 if you want
to build the entire solution then it is
f6 so notice the status bar will
succeeded and within the output window
now it says - succeeded and it has built
both the application 1 and class library
1 projects you can either use f6 or
control shift Bey to build the entire
solution attach the debugger to a
process control alt page so when you are
debugging if you want to attach the
debugger to a process you'll simply
click a debug and then select attach to
process which should bring up attach to
process window the keyboard shortcut for
that is ctrl alt P so which should bring
the same window so ctrl alt pay
expand or collapse current element
control mm so this is again a very
useful feature so if you want to
collapse for example this page load
method you know while you are on that
method press control mm that's going to
collapse it if you press it again it's
going to expand it for example if I put
the cursor within the namespace and then
plus control mm it's going to collapse
that control mm is going to expand it
again collapse all control m Oh so if
you want to collapse everything control
mo and if you want to toggle all
outlining its control ml so control ml
so it has expanded everything now
control ml is going to collapse
everything convert selected text to
uppercase
so let's actually press control ml to
toggle the outlining now if I want you
know to convert this text to uppercase
you know I can simply select the text
and then press control shift you that's
going to convert that selected text to
uppercase if you want to convert that to
a lowercase control you okay so these
set of keyboard shortcuts that we can
use on a daily basis which makes us more
productive there are several other
keyboard shortcuts as well but these are
some things that we use you know very
commonly that's it for today thank you
