in this video well discuss how to check
if javascript is enabled or disabled
let's understand this with an example
let's say we have a page like this which
captures name and gender both of these
fields are required fields this page
relies on JavaScript being enabled for
performing client-side validation in
reality it's a good practice to always
have server-side validation irrespective
of whether we have client-side
validation or not for the purpose of
this demo let's assume that we only have
client-side validation first let's go
ahead and design a page that looks like
this in the interest of time I have
already implemented the required HTML so
let's flip to visual studio so here we
have the table element where we have set
the border to 1 and inside this table we
have 2 TRS and within the first year we
have 2 TDs
the first TD has got this little text
name and within the second TD we have a
text box to capture name similarly in
the second er we have 2 TDs in the first
TD we have gender and in the second TD
we have a text box to capture gender and
here we have a section for script let's
go ahead and write a JavaScript function
let's name this function validate if
empty and the dysfunction let's pass the
ID of the control that we want to
validate as a parameter let's create a
variable let's name it control document
dot get element by ID and to this
function we pass the control ID that we
receive as a parameter if control dot
value is equal to an empty string then
we know that they use it intent any
value into that control in that case we
want to set the background color of that
control to red indicating that it's a
required field if it is not empty then
we know that the user has entered
something into that control in that case
we
the background to be white so a very
simple JavaScript function to perform
validation and we want to call this
javascript function when on focus event
occurs on the control that is whenever
the control receives the focus and this
function we need to pass the control ID
and the control ID is txt name so we
want to call this function also when on
blur event occurs
similarly when keyup event occurs let's
do the same thing with the other textbox
so let's copy all these event names and
paste them right here
now here we need to change the ID of the
control the idea of the control in this
case is txt gender so let's copy and
paste it
so at the moment we have a very simple
page with two text boxes and a
JavaScript validation function to
validate that text boxes are empty at
the moment we have JavaScript enabled
look at this as soon as the text box
receives focus the validation kicks in
and the background color shows red
indicating that it's a required field
but the moment we start typing look at
that the background is changed to white
similarly gender male and the moment we
delete the last character we again have
the validation in place so basically
this is a working page javascript is
enabled so everything is working as
expected
let's go ahead and disable JavaScript to
disable JavaScript in Google Chrome
click on this icon on the top right hand
corner and then select settings and on
the settings page within this search
settings text box type JavaScript and
then click on this button content
settings then notice this under this
JavaScript section we have a radio
button which says do not allow any sites
to run JavaScript select that click done
to save changes now let's go ahead and
reload this page now the moment we have
JavaScript disabled so look at this the
validation does not kick in okay because
we don't have JavaScript enable okay now
what we want to do is if javascript is
enable then we want to display this name
and gender elements and the user can
continue to use the application but if
javascript is disabled then we want to
hide these elements and display an error
message to the user saying you know it
seems that you have disabled javascript
please enable JavaScript and the easiest
way to detect if javascript is enabled
or not is by using no script tag the
content inside this no script tag will
be displayed only if scripts are not
supported by the browser or if the
client has disabled JavaScript support
ok so let's see how to use this no
script element
so let's use no script and let's include
an h1 element and the error message that
we want is it seems that you have
disabled JavaScript please enable
JavaScript so let's copy and paste that
here so at the moment we have javascript
disabled so when I reload this page look
at that
it shows the error message that we
expect since we have javascript disabled
the content that is present inside the
small script element is displayed but we
also have these elements name and gender
we don't want these elements we want to
hide the rest of the content on the page
okay and the easiest way to do that is
by wrapping the rest of the HTML inside
you know some other root elements
something like maybe a development and
then apply a style class to that
development to hide you know that rest
of the HTML so let's include a div
element here and then inside this no
script element I'm also going to have a
style section type equals text slash CSS
and then here but let's create a class
let's name this root div class and then
we are going to have just one style here
display colon none and then let's apply
this style class to this development
plus equals root div class okay so if
javascript is disabled then this content
you know will be used so this root div
class will be used and here we are
saying display colon none so it will
hide all the HTML that's present inside
that development okay so let's save
these changes let's reload this page
look at that the HTML table disappears
and then we only have the error message
let's go ahead and enable JavaScript
back so let's go to the settings page
search for JavaScript and then click on
this content settings button allow all
sites to learn JavaScript
click done let's reload this page look
at that you know now just the HTML table
is shown and then the JavaScript
validation is working as expected let's
quickly test this in IE so let's fire up
internet explorer at the moment we
already have JavaScript enabled in IE so
let's navigate actually let's browse
this page with Internet Explorer let's
set that as the default let's run this
and look at that javascript validation
is working let's go ahead and disable
JavaScript click internet options and
under security click on custom level and
then scroll all the way to the bottom
and then you should see scripting and
then select the disable under active
scripting click yes click OK let's
reload the page look at that now we get
a message saying it seems that you have
to say well JavaScript please enable
JavaScript so this is working with both
the browser's IE and google chrome and
here's the code that we have just
discussed thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
