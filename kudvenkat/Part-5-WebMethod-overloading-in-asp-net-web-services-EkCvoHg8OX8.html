tutorial in this video we'll discuss
overloading web methods in asp.net web
services this is continuation 2 part 4
so please watch part 4 from the web
services tutorial before proceeding with
this video method overloading allows a
class to have multiple methods with the
same name but with the difference in
nature in c-sharp methods can be
overloaded based on the number type and
the kind of parameters we discuss the
basics of method overloading in part 25
of the C sharp tutorial series so if
you're new to method overloading please
watch part 25 web methods and web
service can also be overloaded and we
use message name property for that
purpose let's understand with an example
or we're loading web methods in a web
service let's flip to visual studio
there's the same calculator web service
that we have been working with in this
video series to keep things simple let's
get rid of this implementation within
the add method and let's only leave this
last line and let's also get rid of
these properties let's make a copy of
this add method now if you look at these
two add methods here they are identical
they have got the same name they've got
the same number type and kind of
parameters so now if we filled the web
service obviously we are going to get a
compliation error that's because if we
want to overload methods they have to
differ at least in the number type or
kind of parameters
so let's overload these add methods
within the web service based on the
number of parameters so this add method
here has got two parameters let's make
this add method to have three parameters
and let's call the third parameter third
and number and this method is going to
add three numbers so first add method is
going to add two numbers the second add
method is going to add three numbers so
here we are differing you know the
number of parameters between these two
methods so we are over
boring based on the number of parameters
now when we build this web service it
should build it successfully notice
within the status bar will succeeded now
let's view this web service in a browser
window look at this we get an error and
look at what the error says add method
which has got three integer parameters
and the add method which has got two
integer parameters use the same message
name add but if you look at the methods
here did we specify message name here
no we dint so if we don't specify
message name property of the web method
attribute then by default the name of
the method is going to be the message
name and then web services by using the
same message name for both of the
methods so the web service that is our
calculator web service doesn't know how
to uniquely identify these two methods
so there needs to be a different message
name so in order to overload web methods
in a web service we need to use message
in name or property of the web method
attribute so let's use message name and
let's specify the message name for the
side method as add two numbers so
basically this method is adding two
numbers so that's what we are specifying
the message name as so now let's view
the web service in the browser window
now look at this we get a totally
unrelated error and that's basically
because when we added this web service
to this project web services demo visual
studio ide has also generated this web
service binding attribute for us and by
default it's setting the busy profiles
to basic profile now let's change this
to none and now let's view the web
service in the browser that should fix
that error and now look at this we are
able to view both of the add methods
look at them both of them have
got the same name here but the message
name for this ad method is add two
numbers but for this ad method if you
look at the soap request Matt's message
look at that the name of the method is
ad and for the other add method within
the soap request message notice that the
name I mean the message name basically
is add two numbers so now the web
service has got a way to uniquely
identify these methods within the web
service okay so this is a very common
interview question as well is it
possible to overload web methods in a
web service the answer is yes and we
need to use message name property for
that so this message name property is
used to uniquely identify the individual
XML web service methods alright that's
it for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
