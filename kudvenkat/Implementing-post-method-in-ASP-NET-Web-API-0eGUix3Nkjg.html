tutorial in this video we'll discuss
implementing post method in asp.net web
api so let's flip to visual studio now
first let's comment this custom JSON
format a class that we have put in place
in our previous video I'm also going to
comment this one line of code that we
have in our register method to register
the custom JSON format now let's flip to
employees controller and include a post
method post method allows us to add a
new employee to our employees table at
the moment within the employees table we
have got seven rows so let's flip to
visual studio and include a method for
post it's going to be a public method
return type is going to be wired and the
name of the method is going to be post
now to add a new employee to the
employees table we will have to pass the
employee object so we are going to pass
the employee object as a parameter now
where is the employee object data going
to come from when a client makes a
request the request is going to have
request header URI
and request body the data for the
employee object is going to come from
request body and we tell that to web api
by decorating this employee parameter
with an attribute and that is from body
attribute so basically this attribute is
telling the data for the employee object
is going to come from the request body
and now let's go ahead and create an
instance of our employee DB entities
let's call this entities equals new
employee DB entities and these dot
employees dot add so to the collection
we want to add the employee object that
is coming into the post method as a
parameter and then on the entity is call
Save Changes let's save our changes and
give our solution a build build
succeeded now let's flip to fiddler and
issue a post request so first of all
let's change the HTTP verb to post we
want to post to this URI and remember we
have told the post method that the data
for the employee object is going to come
from request body by decorating it with
from body attribute so within the
request body right here we have to
include the data for the employee object
so here we have JSON formatted employee
objects so I'm going to copy that and
paste it within the request body so we
have got first-name lastname gender and
salary now this is jason formatted data
so we will have to tell that to the web
api that we will be sending jason
formatted data and we tell that by
including content type header so we are
going to set this to application for
slash jason let's execute this request
so the first completed now let's go to
sequence of the management studio and
reissue this select statement notice now
we have eight records including the new
one that we have just added now this
works fine but the problem here is that
if you inspect the response that we have
got look at the status code in the
response header to zero for no content
that's because the return type of the
post method is white so if the return
type of a method is wide by default web
api is going to return status code to
zero for no content according to the
standards of rest when we add a new item
we should actually be returning status
code to zero one item created and along
with the status code to zero one we
should also be returning the location
that is the URI of the newly created
item so let's see how to achieve this we
will be changing the implement
of this post method instead of returning
wired we are going to return HTTP
response message and then here let's
create a variable let's call this
message we are going to use the request
object and then this request object has
got create response method which is
going to return us HTTP response message
so what is the status code that we want
to return we want to return created item
created status code so the status code
that we want to return is created and we
also want to return the employee object
that we have just added to the database
so here is the employee object that we
added to the database so entity
framework is going to populate this
employee object with the ID so if you
look at what we have posted using
fiddler so let's go to the composer tab
so we only have provided values for
first-name lastname
gender and salary we haven't supplied
the value for ID column ID column is an
identity column so sequel server is
going to auto generate the ID column
value we don't have to supply that and
when this Save Changes method is called
entity framework is automatically going
to update this employee object with the
ID that is auto-generated so we are
going to also send the employee object
back to the client and then remember
along with status code 2:01 we also want
to include the location that is the URI
of the newly created item to do that
let's use the message object dot headers
dot location equals and if you look at
what this property expects it expects an
instance of URI so let's create a new
instance of URI and now here we want to
include the URL that is the location of
the newly created item
to do that we are going to make use of
the request object and it has got
request URI property which is going to
give us the URI to which we have posted
the newly created item and if you look
at the URI to which we have posted this
is the URI so request URI property is
going to give us this full URI but the
URI of the newly created item should
also include the ID of the employee
entity that we have just created so we
are going to append the ID of the
employee entity so to this request URI
lets get the ID of the employee and
append it now let's wrap all of this
code inside a try block and if there is
any problem executing this code in the
try block we want to catch the exception
and we want to return that exception to
the client so the client knows what has
gone wrong so here let's use the request
object again and this time we are going
to use create error response method
again this method notice it returns HTTP
response message and since there is a
problem we are going to issue an HTTP
status code of bad request and along
with that status code let's also return
the exception object so we want to
return the message so let's return the
message and let's return the error
response
all right so let's give our solution a
build build succeeded
now let's issue another post request
from fiddler so this time
here is another Jason format an employee
object so let's copy that and paste it
within the request body of fiddler let's
execute this now let's flip to sequel
server management studio and they shoot
the select statement just to make sure
we have that employee inserted into the
table notice the ID is nine for the
newly created employee so now let's go
to fiddler and if we inspect the
response that we have got notice within
the response header the status code now
is two zero one created and if we scroll
down a bit we have the location that is
the URI of the newly created item as
well so let's copy this header value and
let's flip to browser and I'm going to
paste the header value look at that that
is the URI of the newly created item
look at the ID that is appended at the
end it is the ID of the newly created
employee so when we navigate to that URI
we have the newly created entity as
expected now let's modify this get
method as well first let's understand
what happens when we request for an
employee whose ID does not exist so
let's flip to Phila
we want to issue a get request with get
request we don't need a request body so
let's get rid of that and let's request
an employee whose ID does not exist one
zero one does not exist so let's execute
this and see what we get so let's
inspect the response first of all look
at the response header 200 ok and if you
look at what we have caught back we have
caught back null because we don't have
the employee with the ID that we have
requested now this is a bit misleading
according to the standards of rest when
an item is not found we should actually
be returning status code four zero four
which stands for
not found let's see how to achieve this
let's flip to visual studio and modify
the implementation of the scape method
now instead of returning the employee
entity we actually want to return HTTP
response message and here let's create a
variable let's call it entity equals
whatever this line of code returns
now if entity is not equal to now that
means we have found the employee that we
are looking for so in that case we want
to return request dot create response so
we have found the employee that we are
looking for so the status code is going
to be okay and we want to return the
entity if the entity is null that means
the employee with the specified ID does
not exist so in this case we want to
return request dot create error response
because we haven't found the employee
that we are looking for so the status
code is going to be not found and we
also want to return a meaningful message
so the message is going to be employee
with ID equals whatever ID that we have
requested the ID is coming into this
method as a parameter so ID dot to
strain and to that let's append not
found
all right let's give our solution a
build build succeeded
now let's issue another request notice
now we get four zero four so the status
code in the response header is four zero
four not found and if we look at the
message that we got an employee with ID
equals one zero one not found which is a
bit more meaningful than returning
status code 200 okay
now if we request for an employee ID
that does exist we get status code 200
okay and that the employee entry that we
have requested here is the code for the
post method and here is the code for the
get method finally let's quickly recap
some of the important points that we
discussed if a method return type is
void by default status code to zero for
no content is returned when a new item
is created we should be returning status
code to zero one item created with two
zero one status code we should also
include the location that is the URI of
the newly created item when an item is
not found instead of returning null and
status code 200 okay return four zero
four not found status code along with a
meaningful error message such as
employee with ID equals one zero one not
found thank you for listening and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
