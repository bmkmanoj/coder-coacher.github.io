tutorial in this video we'll discuss
action selectors in MVC first of all
let's understand what an action is an
action is a public method inside a
controller these action methods respond
to any one request so if we want to have
this action method executed then we
issue a URL request like this here
localhost is the name of the server MVC
demo is the name of the project home is
the name of the controller and indexed
ending with the action method within
that controller so actions are public
methods within a controller that respond
to URL requests then what our action
selectors action selectors are
attributes that can be applied to these
action methods and we use action
selectors to control or influence which
action method gets invoked and action
name selector is one of the widely used
action selector so when do we use this
one this action selector is used when we
want to invoke an action method with a
different name than what is already
given to that specific action method
here the action method name is indexed
and we are able to invoke that using
index and then you know in the URL now
let's say for some reason I want to
invoke that using a different name like
list what happens if I try to navigate
to that URL we get an error stating the
resource cannot be found
that's because within the home
controller we don't have an action
method with that name but here our
intention was to execute this action
method using that URL so to achieve that
simply decorate this um index action
method with that action name selector so
what are these selectors they're
implemented as attributes so we simply
apply an attribute called action name on
this action method so here we are
specifying the name as list let's build
this and let's refresh this and see if
it's going to work look at that it works
now since we have decorated this one
with you know action named list we are
able to invoke that using slash list now
what's going to happen if I try to
navigate to index we get an error
once you decorate an action method with
an action name attribute then you will
have to use that name to reach that
action method all right now here the
function is simply returning a string
now let's say we are returning back an
action result and then we are returning
a view from this action method now what
should the view be named should it be
named index or list it should be named
list what happens if you name it index
you will get an error look at this let
us go ahead and add a view and let's
call it index let me add that okay now
let's save everything and let's build a
solution and then let's try to refresh
this and see what's going to happen
since we have used that action name
attribute it's going to look for a view
with that name okay we are still
navigating to the index action we want
to go back to the list so look at that
when we try to navigate to the list it
finds it this action method and then it
comes here okay it says return view so
it's going to go into the views folder
and look for a view with either list dot
aspx ASC X or let's see s HTML VB HTML
so it's going to search all these
locations you know with those extensions
so the basic idea is that the view
should have the same name as what you
have used in that action name attribute
okay now let's say for some reason I
still want to use that name index dot CS
index as the name of the view is it
possible can we make it work absolutely
one way you can make it work is by
passing the name of that view to this
view function because there is an
overloaded version where you can pass
the name of the view so let's pass that
index let's build it let's refresh this
and it should work now because it's
going to find list dot CS HTML within
the home folder so there we go now on
the other hand if you simply name it
list
then by convention MVC is going to look
you know a view with that name in the
home folder so there's no need for us to
specify the name of the view so let's
build us and let's refresh and it should
work as before okay look at that it
still works all right
so action name is one of the selectors
another selector is accept verbs
selector let's understand this with an
example
first of all let's get rid of this home
controller and the home folder within
views and I have this table TBL employee
here let's quickly add an ad or net
entity data model based on that table so
let's add a new item select ad or dotnet
entity data model and let's call it
sample data model and let's generate the
model from the database and let's give
it a name sample dbcontext for our
connection string click Next this is
going to connect to the database and
retrieve all the tables views in store
procedures let's expand tables let's
select table TBL employee and we want
our models to live in models namespace
click finish this should generate an
entity with name tape or TBL employee
but let's change it to employee
let's build everything and let's add a
controller and let's call it home
controller and let's use this template
and let's select employee as a model
class and the data context class is
going to be sample dbcontext
let's add this should add home
controller and all the views including
the Edit view and if we look at the home
controller they should be to edit action
methods to action methods with the same
name so we have edit action method here
and an edit action method here now let's
actually build the solution actually
before we do that let's go back to the
Edit view there is a section
call the scripts let's get rid of that
section let's save everything let's
actually build a solution and now let's
go back to the home controller so within
the home controller look at this I have
to edit actions
first of all let's navigate to the index
view so this should list all the
employees and then once I click on this
edit link look at the URL so we are
actually going to go to slash home slash
edit and then we need to pass the ID of
the employee that we want to edit so
when I try to navigate to this URL which
action method do you think you know gets
executed this action method or this
action method now look at this this
action method is decorated with HTTP
POST attribute but this one is not
decorated with any attribute okay so
this is again an action selector here
now
except verbs selector so this is nothing
but an except verb selector so we use
this selector when we want to control
the invocation of an action method based
on the request time okay now I want this
action method to respond to the get
request but notice that by default we
haven't decorated that with any
attribute so if you don't decorate an
action method with an accept verb the
default is cat so that action method is
going to respond to the get request so
when it when we issue this request it is
going to be a get request so which
action method gets responded this action
method okay look at that and what is
this action method doing simply you know
we are passing an employee ID of 1 so
that ID gets passed into this one it's
going to go to the database to retrieve
that employee and then it is passing
that employee to the view okay
so we are displaying that employee
details there now I can change this
employee details and then once I click
Save which action methods get executed
this one gets executed because this is
decorated with HTTP POST attribute when
I submit the form we are actually
posting the data to the server
okay so it's a post operation and since
we have decorated this action method at
HTTP POST this is going to respond to
that action look at this in spite of
having the same name edit edit here you
know this one responds to the get
request this one responds to the post
request okay because we have decorated
them with these accept verbs okay here
we are saying HTTP web start cat here we
are saying HTTP web start post now you
can either use this except verbs
attribute or simply use the shortcut
HTTP GET and HTTP POST but then in other
cases we are actually using accept verbs
selector and this is a very common
interview question as well what are the
different selectors or action selectors
that are available in MVC one is the
action name selector the other one is
accept verbs selector this slide you can
find resources for a speed ordinance
eShop and zequals so any questions
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
