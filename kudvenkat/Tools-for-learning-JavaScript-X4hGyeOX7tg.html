this video we'll discuss tools required
to learn JavaScript websites that help
write and test JavaScript and the
advantage of using visual studio to
learn JavaScript so what are the tools
required to learn JavaScript
all we actually need is a text editor
like notepad and a browser of your
choice you can use any browser you want
Chrome Internet Explorer Firefox Safari
etc here we've got some HTML and
JavaScript notice within the body
section we've got h1 element and
following that we have script element
all JavaScript must be present inside
the script element and notice along with
the script element we are also using the
type attribute basically this type
attribute is going to tell that the
script is JavaScript if the type
attribute is absent then by default the
script will be treated as JavaScript and
here we've got one line of JavaScript
code basically we're using the alert
function in JavaScript we will discuss
functions in detail in a later video
session all this alert function will do
is display that message welcome to
JavaScript tutorial in an alert box at
runtime and all strings must be present
inside course notice this string welcome
to JavaScript tutorial is present in
codes and then notice this statement is
terminated with a semicolon
it's not mandatory for a JavaScript
statement to terminate with semicolon
but it's a good practice to avoid
ambiguity I already have this HTML and
JavaScript copied in the clipboard so
let's open notepad and then paste that
there let's save this notepad so click
file save and let's give it this name
test and we have to save it either with
dot HTM or dot HTML and click Save let's
navigate to the folder where we saved it
so we saved it to this files folder and
look at the icon that is associated with
this file it's Google Chrome browser
icon the default browser on my machine
is Google Chrome and since this is a web
page look at this it is automatically
associated
Google Chrome now when I double-click on
this one it is going to be opened with
Google Chrome browser and then look at
this that h1 JavaScript training that's
displayed using the h1 tag and then look
at the alert welcome to JavaScript
tutorial now if you want to change
something for example hello welcome to
JavaScript tutorial make your changes in
the notepad save it and then come back
to the browser and then reload it look
at this hello welcome to JavaScript
tutorial so in reality all you need you
know to learn JavaScript is text editor
like notepad and any browser of your
choice now let's look at the websites
that can help write and test JavaScript
so this J's bin dot-com is one of the
useful websites I have found to write
and test JavaScript so if we navigate to
jsbin com so basically notice that at
the moment it is showing the HTML and
you know whatever is the output of HD of
this HTML is shown on the right hand
side now we want to write JavaScript
code so notice this menu item here a
javascript click on that it will open up
another window and you can start writing
your JavaScript for example let's say I
want to display an alert box I simply
type alert and then let's say we want to
display the string hello so you type
your JavaScript in this window and then
on the right you have this button run
the JSO click on that and notice that
the javascript is executed and displayed
and let's say for example we want to
have a textbox you know in the HTML so
let's use an input element type equals
text and let's say the value within this
text box is going to be régime dec and
let's give this textbox an ID let's call
it my
text box so what we want to do is we
want to write some JavaScript code here
which is going to retrieve that text
from that text box which is present in
the HTML and then display that within an
alert box so we are still going to use
the alert function but I want to use in
our document object look at this you
type it partially and then when you
press tab key look at this
it automatically completes as well so
this website also provides autocomplete
feature and then plus dot we want to use
get element by ID function so I type it
partially and then when I type the tab
key look at that it shows all the
functions that start with that name and
we want to use get element by ID
function and then to this function we
want to pass the ID of our textbox which
is my textbox and we want to retrieve
the value out of the textbox so let's
use value property and look at this when
we click this button run with j/s look
at that whatever is displayed in this
textbox is now being displayed using
this alert box so a very useful website
to write and test your JavaScript so
what's the advantage of using visual
studio to learn JavaScript or notepad
the main advantage is we shall studio
provide intelligence and autocomplete
features which can reduce typos and
increase developer productivity it also
provides rich debugging support that's
why visual studio is a much better tool
to learn JavaScript thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
