this video we'll discuss adding images
to slideshow using a database table
please watch part 1 37 before proceeding
in part 137 we discussed loading image
data from an XML file so this is the XML
file that we used in part 137 to store
image data notice that we are storing
the name of the image and the order in
which we want that image to be displayed
within the slideshow so now we want to
store this image data in a database
table so the first step is to obviously
create a table to store the name and the
order so here we are creating this table
TBL images and has got three columns ID
which is going to be the primary key of
the table and then name and order
columns okay so let's go ahead and
create this table and then this insert
script right here is going to insert a
data into TBL images table so the name
of the image and the order in which we
want that image to be displayed in the
slideshow so let's go ahead and execute
this insert script I'll have this sequel
script available on my blog in case you
idiot
and the next step is to basically create
a stood procedure to retrieve this image
data from the table TBL images let's go
ahead and create a procedure so create
procedure SP and let's call this get
image data as we need you know the name
and order columns so select name and
order now here order is a sequence of a
reserved keyword but we want to use it
as a column name so we have to wrap it
inside square brackets from TBL images
okay so this is going to be of stood
procedure let's execute that the stored
procedure is created now let's execute
the stored procedure itself and we get
the data okay so we have the image data
stored in the database table so we can
see if Li delete this image data that
XML so let's get rid of that XML file we
can get rid of the folder altogether as
well because we don't have any of the
files there
so I'm going to delete that away okay
the next step is to actually load that
image data from the table so obviously
we have to write bit of video dot net
code so if we have to communicate with
the sequel server we need a connection
string so let's go ahead and add
connection string to a web config file
and the connection string obviously we
need to specify the name of the server
you know what type of security you want
to use whether you want to use windows
authentication or s equals that we
username and password here I am using
windows authentication and the database
name is sample okay the name of the
connection string is TB CS
okay so let's add this connection string
to a web config file and to speed things
up I have this connection string already
type so let me copy that and add it to a
web config file so within the connection
string section I'm going to paste it
there alright so the next step is to
write the ad or net code and let's go
ahead and import the required ato dotnet
namespaces we already have system data
we need systems or data dot sequel
client and then system configuration
okay and all we need to do here is
change this set image URL function now
if you look at the set image URL
function at the moment we are reading
the image data from the XML file at the
moment we don't have an XML file there
instead we want to read image data from
the database table so let's go ahead and
write a do dotnet code let's get rid of
that line there and then first of all
let's create a signal connection object
to create a sequel connection object we
need a connection string so let's read
the connection string information from
web config file so we can use
configuration manager class so
configuration manager dot connection
strings of what is the name of our
connection string its DB CS so let's
copy that
so get the connection string of value
into this variable and then we are going
to pass this to the constructor of the
sequel connection class so using this
connection string create a sequel
connection object and the next step is
to create our sequel data adapter object
and then there is a constructor which
takes you know the command text the
Select command text and the connection
object so our select command is actually
a stored procedure so let's go ahead and
pass the name of the stored procedure so
we are going to use this overloaded
version which takes the Select command
text and the sequel connection object so
let's pass the name of the stored
procedure and we already have the
connection object okay so we have the
data adapter right now but then the
other important thing that we have to
tell to the sequel data adapter object
is that this is not you know an inline
sequel statement instead it is a stored
procedure so we have to tell that to the
data adapter object and to do that you
know it's a select command so data
adapter dot select command dot command
type okay so what's the command type
it's a stored procedure and then the hey
dot for data set object so this method
is going to open the connection execute
the stored procedure retrieve the data
and fill this data set with the data
okay so by this point we have data
within the data set and notice the name
of the table here it's TBL images but
then in the code here we are referring
to the table as image so let's give the
table name here so when we are filling
this data set with that data from TBL
images table within the data set I want
to refer that table as image table okay
all right with all these changes let's
go ahead and run this look at look at
this at the moment this application is
running using the XML file it has
stopped because we don't have the XML
file so let's actually run this now now
it has to load the image
data from the database table in a look
at that it's loading the data from the
database table six seven eight nine we
have two to nine images there okay now
if you want to add a tenth image to the
slideshow all you have to do is copy
that image into the images folder and
then add a row to the database table so
at the moment if you look at this table
there are nine rows at the moment so if
I want to add a tenth image the order
should be ten and then specify the name
of the image there and obviously you
need to have that image within this
images folder all right this slide you

that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
