this video well discuss how to create a
simple floating day of using jQuery here
is what we want to achieve we have a
page here with two sections this is the
main content section and this is the
side panel content section within this
side panel content section we have this
little text side panel content and a
development since we've got a lot of
text within the main content section to
read all of it we will have to scroll
down and notice what is going to happen
to this development as we scroll down
look at that development it is always
visible so this div is called exploding
there let's see how to create this
floating development using jQuery let's
flip to the presentation the first step
here is to design a page that looks like
this so we want a table with two TDs so
let's create a table element and this
table is going to have a single TR and
this is going to have two TDs so I'm
going to set the width of the first TD
which is going to be our main content
section and I'm going to have another TD
and this will be our side panel content
and the width of this TD is going to be
100 pixels 150 so this will be side
panel and this will be our main content
section alright and here within the side
panel TD let's also include to break
elements and then a div element so this
will be our floating div let's give it
an ID let's call this their floating
okay and I'm also going to set style
attribute so basically we want the
background color of this development to
be silver and we want the height to be
150 pixels and width to be 150 pixels
let's include this little text within
that floating div let's call this
floating there alright so let's save the
changes let's go ahead and reload our
HTML one page so we've got two TDs here
but we don't have a border so that's the
reason why we can't sit and also notice
the table is aligned on the Left we want
that to be aligned centered in the
vendor so what I'm going to do is set
first of all align attribute set that
Center and we want border so I'm going
to set border attribute and we want the
border s1 okay so let's go ahead and
reload this page now look at this we got
the border the table is aligned in the
center but we have a double border here
so let's go ahead and collapse that
border so to collapse that border I'm
going to use the style attribute and set
border collapse property to collapse
okay so let's reload this alright now we
want this content to be you know the
content both within the main content
section and the side panel content
section to be vertically aligned in the
top so what I'm going to do is in for
both of these TDs I'm going to set
vertical align property to top let's do
that for this TD as well alright okay so
let's save the changes let's go to and
reload this page and look at that so now
we have the content vertically aligned
on the top alright at the moment notice
we don't have a scroll bar because we
don't have enough content and in the
interest of time I have already type the
required content so let's copy that from
this notepad and paste it within this
main content TD save the changes reload
this page and look at this now we've got
the scroll bar and look at what's going
to happen to this development as we
scroll down notice that it becomes
visible it's not floating now right now
let's see how to keep this div element
floating so back in visual studio within
our jQuery ready function let's actually
minimize this TD so this is the main
content TD that contains all our main
content and within the second TD we have
our development we just call this ID
if floating so within our jQuery ready
function I'm going to create a variable
let's call this floating there and I'm
going to find this development by ID so
let's use the jQuery ID selector find
that development okay
I'm going to create another variable
let's call this floating div position
and I'm going to get that using the
position function so what is this
position function going to do it's
actually going to return an object and
that object is going to contain two
properties top and left the top property
is going to give us the divs top
position okay now when we scroll down we
want to execute some code right so first
we want to capture the scroll event so
dollar window dot scroll so when the
scroll event is raised we want to handle
that and execute some code which is
going to be part of this anonymous
function so when the scroll event is
phrased as we scroll scroll event is
raised and we are going to handle that
now what we want to do is we want to get
as we scroll we want to get the scroll
bar current vertical position okay so to
get the scroll bar current vertical
position let's actually create a
variable let's call this scroll bar
position so to get the scroll bar
current vertical position I'm going to
use scroll top function so vendor dot
scroll top so this is going to give us
the scroll bar current top vertical
position right now let's do a check if
scroll bar position if that is greater
than or equal to the floating div
position objects top property so what
does this mean this means if the scroll
bars
current vertical position is greater
than or equal to the developments top
position then we want to keep our
development floating right because
that's when it starts to become
invisible okay so to make the
development floating what I'm going to
do is set to CSS properties on this
development so this variable refers to
the development so let's use that
variable floating there I'm going to use
CSS function and set to properties so
I'm going to use adjacent object so the
first property I'm going to set is
position I'm going to set this to fixed
in a bit I'll explain what that means
and I'm also going to set top I'm going
to set that to 5 pixels okay else I'm
going to do the same thing but this time
the position is going to be relative and
top is going to be 0 pixels that's all
day to it so let's save the changes
let's reload our HTML page 1 and look at
this as we scroll down look at what is
going to happen look at that our
development is now floating so what's
happening so the thing that is keeping
it floating is this style property
position fixed and look at this this top
we have set it to 5 pixels now look at
this as we scroll down between the top
of the window and this development there
is 5 pixels gap right so what does it do
when we said position 2 fixed it is
actually creating a fixed position
element so what do we mean by a fixed
position element a fixed position
element is positioned relative to the
browser vendor so this development is
positioned relative to this browser
vendor
okay so when we set top two five pixels
look at that you know between the
browser windows top I mean between the
browser window and this div elements top
there is five pixels gap right now what
do you think is going to happen if I set
this to hundred so let's reload this
page and look at this as I scroll down
there is going to be 100 pixels in a
width or gap between the browser window
and the development and that will happen
when the scroll bar vertical position is
greater than or equal to the divs top
position look at that as we scroll down
look at what's going to happen there is
now 100 pixels cap now we can also set
left property so let's go to the set
left here again this left will be
relative to the browser window let me go
ahead and set left also 200 let's do the
same thing here and let set let's set
left to zero so let's save the changes
let's reload this page look at this as I
scroll down you know from the browser
window to this development between them
there will be 100 pixels gap and
similarly you know from the browser
window from you know on the left hand
side you know between this div and the
browser window there will be 100 pixels
gap look at this as I scroll down look
at that the development is right here so
here and here there is 100 pixels gap so
that's what happens when you set
position property to fixed and look at
what is going to happen now as we scroll
up it comes back to its position okay
where it belong so what's going on here
so it's coming back here because of the
code that we have in the else part so
what are we doing in the else part in
the else part you know we are setting
top and left and we are setting position
to relative so what does that do
it's actually creating here a relative
position element so what is meant by a
relative position element
a relative position element is
positioned relative to itself so the
stop and left is relative to the same
element you know where it's position so
look at this as we reload the page so
that's the position of that development
okay now in the else part we are saying
position is relative top is going to be
0 and left is going to be 0 means as we
scroll down and up look at this as we
scroll down it's going to go here
because we have set position to fixed
top 100 left 100 that's why it comes
here now as we scroll up when it
executes this piece of code it's going
to say position is relative since it's
relative to itself you know and we have
set top 2-0 left to 0 it's going to come
back to where it belongs
initially okay on the other hand let's
go ahead and do this let me actually set
top 2 maybe 50 and left to 50 okay so
now let's reload this page look at that
this is the original position of the
development now as I scroll down you
know what is going to happen now when
will this could be executed as long as
the scroll ball position is greater than
or equal to the top position of the
development so initially you know it
will come to this else part where we are
saying position is relative top to 50
and left to 50 so as we start to scroll
this development will be pushed you know
50 pixels from here okay and similarly
50 pixels from the top
you know from currently where the
development is to get this as I scroll
look at that there's 50 pixels from the
left and 50 pixels from the top okay and
in a look at this as it executes the
code that is present in the if part you
know there is 100 pixels on the top and
100 pixels on them on the left okay
so if you understand
what you know when we set position to
fix and when we set position to relative
what happens then this example is very
easy to understand and here is the HTML
and jQuery code that we have just
written thank you for listening and have
a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
