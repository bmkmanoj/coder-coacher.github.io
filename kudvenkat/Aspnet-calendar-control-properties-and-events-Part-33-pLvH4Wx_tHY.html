venket this is part 33 of asp.net video
series in this session we learn about
the asp.net calendar properties and
events before continuing with the
session I strongly recommend to watch
pi32 of this video series let's drag and
drop a calendar control onto the webform
now depending on the purpose that we use
this calendar for we can actually
associate a caption to the calendar and
the way we do that is by using the
caption property let's say for example
I'm using this calendar to display
training dates or something I can
associate a caption to that so training
calendar and then we can align this
caption using a caption align property
let's say I want to align that on the
top I can do that and so obviously as
you can see here the caption is shown
with its alignment and the next property
that you look at is the day header style
now this property has several style
properties that can be you know
customized to change the look and feel
of the day header now if you're
wondering what is they had ah you know
this Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday
etc that you can see here and how do we
change that go to the properties window
and then within the properties window
you can see day header style property
and you can change a lot of style
properties here for example the back
color let's say I want to change that to
red
I can select and change that to red and
for color maybe I want to change it to
white we can do that so all these
properties can be changed so that's day
header style and they name a format if
you look at this that they named you
know it's currently three letters Monday
Tuesday Wednesday so we can change that
as well and that the VAT is that it
takes our short first two letters or
first letter short as you know just by
looking at the values that this property
takes we can guess what it might be for
example if I just select first two
letters is going to show just the first
two letters on the other hand if you
just say first letter we only get the
first letter so that's day name format
property and if I say shortest again I
get the first two letters there
first day of the week again another
property which is interesting is the
first day of the week by default here
for this calendar the first day of the
week is Monday let's actually put that
to you know full so that if you put that
to fool you get the full name of the day
but instead of that let's change that to
short which give us the three letters
now look at that the first day of the
week by default is Monday you can change
that if you want to depending on your
shift timings or shift today's you know
to suit your needs for example let's say
the first day of my week is Wednesday I
can select that next previous format now
if you look at this next previous format
is set to custom text so meaning you
know we can set that custom text there
so next month text here we are using
ampersand a GT semicolon which stands
for you know greater than symbol or you
can you know let's say instead of that
one I want double you know greater than
symbols I get that there similarly I can
also change the prep month text in this
case instead of that I want two less
than symbols I can do that as well
instead of that you know this next
platform it actually takes other values
as well for example short month so that
will give us a three-letter month name
or I can say full month where it shows
the full month name similarly we can
select you know maybe they name format
if you said that too full then we'll get
full day and full month names there okay
so those are some of the useful
properties and the most useful property
is the selection mode depending on this
property you actually decide what
elements you want to select within the
calendar now let's set this to maybe
short and maybe short month okay
now the next property is the selection
mode by default the selection mode of
the calendar is day which means when we
actually run this project and when we
try to select it we can only select a
day within that calendar okay so I
cannot select a week or a month now is
it possible in the first place to select
an entire week absolutely and how do we
do that change the selection mode of the
calendar okay so if you look at the
selection mode of the calendar
it actually takes three values so
selection mode currently this day but it
can be David meaning you can select a
day or an entire week or day week month
where you can select a single day the
entire week or the end time and let's
say day week month and the moment I do
that look at that you know I can select
the week using this greater than symbol
I can select the entire month using this
double greater-than symbol now are these
customizable absolutely you can change
them as well
okay so select month text currently it's
like you know two greater than symbols
you can change that if you want to for
example I can say select month okay so
the complete word will be displayed
there
similarly select week text we can say
select week and that particular text
will be displayed there when you click
that it selects the entire week let's go
ahead and run this and see what actually
happens when we do that so when I say
select week look at that then pay we get
selected similarly I'm selecting this
week if I say select month all the days
from first to 30th of November are
selected okay
now an interesting point arises here now
if I have selected all the days within
that month then how do I select you know
or retrieve the selected dates or if I
select just this week so I want the
selected dates that the user has
selected on the server side so how do I
retrieve them in the previous session of
this video series we have seen you know
if you user selects a single date then
we use you know calendar one dot select
a date that property gives us the
selected date but if the user selects
the entire week then how do I select
those day
okay let's see that now obviously to
select that this calendar control
exposes an event called selection
changed event given over the selection
and the calendar changes so now let's
say if I want to retrieve the selected
date we can use you know the selected
date property of the calendar controls
calendar one dot selected a date let's
say dot two short date string so now if
we run this and when we select the date
within that calendar control the
selected date will be written to the
respond stream for example here I'm
selecting November 15 so that gets
written but on the other hand look at
this I'm trying to select this week here
now I am only getting the one date defer
in no 21st of November the first date
there but I want the you know the range
of dates from 21 to 27 all the dates
that I have selected and how do we do
that
to do that there is another property the
calendar control exposes called selected
dates property so this is going to
return a collection of selected date so
anytime we have a collection of
something we can use the for each loop
loop through each date and then do
whatever you want in this case we want
to print the data out so let's use a for
each loop here so for each so we know
that we are going to get back date time
let's say let's call that selected date
time in calendar one dot selected dates
and what do we want to do we want to
print each date that the user has
selected so let's say calendar one I
mean we get the selected date into this
variable so I'm going to use that and
then print that down to short date
string and then put an HTML break there
get rid of this one all right so now if
we run this if we select a single day
then we get that just that one date but
if I select a week I get the entire week
so I select number 15 let me select the
entire week I get all the dates within
that week from 21st November
to 27 November on the other hand if I
select the entire month I get all the
dates within that month okay so one of
the events we have just discussed is the
selection changed event other important
events that this calendar control
actually exposes are you know maybe Dave
lender event we have discussed about
this in the previous session of this
video series so when does this even get
fired this even gets fired
you know whenever the day in the
calendar control is rendered let's do
one thing let's actually get rid of this
calendar let's drag and drop another
calendar control here and then auto
format that so that it looks a little
better I'm selecting colorful there okay
so we have this calendar control here
now if I go to the properties of this
calendar control
let's select data and our event okay so
we have this when does this data and the
event gets fired every time the day
within that calendar control is rendered
that event is fired so if you look at
this we have seven rows and seven
columns okay seven into seven 49 times
for each day
this even gets fired okay now this is a
very rich event that can be used for a
variety of purposes
let's say for example you know what I
want to do basically is within this
month you know in the month of November
let's say all the even days are actually
booked you know let's say this calendar
is displaying a list of appointments
available but then all even days 2 4 6 8
these are actually closed for bookings
so I want to put a red cross there and
then I don't want that to be selectable
okay
is it possible to customize that in such
a way absolutely and the even that we
use for that purpose is the day render
event so let's see how to actually do
that okay so if and I want to do that
only for the dates within the current
month so if it is another month date I
don't want to do that so how do we check
if the date belongs to current month we
can use this date render eventargs
EEO object so if a dot day dot and we
can basically say
is other month so if this belongs to
other month then we know that property
returns true
so it should not belong to other month
and you dot day dot
so day will basically give us the
calendar day there you dot day dot date
and then we can say day which is nothing
but the integer if that divided by two
gives us zero that means that's an even
date so in that case what do we want to
do we want to set the back color of the
cell maybe to red
and maybe the full color you know
basically the font color to white and I
want to bold the text so e dots l dot
font dot bold is equal to true and we
want to put a red X X there so e dots L
dot text is equal to X and then we want
to show at tooltip there when I hover my
mouse over that cell it should show the
tooltip you know this is closed for
booking or just booked so a dot cell I
want to set the tooltips or tool tip is
equal to maybe I want to just show you a
message booked okay on the other hand if
it's any other date if it's an order
date then I want to show you know the
tooltip as the date is available for
booking
so let's display the text there
available okay that's all we have to do
now if we run this as you might expect
you know the date and the event will be
called for each day you know within that
and look at that all the even dates they
are you know the background color is red
and then the for the X color is white
and it when I move my mouse over here on
the cell look at the cell a tooltip it
says book on the other hand if I move it
here the tooltip says available so a lot
of customization can be done using this
day render event all right so the next
even that we will examine today of the
calendar control is the visible month
changed event as the name suggests you
know this event is fired when the is
visible month in the calendar changes so
let's actually double click that let's
say response dot right
month changed so now if we run this and
then click that button
I mean click this so that the month
changes no month change the event is
fired now let's do something you know
interesting about this you know let's
say for example when I change the month
here I am changing from November to
December and when I click this one I am
changing from December to January so as
soon as I do that I want to figure out
from which month to which month I have
changed is there a way to do that so I
want you to you know print a message
here saying month change it from January
to February or February to March
whatever so how do we do that how do we
get the current month name and the month
to which we have changed and that is
using this month changed event args II
object if you look at this e here the
month that changed even tags object it
has two properties new date and previous
date
okay now new date is the month that we
are going to display and previous date
is is the current month that we are in
okay so what we basically can do so new
date is going to return the new date and
then then from that date I can actually
get the month part of it
so month will give me an integer but
then what I want to do is I want to
display an English month name you know
from Jan to February of February to
March so for that purpose let's write a
simple function which takes in a month
number and then return the name of the
month as a string so I have already
written a simple method for that let's
copy that and paste it here so I'm going
to have this private method and if you
look at this method it's very simple and
straightforward all it's doing is it's
taking in an integer month number and
then it is switching on that integer if
that is one then it returns January
otherwise February March etc now what
I'm going to do here we know that this
month property of the new date is going
to return an integer so I'm going to
pass this to this method okay so let me
call this method get date
or get month name and to this method I
am passing in the month number okay so
this method will actually return us the
new month name so I'm going to call this
new month okay so and if you want the
current month or old month you do the
same thing but then you change the
argument that you're passing into this
method instead of passing in their new
date you will say current I'm in
previous state okay and all we have to
do at this time let's spawn start right
maybe month changed from we know what is
the old month so old month plus give a
space to and then maybe we can pass in
new month that's all we have to do and
this is a little helper method that's
you know taking in a month number and
then giving us a montenay okay so let's
run this now and as we change the month
it should actually display you know from
what month to what month we have changed
so currently we're on November 2012 when
I click this one change from November to
December similarly from December to
January okay so we have seen all the
three events that the calendar exposes
you know selection changed a render and
visible month change event on this slide
