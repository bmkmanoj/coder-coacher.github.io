venket this is part five of asp.net MVC
tutorial in this video we'll discuss
views in an MVC application please watch
but for before proceeding with this
video now let's say using our MVC web
application I want to display the list
of countries as you can see on the slide
here let's see how to achieve this let's
flip to visual studio so at the moment
if you look at this index action method
within the home controller class it's
actually returning a string now if you
look at the list of country names
they're nothing but lists of strings so
let's change the return type of this
function to list off string okay and
then to display the list of countries I
don't need these two parameters so let
me get rid of them and then since the
return type of this action method is
list of string let's actually return a
new list of string and then we actually
want to return a list of countries back
so let's hard code some countries here
in reality we may retrieve them by
interacting with a WCF service or by
retrieving them from a database table
etc okay
but for now you know to understand views
let's actually hard code the names of
countries within this ah you know new
list of string object so let's say for
example I want to return India as one of
the country and then US UK and Canada
alright so now let's go ahead and run
this and one more thing we don't need
this get details action method so let's
get rid of that and let's go ahead and
run this application and see what's
going to happen what do we expect we
expect the list of countries to be
displayed like this on the form once it
renders but let's see what's going to
happen look at this instead of rendering
the list of countries it actually is
printing the name of the type okay so if
you look at what is the return type of
this function its list of string but
look at the intellisense
list of string class it's actually
present in system dot collections to
generate namespace and that's what is
printed on this form right here okay so
to correct this error
I mean to correct this week it's not an
arrow but it's actually an incorrectly
printing the type name instead of
looping through each country and then
printing those country names okay so to
fix this we can actually add a view so
what are views in Model View controller
the purpose of a view is to render the
data you know is to format the data in
the baby want and present it to the end
user so we give view some data and then
in the view itself we specify how we
want to format it do you want to bold it
underline it or you want to present it
using a table using an unordered list or
a bulleted list etc you know that's what
is the job of the view to format the
data and then present it to the end-user
so we give we are going to give this
data you know the list of strings to a
view and that view is going to determine
how to format that and how to present it
to the end-user okay so we want to
return a view from this a controller
action method and to return a view first
we need to add a view to this project
and to do that right click anywhere on
this function and then select add view
and look at the add view dialog box look
at the name of the view its index okay
the name of the view is matching the
name of the controller action method
here and then we're going to make use of
razor view engine so let's select razor
as the view engine and then leave the
rest of the defaults will discuss
strongly-typed views in the later video
session in a very great detail okay but
actually before I click Add let me
cancel out of this and let's look at
solution Explorer you know look at this
views folder at the moment it doesn't
have any other files and folders except
for web config file we'll discuss the
purpose of this web config file in the
later video session now let me go ahead
and add a view so ad view I'm going to
you know leave the defaults there and
click Add so this should add a view with
name index dot C sh t ml toward solution
I'm into a project let's see where it
has added look at this within the views
folder I've got another folder here home
and within that home folder index dot
CSS HTML is present so why did this add
this home folder because if you look at
the name of
Ola its home controller and this home
controller can have several action
methods okay so all the views that are
related to this home controller will now
reside within this home folder of this
fuse folder okay
alright so for our index action method
within the home controller to be able to
return a view there are some changes
that we need to do first we need to
change the return type of this function
so since we want this controller action
method to return a view I'm going to
change the return type of this function
to action result and then ultimately
what we want to do from this function I
want to return a view so I'm going to
say return view okay so which view is
this function going to return since here
look at the name of the controller
action method its index and where is
this index action method present within
home controller
okay so nvz uses some conventions by
default so because of those conventions
what it's going to do it's actually
going to look within the views folder
for views and then the name of the
controller is home so it's going to find
for home controller and then within the
home controller checks okay is there a
view with named index dot CS HTML if
it's present there it's going to pull
that out from there and then render that
okay all right so that's what this
return view is going to return it's
going to return this view and then look
at what we want to do with that view we
actually want to display the list of
countries like this okay so where do we
store this list of countries so
obviously from this controller action
method we need to pass these list of
countries to this view okay so how do I
pass data from a controller to a view
okay there are several ways we can do it
we can either use something called view
data view bag or we can use view models
in this video we'll see how to use view
data okay so instead of returning this
list back because I cannot do that now
because the return type of this function
is action result which is
to return a view there okay now you may
be wondering okay this view if I hover
my mouse over here look at what's the
return type of view it's actually view
result but the return type of this
controller action method is action
result so how am i able to return a view
result when the return type is action
result that's because if I right click
on this view go to definition so it's
whew result but then when I right click
on view result go to definition it
inherits from view result based and I
right-click on that and go to definition
look at that ultimately a view inherits
from action result okay so that's the
reason why I'm able to return a view in
spite of this return type being action
result okay now why is this there why
are we using a super type why can't I
just say you know view result that's the
return type we can do but remember a
controller action method can do more
than just returning a view it can return
to another controller controller action
method or it can return adjacent result
it can do you know several things we'll
talk more about that in a later video
session okay but for now if you ask me
can't I make the return type of this
function view result absolutely you can
do that as well so if I make this view
result for example it's still going to
work why because I'm just returning a
view and a view is going to return a
view result back they match so no
problem all right but then before we
return a view you know as as from this
controller action method we need to
store this list of countries somewhere
so that the view can pull them out and
then print them so where am I going to
store them I'm going to use something
called a view bag object for this so
there's something called view bag so I'm
going to make use of that object and
then here look at this I can use some
dynamic properties on this I can give if
I'm in any meaningful name for example
these a list of countries so I'm going
to use a property on this dynamic
property countries and in to that I'm
going to store this new list of
strengths okay
so this property is dynamic property you
can use country
is or you can give it any meaningful
name that that makes more sense okay so
what are we doing in this controller
action method we are storing this list
of countries within this property of
this view web object and then we are
returning a view and which view is this
going to return this is going to return
this index dot CS HTML so within this
view now what we need to do we need to
retrieve those countries out of that
view bag object and then display them to
the user using an unordered list okay so
let's change the code in index dot CS
HTML first of all you know we want to
have the title as countries list so
let's change that to countries list and
then let's have the same title for the
page okay now if I want to print an
unordered list like this we use n HTML
unordered list so I'm going to make use
of unordered list and then each country
should be displayed as a bullet item so
within an unordered list we will have a
list item right so now what we need to
do we need to loop through so we need to
loop through each country but where are
these countries stored there are they're
stored in this country's dynamic
property of this view bag object so
retrieve those countries so what I'm
going to do here is for each look at
that now I have some HTML here but I
also need to write some c-sharp code so
how do I switch between c-sharp and HTML
I use the symbol add-in razor okay so
now when I type for H look at that I get
intelligence as well for each string STR
let's call this variable country in
whether our list of countries present
its present in view bag object and what
is the property that we have used to
store those countries its country's
property so let's copy the property and
what we want to do so for each country
we are looping through and then
basically
we want to display this country inside a
list item so I'm going to put it there
that's said let's go ahead and run this
and see what's the output that we get so
what do we expect we expect the list of
countries to be displayed using an
unordered list like this and let's see
what's going to happen so it's still
rendering look at that instead of
printing the name of the country it's
actually printing the name of the
variable and that's understandable
because you know razer thinks that okay
this is HTML we started HTML and it
thinks this word is something that the
end user want to print just like that
but no it's actually a variable which
which is this one which contains the
name of a country so - to convey our
intention that it's a variable all you
need to do is specify the @ symbol there
so now it's going to treat that as a
variable and whatever value that's
present in that variable is going to be
retrieved and then printed in between
that opening and closing tag of list
item and we have the output as expected
all right so what did we do we added
this controller action method and now we
are storing the list of countries in
that countries property of the viewbag
object and then we are returning a view
which is going to return this index dot
CS HTML view and within that view what
have you doing we are looping through
each country and then printing them so
we are using razor views here alright
and that's what is the pictures doing
here look at that this is the action
method that gets invoked and this
returns this view this view pull state
out of this countries you know view bag
object and then prints them and this is
the output so view bag and view data for
the moment you know we are going to
discuss more you know about these in our
next video session for now understand
both of them as a mechanism to pass data
from a controller to a view but remember
to pass data from a controller to a view
it's always a good practice to use
strongly type view models will discuss
more about view models in a later video
session now we use at symbol to switch
between you know c-sharp code and H
EML alright on this slide you can find
resources for asp.net c-sharp and
sequence of interview questions that's
it for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
