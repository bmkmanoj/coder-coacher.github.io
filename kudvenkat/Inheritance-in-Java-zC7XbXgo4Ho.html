learn about inheritance in Java let's
understand with of your voice scenarios
you might have observed that all living
beings inherit the characteristics and
behaviors of their parents be dogs human
beings cats hens etc you will observe
that their offsprings look and behave
like their parents right in the loop in
the behavior in the be in the experience
they are similar to their parents and
then even though all these offsprings
are similar to their parents they are
unique in their own sense that means
some human beings would be having
special behavior like people could be
single or someone could be orator they
can be vegetarians or non vegetarians
etc also at the same time when you ask
similar people to do same thing they
might end up doing the same thing our
choise in a different way
one example could be when I ask someone
to sing a song a girl would sing a
melodious song or a guy would cook up
some job right now this is some
real-world experience that the observe
inwardly to the world so when we see
that the offsprings are similar to their
parents and they derive some
characteristics and behavior from their
parents you should smell the
understanding of inheritance from this
and similarly when you observe that
there might the same kind of people or
multiple kind of people who expose or
display some kind of behavior then you
should understand that there is some
concept of interfaces right a programmer
and a manager the booth might be some
employees but
they may not have something which is
similar to both of them for example the
programmer might be a singer but his
managers won't be single in this way a
programmer is an employee but still he
turn he does something which is unique
to him and there in order to model these
kind of scenarios we have construct of
interfaces and then polymorphism is
another important concept which tells
that you can have same name but multiple
forms which means that I can ask someone
to sync and you I will observe that even
those things they was asked for
different people might behave in a
different way in this tutorial we are
going to learn in detail about
inheritance interfaces and polymorphism
this is a series of three tutorials
which will cover all this conception
detail in this part we are going to
focus specifically on inheritance
what does inheritance mean in Java in
Java you will say scenarios when you
have multiple classes which have lot of
things in common let's take an example
you can have a programmer class which
has a name and address phone number and
that programmer might know some
programming languages similarly there
can be our managers who also has a name
and address phone numbers but he also
has some specific properties like team
size and booth programmer and manager
work when you ask programmer to work
he might code when you ask manager to
work he might manage a team let's create
classes and see this so that they had a
better understanding I have already
cooked up some classes let's have
of programmer class so this is our
programmer class where we have these
like name address phone number and an
array of programming languages then we
have a constructor and then we have a
single method work in which the
programmer is supposed to say I have a
programmer and I code note that whenever
you create an instance of programmer
class let's say and creating an instance
of programmer class program of p1 is
equal to new programmer let's of the
name of the programmer is Peter his
address address 1 and its mobile number
is 4 1 and let's say he knows he knows
only job as a programming language as of
now right so this is how we create an
instance of programmer and when I say
programmer p1 to work let's see what he
does he will print that I am a
programmer and I code right now let's
create similarly another class manager
which has feels like name address phone
number but he will also have a specific
field which steams list and when you ask
manager to work he does something
similar so let's say I create another
instance of manager
let's say managers m1 is equal to new
manager mike is the manager of Peter he
lives in a different address he has a
different phone number and he doesn't
know any programming language but he
manages a team of four and I can say
managers also to work and when we
rosters he will observe that we see two
output one from a programmer instance
and another from manager instance right
but you will observe that these two
classes have something in common right
this understand this that both this
programmer and managers classes has some
common properties like name address
phone number they have some specific
properties also not to lose the context
like programming languages is specific
to a programmer but team size is very
specific to a manager both have a method
called
work the signature of the method is
exactly same but implementation is
different one of the guy writes code and
another manages the team so what we can
do is we can extract out the common
things into a base class like name
address phone number and work method can
be you know extracted out to two base
class and then we can use the concept of
inheritance in Java and we can have
programmer and manager class exchange
the employee let's do this and
understand it so I am going to remove
these two classes programmer and
managers here from my code base and then
I am going to define first of all a
common class which is employed class
first of all and then manage the classes
and programmer classes so let's say I
have this code ready I will just show it
to you what we can do here is I have
first of all an employee class just look
here in employ class I have needs
address phone number and a constructor
and then I have a con method work since
the boy doesn't know what he is going to
work upon he just have a default
implementation saying that I am an
employer I do something now cause the
inheritance concept
I have a class programmer which is
extending the employee days class and in
this way the programmer class becomes
the child class of employee here
employee class is known as base class or
superclass or parent class and the
programmer class is known as child class
all these all are derived class right
now we have programmer specific
properties here and then we have B
constructor of programmers clubs we will
observe that here I am calling super
with three parameters what is this name
super is a keyword in Java which allows
you to refer to the base class note that
in our previous slide we observe that a
base class essentially has some methods
and variables and all the non provides
of non private variables and methods get
inherited by the default or by the
derived class and you can think that a
base class is embedded inside an
instance of a tonight class you can
refer to this base class instance using
the super keyword right and the derived
class attributes and the methods can be
referred to using the disc keyword right
so here and using the super keyword to
essentially call this employ constructor
which has three parameters name address
and phone number so here is my program
the class I take the three parameters
name address phone number I call the
superclass constructor or the base class
constructor and then the fourth one is
in this class itself and then I have a
method whose signature is exactly same
as that was created in the base class
this one and I am just trying to
override it
but overwrite I mean that I am providing
the specific implementation right now
understand that if I come in tout this
screen if I remove this thing and if I
compile this code you will observe that
when I create an instance of programmer
class and I call p1 Network all the
programmer doesn't have any worse method
defined the output will be that I am an
employee I do something this means that
a programmer instance has an access or
visibility to all these public
properties and methods of the base class
if you provide a specific implementation
and you are overriding it it means that
you are essentially providing a specific
implementation so now you can see the
first line is I am a programmer and I
code same base manager also is another
build another derived class out of
employ base class
it has team size as specific properties
right this is how we implement
inheritance in Java you might wonder
what are the benefits of inheritance one
of the most prominent benefit of
inheritances that you are able to keep
the common code in the base class in
this way you are following a principle
known as dry do not repeat yourself you
are not repeating the single properties
of the definitions and common methods
everywhere you are trying to abstract
them out into a base class such code is
easy to maintain and it provides
extensibility you can add new
implementation out of these class any
number of times also keeping specialized
behavior in derived classes useful for
maintaining 3d point of view as a side
note remember that all
Francis inherits from Java dot line dot
object either implicitly or explicitly
note that if I want that the base class
employs should not define any default
implementation the work method should be
provided by child classes and I want to
force this behavior what I can do is I
can make this method extract now such a
method which does not have any body and
has an abstract keyword in its signature
is known as an abstract method and fit
which whichever class has an abstract
method that class also has to be an
abstract class right whichever class has
an abstract method that class has to be
in the S that of that class also has to
be in a shirt class now let's see what
what this error is actually meaning here
your abstract keyword has to be before
the class keyword so you can define here
in this way abstract class employee and
then this class becomes an abstract
class because it has an abstract method
work now whenever child classes extend
the base class they have to provide an
implementation of this method if you
don't provide this implementation you
will see an error saying that the type
programmer must implement the inherited
abstract class methods right
and in this way I have created a base
class which is abstract class and two
child services which actually implement
the abstract class methods so derived
class can either overwrite the base
methods or they can hide the
implementation abstract method is a
method which has no body and is having
abstract keyword abstract classes or the
classes which have some Astrid method
in them and a base class can be either
abstract class as we saw or it cannot be
concrete class which means the knowledge
that class and here one thing is very
very important which is
interrelationship in the examples in
which we saw just now your programmer is
an employ and use manager is also an
employee and why this is a relationship
is important which means that I can
create an instance of a programmer class
but since your programmer is also an
employee you can use employing reference
here right you now your programmer is
also an employee our difference of site
base class can point to a child class
implementation similarly I can write
employ and one is equal to manager and
when I run this code you will see the
similar output so as stretch class
forces all the derived classes to add
their own implementation for all the
track methods you know next tutorial we
are going to learn about interfaces in
this tutorial I hope you are clear with
the analogy of inheritance in real world
we have seen in irritants and examples
and we also had a glimpse of water and
share these classes and wherever you
have abstract these classes how to
charge classes actually implement or
provide the definition of abstract
methods in them I hope you enjoyed this
tutorial if you write these tutorials
