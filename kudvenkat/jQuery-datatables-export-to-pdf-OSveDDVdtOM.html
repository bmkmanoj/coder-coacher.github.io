this video we'll discuss how to export
jQuery data tables data to excel CSV or
PDF how to copy the data to the
clipboard and finally how to see the
print preview of the data so here is
what we want to do we want to include
all these buttons on the web page when I
click on save to excel button we want to
save all this data to an excel file when
we click on PDF button we want to export
to PDF when I click on the copy button
we want to copy all this data to the
clipboard and when we click the print
button we want to see the print preview
of this data in the Print Preview it
doesn't make sense to include all these
buttons the search text box the paging
navigation bar this status text on the
Left which says showing 1 to 10 of 21
entries and this text show 10 entries on
the Print Preview or on the print itself
we just want the data along with its
header and footer to achieve all this we
will use table tools plugin for jQuery
data tables to get the table tools
plug-in visit this URL right here
I'll have this link available on my blog
on this page when you scroll down you
can see the CDN links for table tools
CSS and JavaScript files I've already
included these links on the web page so
on the web page right here within the
head section notice that we have a
reference to the core jQuery file itself
we have a reference to the data tables
javascript file and table tools
javascript file in addition to these
script files we also have references to
two CSS files the data tables CSS and
table tools CSS and within our script
section we have the ready function wired
up within the body section I have a
table element with ID data table and has
got D head and T food sections within
the T head section we've got five th
elements ID city country and continent I
mean basically four we have the same
elements within the D food section and
then within the T body section we have
got some hard coded data there are 21
rows at the moment so if we view this
page in the browser this
how the data is rendered at the moment
the data is not displayed using jQuery
data tables plugin let's display that
using jQuery data tables plug-in to do
that within our jQuery ready function
I'm going to use the jQuery ID selector
find the data table and on that I am
going to call data tables function let's
save our changes reload the page and now
the data should be displayed using
jQuery data tables plug-in let us store
the data table instance in a variable
and I'm going to call that variable
table and I'm going to create another
variable and I'm going to call that
table tools equals new dollar dot F n
dot data table dot table tools and to
this table tools function I'm going to
pass our data table instance that we
have cached in this variable okay and
then let's use the table tools variable
so table tools dot I'm going to use FN
contain a function so what is this F in
container function going to do now if
you look at these buttons you know all
these buttons are present in a container
that this function is going to return ok
so what do we want to do with that
container we want those buttons to
appear just before this entire data
table right and to do that I'm going to
use insert before function and I want to
insert that container of buttons just
before an element with ID and the ID
that I am going to use is data table so
that's the idea of our HTML table
underscore wrapper now what is this data
table underscore wrapper will understand
that in just a bit for now let us save
our changes reload this webpage and look
at what is going to happen notice that
we get those magic
copy CSV Excel PDF print okay now at the
moment look at that when I click the
buttons we don't have the functionality
we'll discuss that in just a bit but
let's now understand what is this hash
datatable wrapper now on this webpage if
you launch developer tools by pressing
f12 and then click on this magnifying
glass and look at this at the moment the
entire data table is selected and if you
look at where you know the data table
it's present it's actually you know all
the content of the data table is
strapped inside the development with ID
data table underscore wrapper so Jake we
injected that development so now what we
are doing in our jQuery code is we are
saying the container that contains our
buttons we want to insert that before
that development with that ID so that's
how we get those buttons just before
that data table okay so we got those
buttons but there is no functionality we
are not able to copy or export data and
that's basically because the table tools
plugin rely on flash swf file to perform
those actions and to get those that
flash swf file visit this URL right here
okay and again I'll have this link
available on my blog and on this page
when you scroll all the way to the down
you can find that Flash SWF file that
tables tools plugin require and if you
look at that SWF file we have got two
variations of that one has this word PDF
in it and the other one does not and the
difference between these two files is
that if you want to be able to export a
PDF then this file has that capability
the other one does not have the
capability and the other difference is
in size so the one that has the
capability to export to PDF have is
significantly large in size it's around
56 kilobytes whereas the one without PDF
capability is two kilobytes so in your
application if you really need to export
data to PDF only then use this version
of the SDF SWF file so in our
application we want to be able to export
it to PDF as well so I'm going to copy
that URL
and here I'm going to specify the
options for table tools plug-in and I do
that using a JavaScript object and we
have to specify s SWF path and the value
is going to be the CDN length that we
have just copied that's the part for the
SWF file that the table tools plug-in
require now s in front of this SWF at
the path specifies that it takes a
string value so let's save our changes
let's reload our web page and look at
this when I click on copy button it says
copy 21 rows to the clipboard when we
open a notepad and when we press control
V look at that we get the data from the
clipboard onto the notepad all right
and when I click on print look at that I
am on print preview we don't have that
search text box we don't have the paging
navigation bar and other data table
elements we just have the header footer
and the data of the data table at the
moment it's showing all the 21 rows
right so when I press escape I go back
to the original page the Print Preview
is closed we are back on the original
page now let's say for some reason when
you click on this print button you don't
want all the rows of the data table
instead you want just the rows on the
first page okay so how do we achieve
that
we look at that in just a bit but before
that let's say we want only copy and
print buttons we don't want other
functionality on the page so how do I
customize that so I want only those two
buttons copy and print to do that use
the other option of data tables I mean
table tools plug-in and that is a
buttons so here we specify what buttons
we want and a before the name of the
option specifies that it takes an array
value and here what we want is copy and
print functionality so let's say where
were changes
reload this page and look at that we
only have copy and print functionality
now when we click print we get all the
rows and that's not what we want we want
just the rows on the first page so to
achieve that I am going to use a
JavaScript object for print and I'm
going to say so I'm using this option s
extends so I want to extend print button
okay and how do I want to extend it I
don't want to show all the rows of the
data table on the print preview I just
want the rows on the first page for that
I am going to use boolean show all and
I'm going to set that to false by
default it is true so it's showing all
the rules of the data table on the print
preview so with this change let's reload
our page and look at this when I click
on print preview now it's only
displaying the rows on the first page
which is 10 rows okay and when we press
escape we are back on the original page
now let's say we want CSV and Excel as
well if that is the case along with copy
and print
I want CS way and XLS so let's say what
changes reload this page and notice that
we get CSV and XLS well now when I click
on CS way look at that it gives me dot
csv extension and then we plus data
click save' and when we go to that
folder downloads look at that data dot
csv and the data is exported to that
file similarly when I click on Excel
look at that it again uses dot csv
extension now I don't want dot csv
extension for excel i want to use dot
XLS extension now if you want to do that
again you will have to customize that or
extend XLS option and do that we are
going to use javascript object just like
how we have done it for print
and I'm going to specify that we want to
extend XLS and I'm going to specify s
filename option and I'm going to use
here star dot XLS okay
so let's save those changes and reload
this page and now look at this when I
click on Excel now we get dot XLS
extension now let's say you know we want
to give a default name to the file for
example I want it as data or XLS so you
can specify it like that data dot XLS
save the changes reload this page and
look at this when I click on Excel it
gives the name as data dot XLS and when
I click on save within that folder we
have data dot XLS the extension now is
dot XLS now if you look at the default
text it's a CSV Excel let's say for some
reason I want to change the text on the
button as well something like save to
Excel if that's the case then you can
use the other option s button text and
I'm going to set that to save to Excel
let's reload our page and look at that
it says save to excel and we still have
the same functionality all right let's
say we want you know the PDF
functionality as well and to get that
I'm going to use PDF let's save our
changes reload this page and look at
that we get the PDF option when I click
on PDF and let's say this is data and if
we go to the download file we have the
PDF file let's go and open that so all
the data now is exported to PDF so we
have the header add the data and we
the footer as well now let's say for
some reason you don't want footer when
you export to PDF if that's the case you
can extend this PDF and again the way we
do it is by using a JavaScript object
and specify the options so we want to
extend PDF and boolean futa I don't want
to include that within the exported data
by default it is true I am going to set
that to false if you don't want to
include the header as well you can set B
header to false but now let's say we
just know on the footer so I'm going to
save those changes reload our page and
let's click on this PDF option
so PDF and let's say new data let's
click Save and when we go here new data
PDF and when we scroll down we should
not have the footer all right
so table tools plugin CSS and JavaScript
CD and links can be found on this URL
and in addition to that CSS and
JavaScript we know that we also need the
table tools Flash SWF file you can grab
that from this URL right here and the
table tools button options documentation
that is you know this s extends s file
name as button text or all these options
that you can use with these buttons you
know you can find the detailed
documentation on this URL I'll have all
these links available on my blog so what
are the JavaScript reference is required
on the page you want the jQuery itself
data tables and table tools and the CSS
for the data tables and table tools and
here is the jQuery code that we just
looked at in action thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
