questions and answers video series in
this video we'll discuss how to reverse
each word in a string using c-sharp this
is a common interview question let me
explain what I mean we have our input
string here so this input string at the
moment contains five words one two three
four five and what we want to do is
reverse each of the characters in each
of these words in this train so we want
one to be reversed to ëno similarly two
will be owt
similarly three four five let's see how
to achieve this using c-sharp let's flip
to visual studio here we have our input
string one two three four five the first
thing that I'm going to do here is take
the input string and on that I'm going
to call the split function and it
expects this separator
what is the split function going to do
it's going to split the single strain
into a string array now if we want to
split a string into a string array then
we will have to specify what is the
separator based on which you want to
split the string the separator is going
to be this single space character that
we have between every word okay so I'm
going to specify the single space as the
separator so look at this intellisense
split function is returning a string
array so now we will have a string array
that contains these five words and on
that I'm going to call this link
function select and specify a lambda
expression X such that and I'm going to
use a new string constructor now what
does this X represent it represents each
string that we have in the string array
that the split function is returning
okay so for example now if we have one
you know within this X what do we want
to do with that string we want to
reverse the characters in that string
right to do that I'm going to use that X
which represents each string that we
have in the string array that this split
function is returning and on that I'm
going to call the reverse function and
if you look at the intelligence of this
reverse function look at what is reverse
function giving us back it's giving us
an i enumerable
of character that means a collection of
characters
okay now this reverse function will
reverse the characters and it's
returning that string as a collection of
characters if you look at this string
constructor you know it expects a
character a so if we give it a character
array then based on that character array
this constructor can construct a string
now I'm going to convert this I
enumerable of character to a character
array simply by using two array function
okay so this will return a character
array to the string constructor and the
string constructor is constructing a
string from that now this is going to
operate this lambda expression will be
applied for all strings that we have in
this string array that this split
function is returning so at the moment
with this Select function what we have
is a string array that contains you know
all these five words but the characters
in them are all reversed because of this
reverse function call here okay so now
look at this Select function what it is
returning it is returning an ienumerable
of string that means a collection of
strings we have these five words in that
collection now what we want in the
result is a single string back now to
get that single string we want to join
all the strings that we have in this
ienumerable of string okay
so to join those strings back together I
am going to use join function of the
string object so string dot join so how
do you want to join all those sub
strings you want to join them so if you
look at the result how do we want to
join them we want to join them using a
single space so I'm going to use this
separator as a single space and we have
to specify our string array here and
that string that is nothing but whatever
we have right here so I'm going to cut
that and specify it right there and and
the semicolon so what is this join
returning us back look at that it's
returning us a single string
back let's store that in a variable
string let's call it result string
equals that just to make this a little
readable I'm going to and I'll bring the
split function to the next line and
similarly the Select function all right
now let's print that to the console so
console dot write line and let's pass
our result string so now we should have
each character in each of the words to
be reversed notice that the output is
what we expected thank you for listening
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
