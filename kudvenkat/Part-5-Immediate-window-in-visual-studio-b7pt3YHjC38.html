in this video we'll discuss immediate
window in Visual Studio immediate window
is very helpful during debugging to
evaluate expressions execute statements
and print variable values there are
several ways to get to immediate window
in Visual Studio one way is by using the
command vendor we discussed command
window in detail in part 4 of this video
series so to get a command window in
Visual Studio we click view other
windows and then command window or we
can use the keyboard shortcut ctrl W a
once we are within the command window
type the command IMM edie for immediate
window and then press ENTER notice that
we are now with an immediate vendor now
to get back to the command window type
the angular bracket and then the command
CMD now once we press ENTER notice that
we are back in the command window the
other way to get to immediate window is
by using the visual studio menu so from
the debug menu select Windows and then
immediate window or use the keyboard
shortcut control di now the visual
studio commands that we can execute in
command window are also supported with
an immediate vendor but you should use
angular bracket now look at this to get
to command window from the immediate
window we type this command CMD okay now
if I don't use the angular bracket and
then simply type the command like this
CMD and then + Enter
look at that we get an error the name
CMD does not exist in the current
context but if we use the angular
bracket and then press Enter look at
that we get back to the you know command
window the command gets executed
successfully now if you want to cycle
between the commands that you have typed
within the immediate window you can use
up and down arrow keys alright
now for example to get to the open file
dialog box from command vendor we type
the command o F and then press Enter Oh
F is the alias for open file dialog okay
so that commands get executed and then
it opens up this open file dialog box
now if we want to execute that command
from the immediate window then we have
to type the angular bracket first and
then type o F and then that opens up the
open file dialog so if you want to use
any of the visual studio commands you
know then you use the angular bracket
immediate window also suppose the
execution of the function at design-time
let's understand what you mean by the
statement with an example now we have a
simple console application here and if
you look at this application we've got
this print sum function okay and this
print sum function all it does is it has
got three parameters n 1 n 2 n 3 that is
three numbers and this function is going
to add those three numbers and then
return their sum and within the main
method we are actually calling this
function okay and passing one two three
and then holding the sum in this
variable and printing out the sum okay
now at design time while I'm writing
this program you know I want to execute
this function okay that's you know one
of the reasons why we can use an
immediate window without running the
actual application we can simply execute
this function okay so if I want to
execute this function then I use
question mark and then the name of the
function now this function expects three
parameters three integer parameters so
we need to supply the respective
arguments so let's pass 1 comma 2 comma
3 and then press Enter look at that the
function is executed and it prints the
sum of those three numbers number 6
ok so immediate window supports function
execution at design
but in reality most of the time we use
immediate window at runtime during
debugging to inspect change and print
variable values let's understand what we
mean by that statement now let's
actually run this console application
but before that let's put a breakpoint
within this print sum function and then
run this program within the debug mode
so obviously since we have a breakpoint
there it's going to stop the execution
at that arm in our breakpoint now let's
press control di the keyboard shortcut
to get to the immediate window now I
want to find out what is the value of
you know this parameter N 1 to achieve
that from within the immediate window
type question mark and then type the
name of the variable in this case N 1
once I press ENTER look at that the
value that is present within n is 1 if
you want to find out the value of n 3
type N 3 and then + Enter look at that
the value that is present in n 3 is 3
because look at this this function is
called from here and we are passing 1 2
and 3 for N 1 n 2 and n 3 variables ok
so we have just seen how to print you
know the values of the variables now we
can also evaluate expressions now I want
to check if N 1 value is equal to 1 how
do I do that the Equality operator in
view in c-sharp is double equals so
double equals 1 so we want to evaluate
that expression so when I press ENTER
look at that it prints true saying N 1
equals 1 on the other hand I want to
check if N 1 value is equal to n 2 value
how do I do that again N 1 double equals
n 2 look at that it prints false way is
that because N 1 value is 1 n 2 F value
is 2 they are not equal so that
expression has evaluated to false now I
want to find out the sum of N 1 and n 3
so how do I do that simply pass that
expression n 1 plus n 3 look at that it
prints the sum of those two numbers now
let's say I want to change the
you of a specific variable let's say I
want to change the value of n1 from 1 to
10 without re running the program so I
can do that using immediate window so
question mark n 1 equals 10 and I do
that it has now changed the value of n
to 10 let's verify that so question mark
and one should print the value back look
at that and one value is 10 ok now so at
the moment N 1 value is 10 n 2 is 2 &amp;amp; 3
is 3 so 10 plus 2 plus 3 15 so when we
press f10 and then inspect the value of
this variable sum look at that it is 15
so using immediate window we can inspect
the values of these variables we can
print their values we can evaluate
expressions we can change the values is
required so definitely a very useful
tool during debugging and intellisense
is also available with an immediate
window so for example you know if if the
code within this page is large and you
don't remember the names of the
variables and if you want for example
intelligence look at this intelligence
is supported as well when I type n and
then plus control space look at that
there are 3 variables which starts whose
name starts with N and 1 n 2 n 3 all of
them are listed there whatever you want
pick that plus enter and you get to see
the value of that variable alright
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
