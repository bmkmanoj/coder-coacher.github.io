this video we'll discuss exception
handling in WCF for the purpose of this
demo I've created a simple calculator WC
of servers if you look at the calculator
service itself we have got two files
here I calculate a service dot C as this
the interface file where we have a
single service contract and a single
operation contract within that service
contract and if you look at this
operation contract here it takes two
parameters of type integer and returns
an integer and if you look at the
service implementation itself you know
the implementation of this divide method
is straightforward all it does is divide
the numerator by denominator and then
return that result back so
straightforward calculator service and
then we have hosted this calculator
service using a console project so this
calculator service host is a console
project within the application
configuration file there's the same
configuration that we have done in the
previous sessions of this video series
you know to host a WCF service so
basically we have specified of a service
name here and then we have the end point
where we have specified the ABC of the
service endpoint that is the address
binding and the contract and then we
have the base address and then we have
specified service behavior to enable
service metadata exchange we associated
this behavior with this service using
behavior configuration and then within
program dot CS file we have the
necessary code to open the service host
I'll how all this could available on my
blog in case you need it so the service
host is already running and I also have
implemented a client for this calculator
service and the client is an asp.net web
application project so I've created an
MT asp.net web application and then
added a reference to the calculator
service so if you look at you know the
baby have added the reference you know
we simply specify the base address of
the calculator service
you know once we click OK it's going to
ask us to provide a namespace and the
namespace that I have given is
calculator service so we have a
reference to a calculator service and
here is the webform design which is
straightforward again we have caught
couple of text boxes about an and the
label control this label will display
the result of you know the division and
within the click event handler of the
button we are retrieving the numerator
and denominator from the respective text
boxes converting them to India and
storing those values in these variables
and then we are creating an instance of
the proxy class here and then in working
the divide method passing in the
numerator and denominator
finally converting the result to a
string and then assigning that to the
text property of the label control so
let's go ahead and run the client so
let's enter a numerator of 20 and a
denominator of 5 divided we get the
result as expected
okay now let's divide in number by 0 so
once we click divide what's going to
happen the service divide method will be
called
and you know when we divide a number by
0
you know we get an exception / 0
exception so the service is actually
going to throw an exception and let's
see what happens when an exception is
thrown from a WCF service so once we
click this button look at that we get
that ello screen of death and if you
look at the error it doesn't say
anything about / 0 exception look at the
error message what it says the server
was unable to process the request due to
an internal error for more information
about the error either turn on include
exception detail in false okay so
basically if you look at the exception
details here look at what we are getting
back we are getting a fault exception
back ok so what is this fault exception
there's nothing but a soup fault
exception so what happened
- the actual dotnet exception that is
the / 0 exception that has occurred in
the WCF service so when an exception
occurs in a WCF service you know that
exception is a dotnet exception here now
the dotnet exception is not sent back to
the client
now that object you know an exception is
also nothing but an object so that
object needs to be serialized into an
XML format before it can be sent to the
client okay so the exception is
converted into something called soap
fault okay which is an XML format and
then that soup fault is returned to the
client and that's the reason why we are
getting a fault exception here and by
default when there is an unhandled
exception in a WC of servers the
exception details are not included in
the fault exception that is returned to
the client okay and why does WC have do
that by default because of security
reasons you know service is something
internal to the organization that
service could be consumed by external
clients and we don't want to be sharing
you know the application code which you
know the exception details basically
include the application code as well and
we don't want to share that with with
client applications right so by default
you know WCF will not include an
unhandled exception details in the soup
fault that is returned to the client but
sometimes for debugging purposes we want
to include exception details in the soup
fault and in order to do that there are
two ways okay so when an exception
occurs in a WCF service the service C
realizes the exception into your so
fault and then sense that soup fault to
the client but by default unhandled
exception details are not included in so
faults that are propagated to the client
applications for security reasons
instead a generic so fault is returned
to the client for debugging purpose if
we want to include exception details in
soup falls we need to enable
include exception detail and faults
setting and we can do that in two ways
the preferred approach is to use the
config file as you can see here notice
that we are specifying a service
behavior and look at this element right
here service debug element and we are
setting include exception detail and
false attribute to true so let's include
the setting in our service configuration
file and see what's going to happen to
the Soph all that is returned so let's
get to the application configuration
file so we already have a service
behaviors section here and let's include
service debug element and then set
include exception detail in false to
true let's stop the host that's already
running let's read on this service host
let's go back to the client and then
click divide now look at that we get
still a fault exception okay and now
look at this the actual exception
information is displayed attempted to
divide by zero okay that's the actual
exception so we cannot divide a number
by zero so we know what the problem is
and we are going to fix that okay so
basically sometimes for debugging
purposes we want to include exception
details and false and if we want to do
that one of the options is to use
service behavior configuration and set
this attribute to true and another
approach is through code using the
service behavior attribute and then we
specify this named parameter to true
okay so I always prefer using
configuration over code because if you
change configuration you don't have to
recompile and redeploy your application
but if you change your code you need to
rebuild and redeploy your application
and as far as soap falls are concerned
these are very commonly asked interview
questions what happens when an exception
occurs in a WCF service or what is it so
fault or how our WCF service
exceptions reported to client
applications now the answer for all of
these three questions you know is the
same thing whenever there is an
exception in a WC of servers the
exceptions are serialized into soap
falls before returned to the client and
by default the exception information is
not included in the soap vault that is
sent to the client and why does WCF does
do that by default that's for security
reasons and for debugging purposes if we
want to include exception detail in
false all we need to do is set that
setting to true and we can do that
either in the config file or in code
that's it for today thanks for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
