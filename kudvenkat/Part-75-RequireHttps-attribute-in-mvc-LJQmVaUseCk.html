in this video we'll discuss require HTTP
attribute in MVC a require HTTP
attribute forces an unsecured HTTP
request to be recent over HTTP protocol
let's understand this with an example
let's flip to visual studio
here I have a blank asp.net MVC for
application let's add a controller and
let's name it home controller and let's
change the return type of this index
action method to return a string instead
of an action result and we want to
return this string which states this
method should be accessed only using
HTTP protocol let's build our solution
let's fire up a browser and then let's
use HTTP request to invoke the index
action within the home controller look
at that we are able to invoke the index
action using the HTTP protocol and if
you have fiddler installed on your
machine fire of fiddler delete any
traces that you have already captured
now let's reissue the request let's go
back to fiddler look at that you know we
have made a request to the index action
within the home controller and look at
the HTTP status code 200 which means the
result is okay and look at the request
data this method should be accessed only
using HTTP protocol that is what is the
message this index action is returning
and we see that unencrypted okay so it's
present in plain text format so when you
use HTTP protocol the data is sent over
the wire in a plain text format now
let's say our requirement is such that
we want users to be requesting this
index action only by using HTTP protocol
so how do we force that to happen all we
need to do is they create this action
method with require HTTP attribute let's
build our solution
now let's reissue you know again an HTTP
request to the index action within the
home controller look at that we are
issuing an HTTP request and let's see
what's going to happen look at that we
are automatically redirected to use HTTP
protocol and if you look at fiddler look
at that we made a request to the index
action within the home controller and
look at the HTTP status code
3:02 so a redirection is done
automatically for us and look at this h2
tag over here object move - so the
request is automatically redirected to
http okay so using require HTTP
attribute forces an unsecured HTTP
request to be recent over to HTTP
protocol and we have seen that
practically and another thing to note
this look at that that's the request and
then you know we are redirected to HTTP
and look at that HTTP decryption is
disabled so if you look at the data here
it's not pleasant in plain text so
obviously any data that is transmitted
over HTTP protocol is encrypted and if
you look at the output here you know we
have an error if you look at this
message SSL error SSL stands for secure
socket layer that's because I don't have
a valid SSL certificate installed on my
machine that's the reason why we see the
screen otherwise we should have been on
this page without any errors like this
okay so this require HTTP attribute can
be applied at a controller level as well
so when we apply it at the controller
level then that attribute is applicable
for all action methods within that
controller and keep in mind sensitive
data such as login credentials credit
card information etc must always be
transmitted using HTTP protocol that's
because information transmitted over
HTTP is encrypted and if you're new to
this SSL concepts that is secure
socket layer concepts we discussed about
them in detail in parts 1 0 1 2 1 0 3 in
asp.net video tutorial that's it for
today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
