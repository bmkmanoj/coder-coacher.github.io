asp.net tutorial in this video we'll
discuss how to included JavaScript
calendar date picker on an asp.net page
on most of the websites you might have
seen a calendar like this on that page
if you have date related fields like
date of birth or higher date and when
you click in the respect to text box
control a calendar pops up and renew
selected date from the calendar the
selected date will be populated with in
the text box control and the calendar
disappears that's generally a JavaScript
calendar so let's see how to include
this JavaScript calendar on an asp.net
page there are several free JavaScript
calendars available on the internet
wicked a is one of them here is the URL
to download the required CSS and
JavaScript files
I'll have this link available on my blog
in case you need it so once you navigate
to that URL on the right hand side
you'll find a button which says download
zip click that button to download the
zip to folder I've already downloaded
the folder and extract its contents
within the downloaded folder you should
see a folder with named CSS and that
contains the required CSS files we need
all these three CSS files so I'm going
to copy this folder now let's flip to
shell studio here I have an empty
asp.net web application project I'm
going to right click on the project name
in solution explorer and paste the
folder that we have just copied so the
folder and all the three CSS files are
present in our project now we also need
a JavaScript file so the speak a date or
JS file copy that and let's paste that
within our project so we have got one
J's file and three CSS files this J's
file contains the required JavaScript
for our calendar so we need to add
references to these four files on this
page so let's select all of them and
drag and drop them into the head section
and we need a text box control as well
so let's drag and drop a text box
control so when we click inside the text
box control that's when we want to
display that calendar finally we need to
write some JavaScript and here is that
JavaScript so basically we are using
wicked a constructor function and this
JavaScript constructor function is
present in this J's file wicked ojs and
if you look at this constructor function
we have lot of configuration specified
here now what does these different
fields mean that information is
available on this page so if you scroll
down you should find a section which
says configuration and here we have the
list of fields and what they mean so if
you look at this field this specifies
the control for which we want to display
this calendar so when we click within
this textbox one control that's when we
want to display this calendar so we are
finding that using document or create
event element by ID and setting that as
the fear this first day field here
specifies what should be the first day
of the week zero for Sunday one for
Monday two for Tuesday etc since we have
specified one as the value for first day
field Monday is the first week within
the calendar and what is the minimum
date that you want to show within the
calendar what is the maximum date that
you want to show within the calendar and
then the range of the ER range basically
so within this calendar we only want to
show from 2000 to 2020 and how many
months you want to display within the
calendar now notice that we have
specified a number of months as one so
only one month is displayed within the
calendar okay
and the theme obviously specifies what
theme you want for the calendar so if
you look at this team dot CSS file so
there is a team with named dark theme so
you can use that team if you want to all
right so to speed things up I have
already typed all that required
JavaScript so I'm going to copy that and
paste it within our form
so now let's go ahead and run this when
the webform loads you know we will have
the textbox control and once we click
within the textbox control look at that
the calendar shows up and once we select
a date from the calendar the date is
displayed within the textbox and the
calendar disappears okay and if you look
at this it has got you know the
background of this calendar is black but
if you want a dark theme like this then
use theme so at the moment we don't have
theme here
so let's fizzy for I teen : dark - theme
let's save the changes reload the page
and look at this when we click the theme
of the calendar changes and if you look
at this there's only one month displayed
within the calendar but if you want to
display two months instead of one month
then for this number of months field
specified - and when we reload this and
when we click within the textbox control
look at that March and April are
displayed okay and if you specify that
as three then three months will be
displayed look at this March April and
May so if you want to know all the other
fields you know just read this
documentation there are loads of them
and you have a lot of options to
customize the look and feel of this
calendar
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
