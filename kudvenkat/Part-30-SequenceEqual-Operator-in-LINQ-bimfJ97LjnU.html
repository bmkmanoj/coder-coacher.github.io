video we'll discuss sequence equal
operator and link sequence equal
operator is used to determine whether
two sequences are equal this method
returns true if the sequences are equal
otherwise false for two sequences to be
equal both the sequences should have the
same number of elements and same value
should be present in the same order in
both the sequences here is an example
here we've got two string arrays
countries 1 and countries to notice that
we've got same number of elements and
same values are present in the same
order in both the sequences hence in
this case sequence equal is going to
return true here is another example in
this case sequence equal is going to
return false that's because the default
comparison of strings is going to be
case sensitive if you notice this
country USA its present in capital
letters in the first sequence and in
small letters in the second sequence so
since the comparison is case sensetive
sequence equal in this case is going to
return false if we want the comparison
to be case insensitive then we can use
the other overloaded version of sequence
equal method to which we can pass an
alternate compare so here we are passing
string compare and we are telling to
ignore the case so in this case sequence
equal is going to return true now in
this case sequence equal is going to
return false that's because although
both of these sequences contain same
data the data is not present in the same
order that's why in this case sequence
equal is going to return false to fix
this problem what we can do is use the
order by to sort data in both of these
source sequences so this order by here
is going to sort the data in countries
one sequence and this order by here is
going to sort the data in countries two
sequence and sequence equal here is
going to return true because in both the
sequences the data is now sorted in
ascending order now when it comes to
complex types like employee customer etc
the default compare will only check if
the references of the objects are
not the individual property values
within the objects so in this case
sequence equal is going to return false
in spite of these two lists containing
the same employee objects so to fix this
problem there are three ways and we
discussed all these three options in
detail in part 26 when we were
discussing distinct method in a similar
fashion all of these three options can
be very easily implemented for sequence
equal method that's it for today thank
you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
