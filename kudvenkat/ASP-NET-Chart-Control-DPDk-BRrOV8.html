control tutorial in this video well disk
is displaying data using asp.net chart
control this is what we want to achieve
we want to display student names and
their total marks in a bar chart as you
can see here we want these student names
to be displayed on the x-axis and the
total marks to be on y-axis we want the
x axis title to be student name and
y-axis title to be total marks and for
the bar chart itself we want the title
to be total marks of students so let's
see how to achieve this using chart
control in asp.net let's flip to visual
studio here I have an empty asp.net web
application project to this project all
I have done is handed this webform 1 dot
aspx look at the HTML that we have
caught on this waveform at the moment
also look at what we have caught in
depth our config file and the references
folder now when we drag-and-drop chart
control onto this waveform there are
going to be some changes made to this
project
so first let's drag and drop the chart
control onto the waveform you will find
chart control on the data tab in toolbox
so let's drag and drop this on to this
waveform so a chart control is added to
the waveform let's flip this to the
source mode first of all notice this we
have got the HTML required for the chart
control and then at the top of the page
notice that we've got a register
directive added and look at the assembly
attribute it's set to system load web
dot data visualization so within
references folder notice that a
reference to system dot web dot data
visualization is added and within web
config file we've got a lot of
configuration we'll talk about all this
in detail in a later video session but
for now understand that when we add a
chart control to the waveform for the
first time they are going to be made
some changes made to your project so now
what we want to do is display student
names and their total marks so if you
look at the chart control HTML that we
have here notice that there are two main
components of the chart control one is
the series and the other one is chart
areas so what is a series a series
is a collection of data points as you
can see here so notice that within this
chart control we've got one series and
one chart area now a chart can contain
multiple series and multiple chart areas
okay now a series is a collection of
data points and each data point here is
going to specify the data for X and y
axis on our bar chart control so this
axis labeled here you know using that we
are specifying the student names on the
x axis and y values are the values that
will be displayed on y axis okay and to
get the x axis title that is student
name on this bar chart they using the
title attribute of axis x element and to
get the y axis title they using title
attribute of axis Y element and that to
get the title of the chart control chart
itself we are using the titles element
of the chart control so within titles
element we have a title element and we
are setting the text property to
whatever we want the title to be
displayed on the chart control so pretty
straightforward HTML there now here we
are specifying the chart data
declaratively on the HTML it's also
possible we can specify this
programmatically in the code-behind file
we'll discuss that in a later video
session for now you know let's get this
HTML on to this webform to speed things
up I have already typed the HTML that
you have seen on the slide so let's copy
this and paste it right here and let's
flip this to the design mode notice that
you know we have these student names and
their total marks on y-axis okay so
let's run this and see if the chart get
rendered as expected so we should have
the bar chart control okay
and if I right click on that save image
as notice that this is this bar chart is
actually rendered as an image all right
now if you look at the HTML here so we
have one series and one chart area now
if we have multiple series and multiple
chart a
we need to associate a series to a chart
okay now how do we associate series to a
chart using chart area attribute of the
series element so chart area equals so
what is the name of this chart area its
chart area one okay so we use the chart
area attribute to associate a series
with a chart area we can have multiple
series you know associated to a same
chart area we'll talk more about that
you know when we talk about multiple
series charts in a later video session
but for now just remember that to
associate a series to a chart we use
chart area attribute now initially we
didn't have this chart area attribute
but it still worked as expected so how
did it work since we have only one
series and one chart area by default
this series is associated with this
chart area okay now if you want to be
explicit use the chart area attribute
now what is going to happen if we
specify a chart area that does not exist
now if I flip this to the design mode
notice that you know we have an error
rendering the control and if you want to
know what exactly is the error run the
application and at runtime you will get
to know that a chart element with name
chart area to could not be found in
chart area collection so within this
chart area collection we don't have any
chart area with that name chart area to
that's what the error says okay so in
this video we have seen how to display
data using bar chart control there are
different types of charts that are
available in asp.net we'll discuss the
different types of charts in our next
video thank you for listening and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
