am venket this is part 30 of asp.net
grid-view tutorial in this video we'll
discuss about displaying images in an
asp.net grid view control using template
field on this slide you can see a grid
view displaying employee related
information employee ID name gender city
and the photo there are two ways to
display images within a grid view
control we can use template field or we
can use image field in this video we'll
discuss about using template field to
display images with the grid view
control and in our next video we'll
discuss about using image field to do
the same thing now we are retrieving
this employee information from this
table TBL employee and then we want to
display that within the grid view
control okay so obviously to retrieve
this employee information we need
employee data access layer so let's add
an employee data access layer class file
to this project so right click on the
project add a class file and let's call
the class file s employee data access
layer dot CS and obviously to
encapsulate this employee information
you know employee ID name gender city
and photo path columns we need a class
so let's go ahead and create an employee
class within this employee data access
layer file so I'm going to call that
employee class and then it's going to
have these properties employee ID name
gender City photo
you know properties to represent these
columns within the table all right
obviously we need a method within this
employee data access layer class you
know to retrieve data from this table
and then return that to whoever is going
to call that method so I'm going to have
this you know get all employees method
within employee data access layer class
so if you look at this method it's
pretty simple and straightforward method
obviously we have some compilation
errors that's because we need some ad or
dotnet namespaces so let's copy those
namespaces and paste them there so
system data our system load data dot
sequel client and configuration all
right so if you look at this method all
it's doing is it's reading the
connection string from web config file
creating a sequel connection object
using that connection string preparing a
sequel command look at the command here
select star from TB
employee we want to retrieve all the
employees once we execute the query we
get all the rows so we are looping
through Ichiro and then converting the
Roo columns into the properties of the
employee object and then adding that
employee object to the list which we are
going to return back
so finally we will return that Employee
List so straightforward you know get all
employees method ok so obviously on this
platform we need a grid view control so
let's drag and drop it would be control
onto the waveform let's sort of format
that
let's choose brown sugar scheme and to
retrieve this data within the page load
we can invoke employee data access
layers get all employees method this is
going to return list of employees back
which we are going to use as the data
source for our grid view control so get
grid view one data source is equal to
that and then finally bind the grid view
control all right
so so we get this data back and
obviously if you look at the photo part
you know if we want to display the
employees photo within the grid view
control then those photos must exist if
you look at the path within the table
they have to exist in the images folder
of our asp.net web application project
so let's go ahead and create images
folder so let me add a new folder to
this project
and let's call that images and we want
four images within those within that
folder mark John Mary and Mike dot you
know all of them having dot PNG
extension so basically I have these
photos you know I have made them up
using Microsoft Paint I have just their
names so let me copy this and then paste
them within the images folder of our
asp.net web application project so we
have the images there all right so with
this
let's save everything let's run this and
let's see what happens within the grid
view control so when the webform renders
obviously it's going to call that
employee data access layer you know get
all employees method and then return
that to this grid view but look at what
is happening instead of displaying
images it's actually displaying you know
whatever data that we have in this
column okay so obviously you know that's
just treated like any other data within
the table and then it's being rendered
within the grid view control but instead
of rendering you know that data like
that we want to use that data you know
basically to retrieve the image is
present within this folder and then
display them within that column okay
now at the moment if you look at this
this grid view control doesn't have any
columns defined at design-time you know
these columns that you are looking at
within the grid view they are
auto-generated depending on the data
okay so what I'm going to do is we want
to basically look at this we want one
two three four five columns within the
grid we control out of those five
columns you know the first four can be
bound columns because that's just data
so I'm just going to display them within
the label control but the last column
you know the photo column I want this to
be a template field because I want an
image control
within the template fear and we want to
bind that image control to this path you
know this is where we have the photo so
we are going to set the image URL
property of that image within the
template field to this column okay let's
see how to do that first of all let's go
ahead and add you know five columns to
our grid view control so out of those
five the first four will be bound
columns and the last one will be the
template feel so employee ID name
generated city there will be the bound
fields so let's add four bound fields
one two three and four and finally we
need a template field let's add that so
the first field is going to be employee
ID and the data field is also going to
be employee ID because that's what is
the property of our employee object and
the next field is going to be name and
the data field is also going to be named
the next field gender and the data field
is also going to be gender finally city
is the header text and data field is
also going to be city okay so those are
the full bound fields and this is our
template field okay so click OK now look
at this employee ID name gender City
they are data bound but template field
we haven't defined any template yet
we'll do that in a bit but then there is
another problem here look at this these
columns are auto-generated we don't want
these columns to be auto-generated so
I'm going to set Auto generate columns
property of the grid view controller to
false so Auto generate columns which is
true by default let's set that to false
so that should go away now we want to
you know edit the template within the
last column which is the template field
so since we want to display an image
within the last column we want to define
an image control inside the item
template of this template field column
okay so let's do that so click on edit
templates and then item
late what do we want there we want an
image control there so let's go into the
standard tab and then let's drag and
drop an image control okay and then
obviously the image control should be
binding to the photo path but the photo
path is the name of the column within
our employee data access layer because
this employee object is what is being
returned by this method and if you look
at the property the property name is
photo so we need to bind to this photo
property of the employee object you know
the image URL property of this image
object so go to the properties of the
image control or click on edit data
bindings and then we want that image to
be bound to photo property of the
employee object so we are binding the
image URL property to the photo property
of the employee object click OK and we
are done so let's end the template
editing there and you can also give the
header text if you want so I'm going to
give the header text for the template
field as well so let's set the
and the texture maybe photo okay so with
these changes have rerun this as you
might expect you know the grid view
should display before you know the
images the photosphere instead of the
pot but then we have a slight issue here
the issue is I don't want these images
to be so big because the actual size of
the images is considered here that's why
they are very big let's say I want them
to be you know reduced size I want 100
pixels by 100 pixels the height and
width so how do I change that you know
obviously this image control within that
template field can also have height and
width properties along with you know all
the other properties that we already
have here so let me set height to maybe
100 pixels and width 200 pixels okay so
that should have solved the problem look
at this so let me run this now now the
images should be scaled down okay so
this match with what we have within our
grid view control so obviously there are
two ways to display images within the
grid view control we can either use
template field or image fields in this
video we discussed about using template
fear okay so basically to display this
image within the grid view control we're
using a template field so the template
field is used to display photos of
employees in the item template here
using the image control and the image
URL property is set to the photo
property of the employee object and to
control the size of the image in grid
view control we have set the width and
height for that image control within the
item template in our case we have set it
to 100 by 100 pixels height and width
and we also need to set the grid view
one controls Auto generate columns
property to false because we are
defining what columns we want to have
within the grid we control all right on

asp.net c-sharp and sequels the way
