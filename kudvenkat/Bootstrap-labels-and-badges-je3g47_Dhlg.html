this video we'll discuss the bootstrap
labels and badges first let's discuss
the bootstrap label component this
component is useful for providing
important additional information for
example we can use this component to let
the user know if a software training
course is beginner intermediate or
advanced level or if it's a new course
let's see how to display these labels
next to the course names let's flip
through sheets to do what we have here
at the moment is eval and inside this
well we have the different courses
offered by presume technologies so if we
view this HTML in the browser this is
how it looks at the moment
remember in our previous video we have
customized the background color of the
valid component and that's the reason
why we see a different background color
here and what we want to do is display
these labels next to the course names
here to do that we'll have to create a
label to create a label all we need to
do is create a span element and the
class of this is going to be label I'm
also going to use another class and that
is label default which is going to apply
the default contextual style let's say
this is a beginner course let's do the
same thing with the other courses that
we have so I'm going to copy this span
element and paste it next to the other
course names that we have so let's say a
deonette is intermediate course and WCF
is advanced course and let's say
bootstrap is a new course let's save our
changes now at this point when we reload
this page notice we get the labels next
to the course names as expected at the
moment notice we are using label default
class which is going to apply the
default contextual styles we can also
use the other contextual
classes that are available so we have
got primary success in forewarning and
danger different contextual classes are
going to give us different styles so
let's apply these different contextual
state classes that we have here so I'm
going to use here labeled primary label
info success warning and let's use
danger here let's save our changes and
then we need a little page notice we get
different contextual styles also keep in
mind at the moment we are only using the
h4 heading element here we can use any
of the heading elements h1 through h6
let's also change these elements and see
what we get so the title head is going
to be H 1 and let's change this to h2
and this one to h3 this one to h4 and
let's change this one to h5 and finally
this one two at six let's save our
changes and when we reload our page
notice the labels adapts depending on
the heading size next let's discuss the
bootstrap badge component this component
is useful for providing important
notifications like number of new
messages in your email inbox let's see
how to display these badges that we see
here let's flip to visual studio I'm
going to replace this HTML with another
piece of HTML here we have got four
anchor elements let's reload this page
notice we see the four anchor elements
here now these are the folders that we
see in any typical email client now what
we want to do is display these badges
next to these folders for that we are
going to create a badge to create a
badge all we need to do is create a span
element with class badge and let's say
for example within our inbox we have got
ten hundred items let's paste the span
element
next to the other folders that we have
so for example let's say within our sent
folder we have two items within span we
have three items and within thrash we
have five items let's save our changes
and when we reload this page notice we
get the badges as expected and here is
the HTML for that at the moment we are
using the badge component with an anchor
element the badge component can also be
used with other elements such as a
button when used with the button the
badge component has the capability to
adapt to the contextual state class
being used on that button notice here
we've got four buttons with four
different contextual state classes being
applied and notice the badge component
that is used on the button has
automatically adapted to the contextual
state class being used on that
respective button let's look at this in
action let's flip to visual studio I'm
going to change the anchor element to a
button element and instead of the HTF
attribute I'm going to use the class
attribute first let's use the BTN class
which is going to apply the button
styles and let's use the button primary
contextual class now let's do the same
thing with the other anchor elements
that we have here so here again we have
got buttons and we are using different
contextual State classes meeting and
warning success and info and for these
buttons to be present in the same line
I'm going to remove the HTML break
element let's save our changes and when
we reload our page notice we get the
buttons and the badges the badge is has
adapted to the contextual state class
being used on the respective button here
is the HTML for that thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
