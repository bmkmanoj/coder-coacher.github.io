in this video we'll discuss while loop
in JavaScript these are the basic loops
in JavaScript
while do-while and form in this video
we'll discus while loop and in a later
video session we'll discuss the rest of
the loops let's understand why loop with
an example let's flip to visual studio
we want to prom the user to enter a
number and then we want to print all the
even numbers starting from 0 till the
number that the end user has provided
for example if the end user enters 10
then we want to print even numbers from
0 till 10 so first we need to prom the
user to enter the number so let's use
the prompt function for that please
enter a target number and in case if the
end user didn't provide any value then
we want to return an empty string as the
default this prompt function is going to
return the number in text format so
let's convert that to a number using the
number function and then let's store
that number in this target variable now
let's create another variable let's name
it start and initialize that to 0
because we want to start printing even
numbers from 0 now let's use the while
loop so we use the while keyword while
start is less than or equal to target
what we want to do is write the value
that is present in the start variable to
the web page and in order to do that we
are going to use the write function of
the document object so document dot
write and then whatever value that you
provide to this method it's going to
write that to the web page so we want to
write the value that is present within
the start variable and then we want to
increment the start variable by 2 all
right so let's quickly run this and test
it so let's enter for example 10 as the
target number click OK and notice that
it prints you know even numbers from 0
till 10 but all of them are present on
the same line let's print each even
number on a separate line which means we
need an HTML break
so let's append HTML plague
to the number that we want to plant and
with this let's rerun this and see if we
get the even numbers printed on a
separate line okay so now let's see how
this while loop works so within the
target variable let's say for example if
the end user has entered number 10 then
in this variable we have that value 10
and within start we have zero so the
while loop has a condition at the
beginning is 0 less than or equal to 10
that condition is true so when the
condition is true then all the
statements that are present inside the
loop will be executed okay so here we
are writing the value that is present in
the start variable to the webpage and
then we're incrementing the value that
is present in this variable by 2 so 0
plus 2 is equal to 2 and then it comes
back and checks the condition again is 2
less than or equal to 10 so the
condition is still true so it's going to
execute these statements again so it's
going to do this as long as the
condition is true now when the value of
the start variable become 10 you know is
10 less than or equal to 10 the
condition is still true so it comes
inside print the value 10 and then
increments the variable by 2 so 10 plus
2 equals 12 is 12 less than or equal to
10 no that's when the condition becomes
false as soon as the condition becomes
false it's going to end the loop okay so
that's how while loop works now let's
talk about infinite while loops so what
can cause a while loop to become an
infinite while loop failure to update
the variable that participates in the
condition will create a never ending or
infinite loop let's understand what we
mean by this statement if you look at
the condition that we have caught here
for the while loop there are two
variables that are participating in this
condition start and target number now in
our example target number is 10 and it
is always going to state 10 it's going
it's not going to change but the value
that is present in the start variable is
going to change okay
we initialize that to 0 and then every
time we increment it to 2 so at some
point
you know this value is going to become
greater than the target number at which
point the condition becomes true and the
loop ends but notice what we have done
here we have commented that line which
means this start variable will never be
updated will never be incremented it is
always going to stay zero so if it is
always going to stay zero then zero is
always going to be less than or equal to
10 which means this condition will never
become false if this condition will
never become false then the control will
never get out of this while loop so it
will repeatedly infinitely keep
executing this statement so this is what
causes infinite or never-ending loops so
we need to update these variables so
that at some point you know the
condition become false and the loop ends
so let's look at this in action so if we
comment this line this is going to be
always zeros and 0 is always going to be
less than or equal to ten so when we run
this now it will prompt us to enter a
target number let's say for example if
we entered then click OK
look at that it is processing processing
processing processing ok now what is it
doing behind the scenes you know it's
it's continuously writing the value 0 to
the webpage ok and you know it is stuck
there look at this it is still
processing so basically you know our web
page is frozen so that's why it's very
important to update the variables that's
part that participates in the condition
you know otherwise we risk creating
never-ending loops now let's understand
the use of break statement in a loop now
we know that if we use break statement
inside a switch statement you know it
causes the execution to break out of the
switch statement in a similar fashion if
we use break statement in a while loop
then it's going to end that loop early
let's understand this with an example
so now we are prompting the user to
enter a target number now if the end
user enters any number that is below
read a hundred then we want to print all
the even numbers from zero till 100 but
if they enter any number beyond 100 then
we want to limit the even numbers only
until 100 which means the absolute
maximum that this program is going to
print even numbers is only till 100 if
they enter any number beyond 100 we are
still going to print only numbers until
100 ok so within the message we'll just
say please enter a target number and
then we will say 100 and within brackets
maybe max so we are telling the users to
enter a number only until 100 but if
they enter anything beyond 100 we are
going to break this while loop after we
have printed hundred even numbers okay
so how are we going to break the while
loop so we will check the value that is
present within this start variable okay
its start is greater than 100 then what
we want to do we want to break out of
the while loop so as soon as this
variable is greater than 100 it's going
to come to this statement
okay break and then as soon as the
interpreter encounters this statement
it's going to exit the while loop okay
so let's quickly test this let's run
this now so if we enter a number you
know below 100 for example 50 then it
should print all the even numbers
starting from 0 till 50 okay so there we
go
now if we enter 150 then it should only
print even numbers till 100 okay it's
not going to go beyond 100 that is
because as soon as this variable becomes
greater than 100
you know this condition becomes true and
this statement will be executed when
break statement is executed the while
loop is going to end now let's
understand the use of continue statement
so what is this continuous statement
going to do continue statement tells the
JavaScript interpreter to skip remaining
code that is present after this
statement and start the next iteration
of the loop again let's understand this
with an example so what we want to do is
print all the odd numbers between 1 and
10 okay so let's see how
do that so we are not going to ask the
user to enter a number so we have the
start variable which is initialized to
10 and we are going to hard-code the
value 10 here so while start is less
than 10 what we want to do is increment
the value that is present in this
variable by 1 and then we are going to
check if start modulus 2 equals 0 okay
that means if the number is even okay
when we divide a number by 2 and if the
reminder is 0 then we know it's an even
number if it's even number then I'm
using this continue keyword okay and
then finally here we're using the
document object document dot write and
then we want to write the value that is
present in the start variable and then
we want to append an HTML break so that
each number will be printed on its own
line so let's look at what's happening
here so we have initialized star to 0 is
0 less than 10 the condition is true so
it comes inside start is equal to start
plus 1 0 plus 1 is 1 so at the moment we
can start variable we have 1 1 modulus
to the reminder is not 0 so it is not
going to go into this F block so it
comes here right the value that is
present in the start variable which is 1
and then it goes back it checks is 1
less than or equal to 10 yes it is and
then it comes here increments one by one
so start is equal to 2 2 modulus 2 the
reminder is 0 so it comes inside the if
statement and this statement will be
executed continue okay so as soon as
this statement executes what is going to
happen it's going to skip any statements
that are present after that continue
you know this rest of code within the
while loop will be skipped and then
immediately it goes to the next
iteration of the loop so at the moment
start value is 2 so it's 2 less than 10
yes it's going to come inside 2 plus 1
is 3 so start is 3 3 modulus 2 is not 0
so it doesn't go inside right the value
3
so this way it goes on until printing
all the even numbers that are present
between one and ten I mean all the odd
numbers so let's run this and see if
that's the case so it prints the odd
numbers from one till nine so continue
basically when this statement executes
it's going to skip the rest of the
instructions in the while loop and then
it immediately goes to the next
iteration thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
