in this video we'll discuss functions in
JavaScript
what's a function a function is a block
of reusable code a function allows us to
write code ones and use it as many times
as we want just by calling the function
here we have the syntax for JavaScript
function in JavaScript a function is
declared using the function keyword
followed by that will have the name of
the function and followed by that we
will have parentheses within parentheses
we specify the function parameters
function parameters are optional if we
have multiple parameters then we
separate them with a comma now let's
look at an example we want to write a
JavaScript function that's going to take
two numbers as parameters add them
together and return their sum so in
JavaScript we declare a function using
the function keyword followed by that we
will have the name of the function and
then within parentheses we specify the
parameters so we want to have two
parameters first number and second
number and then we will have curly
braces and within curly braces we
specify the body of the function that is
the statements that we want to execute
as part of this function call so we want
to add these two numbers together so
let's create a variable to hold this sum
and add the numbers together and then
finally we want to return the sum so now
we have a simple JavaScript function
that's taking two numbers as parameters
adding them together and returning their
sum now let's see how to call this
JavaScript function to call the
JavaScript function simply specify the
name of the function and then within
parentheses specify the values for the
parameters so we have two parameters
here so we need to pass two values 10
for the first parameter and 20 for the
second parameter so this function is
going to add those two numbers return
the sum so let's create a variable here
to hold that sum
let's name it result and then let's
write the value that is present in that
variable to the webpage so now when we
run this as you might expect we should
get 30 St result now what do you think
is going to happen when we do not
specify values for the function
parameters when calling the function the
parameters that are missing values are
set to undefined let's understand this
so here at the moment
this function is got two parameters
first number and second number now let's
remove the value for the second
parameter so at the moment we are only
passing value for the first parameter
but not for the second parameter so now
when this function is called first
number will be initialized to 10 but
second number will be set to undefined
because we are not passing value for
that so when we learnt this we will get
n n as the result so what is this na and
na n stands for not a number so why is
that second number is set to undefined
and then first number is set to 10 10
plus undefined that results to not a
number so within sum variable will have
not a number and that's what is returned
and that's what will be stored in this
result variable and finally we are
writing that to the document object if
you actually put this program in debug
mode you will actually notice that you
know second number will be set to
undefined notice that then I hover the
mouse over second number is set to
undefined and if you look at first
number that is 10 now some at the moment
will be undefined when we press f10
notice that within some we get n/a and
not a number and finally we are writing
that value to the webpage
now what happens when we specify too
many parameter values when calling the
function so at the moment we have two
parameters but if I pass three or more
parameter values then what is going to
happen javascript is simply going to
ignore the additional parameter values
in this case first number will be set to
10 second number will be set to 20 so
the result will be 30 the additional
parameter values that is 30 and 40 will
be ignored should a JavaScript function
always return a value no they don't have
to it totally depends on what we want
the function to do if an explicit return
statement is omitted undefined is
returned automatically from the function
so let's understand this with an example
so if you look at the function that we
have here at the moment this function is
returning the sum of these two numbers
and we are storing that sum in this
result variable and writing that to the
document now what do you think is going
to happen if we don't have this return
statement for example let's say we want
this function to add two numbers
together and we want this function
itself to write that sum to the webpage
so I'm going to move this document dot
write statement inside the function and
then we want to write the value that is
present in this sum variable to the
document so if you look at this function
we don't have an explicit return
statement here right but here what we
are doing is we are calling the function
and we are assigning the return value of
that function to this variable but if
you look at this function it doesn't
have any explicit return statement
meaning it's not explicitly returning
anything now what do you think is going
to happen when we actually alert the
value that is present in that result
variable now if an explicit return
statement is missing then by default
that this function will return undefined
and that's what will be alerted let's
look at that in action
so when I run this notice that it writes
the value 30 to the document and within
the alert we get undefined thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
