this video we'll discuss the concept of
method chaining in jQuery how method
chaining works and when will method
chaining not work let's understand all
these with an example we'll be using
this HTML in this demo notice we've got
an unordered list and at the moment this
list contains five list items now we
want to write some jQuery code and that
jQuery code should do the following it
should change the color of all these
list items to blue and we also want to
do a couple of animations we want these
list items to slide up first and then
slide down so we want to do those two
animations and finally we also want to
set the title attribute of each of these
list item to my title so let's see how
to achieve this using jQuery code let's
flip to visual studio so here we already
have that unordered list that we have
seen on the slide within our jQuery
ready function we need a selector that's
going to grab all this list item
elements so I'm going to use the jQuery
element selector so the element that we
want to grab is Li so what is this
selector going to do this is going to
return as a jQuery collection object
back and that collection object is going
to contain all these list items so what
is the first thing that we want to do
with those list items we want to change
their color to blue so I'm going to make
use of the CSS function and this
function has got two parameters the
first parameter is the name of the
property that we want to change which is
color and we want to set that to blue so
what happens when this piece of code is
executed look at the CSS method we are
actually calling it on the jQuery
collection object that is returned by
this selector so this method is going to
implicitly iterate over each element
within that collection and apply blue
color what is the next thing that we
want to do animation we want to slide up
all these list item elements now there
are several animation functions in
jQuery we'll discuss all those functions
in detail in a later video session for
now to perform this light-up animation
I'm going to
use slide up jQuery function and this
function has got three parameters but
for the purpose of this demo we are only
going to discuss the speed parameter we
specify the value for speed parameter in
milliseconds so thousand milliseconds is
equal to one second that means this
animation that is slide up animation is
going to last for one second so the next
thing we want to do is also an animation
but here we want to slide down the list
items so I'm going to use this jQuery
slide down method and if you look at
this method this also has got the same
set of parameters as of slide up method
and again here we're using thousand
milliseconds for speed which means both
of these animations are going to last
for one second each and the final thing
that we want to do is set the title
attribute so dollar Li and to set an
attribute we can use a TDR function and
if you look at this function there's got
two parameters the name of the attribute
that we want to set and the value so the
name of the attribute is title and the
value is going to be my title all right
so let's save the changes and when we
reload this page four things should
happen
first the color of these list items
should change to blue two animations
should happen slide up and slide down
each one second and then finally when we
hover the mouse over any of the list
item the title attribute you know which
we have set as my title should show up
as tooltip so let's see if that happens
look at that we get the blue color slide
up slide down and then I have the mouse
over list item look at that we get the
title attribute value as a tooltip now
if you look at this code notice you know
how we are calling this function stock
CSS slide up slide down and attr we're
calling all these functions you know on
the same selector so don't you think
this code is redundant
we have the same selector all over now
instead of writing this code like this
we can actually chain all these methods
together meaning you know at the end
here so on the collection object that is
returned by this selector we calling the
CSS method so at the end I can put a dot
and then call slide up method similarly
you know we can then call slide down and
finally we can call this a TDR function
and then a semicolon at the end and we
can get rid of all these lines look at
this now we have achieved all this in a
single line of code now when we save
these changes and when we reload the
behavior should be the same so how
method chaining works so what's going on
here this selector what is this going to
do it's going to give us a jQuery object
which is a collection object and that
jQuery collection object contains all
these list items and on that object we
are calling the CSS method what is this
method going to do it's going to
implicitly iterate over each element
within that collection apply the boot
blue color and then once it has done
with its job it's going to return that
object back and whatever object this
method is going to return on that object
we are calling slide up method in turn
and what is this light-up method going
to do again it's going to do its job
meaning it's going to perform that
animation on all those elements within
that collection object and then return
that collection object and whatever
object this method returns on that we
call and slide down so this process goes
on until we reach this last method in
this method chain so that's how method
chaining works now when we have you know
method chaining code like this this line
of code can very easily become quite
long and when it becomes too long the
readability of the code will be lost so
if you want to improve the readability
of your code you can actually introduce
some white spaces and new line
characters so something like that
so I can actually move the CSS method
down and then slide up method to the
next line similarly slide down and
finally a TDR so this version of the
code with those extra white spaces and
line breaks you know it's much more
readable than the previous version where
we have all them chained methods in one
line again you know when we reload it
should still work the same way except
that we have formatted it for
readability
now let's discuss Vendrell method
chaining not work so if you look at all
these methods they are actually doing
their job and returning a jQuery object
back and whatever method you know
whatever object is written by CSS method
on that object slide up method operates
and it goes on until we reach the last
method now what's going to happen if we
have a method in this chain which is not
going to return a jQuery object then
that method chain will not work one such
method is text method so for example
when I use text method so if you look at
this text method there are two things
that we can do with this method if you
use the method without the parameter
value this is actually going to return
the text value of the list item on the
other hand if you specify a value of
something like XYZ then it's going to
set that value to the list item okay so
let's use it without parameters so when
we use this text pair our method without
parameters what is this going to do it's
actually going to return a single string
back and that string is going to contain
the text of all these list items you
know join together let's actually look
at that in action so let's cut this code
from here and then let's wrap this in an
alert function okay so when we reload
this page look at that we get a single
string back and look at what the string
contains it contains all these country
names so what is this text method
returning it's not returning a jQuery
object it's simply returning a string
back
and that string you know contains all
the country names and then we have the
CSS method slide up slide down and a TDR
so now since this text method is not
returning a jQuery object this method
chain is not going to work meaning the
color will not be changed to blue no
animations will be there and the title
attribute will not be set let's actually
look at that in action so let's save the
changes and let's reload this look at
that nothing happens when I have the
mouse over any of the list items we
don't get the title attribute value as a
tooltip and look at that the color is
not changed to blue no animations
nothing why is that because this method
is not returning a jQuery object back
you know this method chain is not going
to work now we discussed that we can use
this text method to set a value as well
so when we use this method to set a
value then this chain is going to work
let's actually look at that in action
let's actually set the value of the list
item to my value and let's save the
changes so when we reload the page what
should happen it should change the text
value of all these list items to my
value the color should be changed to
blue animations should happen and then
the tooltip should be I mean title
attribute value should be displayed as a
tooltip so let's reload the page look at
that when I hover the mouse we get my
title as a tooltip okay so when we use
that text function to retrieve the value
since it's not returning a jQuery object
you know the method chain will not work
now actually let's look at another
example now what is going to happen when
I move this text method down in the
chain so it's present right here so that
means this selector is going to give us
a collection object a jQuery object on
that this CSS method should work slide
up should work slide down should work
and this text method since it's going to
return a string back you know attr
should not work so except this
the rest of the methods in this chain
should work let's actually look at that
in action so let's reload this page look
at that blue color slide up slide down
but then I have the mouse over I don't
get the attribute value as a tooltip
okay
only this method failed because the
previous method in the chain is not
returning a jQuery object back thank you
for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
