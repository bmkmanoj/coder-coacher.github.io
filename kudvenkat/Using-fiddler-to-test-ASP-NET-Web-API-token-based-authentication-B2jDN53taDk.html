tutorial in this video we'll discuss how
to test asp.net Web API tooken based
authentication using fiddler in our
previous video we have registered a new
user using our register dot HTML page we
are storing the new registrations in a
sequel server database so within sequel
server in our employee DB database along
with the employees table we also have
the identity tables in this asp net
users we have the new registrations so
if we right-click on this table and
select this option select top thousand
rows we can see the new registrations
notice the email column we have a user
with email a at a com the username is
also the email address if we scroll all
the way to the right notice the username
column it's the same as that of the
email address and we also have hashed
password so let's use this username and
password and generate an access token
let's slip to fiddler let's click on the
composer tab at the moment our
application is running at this port
number 3 for 8 3 8
so let's issue a post request to that
URL so we want to issue a post request
to HTTP : four slash four slash
localhost colon the port number at which
our application is running and we want
to post to slash token and within the
request party we want to specify user
name and password so user name equals a
at a comm and purse and password equals
the password that we have specified
during registration which is test 1 2 3
exclamation and we also need to specify
a grand type so ampersand grant
underscore type and grant type is
password so basically using this grant
type we are specifying that we are
supplying password and in return we want
an access token so let's execute this
notice the request has completed
successfully with status code 200 now
when I double click on this look at the
response that we got from the server
we got a signed access token we also
have the date and time when the token is
issued when it is going to expire the
username is a at a calm and the token
type is better so to get an access token
we issue a post request to slash token
and in the request body we specify user
name password and grant type equals
password and in return we get assigned
access token from the server
let's now understand how this access
token is generated we have not written
any code whatsoever that validates the
username and password that we have
supplied and generate an access token
all this code is provided out of the box
by asp.net Web API when we have created
a new web API project to see the code
that validates user name and password
and generates access token in app and
the score start folder we have this file
startup dot dot dot CS within this file
we have configure aught function within
this function we are creating an
instance of o earth authorization server
options class and in here we have that
slash token endpoint to which we are
posting username and password we are
also specifying the token expiry using
access token expired timespan property
and in this case the token expires 14
days after it is issued so if you look
at the access token that we got from the
server notice it is issued on 2nd
December and it expires on 16th December
so it expires 14 days after it is issued
we can always change this property to
meet our application needs so for
example let's say we want the token to
expire one hour after it is issued I can
say timespan from ours and let's add one
hour so we want the token to be valid
only for one hour so let's give our
solution a build and reissue a request
from fiddler so let's execute this
request request complete successfully
with status code 200 and look at issued
and expires the token is issue
at 1510 and it's going to expire at 1610
one hour after it is issued the obvious
next question that comes to our mind is
where is the code that validates the
username and password that we have
supplied now if you look at this
provider property we are initializing
this with a new instance of application
or provider class if we right click on
this and go to definition within this
class we have this method grant resource
owner credentials to which we are
passing or grant resource owner
credentials context object this object
has got the user name and password user
manager tries to find a user with the
specified username and password if it
doesn't find any user it returns an
error the username or password is
incorrect if it finds a user then it
creates a claims identity object which
in turn is passed to authentication
ticket which is going to create a ticket
and that is passed to validated method
which generates the access token now
let's use this access token and retrieve
employee's data by calling the get
method of the employees controller so
let's go to the composer tab we want the
issue a get request with a get request
we don't need to have a request body and
we want to issue a get request to slash
API slash employees at the moment we are
not passing the access token so when we
execute this notice we get four zero one
unauthorized as the response that's
because the employee is controller is
decorated with authorized attribute this
means every request needs to be
authenticated so with every request we
need to pass the access token and to
pass the access token we are going to
make use of authorization header so
let's flip to fiddler one more time and
on the composer tab we want to pass the
access token so let's use the
authorization header and the value for
this is going to be bearer so basically
this word tells that we are sending a
bearer token and let's copy the access
token
so here we have the access token let's
right-click copy that and paste that in
a notepad and let's cut just the access
token value and specify that on the
composer tab all right so we are passing
the access token as well so let's
execute this notice directorís
completed successfully with status code
200 and we get the employees data as
expected so to pass the access token
from the client to the server we use the
authorization header at the moment we
only have the registration page
implemented in our next video we'll
discuss implementing the login page
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
