this video we'll discuss the jQuery
selected selector in the previous
sessions of this video series we discuss
that to get all check the checkboxes of
radio buttons we use the jQuery checked
selector to select all selected options
of a select element that is a single
select or a multi select drop-down list
we use the selected selector let's
understand this with an example here
we've got a single select drop-down list
as we make our selection from this
drop-down list we want to display these
selected options value and text as you
can see here so let's see how to achieve
this so here we have a select element
and this select element has got five
options and notice each option has got a
value and text and at the bottom we have
a development so we want to display each
options value and text within this div
element so let's see how to do that
within our script section we have the
ready function wired up right we want to
retrieve the selected options value and
text whenever the selection within the
drop-down list changes so I'm going to
wire up change event handler to this
select element so to do that we need to
first find the select element the select
element has got an ID so I'm going to
use the ID selector and in jQuery ID
selector is hash so hash and the ID of
the element that we want to find is
select countries and with that element
we want to wire up change even handler
when this change event occurs we want to
execute a function so whenever the
selection within that drop-down list
changes what do we want to do we want to
retrieve the value and text of that
selected option so now where are these
options present these options are
actually nested in the Select element so
I can use the ancestor descendant syntax
okay so the Select element has got an ID
and the ID is select countries so first
find the element with ID
select countries and then queue me all
options that are descendants of that
select element but we don't really want
all the options we just want that option
which is selected and to specify that
I'm going to use : selected selector so
this is basically going to tell give me
that option that is selected and that is
present inside this select countries
select element so that's our selected
options so let's put that in a variable
let's name it selected option and all
that is left now is to retrieve the text
and value of that selected option and
display that within this development so
we need to find the development as well
and this development has got an ID so we
can use the ID selector so dollar ID
selector is hash find the div by ID and
let's call the HTML method and then we
want to display the value and text so
first let's display the value value
equals and to get the value we can use
this variable selected option dot Val
function should give us the value and
then we want the text so let's open that
string text equals selected option dot
text all right so let's save these
changes and let's reload this page and
look at this we select United Kingdom we
get its value and text so this is a
single select drop-down list now let's
see how to do the same thing with a
multi select drop-down list so at the
moment within this select item we have
two options selected and look at the
result for both the options we get the
value and text okay so let's see how to
achieve this first of all to make this a
multi select drop-down list use the
multiple attribute so multiple equals
multiple okay so let's save the change
and let's reload this page so this
should become a multi select drop-down
list now in a multi select drop-down
list there is a chance that the user can
select more than one option okay so with
this selector what we are getting back
is actually a collection so let's rename
the variable to selected options and the
selected options can contain more than
one selection right so if selected
options dot length if that is greater
than zero then we know that there is a
selection within that list and in that
case what do we want to do we want to
loop through each option and then
retrieve the value and text so first I'm
going to create a variable here let's
call this result string and let's
initialize that to an empty string and
this is a collection so I'm going to use
the jQuery each function and loop
through each item that we have within
that collection and when we are looping
through we want to execute some code so
I'm going to use an anonymous function
and we are going to populate this result
string with the text and value of each
option so result string plus equals so
first we want the value so value equals
and we have this keyword which refers to
an item within that collection and then
we can use the valve function on that
and to that we want to append text so
text equals and again dollar this dot
text
all right so we loop through each item
within that collection append the value
and text and we want the value and text
of each option to be present in a
separate line so at the end of each
option we want an HTML break alright and
the final thing that is left is to this
HTML function simply pass our result
string all right so let's save these
changes reload this page and look at
this as we make our selections you know
a select to the United States we get the
value and text I select United Kingdom
we get the value in text and by the way
to select multiple items hold down the
control key and then make the selection
so here is the HTML and the jQuery code
for the first example and here for the
second example thank you for listening
