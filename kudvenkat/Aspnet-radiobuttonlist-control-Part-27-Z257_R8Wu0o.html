venket this is part 27 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll learn about
the asp.net radio button list control
before continuing with the session I
strongly recommend to watch parts 24 25
and 26 of this video series in asp.net
there are several list controls like
drop-down lists checkbox lists bulleted
lists list box and radio button list we
are spoken about drop-down lists
checkbox list and list box in previous
sessions of this video series so just
like every other list control a radio
button list is also a collection of list
item objects items can be added to the
radio button list in the HTML source at
design time or in the code-behind file
at runtime radio button list like any
other list control supports data binding
for example a radio button list can be
bound to a database table or an XML file
in the previous sessions of this video
series we have actually seen how to bind
a drop-down list to an XML file and to a
database table so we exactly bind the
radio button list also in the similar
way checkbox list is generally used when
we want to present the user with
multiple choices from which we want him
or her to select one or more options but
then if you want to restrict the user to
select only one option then we can make
use of a radio button list that is if we
want to present the user with mutually
exclusive choices then radio button list
should be used let's look at some of the
useful properties of the radio button
list control you know most of these
properties are actually very similar to
a checkbox list control especially the
repeat Direction repeat columns and
repeat layout properties let's flip to
visual studio let's drag and drop a
radio button list control and we know
that just like any other list control a
radio button list control is also a
collection of list item objects and
these list item objects can be added in
the HTML source or programmatically so
let's use this radio button list to
display a list of favorite colors okay
and I want the user to select only one
favorite color
and by default if you look
this the items are arranged in vertical
layout if you want to change that to
horizontal layout then we can make use
of repeat Direction property by default
the repeated Direction is vertical so if
we change that to horizontal
you know the items are arranged in a
horizontal layout and then we have this
repeat columns and again this was very
similar to a checkbox list control by
default at zero which means all the list
items are shown in one column but if I
want them to be spread across two
columns I can change that to two and
they were they are spread across two
columns now let's put it back to zero
okay another interesting property is the
table you know repeat layout property
and if you look at this property it
takes four value stable flow unordered
list and order list let's look at each
of them now by default the repeat layout
is stable and if I run this as it stands
what's going to happen if you look at
this there are four colors here and
which meaning for radio button list
items if I right click on this webform
and then view source okay look at the
HTML that is generated now the we are
actually using here a table to display
you know this radio button list okay and
the reason why it's doing that is
because you have set the repeat layout
to use table okay on the other hand if I
set that to flow and if I run this
what's going to happen it doesn't use
the table if you view the HTML source so
right click view source look at that
it's not using the table now to present
these radio buttons okay so the other
options that we have are
you know unordered less let's pin this
down so unordered list now look at this
the moment I change this to unordered
list I'm going to get an error so there
was an error rendering the control the
unordered list and ordered list layouts
only support vertical layout which means
in they repeat direction you have to set
that to vertical to use this unordered
list and ordered list repeat layouts
okay so unordered list the name says
it's an unordered list which shows you
know the bulleted points so if we run
this now you know these radio button
list items will be generated along with
that you know bullets there if you want
numbers instead of bullets then I just
use ordered lists so now if we run this
obviously as you can see here it's
rendering the numbers okay but keep in
mind the ordered list and the unordered
list
repeat layout can be used only when the
repeat Direction is vertical okay
let's put this back to table and let's
change the repeat direction to
horizontal all right so now let's do a
quick demo you know where we select
these radio buttons and then I want to
view the text value and index and this
is very much similar to a drop-down list
because if you remember in a drop-down
list you can select only one item and
the same is the case with a radio button
list you can select only one item from
the radio button list okay so obviously
if you are able to select only one item
there is no point in looping through
each list item object within the radio
button list all you can do to select the
text value and index you can use the
selected item property and selected
index property of the radio button list
okay so let's drag and drop a button so
whenever I click this button we want to
retrieve the selected item text value
and index and how do we do that response
dot right
so text is equal to radio button list 1
dot selected item dot text and if you
remember from the previous sessions of
this video series if the user has not
selected any item then the selected item
you know when you try to retrieve the
text property of the selected item you
know when it is null then a null
reference exception is will be thrown so
to avoid that you can actually check if
the selected item is not now or you can
also use radio button list 1 dot
selected index not equal to minus 1 we
have talked about that when we are
discussing our list box control okay so
we have the text we want the value and
the index so the value is equal to radio
button 1 list 1 dot selected item dot
value and if we want the index dot
selected index since that is an integer
let's use two string method to convert
that to string and to have this properly
displayed when it renders on the page
put an HTML break there
all right so now if we run this as you
might expect when we click that button
you know it will show us the selected
items text value okay so red on the
other hand if I select look at that as
soon as I select the radio button it
clears the one or the other one which is
already selected that's because radio
button selections are mutually exclusive
okay fine now let's say I want to
uncheck this you know by I selected this
option but I don't want to select any of
these options and I want to simply you
know don't want to select any of these
radio buttons now is it possible now the
only way to make that possible is run
the page once again or navigate navigate
away from that page and navigate to that
page back you know you will have them
unselected okay but then on the page is
there a way you know once if I select it
there's no way I can select that but we
can do that programmatically probably we
can provide them with a button control
you know and then they can click that
button to remove all the selections so
if you look at this one there is a
button called clear selection and this
is going to clear all the selections you
know that you made
so let's program that now so let's drag
and drop a button control onto the
webform and let's change the text of
that one to clear selection
okay double-click that the even handler
gets generated now again keep in mind
you know to clear the selection the
easiest way is radio button list one
that's selected index is equal to minus
one and there are a lot of people I have
seen in a lot of articles on the
internet you know people actually
looping through each list item
you know they lot of people does this
for each list item a lie-in radio button
list 1 dot items so they loop through
each list item and then they say if Ally
dot selected and what they do is Li dot
you know selected as equal to false do
we really have to write so much of code
now with this kind of a code there are
two problems one it's more code two you
are unnecessarily looping through each
list item object okay so the best way is
to simply set the selected index to
minus one no matter which item the user
has selected the moment you set the in
selected index to minus one it's not
going to select anything within that
radio button list so let's run this now
and see in action if it's working as
expected
okay select that click this button okay
green my it's my selection and then the
moment I click clear my selection look
at that nothing is selected there on
