this video we'll discuss throttling in
WCF with an example let's create a
simple WCF service let's flip to visual
studio let's create a new class library
project and let's call it simple service
let's delete this class 1 dot CS file
that's auto-generated to this project
let's add a new item and we want to add
WCF service and let's call this the PCF
service simple service and let's change
this operation contract to one-way
operation and to do that we set is
one-way equals true and let's provide
the implementation for this to work
operation contract
let's bring end systems or threading
namespace and let's make the current
thread that's executing this operation
contract sleep for 1,000 milliseconds
that is one second and then let's print
a message on to the console and the
message is this so thread whatever
thread that is executing the current
request we are going to print the thread
ID in this location of zero so thread
processing request at you know the date
and time so we are going to print the
date and time here so to get the current
thread ID we use the thread class thread
current red dot managed thread ID so
that property should give us the thread
ID and to get the current date in time
we simply use daytime now all right so
that's our WCF service very simple one
now to host this WCF service let's use a
console application so to the solution
let's add a new project and we want to
add a console application and let's call
this host first of all to this host
project we need to add a reference to
this WCF service and a reference to
system dot cir
model assembly so let's go and do the
ads let's add a reference to that
project and add a reference to system
load service model assembly and then to
this project we also need to add the
configuration file so let's add a new
item and we want to add application
config file and here we need to specify
the configuration to host the WCF
service so let's copy the config and
paste it right here we discuss this
configuration several videos in the
previous sessions so I'm not going to go
into the details of it at the moment we
are using basic HTTP binding that is the
address at which this WCF service is
available and that's the contract and
this is the base address baby can
retrieve the metadata for this WCF
service and within program dot CS file
we need to write you know the
corresponding code to host the WCF
service so we need to bring in system
block service model namespace and again
math type this code in the interest of
time so let's copy and paste it right
there within the main method alright
let's set our host at the start of
project and run the WCF service by
pressing control f5 ok so at this point
we have our WCF service up and running
let's go ahead and create a client for
this WCF service the client is going to
be a console application so let's create
a new project of type console
application and let's call this client
the first thing that we need to do is to
add a reference to RWC of service and if
you recollect from the config our WCF
service is available at this URL that's
the base address localhost 8080 click go
so that should discover a simple service
specify the namespace so I'm going to
use simple service as the namespace
click OK so within the main method let's
create an instance of the proxy class so
simple service dot simple service client
client equals new simple service client
let's bring in system threading
namespace now what we are going to do
here is create multiple threads and then
make them responsible for executing the
do work operation of this WCF service
okay so I'm going to use a for loop here
so for end I equals 1 I less than or
equal to 100 that means we are going to
create 100 threads here okay
so let's create a thread let's call it
thread equals new thread and we won't
dress this thread to execute to work
operation of the WCF service and let's
say thread dot start all right now at
the moment we haven't specified you know
the service instance context mode and
the concurrency mode let's go ahead and
specify that for our WCF service and to
specify that we use the service behavior
attribute and then we set instance
context mode let's set instance context
mode to pair call and let's set
concurrency mode to multiple
alright let's close the service host
that's running let's run this service
host once again and let's go to the
client let's run our client and look at
this once we have run our client notice
that there are multiple tests that are
being executed you know at the moment ok
let let's fill it allow this to complete
and notice that at you know 18 22 36 at
that time there are 4 threads 4 3 5 &amp;amp; 6
you know these threads are currently
executing on the do work operation okay
but then at 37 look at that there are
more threads may be around you know six
to seven of them at 38 there are even
more okay so basically at the moment we
don't have control on how many
concurrent calls are being executed now
if we intend to control that we can use
the throttling settings okay in the
previous video sessions we discussed
what we mean by throughput but let's
quickly review it throughput is nothing
but the amount of work done in a given
time and in the previous video sessions
we discussed our service instance
context mode and the concurrency mode
can influence the to put that we get in
fact we looked at several examples okay
so in addition to instance context mode
and concurrency mode throttling settings
also influence the throughput of AWC of
service throttling settings can be
specified either in the config file or
in code and here you see an example of
how to specify throttling settings in
config file so it's a service behavior
so we use service behaviors and we use
this section that is service throttling
and obviously notice that there are
several attributes max concurrent calls
max concurrent instances and max
concurrent sessions the names of the
attributes are self-explanatory max
concurrent calls is how many concurrent
calls a process at maximum that is 3
similarly max concurrent instances ok
and max concurrent sessions right and if
we want to specify
settings within code then we use service
throttling behavior class we create an
instance of that class and notice that
this class has got you know three
properties the same three properties max
concurrent calls concurrent instances
and concurrent sessions once we have the
instance of that class we then add it to
the behaviors collection property you
know that's available on the description
property of the host object okay all
right so we can either specify the
throttling settings either in config
file or within application code
programmatically now at the moment we
didn't specify any throttling settings
and that's the reason why we are not
able to control how many calls are
processed concurrently the maximum for
example
okay now let's specify throttling
settings for this WCF service so here
notice that we have behaviors section so
we already have a service behavior
called max behavior which is going to
allow you know metadata exchange in
addition to that behavior let's also
specify service throttling behavior so
service throttling and notice that we
have got those three attributes let's
set max content calls to three max
concurrent instances to three and max
concurrent sessions maybe to 100 all
right so we have the WCF service still
running let's close that
let's also close that client let's run
our WCF service host and then let's run
our client so now look at the service
host window look at that at 18 26 11
seconds only three concurrent calls a
process similarly at 12 3 13 3 so notice
that every one second at the maximum
only three concurrent calls are being
processed okay that's because we have
limited the number of concurrent cause
you know that can be processed using
throttling settings right and these are
the three properties that we have used
max concurrent calls max concurrent
instances and max can
sessions now obviously with the above
with these three with these throttling
settings at the maximum of three
concurrent calls a process we have seen
that in action now in addition to max
concurrent calls property max concurrent
instances and max concurrent sessions
may also impact the number of calls
processed concurrently okay let's look
at an example now let's say we have this
scenario at the moment we have set max
concurrent calls to three let's change
max concurrent instances to two let's
actually close this service host and the
client that are already running so let's
set max concurrent instances to do and
let's leave max concurrent sessions at
100 now with a pair call instance
context mode only two calls are
processed concurrently and why is that
that's basically because with per call
instance context mode every call
requires a new service instance and with
this setting max concurrent instance is
equal to two with that throttling
setting we are allowing only a maximum
of two concurrent instances to be
created at any given point of time so in
spite of having this max concurrent
calls to three since we have set max
concurrent instances to do with per call
only a maximum of two requests I mean
two concurrent requests are processed
okay let's actually look at that in
action so if you look at our WCF service
notice that max concurrent instance is a
set to two and the instance context mode
is per call so let's go ahead and run
order Bishop service and let's run the
client and now if you look at the hosts
window look at that every second only
two requests are being processed and
currently in spite of having max
concurrent calls to three that's because
here are max concurrent instances is
influencing the number of concurrent
calls because we are limiting that just
to gesture to you know it'll only
process two concurrent calls because
with per call every request results in a
new service instance
right now with the same configuration if
we were to use single instance context
mode then three calls a processed
concurrently and why is that that's
because with a single turn service there
is only one service instance which is
going to handle all the requests from
all the clients okay with singleton
instance context mode the max concurrent
instances property is actually
irrelevant because at any point of time
you know at the maximum we'll only have
one service instance and that's going to
be responsible for handling all the
requests from all the clients okay so
let's quickly change that to a nun with
another simple service let's change this
to single and let's run Oh WCF service
okay so the service is up let's run the
client so we expect now three requests
to be processed look at that every
second three concurrent requests our
requests are processed and please note
this max concurrent sessions we haven't
discussed more about it but then this
max concurrent sessions is the sum of
all sessions and WCF we've got different
types of sessions that is application
transport reliable and secure sessions
so basically you know when we specify
this max concurrent sessions keep in
mind it's the sum of all those types of
sessions so relatively that number will
be much higher when we compare that with
the other our two attributes and if you
are interested in default here are the
defaults they change with the version of
wucf that we are working with before WCF
4.0 max concurrent calls you know if we
don't specify the throttling settings
explicitly either in the config file or
in the application code programmatically
then these are the defaults max
concurrent calls 16 max concurrent
sessions 10 and max concurrent instances
is the sum of max concurrent calls and
max concurrent sessions before WCF 4.0
it's going to be 26
because max concurrent calls
sixteen and concessions is ten okay with
WCF 4.0 and later this is how it has
changed that's it for today thank you
for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
