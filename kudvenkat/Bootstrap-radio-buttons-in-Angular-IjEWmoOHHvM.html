tutorial in this video well disk is
working with radio buttons and angular
template event forms so here is what we
want to do we want to include gender
radio buttons within our create employee
form when we select the gender of an
employee using one of these radio
buttons we want the selected radio
button value to be part of the angular
generated phone model along the same
lines and we click the Save button
we want the select a gender value to be
logged to the browser console at the
moment on our create employee form we
have full name and email form controls
along with both of them we also need
gender radio buttons so let's flip to
visual studio code and within our create
employee component view template let's
make a copy of this email form group and
then we'll change the bits that are
required so first of all we want to
change the label here to gender because
we want to display gender radio buttons
we don't want the four attributes so I'm
going to get rid of that from there and
then inside this div I'm going to create
another div and I'm going to use a
different class here
so this is going to be form control
again this is bootstrap CSS class for
styling and let's move this input
element inside that there and this is
going to be let's actually get rid of
all these attributes and then use the
attributes that are required for our
radio button to get a radio button we
use input type radio' and we wound this
to have a value of male so but this
value attribute is required because this
is what is posted to the server when we
submit our form so inside this
development with class form control we
have an input radio button and we also
want a label and let's move the closing
label right here so inside the label we
have our radio button and we want this
label to display male
okay so this is the text that will be
displayed against this male radio button
the value is male with a lowercase M and
this is the text that is displayed to
the user
now to get another radio button for
female so let's make a copy of that and
let's change the text here to female and
obviously we also have to change the
corresponding value and then we want
these radio buttons to be displayed next
to each other in line so I'm going to
use a clasp on this label and this is
going to be radio - in line that's - the
same thing on the other radio button
label save our changes and then take a
look at the browser notice we have the
gender radio buttons as expected but
there are two problems and I select
gender notice it's not part of the
Anglet generated phone model when I type
into the email phone control as part of
the generated phone model and similarly
full name is but this gender is not the
second problem is these radio buttons
are not mutually exclusive meaning I can
select both of them at the same time and
that's not the behavior we want we want
these radio buttons to be mutually
exclusive to make them mutually
exclusive all we have to do is include
name attribute on both the radio buttons
and set them both to the same value in
this case we have set it to gender so
both these radio buttons are part of the
same group which makes them mutually
exclusive now notice when I select male
and then if I try to select female the
other radio button is automatically
selected so that's the behavior we want
we still have the second problem that is
this gender is not part of this angular
generated phone model to make it part of
the angle generated phone model all we
have to do is include ng model directly
on both these radio buttons let's save
our changes and then take a look at the
browser the form is reloading notice
when I select
the selected gender value is part of the
Anglet generated form model as expected
now let's launch browser developer tools
fill in full name and email as well and
then click the Save button we have the
form log to the console if we scroll
down a bit and then take a look at the
value property its value is an object
and when we expand that we see the
gender property value logged to the
console
now let's include another textbox to
capture the employee phone number since
it's a text box it's going to be very
similar to email form group so let's
paste that here and then change the bits
that are required so first of all that
text here has to say phone number and
then let's give this input element an ID
let's call it phone number yes that's
what we are capturing here and then this
label is for this input element so let's
change the four attribute to phone
number and along the same lines let's
actually bring the rest of the
properties right here to the next line
so ng-model
is also going to be phone number name is
also phone number let's save our changes
and then take a look at the browser
notice we have the phone number text box
displayed as expected now we won't
include another field on our form and
I'm going to call it contact preference
and the contact preference can be either
email or phone number so we want another
set of radio buttons just like gender so
I'm going to paste in some HTML here for
contact preference set of radio buttons
and this HTML is very similar to gender
so I'm going to save the changes and
then let's take another look at the
browser notice we have our contact
preference radio buttons as well so as
we type into these form controls look at
what happens to the angler
auto-generated phone model
first of all name is included in the
form model similarly email and then
phone number
set it to one two three four five and
then our contact preference not his
contact preferences email when the email
radio button is selected similarly when
I select phone
let's phone and gender also works the
same way and when we click this Save
button it should have been logged to the
console so let's launch browse the
developer tools notice we have the form
let's expand that scroll down and then
we should have the value property which
is an object let's expand that and we
can see all our properties contact
preference email full name gender phone
number so we've just seen how to work
with radio buttons in angular here is
the HTML for these two gender radio
buttons thank you for listening and have
a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
