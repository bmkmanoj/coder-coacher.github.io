in this video we'll discuss a simple
JavaScript closure example this is the
example that we want to implement every
time we click a button on a webpage we
want to increment the click count by 1
there are several ways we can do this in
JavaScript one of the ways is by using a
global variable here I have an empty
asp.net web application project to this
project let's add an HTML page to keep
things simple I'm going to delete all of
this auto-generated HTML and include
this script tag let's set the type
attribute to text slash JavaScript and
here let's create a variable let's name
it click count and initialize this to 0
now let's include an HTML button type
equals button value equals click may an
on click of this button we want to
increment this variable value by 1 and
then display that incremented value
within JavaScript alert
let's run the page and see if the click
count gets incremented we click the
button the first time notice that the
value is 1 click it the second time
value is 2 click a third time value is 3
so every time we click the button the
click count gets incremented as expected
for the problem with this approach is
that here click count is a global
variable that means any script on the
page can access this variable and change
its value accidentally we don't want
that to happen we want to protect this
variable to protect the variable we can
make it a local variable within a
function so let's see that approach now
so I'm going to create a function here
let's name this function increment click
count
notice that this variable is now present
inside this function so no other script
on this page can access this variable
the only way to change this variable
value is by calling this function and
this function is going to increment the
click count value by 1 and then return
that value and unclick off this button
let's call this increment click count
function let's run this click the button
the first time notice that value is 1
click it second time notice that the
value is still 1 click at the time
notice that the value is still 1 why is
that why is the value not being
incremented beyond 1 every time we click
the button we are calling increment
click count function and with an
increment click count function we have
these two lines of code so every time
this function is called click count is
reset to zero and then it gets
incremented by one and that value is
returned so that's the reason no matter
how many times you click the button it's
not incremented beyond 1 to solve this
we can use a closure so what's a closure
a closure is an inner function that has
access to the outer functions variables
and parameters in addition to its own
variables and parameters and global
variables in
very simple term we can say a closure is
a function inside another function these
functions that is the inner and outer
functions could be named functions or
anonymous functions let's see how to use
a JavaScript closure to solve this click
count problem in our example we are
going to make use of anonymous functions
that is both the inner and outer
functions are going to be anonymous
functions now what's an anonymous
function anonymous function is a
function that does not have any name now
we can convert this function right here
to an anonymous function simply by
removing the name at the moment this
function has this variable click count
which is initialized to 0 I am going to
have another anonymous function inside
the outer anonymous function and this
inner anonymous function is going to
increment the click count by 1 and
return that value now I'm going to wrap
this entire code within a pair of
parentheses and I'm going to use another
pair of parentheses so what does this
additional pair of parentheses going to
do this is going to make the outer
anonymous function here a self invoking
function and whatever result we get they
are going to assign that we are variable
let's name this variable increment click
count and on click of the button we are
invoking this function so since we are
assigning a function expression to a
variable this one this variable now can
be used as a function for the time being
let's remove the parentheses and run the
webpage now when we click the button
notice what we get back what we get back
is the inner function expression so
what's happening here so when this
increment click count function is called
you know it's going to automatically
execute the
outter anonymous function and it's going
to set click count value to zero and
keep in mind the outer anonymous
function gets executed only once and
this inner function will have access
this to this click count variable so
click count is initialized to zero and
the outer function executes only once
and every time we click the button this
inner function is going to increment
click count so when we include the pair
of parentheses here the inner function
will be executed that means it is going
to increment click count by one every
time we click the button so let's run
this click the button the first time
notice that the value is 1 click it
second time value is 2 click a third
time value is 3 now the interesting
thing to keep in mind is that this click
count variable is present inside this
function that means no the script on
this page will have access to this click
count variable the only way to change
this variable is by calling this
increment click count function thank you
for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
