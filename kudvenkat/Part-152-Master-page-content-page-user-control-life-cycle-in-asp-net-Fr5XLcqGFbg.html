this video we'll discuss the order of
events execution when we have a Content
page with a master page and a user
control let's understand this with an
example let's flip to visual studio here
I have a blank asp.net webforms
application first let's add a user
control and let's name it test user
control let's include an h1 tag within
this user control and let's just say
this is a test user control let's now
add a master page and let's call this
side master first of all let's get rid
of this content placeholder that's there
within the head section and in the
code-behind file let's include even
handler methods for page in it and page
pre-render as well so let's call this
page in it so this is page
initialization even handler method page
load even handler method and let's also
have page pre Linda even handler method
now within the page initialization let's
just say that spawns dot write since
this is masterbate let's say master page
init event and let's include an HTML
break as well and let's say this is
master page load event and this is
master page pre-render event
alright now let's right click on this
master page and add a content page so
this should add of a form 1 dot aspx so
within this waveform 1 dot aspx we have
this content control inside this content
control let's drag and drop maybe a
textbox control let's actually flip this
platform 1 to the design mode
and then let's drag and drop a text box
control and then let's drag and drop our
user control from the solution Explorer
so here we have the test user control
let's drag and drop it onto a web form
so we have our test user control here so
if you flip the web form to the source
mode notice that when we dragged and
drop the user control onto the web form
it has automatically generated that
register directive for us so here we go
we have a text box control and then HTML
break and a user control all right now
let's associate three even handler
methods for this text box control so on
in it own load and on pre-render in a
similar fashion let's have the same
event handler methods associated for the
user control in a bit we'll implement
the even handler methods and specify
their names here okay all right so now
let's get to the code behind file of
this content page
so within the code-behind file we have
page load event just for let's have
let's actually copy the code that we
already have within the master page and
paste it within our content page now
since this is the content page let's
change this text to instead of master
let's say content so content page in it
event content page load event and
content page pre then the event in a
similar fashion let's have the
respective even handler methods for the
textbox and user control that we have on
this content page that is this text box
one control and this test use control
one
so let's paste it here so I'm paste and
get six times and we'll just change the
name of the even handler method
okay so let's call this maybe text box
one init event so this is going to be
textbox in it event and let's change
this text box one underscore load and
this is going to be textbox a load event
similarly textbox pre-render event so
textbox pre-render event and then we
have a user control so test use a
control in it event so let's say user
control in it event
and this is going to be test can test
user control load so use the control
load event and finally pre-render for
test user control so user control please
end the event all that is left now is to
associate this even handler methods with
the respective events in the aspx okay
so for textbox what is the name of the a
native and it's called textbox one
underscore in it so let's copy that and
specify that right here
so textbox one underscore in it this one
is called Xbox one underscore load and
for pre render it is textbox one
underscore pre-render and similarly for
the user control test user control
underscore in it is the name of the
event handler method so test user
control underscore load and for
pre-render that's going to be pre render
all right so with all these changes
let's actually go ahead and run this and
see in what order the events get fired
so if you look at the code behind file
of the content page we have even handler
methods for the content page the textbox
control and the user control and within
the master page we have even handler
method for the master page
initialization load and pre-render
alright so let's go ahead and run this
and see the order of execution in action
okay look at this now textbox
initialization event
user control initialization event and
then master page content page
initialization event so the
initialization events are occurring from
the innermost control to the outermost
control now what do we mean by in the
most control and outermost control and
look at this
so this waveform 1 dot aspx this is the
content page now the controls that is
the textbox control and user control
they are present these controls are
present on this content page so the
innermost controls here are text box and
you know this test user control because
they are present inside this content
page now along with this content page we
also have a master page okay so at
runtime this master page and content
page are actually merged into one thing
and that's how we get the layout of the
master page and the content of the
content page okay when the page is
rendered but then is the content page
merged into the master page or is the
master page merged into the content page
what actually happens now here is the
answer for that you know keep in mind
that the master page is merged into the
content page and that master page cont
is actually treated as a control in the
content page and this merging process
happens during the initialization stage
of the page processing so basically a
master page is also just like another
control on the content page so if you
look at this waveform one dot aspx at
the moment you know this content page is
the outer most control and within this
content page we have this content
control okay and look at what this
content control is pointing to it's
pointing to the content placeholder on
the master page and keep in mind at the
initialization stage of the page
processing the master page is actually
merged into this content page okay and
that's how we get the layout that we
have in the master page okay and you
know just like these control
the master pages also another control
within the content page okay so here the
innermost controls are these two and
then we have the master page itself and
then the content page the outermost
control is the content page okay and
then one rule of thumb that we have to
keep in mind is this the initialization
events are raised from the innermost
control to the outermost one and all the
other events are raised from the
outermost control to the innermost one
so here
the initialization events of this page
you know the init events and look at
this they are raised from the innermost
control to the outermost control textbox
and user controls are the controls on
the content page master page is also
like a control on the content page and
then we have the content page itself so
the inlet event is raised from the
innermost control to the outermost
control but look at the load event and
pre then the emailed load event is
raised from the outermost control to the
innermost control so from content page
then master page then text box and user
control
similarly pre-render also content page
master page text box and user control
okay now look at this why is this text
box even firing before the user control
you know the order of these innermost
controls is dictated by the order in
which they are present on our content
page look at this here first we have the
text box control and then the user
control that's why you know the entity
event of text box is fired before the
entity event of user control if you want
the user control init event to be fired
first then probably we'll have to switch
the order in which they are present on
the web form so possibly what we can do
here is take this text box control and
put this after the user control let's
include an HTML break here and let's get
rid of this white space all right now
let's go ahead and run this and see in
what order the events get fired look at
this here text box in it event and use
control in at a bend and look at here
user control in at the event and textbox
in at event okay so basically for the
innermost control the order depends on
the order in which you know these
controls are laid out on the form all
right so basically in general the rule
of thumb is that the initialization
events are raised from the innermost
control to the outermost one and all the
other events are raised from the
outermost control to the innermost one
now two of our valuable YouTube channel
subscribers will ask the defaulting
question in interview we have a master
page content page and the user control
with the events that you can see here
master in it and master load content in
it and content load user control in it
and use a control load when we're on the
page containing the fo events in what
sequence these are processed or fired
obviously from what we have seen so far
the order is going to be this one use a
control in it master a net content in it
and then content loadmaster load user
control and why is that that's because
in general the initialization events are
raised from the inner most control to
the auto most control and all the other
events are raised from the outer most
control to the inner most control
alright that's it for today thank you
for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
