this video we'll discuss using
dictionary object in c-sharp this is
continuation to part 72 so please watch
about 72 before proceeding with this
video in this video we'll discuss these
four methods try get value count remove
and clear below so discuss using link
extension methods with dictionary and
finally we'll look at different ways to
convert an array into a dictionary let's
flip to visual studio we'll be using the
same example that we started in part 72
so here we have a customer class with
three auto implemented properties and in
the main method we are creating three
instances of that customer class and
then we created a dictionary and we
added these customer objects as values
within the dictionary and the respect to
customer IDs as keys now let's look at
using this try get value function first
of all when do we use this function if
you're not sure if the dictionary
contains a specific K that's when we use
this function and what does this try get
value function returns as the name
States it's going to return a value that
is associated with a key there are
several ways to do that in the previous
session you know we discussed one of the
ways to get a value that is associated
with it with a specific key is by using
you know something like this so look at
this when we pass this key 1:01 you know
what is it going to return it's going to
retain a customer object because this
dictionary contains I mean the value
within this dictionary is a customer so
we get a customer back this is one way
but then if I use this approach and if
that key doesn't exist within the
dictionary then we are going to get an
exception so if you're not sure you know
if the dictionary contains a specific
key and if that key doesn't exist if you
don't want to get an exception then use
try get value so let's see using try get
value function if you notice this try
get value function it expects two
parameters the first parameter is the
key okay so I want to get the value for
this K so that's going to be the first
parameter and if that key is
and you know the second parameter look
at the parameter type its customer okay
because the value within the bit in this
dictionary is customer okay so the type
is customer here so whatever parameter
that we are going to pass here is going
to receive the value that is associated
with that key okay and notice that it's
an output parameter okay because we are
going to get the value back we are not
going to give it a value but we are
going to get to get a value so let's go
ahead and create a an object reference
variable of type customer and then let's
pass it as a second parameter so this
reference variable is going to receive
the value that is associated with that
key and since this is an output
parameter we have to have out keyword in
front of that okay and notice the return
type of this function from the
intellisense what is it returning it's
returning a boolean meaning it true or
false if there is a key 1:01 within the
dictionary then this method is going to
return true okay since the return type
is boolean we can use this in an if
condition okay so if this key is found
this function is going to return true
and this parameter is going to receive
the value that is associated with that
key in that case we want to print the
details associated with that customer so
I want to print their ID their name
and their salary
so where are we going to get the idea
from from the customer objects of
customer ID customer dot name and
customer dot salary all right now if
this key doesn't exist in the dictionary
then what's going to happen this
function will return false and this
parameter will be now okay so in that
case we want to print a message stating
the key does not exist within the
dictionary maybe the key is not found
all right now do we have an item with
that key within the dictionary yes we do
in fact the first object has got ID 1 0
1 so let's go ahead and run this and see
if we get the output that we expect ok
look at that we have the details of that
customer ok now on the other hand if I
pass something like 1 1 1 we don't have
an item with that key so it should come
to the else block and say that T is not
fun but the important thing to keep in
mind here is we don't get an exception
all right now let's look at using this
count function first of all when do we
use this function now as the name States
if you want to find the total count of
all the items that is present within the
dictionary then we use that count
function actually there are two ways to
find the total number of elements that
are present in a dictionary one has to
use the count property so this
dictionary class exposes a property
count property and look at the return
type its integer so it's going to return
the total number of items within the
dictionary so let's say we want to print
something like total items equals
so now as you might expect when we done
this we should get to the lightens equal
three
so here we are using this count property
and this is defined within the
dictionary class itself now instead of
using count property I can also use
count function okay now where is this
count function present it's actually
present in a different namespace so if I
right click on that and if I go to the
definition look at that this is first of
all an extension method look at that
it's a static method and the first
parameter is of type this and this third
should be present in a static class so
this is definitely an extension method
on ienumerable class and look at the
namespace its present in system dot line
meaning this is a link extension method
so we are using a link extension method
on a dictionary object so when we run
this we should get the same output total
items equals three now there are two
overloaded versions of this count
function the one that we have just used
you know doesn't take any parameters but
there is the second overloaded version
where we can specify a predicate okay
and let's say for example I want to find
the total count of employees where the
salary of the employees is greater than
4000 okay now if you look at the
customers that we have here there are
two employees whose salary is greater
than 4000 customer 1 and customer 2 so I
want to find the count of all such
employees and we can very easily achieve
that using this count function okay now
look at this we are using an extension
method on this dictionary and then we
are going to pass a predicate here okay
now since we are using this count
function on a dictionary you know when I
say key value pair here so key value
pair such that key value pair dot so
basically what we are doing is we are
passing you know this predicate here ok
so what I want to do is we are using
this count function on this dictionary
so we are going to get a key value pair
access to the key value pair
that is present within the dictionary
object and we want to find the value so
what is value value is nothing but the
customer object itself so and then this
value will have all the properties of
the customer so ID name salary because
this value itself is nothing but a
customer object now what we want to do
is you know key value pairs such that
key value pair dot value dot salary
should be greater than 4000 so if this
condition evaluates to true then that
employee will be included in the count
otherwise he will be excluded so when we
run this we should get the total count
as two because we have only two
employees whose salary is greater than
4000 similarly you can include any
condition you want maybe you know I want
the count of all employees whose name
starts with maybe letter s you know you
can give any condition so any expression
that you give here should have to
evaluate to true you know if that has to
be included in the count if it evaluates
to false then it will be excluded from
the count all right now let's discuss
using remove function so anytime you
want to remove an item from a dictionary
then you use remove function so
obviously let's say at the moment this
dictionary has got you know three items
and let's say I want to remove an item
which has got this key one one zero and
to do that they simply say dictionary
customers dot remove and then you
specify the key of the item so one one
zero should remove that from the
dictionary okay what is going to happen
if I specify a key that does not exist
basically if the item with that key
doesn't exist then you wouldn't get an
exception and nothing happens so that's
fine all right so the next function that
we discuss is clear now if you want to
remove all items from the dictionary so
remove will remove one item from the
dictionary but if you want to remove all
items from the dictionary then you use
clear so when you use clear look at the
intellisense it states remove all keys
and value
from the dictionary so it's going to
remove everything okay and then we have
seen using link extension methods with
dictionary and finally let's look at the
different ways to convert an array into
dictionary now at the moment we have you
know we can get rid of this dictionary
so at the moment we have created three
customer objects here now let's create a
customer array so customer and let's
call this maybe customers equals new
customer array and I want to whole let's
say three elements within that array
okay so we can basically say customers
of 0 equals customer 1 and similarly
within the first location we want to
store customer 2 and then here maybe
customer 3 ok now we have an array here
now can we convert an array into a
dictionary absolutely all you need to do
is on that object so customers dot -
dictionary look at that you have this -
dictionary method so simply call this -
dictionary method and then obviously
when you want to convert an array into a
dictionary or let's say for example when
you want to create a dictionary there
are two things that you need to specify
what is the key for the dictionary and
what is the value ok so obviously when
we are converting an array into a
dictionary we need to specify that as
well so all the objects that I have in
this array I want to convert them into a
dictionary type ok so here the customer
objects is stored in an array but I want
now to store them in a dictionary and
obviously when if we want to create a
dictionary we need to specify the K and
the value okay now so here I'm saying so
each employee or customer such that the
ID is going to be I mean the key is
going to be ID of the customer and then
I am saying value
is going to be customer okay so here
basically what we are saying is the key
is going to be customer ID and the value
is going to be customer object itself
okay so now let's actually loop through
let's so this to dictionary is going to
return a dictionary back
so let's store that in a dictionary so
the key is going to be integer and the
value is going to be of type customer
and let's call this maybe dictionary
okay
now let's say if we have caught all the
items within that dictionary and to
verify that let's use a for each loop so
for eat so what's the dictionary again
dictionary is a collection of key value
pairs so we're going to say for each key
value pair integer and customer and
let's call it kvp in our dictionary so
in this dictionary now we are going to
have the customer ID as the key and a
customer object itself as the value okay
and we are looping through each item
within the dictionary so let's say
console dot readline we want to print
the key and values so key equals and how
do we get the key from this variable kb
p dot key should give us that and then
obviously value within the dictionary is
a customer object so let's create a
customer object and maybe let's call
this past equals KB P dot value should
return a customer object back and then
maybe we want to print their ID name and
salary so ID equals a placeholder there
so plus the dot ID first name and
finally plus dot salary so now let's run
this and look at that we get the output
so it's very easy to convert an array
into a dictionary not only array you can
even convert a list of customers okay
let's say for example instead of this
customers array I have a list of
customers so let's create a list of
customer
and then obviously to add items to the
list we use add method so let's call it
customers dot ad and let's make a copy
of this so we want to add customer one
object customer to object and customer
three object
now this customers is actually a list
but we are using essentially the same
syntax to convert the list to a
dictionary so if I go ahead and run this
now we should get the same output all
right that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
