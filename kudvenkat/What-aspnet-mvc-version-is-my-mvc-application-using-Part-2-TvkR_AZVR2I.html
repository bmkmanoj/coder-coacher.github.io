am venket this is part 2 of a SP dotnet
MVC tutorial in this video we'll discuss
about how to determine what version of
asp.net MVC is being used to buy an
existing MVC application in part 1 of
this video series we discussed about
different MVC versions that are
available as of today we have MVC two
MVC 3 and MVC 4 now let's say on my
computer I have several existing asp.net
MVC applications now how do I determine
which version of MVC is being used by
each of these applications that's what
we are going to discuss in this video
let's flip to visual studio let's create
an MVC application so click on file new
project and let's select MVC - web
application and let's name it MVC -
application click OK and it's going to
ask you whether you want to create a
unit test project for now I'm going to
say no do not create a unit test project
click OK it's going to create an MVC 2
application for us let's go to the other
visual studio that's open and now let's
select file new project and then now
let's select MVC 3 web application and
let's name it MVC 3 application click OK
now select the template you know an
empty template and then the view engine
has raised a view engine we'll talk
about what are these few engines in a
later video session so click OK now
let's go to the other visual studio
which is open and let's create another
project and this time let's create an
MVC for application and let's call this
MVC for application click OK select
empty template and raise the view engine
click OK so now we have three MVC
applications on my computer now if you
look at the name it's called MVC 2
application but in reality we wouldn't
name our applications as such we would
give them more meaningful names
depending on what they do but here you
know just for our identification we have
given it as
dc2 application but just imagine if this
application were to use a different name
then how do I tell which version of MVC
was used to build this application we
can do it in two ways you know we can we
can identify that at design time if you
want to identify that at design time
what you can do is go to solution
Explorer expand that references folder
and then within references folder you
should see something called system dot
Web dot MVC right click on that and
select properties and look at the
version of MVC here too which means we
have used MVC to to build this MVC
application similarly if I go to MVC
three application to get that MVC three
application and then if I go to
references folder and then look at
system dot web dot MVC go to the
properties look at that version is three
and then if I go to MVC for application
expand references folder system dot web
dot MVC right click on that go to
properties look at the version it's four
so we know how to figure that out at
design time now if I want to achieve
that programmatically is that possible
absolutely and this is how you do that
you use reflection so you you you know
look at the controller will talk about
controllers in detail in a later video
session you know but I can use something
called the controller in MVC Model View
controller you know C is controller so
controller and get the type of it and
then dot i use the assembly property and
invoke get name function and then dot
version is going to give you the version
of MVC that was used to build this
application and to quickly identify that
let's go to for example you know this
MVC to application here look at this at
the moment this controller action method
I mean this index function which in this
within this home controller class is
returning action results but for now
let's say it's gonna return string will
talk about these controller action
methods in a very great detail in a
later video session and what I'm going
to do here is I'm going to say return
and then I'm going to use that code that
you have seen on the slide controller
and I'm going to get the type of that
so type of controller and then oh let's
type off dot we can get the assembly dot
get name and then dot version look at
that and then convert that to string
that's it so if I go ahead and run this
now when the web application renders it
should show me the version of MVC that
was used to build this application and
that's at runtime so the waveform is
loading we can do that 210 BC 3 and MVC
for applications as well the same code
no difference let's quickly do it for
MVC 3 if you look at MVC 3 application
at the moment you don't have any
controllers in the folder so we need to
add a controller will talk about
controllers in a great detail in our
next video session so I'm going to say
add that controller and let's call it
home controller and add that should add
a controller class in a function within
that and look at that I have this index
function and similarly I'm going to
return a string and I'm going to go to
our MVC 2 application copy the same code
from there and then paste it within this
function alright
now let's run this so we are running MVC
3 application we have already run MVC to
look at that it has written two as
diversion so for MVC 3 it's returning 3
if you put the similar code in MVC for
application it should state it s MVC 4
so if you want to figure out what
version is being used by an existing MVC
applications there are two ways you can
either do it at design time or
programmatically at runtime
alright on this slide you can find
resources for asp.net c-sharp and sequel
server interview questions that's it for
today thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
