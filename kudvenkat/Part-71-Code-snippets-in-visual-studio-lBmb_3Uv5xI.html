video well disc is code snippets in
Visual Studio so what are code snippets
code snippets are ready-made snippets of
code you can quickly insert into your
code let's understand these code
snippets with an example let's flip to
visual studio here I have a console
application now let's say for example we
want to write code for the for loop and
to do that we start off by typing the
keyword for open the bracket into I is
equal to zero I less than 10 I plus plus
close the bracket open the curly bracket
close the curly bracket now to save all
this time in typing we can use code
snippets and there are several ways to
insert a code snippet and one of the
easiest ways is to simply right-click
and then select insert a snippet from
the context menu and looking at the
moment I do that we will arrive at this
interface and we want to generate code
for the for loop in C sharp so I'm going
to expand this folder and then select
for loop from there and look at that the
moment I do that the code for for loop
is generated and look at this all the
editable fields are highlighted in
yellow
so the first editable field here is the
variable name eye so if I don't want to
change it I simply plus tab and look at
that
the moment I plus tab you know the next
editable field is automatically
highlighted now let's say for example I
want to go back to the previous editable
field and to do that press shift tab so
I am back at the first editable here and
let's say for example I want to change
this variable name to J so I simply
change it to J and look at that once I
change that variable name to J the other
instances of that variable are still I
but then once I press tab look at what's
going to happen all the other instances
are also automatically changed to J and
then the next editable field is
automatically highlighted for us now
let's say I want the condition to be as
J less than 10 so I change that length
to 10 and then look at this I am done
now editing these fields now I want to
set from field editing more and to do
that there are two ways you can either
press Escape key or Enter key and look
at this when I press ENTER we get out of
that field editing mode and we can now
write code as normal okay so there are
several ways to insert a code snippets
and we have seen one of the ways is to
simply right-click and then select
insert snippet from the context menu the
other way is look at that there is a
keyboard shortcut ctrl K and X so I have
my cursor right here and when I type
ctrl K X because that we have the same
in interface to insert the code snippet
okay and the other way is to go to the
Edit menu in the Lycians and then select
insert snippet from the context menu
there and the other way is to use the
code snippet shortcut so the code
snippet shortcut for for loop is for
look at this the moment I type for
within the visual studio ventilations we
have that code snippet for the for loop
automatically selected now when I press
the tab key twice look at that the code
snippet for for loop is automatically
generated for us and we change the
editable fields in the same way as we
did before all right so these are the
different ways to insert a code snippet
in Visual Studio now there are different
types of code snippets and the code
snippets that we have discussed until
now or expansion code snippets so these
snippets all of the code snippet to be
inserted at the point where we had our
cursor so what I mean by that is if I
have my cursor here and then the
keyboard shortcut is ctrl K X so let me
type that and we an be insert a for loop
so at that point you know the code
snippet code is inserted those are
expansion code snippet types and then
there is another set of code snippets
called surrounds with you know these
snippets allow the code snippet to be
placed around a selected piece of code
and for example let's say I want this
for
to be surrounded by another for loop I
can simply select that piece of code
right click and then select surrounds
width option look at that surround with
and then once we do that we can select
uniform maybe I want to surround that
with a for loop or a for each loop let's
say I want to surround that with follow
look at that this piece of code is now
automatically surrounded with another
for loop and then the other type of code
snippets are refactoring will discuss
these refactoring code snippets in a
later video session so puts around a
code snippet with another piece of code
there are again several ways we can
either use the keyboard shortcut ctrl KS
so look at this when I select this piece
of code and then when I right click look
at that I can pick up this options
around width or we can use this keyboard
shortcut control KS or the other way is
select the piece of code that you want
to surround with go to the Edit menu in
the lick sense and then select surround
width option write these code snippets
can be used with any type of application
that we can create with Visual Studio
now so far we have seen using code
snippets with a console application now
here I have an asp.net MVC web
application so basically I can use code
snippets within an MVC application as
well so here we have a controller so for
example I want to generate some piece of
code here I can simply right-click
select insert snippet look at that we
can you know insert the code snippets
here as well and not only within code
files even within views we have some
HTML you know we can use a code snippets
so for example I want to generate the
HTML for input type submit ok to do that
again you right-click insert snippet and
then HTML so for input button so I
select that double click it and look at
the highlight our vegetable fields are
highlighted input type is equal to in
maybe submit and you can give it a name
and then a value so code snippets can be
used with any type of application that
we can create with Visual Studio not
just with one specific type of
application and these code snippets are
available for different languages for
c-sharp we have seen it for HTML
similarly for Visual Basic
Java's jscript sequel etc and to arrive
at this list you know we can basically
use code snip-snip ad manager so these
code this code snippet manager can also
be used to add or remove code snippets
so and not only that we can also find
this information like the description of
the code snippet it shortcut
what is the snippet type and the author
of that snippet all this information can
be found in code snippet manager and to
access code snippet manager simply
select code snippet manager from the
tools option within Visual Studio so if
we go back to visual studio go to tools
and then you should see their code
snippet manager and the keyboard
shortcut for that is ctrl K + ctrl B so
once we open that look at that here are
the different languages and once we
expand a code snippet for example look
at that you know we have the description
shortcut the snippet type and the author
alright that's it for today thank you
for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
