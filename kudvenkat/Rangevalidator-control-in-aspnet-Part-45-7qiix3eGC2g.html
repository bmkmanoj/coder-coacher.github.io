venket this is part 45 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll discuss
about the range validator control in
asp.net before continuing with the
session I strongly recommend to watch
pad 44 of this video series range
validator is used to check if the value
is within a specified range of values
for example to check if the age falls
between 1 and 100 on this screen you can
see a text box where the user can enter
age and the allowed range here for the
age is 1 and 100 but the user has
entered 121 which is beyond the alarmed
and hence the error messages displayed
stating stop so age must be between 1
and 100 and to do this we're using a
range validator as the name suggests a
range validator is used to validate for
a given range let's look at this in
action let's flip Visual Studio and I
have this HTML already typed in just to
save some time so let me copy and paste
this HTML and this is very
straightforward you know all all this
HTML is doing is displaying this word
age a text box button and the label
control so if we inspect the source here
it's a table within which we have this
word age in the bold tag a text box
control a button and the label control
all right so we want to allow the user
to enter age into this text box and we
want to ensure that age falls between 1
and 100 so let's drag and drop the range
validator control so just like any other
validator control it has got the ID
let's give this ID a meaningful name
since it's validating age I'm going to
call this range validator 8 then it is
equal to server
let's give meaningful error message H
must be between 1 and 100 okay so that's
the error message and the next important
property that we have to specify is the
control to validate which control should
this range validator validate it should
validate the text box age so txt age is
the ID of that text box let's copy and
specify that here okay control to
validate
and we want the error message to display
the in red color so for color is equal
to red so these are the properties that
are common to every validation control
but then let's now look at the
properties that are specific to range
validator now range validator as we know
it are checks for a given rate so
obviously we have to specify the minimum
value and maximum value of that range
and how do we do that using the minimum
value property so the minimum value in
our case is going to be 1 and maximum
value is going to be 100 okay now we
know that age is an integer but we need
to tell that to the range validator
control so how do we tell that using the
type property so type is going to be
integer and other allow the types are
currency date double and string datatype
so I'm going to select integer as the
type okay so these are the properties
that we need to specify for a range
validator control now let's go ahead and
run this and see what happens if we
enter a range that doesn't fall you know
fall between 1 and 100 so let me enter
121 click Save we get that error message
as expected okay now let's do some
server-side processing so obviously if I
enter a valid age I want to save this to
the database so I double click the
button control even handlers get
generated so if page dot there's a
property called
is valid property at the page level and
this is a boolean property this property
is going to return true if the all if
all the validation controls passes
validation in which case we want to save
the data to the database so i'm going to
say label status dot text is equal to
data save in real time applications we
actually save the database to the
database in the sense we will have the
actual ato dotnet code here but here
just to save time we're just printing
that message onto the screen and
basically I want to set the color of the
label to a green color so system dot
drawing dot color dot green ok now
if this property returns false then we
know that it will come to the else block
which means at least one validation
control has failed validation in which
case we don't want to save the data so
we want to display a message saying
validation failed and data not saved and
here I want to show the color of the
label as red okay so now let's run this
and let's enter an invalid age as you
might expect we get the validation
message but if I enter a valid age then
I will be able to submit that but look
at this even if I don't enter the any
age there and then when I click Save
button I am able to successfully submit
the page to the server for processing so
the important thing to keep in mind here
is that the range validator control only
validates data if you provide data if
you don't enter data then range
validator will return true in the sense
you know it passes okay so if you end to
ensure that the user also enters age
then we have to use required field
validator as well so let's use the
required field validator control along
with the range validator control here so
let me drag and drop the required field
validator
on to the webform so required field
validator let's give it a meaningful ID
since we are validating age I'm going to
call that required field validator age
then it is equal to server and let's
give it a meaningful error message let's
say age is required and obviously
another important property is to come is
control to validate we have to specify
we want to validate this text age text
box so that's one thing and then I want
the error message to get red in color so
I'm going to specify the color s red
okay so now let's run this and see if
both the validation controls work okay
so if I don't provide an age and try to
save look at that age is required the
validation message is shown which is
very good but then look at where it's
displayed it's being pushed away from
textbox control and why is that that's
because this space is occupied by the
range validator control let's inspect
the source I right-click on the page
view source and if you look at the aged
text box there look at the aged text box
so I have the aged text box here and
then I have this range validator and
then I have the required field validator
now range validator is not shown but it
is still occupying that space there
that's why age validation I mean
required field validator error message
is being pushed away and look at how
these messages are rendered you know
they're using this style visibility :
hidden look at that style attribute
visibility : hidden both of them
now when the controls use this property
even though they are not displayed
they're going to occupy that space on
the screen and that's the reason why
this message is being pushed away from
the control ok let's see how to correct
this and to correct this it turns out
that we have a very simple property
called display property and every
validation control supports this
property now display property is going
to take three values the first one is
none so let's flip to presentation so
display property which is supported by
all validation control the first value
it allows is none when you set display
property to none error message is not at
all rendered and displayed to the next
to the control this property is
basically used to show the error message
only in the validation summary control
we'll talk more about this option when
we talk about validation summary control
but whereas when you set the display
property to state a the error message is
displayed next to the control if the
validation fails but the space is
reserved on the page for the message
even if validation succeeds and the span
tag that that displays the error message
is rendered with style visibility :
hidden and we have just seen that
whereas if we set the property to
dynamic there're messages displayed next
to the control of the validation fails
on the other hand the space is not
reserved on the page for the message if
the validation succeeds that's important
to keep in mind
so the span tag is now rendered with
style at display : none let's set that
to dynamic and see if that solves our
problem so I come here set the display
property of this to dynamic and I do the
same thing for required field validator
as well okay so now let's go ahead and
run this and see if your if our problem
is solved so now I don't enter age so
age is required and if I enter an
invalid age 1:21 age must be between 1
and 121 and hundred so let's view the
source now and once you look at the
source look at how these tags are
rendered now you know the span tag with
the style display : none display : not
so when a tag is rendered with style a
display : none if they're not displayed
then they won't occupy that space on the
screen and that's why we have the
message is displayed as expected ok now
we have seen how to use range validator
control basically to alidade age which
is an integer now let us quickly look at
another example where we want to alaa
date may be dates okay
so let's quickly insert another row
below this current row so I have a row
here maybe I have a field called a date
available maybe for the interview or for
an appointment whatever and we want to
provide a text box where the user can
type in a date so let's drag and drop a
text box onto the webform and let's
stretch this text box so the width is
150 just like the above text box and
let's give it a meaningful name and I'm
going to call this txt date available so
txt date available okay now obviously if
I want to validate the range for this I
need the range validator control and
this is going to be the date so instead
of using a brand new range validator I'm
going to copy and paste the existing one
so that we have less typing to do so
let's copy that and paste it next to the
date available text box so this is going
to validate data available text box so
I'm going to call this range validator
date available and let's give it a
meaningful
name date available must be between
let's say we want to allow only the
dates that fall within this year so 0 1
0 1 2012 and it's going to be 31 12 2012
control to validate it's going to be txt
date available and full color is going
to be red and the most important thing
is the minimum value maximum value and
the type the minimum value is going to
be 1 1 2012 so let's copy that and paste
it there and maximum value is going to
be 31 12 2012 and the type the type here
is going to be date that's it so let's
run this now and see if it works as
expected now it should validate for a
valid date that falls only within this
year any date outside that will be
invalid and let's say I'm saying 12 and
maybe 12 and 2013 this is not a valid
date range so date available must be
between that so let's give you know 2012
and click Save that error message is
gone
I give maybe 98 which is a valid age so
data saved okay on this slide you can
find resources for asp.net c-sharp and
sequel server interview questions that's
it for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
