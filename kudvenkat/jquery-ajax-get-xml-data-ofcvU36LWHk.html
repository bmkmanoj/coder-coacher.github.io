this video well discuss how to load XML
data from the server using jQuery yet
function in part 57 we discussed how to
load JSON data we'll be modifying this
example to load XML data let's flip to
your studio this is the same example
that we worked with in the previous
video session notice here we are making
a request to get help text or aspx page
and we are sending help text key along
with the request and what we get from
this page is JSON data because we are
converting the help text object into a
JSON format now what we want to do is
inspect the request and response that we
get back from this github text or aspx
page to do that we are going to use this
tool fiddler which captures the traffic
so what I'm going to do is first remove
all the traces here and look at this
when this first name textbox receives
focus we are sending some data and
receiving some data from this github
text or aspx page so we want to inspect
both the request and response and that
will be captured in this fiddler tool
look at this we are making a request to
get help text dot aspx page and to make
that request by using get function of
the jQuery what is this gate function
going to do it's going to issue a get
request so if you notice the request
here here we have the request header
look at this the type of request is cat
and we are making that to get help text
dot aspx so it's a get request and since
we are sending some data to the server
in this case help text key by default it
will be appended to the URL as a query
string so get help text or aspx question
mark and then we have this help text key
now since you know B since the first
name textbox received focus you know the
key value is first name that's what is
the request now how does the response
look like to see the response look at
this here we have a message saying
response is encoded simply click on that
and notice we are on the text view tab
at the moment
and this is what we get back we get a
JSON object back so if you want to
inspect the request and response you can
use the fiddler tool but if you just
want to see you know what is the
response like you can also use the
browser right in the browser we simply
type this URL and we should get this
response back in fact let's just try
that so instead of this HTML page one
dot HTML I'm going to type get help text
dot aspx question mark and help text key
equals first-name look at that what we
get back is a JSON object which contains
key and text now let's go ahead and
modify this example so it returns XML
data the first thing that we need to do
is modify the code within github text or
aspx page right at the moment we are
serializing this help text object you
know that this function is returning to
JSON now let's go ahead and see realize
that to XML to do that we are going to
use XML serializer class and that class
is present in system dot XML dot
serialization namespace now here the
first thing I am going to do is set the
content type of the response to text
slash XML and then let's go ahead and
create an instance of XML serialize it
was let's call the instance XML
serializer
equals new XML serializer now when we
create an instance of this XML
serializer class in our we have to
specify the type of object that we want
to serialize the type of object that we
want to serialize is help text right and
this object has got serialized method
which is going to serialize the object
to XML format now once it is serialized
where do you want to write it you know
that's the first parameter we want to
write it to the
output stream of the response object so
that's what I'm going to specify here
response dot output stream and then the
actual object that we want to serialize
so this method get help text by key is
going to written as the help text object
right so I'm going to copy this and
paste it right here so this function
returns the help text object that we
want to serialize and once it is
serialized we want to write it to the
output stream of the response object all
right so we can get rid of this code
from here all right so let's go ahead
and build the project and look at this
now when we make a request to the same
page what we should get back is XML look
at this so here we are getting XML so we
have this help text and within help text
we have got two elements key and text
key is first name text is the text
associated with that help text key now
we want to consume this XML from this
page HTML page one dot HTML okay
so instead of JSON what we are going to
be working with is XML okay and this is
the callback function so what is this
callback function going to get it's
going to get XML data right so what I'm
going to do is wrap the XML using jQuery
object so I'm going to create a variable
here let's call this jQuery XML equals
dollar response so we are wrapping the
XML using the jQuery object since we
have wrapped it using the jQuery wrapper
we can now use jQuery methods on this
jQuery XML so I'm going to create
another variable here let's call this
text element so what I'm going to do
here is within the XML I'm going to find
an XML element with name text
now if you look at the XML that we get
back we have two elements key and text
what I want to find is this text element
and I want to retrieve the text of that
text element okay so now this variable
has the text element all that is left is
retrieve the text of the text element
right so here I'm going to say text
element and then let's use the text
function to get the text of that XML
element that's all there to it so let's
save all these changes let's go ahead
and make a request to our HTML page one
dot HTML and look at this now when the
first name textbox receives fogers we
still get the you know help text
associated with that field now look at
what we have in Fidler here is the last
request so we are still making a get
request and you know notice that the
help text key is still appended to the
URL so that's the request and if you
look at the response what we are getting
back is XML now here at the moment we
are only displaying the actual text
associated with that key if for some
reason you want the key as well then you
know create another variable maybe call
it key element and we can do the same
thing jQuery XML dot find what is the
name of the XML element key and then we
can use this and then call the text
function on that so key element dot text
and let's separate both of them using :
all right so let's save the changes
reload this page and now we should get
both the key and the value that is the
actual help text
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
