this video we'll discus binding asp.net
3 view control to a database table this
is continuation to part 161 so please
watch part 161 from the asp.net tutorial
before proceeding with this video at the
moment this tree view control is bound
to this web site map file but discuss
this in our previous session first let's
remove that Association and to do that
let's delete this data source ID
attribute let's also get rid of the
sitemap data source control we want this
tree view control to be bound to this
database table so we need to create this
table before we do that let's understand
the structure of this table this ID
column is the primary key for this table
tree view text is what is displayed
within the tree view control navigate
URL column can is the name of the page
that we want the user to navigate to
when they click on a tree view item this
parent ID column represents the
relationship between the rows in this
table look at this the first four rows
within this table has got parent ID as
now meaning these four rows are going to
be the top-level items within the tree
view control notice that home employee
employer and admin are the top-level
items the other rules that have got a
parent ID are the child items so notice
the parent ID for rows 5 6 &amp;amp; 7 it's
number 2 meaning these rows are children
of another row within the same table
which has got ID of 2 so which row has
got an ID off to employee row so rows 5
6 &amp;amp; 7 are children of employee row so
notice that within the tribute control
upload edit and view resume are
displayed under employee in a similar
fashion employer and admin items have
also got children in order to speed
things up I have already created this
table it is the sequel script to create
and populate it that's some sample data
I have the script available on my blog
in case if you need it while we are here
let's also create a stored procedure
that's going to retrieve all the four
columns
from table TBL treeview items so here is
that stored procedure and we have called
it SP get three view items all that is
left now is to write ad or net code to
execute the stored procedure and
retrieve data so let's flip to visual
studio let's get to the code behind file
and the first step here is to import the
required namespaces we need system data
we need system data sequel client and
system dot configuration let's write a
private function that's going to
retrieve the data let's call it get tree
view items so the first step here is to
read the connection string from web
config file so within web config file I
already have a connection string called
DB CS that's pointing to the sequel
server that's installed on my machine so
let's read that connection string using
configuration manager class so the name
of the connection string is DB CS
alright the next step is to create the
sequel connection object itself so
sequel connection con equals new sequel
connection create that using the
connection string and let's now create a
sequel data adapter object and we want
the sequel data adapter object to
execute this stored procedure as we get
three view items so let's copy the name
and paste it here and we want this data
adapter object to use this connection
object so let's pass it as a parameter
to the constructor and now let's go and
create a data set object but before we
do that we this data adapter is
executing a stored procedure here so we
need to tell that it's executing stored
procedure and we do that by using
command type property so command type
dot stored procedure but if you notice
the stored procedure it doesn't have any
parameters so it's okay not to have this
line all right now let's go ahead and
create a data set object
and then let's invoke the fill method
which is going to execute the stored
procedure and fill the data set with the
data that is retrieved all right now the
most important thing here is to
establish the relationship the primary
key and foreign key relationship and to
do that we are going to use the
relations collection and use the add
method so we want to add a relation so
we are going to use this overloaded
version so specify a name for the
relation let's call it child rose and
how are the columns within this table
related so what is the parent column the
parent column is ID and the child column
is parent ID okay so when we execute
this stored procedure this data set is
going to contain one table so and how do
we get access to that table all we need
to do SDS dot tables of 0 should give us
that table okay and within the table the
column which has got a name of ID is
going to be the parent column and what
is the child column parent ID column is
the child column so da star tables of 0
dot of parent ID
alright now let's go ahead and use it
for each loop so for each data row let's
call it level 1 data row n des dot
tables of 0.02 are looping through each
data row that we have caught in this
table and then a treeview control is a
collection of three node objects so we
need to create a three node object let's
call it parent three node equals new
three node parent three node dot text so
where are we going to get the text from
this column what is the name of the
column three view text is the name of
the column so level one data row and in
order to get the spelling right let's
copy the name of the column here so tree
view text dot two string in a similar
fashion we need to set the navigate URL
property for the tree view object and
where are we going to get the navigate
URL from this column now some of the
rows within this table have got children
as well so we need to get child rows as
well and how do we get child rows it's
very simple we discussed this in
previous video sessions as well so let's
create a data row array object and let's
call this child rows equals so we'll
take the parent
I mean level one data row dot get child
rows and this function expects the name
of the relationship was the name of the
relationship that we have added child
rows so
let's pass that and what is this method
returning look at that it's returning an
array of data rows so now we are going
to use another for each loop and loop
through the child rows
so for each data row and let's call it
child or level two data in this child
rows array so what are we going to get
to here create another tree node object
and let's call this maybe child tree
node equals new tree node and let's copy
these lines so chain the tree node dot
text where are we going to get the text
from level two data row three view text
column in a similar fashion tail the
tree node dot navigate URL we are going
to get that again from level two data
row navigate URL column so once we have
this child tree node object created
we need to associate that with this
parent tree node and how do we do that
parent tree node dot chain that nodes
dot add and we are going to add a child
a tree node object so here tailed tree
node let's pass that to this function
and once we are done adding all the
child tree nodes finally what we need to
do we need to add this parent tree node
to the tree view control itself and what
is the ID of the tree view control it's
3 B 1 so tree view
one dot nodes dot ad and what does it
expect a tree node object and we are
going to add this parent tree node so
it's as simple as that
all right within our page load event if
it's not a postback event meaning if
it's the initial get request of the
webform go ahead and invoke this
function get tree view items with all
this in place let's go ahead and run
this and see if it works as expected so
we should be able to get the data from
the database right now now look at this
we have got a problem here so the first
set is correctly displayed but look at
this
upload resume you know these children
are also displayed as parent nodes and
in order to correct that all we need to
do is so basically at the top level we
only need to display those rules which
doesn't have parent ID and in order to
achieve that what we are going to do
so f level one data row dot get child
rows basically you know this level one
data row you know as we loop through we
are going to loop through each row
within this table so we are going to
check if parent ID column is null or
empty if that's the case then we know I
mean if it's not null or empty then we
know it's a parent item in which case
only then go ahead and execute this
piece of code that's what we have to
tell in order to achieve that
so if level one data row off what's the
name of the column a parent ID dot two
string
if this is null are empty only then go
ahead and create you know a parent tree
node and then associate all the children
with that parent tree node okay which
means this piece of code will be
executed only for these four rows which
has got parent ID of now and that way we
we will not have this issue let's go
ahead and run this and see if it works
as expected look at that now it's
working as expected
good now at the moment within the tree
view control we only have two levels but
what if we have three or more levels
let's say for example under upload
resume a I'm going to have maybe two
more items so let's insert two more rows
into the table TBL three view items look
at this you know a a that's the name of
the page and number five is the parent
ID meaning we are associating this row
with the number five what is number five
upload resume and we are doing the same
thing that this row as well so basically
these two roles are going to be children
under upload resume okay so we want AAA
and BBB to be displayed under upload
resume so let's execute this insert
script first and let's execute this
procedure just to make sure that we are
getting the data that we expect look at
that we get a and BBB as well so within
the database we have these two rows as
well now let's run this and see if we
get them displayed within the tree we
control look at that it doesn't display
them so the code that we have just
written will only work if there are only
two levels within the tree view control
okay in our next video we'll see how to
make the Street View control work with
three or more levels in the hierarchy
that's it for today thank you for
listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
