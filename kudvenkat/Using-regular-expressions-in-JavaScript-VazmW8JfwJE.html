in this video well discuss using regular
expressions in JavaScript so what is a
regular expression a regular expression
is a sequence of characters that forms a
search pattern let's understand regular
expressions with an example notice here
we've got a string with characters and
numbers what we want to do is retrieve
all the numbers from this train so
basically we want to design a web page
that looks like this
in the first text box the user will
enter his input string and then once we
click this process string button we want
to retrieve all the numbers from the
string and then display them in the
textarea element as you can see here so
for example if we enter this string
right here
we should retrieve the numbers nine
eight nine ten and nine nine zero two as
you can see here if we enter this second
string then we should be retrieving nine
zero eight one two and three four and if
we enter this string the result should
be one two nine zero one and 100 so
basically this page should work with any
string it will be very complex and
error-prone if we have to achieve this
without using regular expressions so
let's see how to use regular expressions
now so let's flip to visual studio so
basically I have already design the web
page to save some time so here we have a
textbox where the idea of the textbox is
set to txt box and with this set to 250
pixels and then we have to HTML break
elements followed by that we have a
button where the value is set to process
string and the width of the button is
set to 250 pixels and then to HTML break
elements and the text area element with
the ID txt area and rows equals four
columns equals 30 so the moment the
webpage looks like this now let's go
ahead and write a JavaScript function so
let's call this function process string
so the first thing that we need to do is
retrieve the user input so let's create
a variable input string
and let's get the value from the input
text box which is from this first text
box so document dot get element by ID
and the ID of the input text box is txt
box and we want to retrieve the value
from there let's create a variable to
hold our result so basically we have our
input string now the string object in
JavaScript has caught a match method and
to the match method we can pass regular
expressions so basically what we want to
retrieve from this string is all digits
all numerical digits so first of all
regular expression should be present
inside forward slashes so whatever you
have in between these two forward
slashes it is going to be a regular
expression so what I want to do is find
all the numerical digits you know in
this string right so in regular
expression to represent a numerical
digit we use backslash d let's see what
is that going to result okay so
basically backslash T that represents a
numerical digit now let's alert what we
get back and on click off this button
let's call this process string button
method on click equals process string
alright let's go and run this now as it
stands so let's enter this string and
click this process string notice that it
only returns nine okay but we want nine
eight nine ten nine nine zero two
everything so basically we want to do a
global match with this regular
expression and in order to specify that
you want to do a global match that is
across the entire string then at the end
of the regular expression use
more letter G so basically this letter G
here is going to tell that we want to do
a global match that is in the entire
string we want to find all occurrences
of numerical digits so now let's go to
end run this and and there our input
string and look at this when I click
process string notice that I get nine
and then I get letter eight and then
nine and then zero and then one so
basically we don't want that we want
that entire number okay
so we want the one or more occurrences
of that numerical digit so to achieve
that use a plus sign here so backslash T
plus means return us all occurrences of
one or more occurrences of numerical
digits from the string and this letter G
at the end is going to tell that we want
to do it across the entire string that
is we want to do a global match so now
let's go to and run this and enter our
input string process training notice
that we get nine eight ninety ten nine
nine zero two now all we need to do is
display those numbers within this text
area element and for that let's use a
for loop now what is going to happen we
need to account for one more scenario
for example if we enter something like
this mark Mary now at the moment this
string does not have any numerical
digits in that so when I click process
string look at that it returns null so
what we want to do is
if result is not equal to now only then
we want to process in a whatever result
that we get back so instead of
displaying it in the alert let's um you
know write those elements to the
textarea element so for that let's use a
follow for where I equals 0 I less than
result dot length I plus plus so if you
don't have this check right here and if
result is null this line is going to
throw an exception that's why check if
result is not now before processing you
know the data that is there in the
result variable so here what we want to
do is append whatever we get back to the
text area element so document dot get
element by ID and the text area element
ID is txt area dot value plus equals
result of I and then to that lets append
backslash R and backslash n because we
want every number to be on its own line
so pretty straightforward code there so
let's go ahead and run this and see if
we get the desired result so let's send
our input string which is this one
notice that we get the numbers nine
eight ninety ten and nine nine zero two
let's go ahead and enter this string we
should first of all look at that it's
appending to what's already there in the
text area element so every time we call
this function let's actually clear
what's already there within that text
area element so document
so the value is going to be an empty
string so let's run this one more time
and now let's enter our second string
notice that we get the numbers nine zero
eight one two and three four and let's
end our final string notice that we get
one two nine zero one and one hundred so
basically this page is working with any
string and here is the code that we have
just written thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
