video we'll discuss generation operators
in length all of these standard query
operators belong to generation operators
category let's look at them one by one
with examples range operator generates a
sequence of integers within a specified
range let's understand what we mean by
this with an example let's say we want
to print all the even numbers between 1
and 10 and we want to achieve this
without using link if that's the case we
would use a for loop like this for int I
is equal to 1 I less than or equal to 10
I plus plus and then inside the for loop
will check when the number is divided by
2 and when the remainder is 0 then we
know that number is even in which case
we want to print the value of I on to
the console so when we run this we get
all the numbers between 1 and 10 now
let's see how to achieve the same thing
using link range method this range
method is present in innumerable class
and notice this method has got two
parameters the first parameter is called
the start parameter and this parameter
specifies the first integer within the
resultant segments so within the
resultant sequence we want numbers from
1 to 10 and then from that numbers we
want to retrieve only the even numbers
so first of all we want to generate
numbers from 1 to 10 so the first
parameter is going to specify the
integer at which we want to start you
know the numbers in the resultant
sequence so in this case from 1 and the
second parameter specifies the number of
sequential integers starting from that
number so we want 10 numbers starting
from 1 in a sequential order so this
call here is going to return us an
ienumerable event which is going to
contain numbers 1 till 10 so let's
create a variable of type I am herbal
event and let's call that result and now
let's use a for each loop
and then print each value that is
present within the result and sequence
so when we run this as you might expect
it's going to print all the numbers from
1 to 10 but that's not what we want we
want only the even numbers if that's the
case we are going to chain this where'
method here and then specify a lambda
expression which is going to retrieve
only even numbers all right now let's
look at repeat operator this repeat
operator is used to generate a sequence
that contains one repeated value let's
look at an example so if you look at
this example right here so again this
repeat method is present in the
enumerable class and again notice this
method has got two parameters as well so
the first parameter is the value that we
want to be repeated within the resultant
sequence so we want this hal over to be
repeated five times within the resultant
sequence so we are passing the first
parameter as holo and since we want that
to be repeated five times we are passing
five as the second parameter so what
this is going to do is return an INT
Murrah Belov string and that resultant
sequence is going to contain this word
hello five times and we use a for each
loop loop through each element within
that result in sequence and when we
write the value of that element to
console we are going to get this hello
word printed five times
so that's repeat empty operator returns
an empty sequence with the specified
type so what does this mean now look at
this again this empty is present in a
enumerable class now notice here that
type is integer okay so what is this
line of code going to do it's going to
return an empty i enumerable event and
here the type is specified as string so
this piece of code is going to return an
empty ienumerable of string so the
immediate next question that comes to
our mind is where is this useful
let's actually understand that with an
example so let's say we've got a method
and let's make it static and let's say
this method returns
ienumerable event and let's call it get
data so since it returns ienumerable
event
let's return a new list of India and
let's say this method is going to return
1 2 3 and here we are going to call this
get data method now when we run this as
it is it's going to print those numbers
1 till 2 3 now let's say this method we
don't own this method let's say you know
this application makes a call to a
method that is present in a 3rd party
application in our third party API and
we don't have any control on third party
application all this application does is
make a call to that method whatever that
method returns you know it's storing
that in this result variable and then
using a for each loop to loop through
each item and printing its value on to
the console
okay now let's say things have changed
and then for some reason you know this
method is actually returning now now
what do you think is going to happen
when we run this piece of code it's
going to throw a null reference
exception that's because you know this
method returns now and then we are
trying to loop through and null
reference object so obviously it throws
that null reference exception ok now
there are several ways we can correct
this problem one way is if result not
equal to now if the result is not equal
to now only then try to look through
each item in the result ok so it's not
going to throw the exception ok so
that's one way the other way is by using
the empty method so we can use null
collating operator here
so this get data may written now ok if
that is the case then what we want to do
is use innumerable dot empty method so
innumerable empty of end so what is this
going to look at the return type it
returns an int mirabile event so it's
going to return an i innumerable event
empty sequence so now when we run this
look at this we don't get the exception
so this will be an empty sequence with
no elements in it if we actually print
the count of that console dot readline
result dot count we get 0 so that's one
of the uses of this empty method and
here is the same example that we just
discussed that's it for today thank you
for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
