control tutorial in this video we'll
discus binding data to the chart control
using data bind table method in part 5
we discussed data binding using
datasource property in this demo we will
be working with the same example that we
worked with in part 5 so please watch
part 5 before proceeding when the data
bind table method is called it
automatically creates and adds a new
series to the chart control so this
means there is no need to specify the
series in the HTML markup of the chart
control declaratively this also means
that we can delete the series element
from the chart control let's flip to
visual studio and delete the CDs element
from the chart control so that's our
first step the second step is to use the
data binding table method in the
code-behind file notice at the moment we
are using datasource property let's
delete these lines and then invoke data
bind table method notice there are two
overloaded versions of this method we
are going to use this overloaded version
which takes two parameters the first
parameter is the data source that
contains the data for the chart control
in our case sequel data reader object
contains the data for the chart control
the second parameter is the name of the
column that contains the values for
x-axis we want a student name to be
displayed on x-axis so that is the
column that contains the values for
y-axis now if you look at this query it
has got two columns and we only specify
the column that contains values for x
axis so this means data binding table is
going to automatically use the other
column for y axis values now these
changes let's run this and notice the
data is displayed as expected now look
at this when I change the chart type for
example when I select PI we get a
runtime error and notice what the error
says it says a chart element with the
same width name see this one could not
be found in the series collection and
where do we have the error we have the
error may be as setting the chart type
dynamically so
we have that error on this line right
here now we don't have a series with
that name remember we have deleted you
know the series which has got name CDs
one when this data bind table method is
called what is this going to do it's
going to automatically create and add a
new series and we do not know the name
of that series it will be dynamically
set by the data bind table method now
here we are getting a reference to the
series by its name there is another way
as well we can also use the index of the
series okay so we can use the series
index instead of name now we know that
you know at least there is going to be
one series present inside the chart
control and we want to set the chart
type of that series with this change
let's go ahead and run this one more
time and then now let's select for
example pi and notice that the data is
displayed using a pie chart okay now
here we using the series index you know
we can do that or we can also use first
or default link method if you prefer for
example instead of using the index I can
use first or default but before that we
need to bring in system dot link
namespace so let's go ahead and do that
and then let's use first or default
method here
and notice that the chart still works as
expected
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
