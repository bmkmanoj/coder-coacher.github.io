please watch what 55 before proceeding
we'll be working with the same example
that we started in part 55 in this video
we'll discuss preventing cross-site
scripting attack while allowing only the
HTML that we want to accept for example
we only want to accept bold and
underlined tags if you recollect from
the previous session we want the users
to be able to submit their feedback and
while they are doing that we want them
to be able to stress certain words using
bold and underlined tags so we want the
users to be able to submit HTML but at
the same time we want to prevent
cross-site scripting attack from
happening so to achieve that there are
three simple steps the first tab is to
disable input validation so that the end
users can submit HTML since we want the
users to be able to submit HTML we want
to you know disable input validation and
that's the reason why we have decorated
this create controller action method
with this validate input attribute and
we are passing false so we don't want to
validate input so whatever input that is
coming from this you know view create
view so when I click on this create
button this is the controller action
method that responds so whatever input
that is coming from that form you know
don't validate that ok so since we are
not validating the input that is coming
from this form in on now the users will
not only be able to submit bold and
underlined tags they will be able to
submit any HTML tags they want they can
even inject JavaScript like this ok
so the next step is to dynamically
encode all the input that is coming from
the user ok so when I click on this
create button whatever input that we
have here you know that input is going
to be received by this controller action
method notice that here we are receiving
a comment object and this comment object
has got name and comments property so
name property is going to receive the
input that's coming from this textbox
comments property is going to receive
the input that is coming from this probe
from this textbox
so we want to HTML encode all the input
that is coming into this controller
action method and how do we do that we
are making use of string builder class
for that now you might be wondering why
are we using string builder class why
can't we simply use system dot string
class that's because of performance
because we are going to modify you know
a given string multiple times okay and
when we change the same string several
times you know it's better to use string
builder over string class that's because
strings of type system dot string are
immutable so if you change them several
times for performance reasons since
strings of type system dot strings are
immutable it's better to use string
builder because strings of type string
builder are mutable no matter how many
times you change them there's not going
to be any performance impact if you're
using string builder so that's why it's
better to use string builder and that's
the reason we are using it here okay so
we are creating an instance of string
builder class and notice what we are
doing here you know whatever that is
present in the comments property so
obviously this user input will be
present in the comments property of the
comment object so we are taking the user
input out and then passing it to this
HTML encode method of a HTTP utility
class that's a static method so we are
calling it in the name of the class so
this method is actually going to you
know HTML encode the user input so it's
going to HTML encode all this input okay
all both of this bold and underlined
tags the script tag and this closing
script tag as well okay so once we have
that HTML encode we are then storing
that in the string builder object okay
so at this point we have all the input
from the user
HTML encoded but what is our requirement
we want to allow bold and underlined
tags so the next step is to selectively
replace the encoded HTML with the HTML
elements that we want to allow what are
the HTML elements that we want to allow
bold and underlined
okay so this is the encoded HTML
football tag so ampersand LT semicolon
LT stands for less than G T stands for
greater than so ampersand LT semicolon
that is the encoded you know string for
less than symbol similarly AM % GT
semicolon is the encoded string for
greater than and then in between we have
that letter B which is which stands for
the bolt tag so replace that encoded
HTML with this HTML tag and this one is
for the closing tag so we replace that
for the closing bool tag under line
closing underlined so once we have you
know the HTML elements that we want to
allow so here we have them next what we
are doing we are setting that back as
the value for the comments property of
the comment object after converting it
into the string representation because
comments property is of type string so
we are converting that to strain okay
now notice this second set of code that
we have here you know via HTML encoding
you know the user input for name as well
so name is coming from this text box we
are not expecting the end user you know
to submit HTML within this text box okay
so that is not stopping the end user
from I mean that is not stopping the
hacker from injecting HTML and
JavaScript okay so to prevent cross-site
scripting attack using this text box you
know it is better to HTML encode the
input you know that is coming as part of
the name property as well okay so we are
taking whatever that is present in the
name property HTML encoding that storing
in this variable and then setting that
as the value for the name property on
the comment object finally behind that
comment object you know to this DB
context object which is going to save
that to the database okay so by this
point we have all HTML n coded except
bold and underlined tag so we are
allowing the users to be able to submit
bold and underlined tags and at the same
time we are preventing cross-site
scripting attack that's like
look at that in action and the
stringbuilder class is present in system
dot txt namespace so let's go ahead and
import that namespace first and with the
controller action method let's go ahead
and create a stringbuilder object
and so this is the comment object which
is going to receive comments and name
from the UI so we have the comments
property we want to HTML encode that
using HTTP utility class we just got the
static method HTML encode so look at the
return type it's returning a string
which is nothing but the encoded string
and then we want to store that in the
string builder object and to do that
we're going to make use of append method
of the string builder object so that's
going to append the encoded string to
the stringbuilder object okay so at this
point we have all HTML encoded we want
you know we want to selectively replace
the encoded HTML with the HDL HTML
elements that we want to allow that is
to bold and underlined tag so SP
comments dot replays we want to replace
you know ampersand less than semicolon
that is the those are the encoded
characters for you know less than symbol
and then the bold tag and then we have
ampersand GT semicolon okay so we want
to replace them with a pulled tag oops
let's put that in the double quotes
similarly we want to replace the closing
poll tag on a line tag and closing
underline tag so that's going to be
closing bowl tag and here we need a
closing bowl tag this is going to be an
underlined tag and this is going to be a
closing underlined tag finally
convert the stringbuilder object to
string and then assign that as the value
for the comments property on the comment
object now the next step is to HTML
encode you know whatever is present in
the name of property so comment dot name
use the HTTP utility class and use the
HTML encode method and encode that store
that in a variable of type string STR
let's call this name and finally set
that as the value for the name property
on the comment object okay so now the
comment object is then persisted to the
database and we redirect the user to the
index fear all right let's build
solution so bill succeeded now let's
click on create so now this is going to
submit this comment to the database now
except you know the bold and underlined
tag notice that except the bold and
underlined tag look at the word very
good that's bolded and underlined but
look at this script you know the script
didn't execute instead you know it has
encoded that script tag and then stored
in the database and then when the form
is displayed look at that when the form
is displayed you know the end coded HTML
is displayed instead of executing that
script so if you look at what we have in
the database so let me execute that
query notice that the bold and
underlined tag they are stored as we
want them to be stored whereas the
script tag is HTML encoded okay so here
we have allowed the HTML that we want to
allow in this case the bold and
underlined text but we have prevented
cross-site scripting attack as well now
I must tell you relying on just
filtering the user input so here what
are we doing you know we are filtering
the user input okay basically we are
encoding all the HTML and we are
allowing only the HTML that we want to
allow so there's nothing but filtering
the user input so this technique alone
cannot guarantee cross-site scripting
attack elimination cross-site scripting
attack can happen in different ways and
in different forms this is just one
example that we have discussed today now
please read MSDN documentation on
cross-site scripting attack and all the
countermeasures that are available this
slide you can find resources face B dot
and C sharp and sequence of interview
questions that's it for today thank you
for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
