this video well discuss the jQuery
checked selector the jQuery checked a
selector selects all check the
checkboxes or radio buttons look at it
selected that we have here there's going
to select all input elements of type
equals radio and look at the colon check
that selected at the end this call and
check that selector is going to ensure
that it is only going to select those
radio buttons that are checked so let's
understand this with an example let's
design a web page that looks like this
so we want two radio buttons for gender
male and female a submit button and a
div element to display the result now
when we click the submit button without
selecting any of the radio buttons then
we want to display this message no radio
button selected within the development
on the other hand when we do have a
radio button selected in this case we
have male selected and then once we
click the submit button we want to
display this message male is checked so
let's see how to achieve this let's flip
to visual studio so here we already have
the required HTML to give us this UI
I'll have this HTML available on my blog
in case you need it now notice we have
got two radio buttons for gender male
and female a submit button and a
development within the script section we
have a ready function and when we click
the submit button that's when the
processing should happen so let's wire
up a click event handler to the submit
button and notice the submit button has
caught an ID so we can use the ID
selector so dollar and ID selector is
the hash symbol so hash and the ID of
the button is me t and submit so this is
going to return us the button we want to
wire up a click event handler and when
the click event happens we want to
execute a function
so here we want to find all those radio
buttons that are checked so input type
equals so what is the type for a radio
button the type is radio so we will use
this attribute value so input type
equals radio so what is this going to do
this is going to select all radio
buttons but that's not what we want we
want to select only those radio buttons
that are checked so here I'm going to
use colon checked selector so this is
going to ensure only those radio buttons
that are checked are selected okay and
let's store whatever we get back in a
variable
let's name that result if result dot
length if that is greater than zero then
we know that you know a radio button is
checked okay in that case we want to
display this message you know whatever
radio button is checked okay so we
should get the value of the radio button
and we should display that within this
div result element okay and again this
div element has got an ID so we can use
the ID selector so dollar hash and the
ID of the development is ative result so
let's copy that and then we are going to
use the HTML method to set a value you
know for that development okay so what
what is the message that we want to
display whatever is the radio button
that we have checked we want the value
of that radio button look at it it has
got a value and to get the value we can
use this result variable and then call
Val method on that we know that there is
going to be only one radio button
checked so we can safely call Val method
and then to that lets up in the string
is checked okay now if the length is not
greater than zero then that means none
of the radio button
is checked and in that case we want to
display no radio button checked within
the div element so no radio button
checked all right so let's save these
changes and reload this page and look at
this we don't have any radio button
checked so when we click the submit
button look at that no radio button
checked on the other hand select mail
click Submit mail is check select female
female is checked and here is the HTML
and the jQuery code that we have just
discussed now let's look at an example
of using checkboxes so look at the
selector here this is going to select
all input elements of type checkbox and
colon checked again is going to ensure
this is going to only select those
checkboxes that are checked and let's
also understand this with an example so
we are going to have you know these
skills on the page and then when we
click the submit button without
selecting any of the checkbox then we
want to display this message no checkbox
checked on the other hand if we have a
few checkboxes checked in this case we
have three of them Java Script C sharp
and VB so first we want to display this
message the number of checkbox is
checked in this case three checkbox is
checked and then the values of the
respective checkboxes that are checked
okay and we want the output to be in
separate lines so three checkbox is
checked in one line and then the value
of each checkbox in a separate line so
let's see how to achieve this so at the
moment what is this selector going to do
this is going to written as all radio
buttons that are checked first of all we
require the HTML to get you know this UI
okay to speed things up I already have
typed the required HTML so let's copy
this and paste it within the body
section so basically we have in a one
two three four checkboxes to display
those four skills JavaScript jQuery
c-sharp and VB
then we have the submit button and the
development to display the result okay
so let's see if these changes and then
we reload this page we should actually
get checkboxes on the page okay
now within the click event handler of
the button control so it's already wired
up and look at this here this code is
actually going to find all radio buttons
that are checked but that's not what we
want now we want to find all checkboxes
that are checked so here are instead of
type equals radio I'm going to replace
that with checkbox so type equals
checkbox so this is going to ensure that
only those checkboxes that are checked
are returned
okay and keep in mind now this result
will have you know if I have like four
three checkboxes checked for example
this result will contain you know three
check box elements okay so if result
length is greater than zero then we know
for sure you know at least one of the
checkbox is checked and in that case we
want to first display you know the
number of checkbox is checked so for
that I'm actually going to create a
variable here let's call this result
string and how do we get the number of
elements that are checked we can use the
length property result that length is
going to give us the number of elements
that are checked and then to that lets
append this string check boxes checked
okay and then let's include an HTML
break at the end so that you know the
values of the respective check boxes
will come in their own separate lines
okay now you know this result can
contain more than one check box so let's
loop through each check box element that
is present within this result and then
retrieve the value of the each check box
okay so this result collection on this
result collection I'm actually going to
call each method so when we are
iterating through each element within
that result collection we want to
execute some code so I'm going to
include an anonymous function here
and when we are looping through what we
want to do we want to retrieve the value
of each checkbox that is checked so
dollar this is going to refer to the
checkbox element that we are currently
iterating over dot Val should give us
the value of that checkbox okay
what do we want to do with that value we
want to append that to this result
string so result that string plus equals
the value of the checkbox that is
selected and then let's append an HTML
break so let's put that in quotes and
then finally you know once we have
finished looping through each element
within the result collection you know we
have formed the required result string
so let's pass that to this HTML element
which is going to set that as the value
for the div element okay if the length
of the result collection is not greater
than zero then we know that no check
boxes have been checked in that case we
want to display this message
no checkbox checked all right so let's
save these changes reload the page and
look at this I select you know we have
we don't have any checkbox checked so
when we click the submit button look at
that no checkbox checked let's select
JavaScript c-sharp click the submit
button to checkbox is checked and we
have the values of the checkboxes that
are checked so now three check box is
checked and here is the HTML and the
jQuery code that we just discussed
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
