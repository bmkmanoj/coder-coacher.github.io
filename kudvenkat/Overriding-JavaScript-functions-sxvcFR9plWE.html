in this video we'll discuss overriding
JavaScript functions this is
continuation to path 60 so please watch
part 60 before proceed in one of the
advantages of using prototype property
to add functions is that it enables us
to override an existing function if
required
here we have an example that we worked
with no previous video session this
employee constructor function is going
to construct the employee object and
notice here we are adding get name
function to the employee object using
the prototype property and then we are
creating two instances of the employee
that is mark and Sarah and then we are
calling get name on each instance which
is going to return the respective
employee name so this program is going
to produce the output that you see on
the right I have this already typed
within visual studio now let's it for
some reason we want to override this get
name function of the employee object now
let's say we want the overridden method
to convert the employee name to
uppercase and then return that okay now
we want to override get name without
changing this function okay because this
is let's say the usable code and we
don't want to change this in any way
so let's actually move this to the
bottom so we have the employee
constructor function and get name
function added to the employee object
now what I want to do is override get
name function so employee dot prototype
dot get name equals function
so whatever implementation I am going to
have here this is going to override get
name function of the employee object so
let's return this dot name after
converting it to uppercase using to
uppercase method
now let's lap all this code inside a
function so this is of a client code so
let's put this inside a function and
let's give this function a meaningful
name let's call this get employee
details and then let's call this get
employee details function okay so now
when we load this page we should have
you know these employee names
capitalized so let's reload the page
notice that Mark and Sarah capitalized
which proves that it's actually using
this overridden function right now at
the moment if you look at you know this
code the entire JavaScript code that is
the employee constructor function and
get name function all this code and of a
client code that is this code are
present on the same page in reality that
reusable code will usually be present in
an external javascript file maybe so to
this project let's actually add an
external javascript file let's name this
employee script IAS and let's move our
reusable code into that javascript file
and then here let's actually include an
HTML tag and then a head tag and within
the head section
let's reference the external javascript
file source is employee script or J is
type equals text slash JavaScript and
then let's include a body section and
within our body section let's have this
script section
okay so now the reusable script is
present in the next ml file and then on
this page notice that we are overriding
getname function so even at this point
when we reload this HTML page one dot
HTM it should produce the same output
because we are still overriding getname
function now if i comment this piece
right here it's going to fall back to
the original implementation of get name
so when i save the changes notice that
now it is using the original version of
get name function
now using this approach we can also
override built-in methods that is
JavaScript built-in methods like alert
function now what does an alert function
usually do it's going to alert the
message to the screen so when I say
alert hello and when we load this page
it's going to alert that word hello
using this dialog box this alert box now
let's say for some reason you know we
want to override that alert function
instead of displaying a dialog box we
want to write whatever message we pass
to that function to this webpage itself
so let's see how to override that so I'm
going to create alert equals you know
this is going to be a function and
whatever message we pass to this
function we want to write that to the
webpage so let's use document dot write
and write the message so now and we call
alert you know this is actually
overriding window dot alert method so
when I save those changes and reload the
page notice that instead of displaying
the message within a JavaScript alert
box it's actually writing it to the
webpage now even if I use window dot
alert and then pass maybe JavaScript
with one space and friend notice that
even this string will be returned to the
webpage so now we should actually get
hello JavaScript so where they use alert
or window dot alert you know it's going
to use this overridden version now if I
comment this then it's going to fall
back to the original implementation so
when I reload this page notice that
first we get hello and then once we
click OK on that we get JavaScript thank
you for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
