video we'll discuss how to implement
date picker functionality in an asp.net
web form using jQuery date picker of
each ad so here is what we want to
achieve as soon as the state of birth
text box receives focus we want a
calendar to pop up and as soon as we
select the date from the calendar we
want that selected date to be populated
with in this date of birth text box and
the calendar should disappear this is
very easy to achieve using the jQuery
date picker widget so here is the HTML
that we need this little text date of
birth to produce that text on the web
form and then we have an asp.net text
box control notice we have set the ID of
the text box to txt date so that's the
HTML we need and then we need one line
of jQuery code so within the jQuery
ready function find the text box control
by ID so here we are using the jQuery ID
selector finding the text box and on
that we are calling the date picker
function so that's all there to it I
have this exact HTML and jQuery code
already typed on this waveform so here
we have the HTML and within the ready
function we are calling the date picker
function so when we view this platform
in the browser this is how it looks like
and notice as soon as the state of the
textbox receives focus we have a
calendar popping up and as soon as we
select the date the selected date is
populated within the text box and the
calendar disappears this date picker
widget is a highly configurable plugin
there are loads of options available to
customize its behavior for the complete
list of those options please visit this
URL right here I've included a few of
the options here which could be useful
so let's look at these options one by
one let's look at this option append
text so whatever text we specify using
this option dot text will be displayed
next to the date field so on this
waveform here this is the date field and
if we use this option and specify some
text that will be displayed next to that
text box so let's go and specify the
options and how do we specify options
use a JavaScript object and pass that to
the date picker function so the first
option that we want to specify is
append text and let's say we want you
know this text to be displayed next to
that date field text box let's save the
changes reload this page and look at
this so here we have the text displayed
and this is basically telling the user
that the date format here should be an
mmdd yyy format let's look at this show
on option this option dictates when the
date picker should appear now by default
the date picker appears when the text
box receives focused so that's the
default behavior on many of the web
applications you might have noticed that
next to the date field there will be a
small calendar icon and when you click
on that icon that's when the calendar
pops up so if you want that button to be
displayed next to the text box then set
show on option 2 button but if you want
both in the sense when the text box
receives focus you know you want to pop
the calendar as soon as when the user
clicks the button you know even at that
point if you want to pop up the calendar
then set this option to both so let's go
ahead and set that to both so the name
of the option is show on and I'm going
to set that to both let's save the
changes let's reload this page now a
button should appear notice that when I
click that the calendar pops up
similarly when the text box receives
focus even then the calendar pops up but
if you look at this button now at the
moment it doesn't have any text on that
we have caught three dots in there but
if you want to associate some text to
this button then use this button text
property so let's go and do that
so let's say we want this text calendar
to be displayed on that button so let's
save the changes reload this page and
look at that we have the text displayed
their date format this is very useful at
the moment notice the format that we
have when we select the date look at
that the format is mm DD yyy now let's
say if you want the format to be DD mm
yyy then you can specify that using this
date format option so date format DD mm
and yyy
so we only have to use two y's so let's
save the changes reload this page and
look at this when I select xx we now
have DD mm and the year number of months
this dictates the number of months to
show at once so basically if you look at
the calendar right now we only have one
month displayed if you want more than
one month to be displayed then you can
use this number of months option so
let's go ahead and specify number of
months as to
now the calendar should display two
months June and July okay change month
changer these are very useful options
now if you look at this calendar at the
moment you know it's displaying the
current month Ania June 2015
now if we have to go back you know let's
say for example to 2005 then you know
you'll have to click it on you know
several times now that's because at the
moment month and year are displayed
using a label instead of the label if
you have a drop-down list then it would
be much easier to navigate to the month
that we need in a month India so simply
select the month from the drop-down list
and here from the drop-down list and
you're there okay so if you want to do
that then use these two options change
mine change yeah set them to true so
let's go and do that change month let's
set that to true similarly change here
let's set that to true as well
so now notice that month is displayed as
a drop-down list similarly year is
displayed as a drop-down list now if I
want to go to 2006 April you know we are
there min date Mak States so basically
these two options you now control the
minimum date and maximum date that you
want to display within the calendar so
let's go ahead and specify those two
options so men date and one thing to
keep in mind when specifying min date
and maxed it is that we specify them
using data object and you know the month
number in JavaScript starts from 0 so 0
for January 1 for February so on and so
forth so for December it's 11
not 12 so let's say we want a min date
to be 1 you know 2001 or 2005 is the and
month number 1 and day number 1 okay
similarly let's go to and specify max
date so let's say we want the max date
to be 2015 11th month that is December
31st okay so let's save the changes
reload this page and look at what we
have in the drop down list we have the
months here from Jan to December and we
have the ears from 2005 to 2015
okay now localization to localize the
date picker then reference the
corresponding localization file the list
of all localization files can be found
at this URL so when you navigate to that
URL notice that here we have caught
several date picker J's files and the
important thing to keep in mind here is
the naming convention look at that the
name starts with date picker and we have
- and then too
letters there those two letters are the
language codes for example if you want
to display the month and weekday names
in German then you'll have to use this
file because that's the German localized
file they pick a dash d dot J s so at
the moment if you look at the calendar
that we have here notice that the months
are displayed in English and the
weekdays are also displayed in English
if you want them to be in German then
use the German localized file okay so I
have already downloaded this localized
version of German file and I've pasted
that within my application so now let's
go ahead and reference that within our
page okay so let's save the changes
let's reload this page and look at
what's going to happen thee to the month
names look at that they are now in
German and similarly the weekday names
are also in chairman okay and if you
look at that localized file we don't
have you know any complicated code here
all they're doing is setting the options
for the date picker widget okay so
basically they're specifying what the
close text should be what is the
previous text should be in German
similarly what should be the month names
in German what should be the month name
you know short month names in German
similarly the day names they name short
day name minimum you know week era all
those options are specified here so if
you want for example to support French
then you should have a French version of
the localized file okay so here we have
the finished version you know - fr
similarly if you want to support English
Great Britain you have en - GB similarly
one for English New Zealand en - NZ
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
