video we'll discuss detecting errors in
views at compile time
please watch putt 49 before proceeding
we'll be working with the same example
that we started in the previous sessions
of this video series please note that
compile time error checking in MVC views
is disabled by default let's understand
this with an example
let's flip to visual studio so here we
have the MVC demo project that we have
been working with and this details view
displays the employee details so when we
navigate to this details view we can see
the employee details there and notice
that this details view is a strongly
typed view against employee model class
and this employee model class has got
several properties like full name gender
age date of birth etc and notice that as
I you know start typing I get
intellisense you know full name is a
property on the employee model class but
then if I misspell the property name
look at that instead of full name I have
typed it as full name one save it and
then when I build a solution notice that
we don't get any compile time error
checking notice on the status bar will
succeeded okay so by default in MVC
views if you misspell any property names
in or if there are some errors you don't
get compile time error checking okay so
now we actually when a vitreous view
let's refresh this view notice that we
get a runtime error so we will ever come
to know about these errors only at
runtime which is very dangerous now is
it possible to enable error checking at
compile time absolutely and the change
is very simple all we need to do is you
know open the MVC project file using a
notepad or any of the text editors that
are available and then in a search for
this MVC build views element and by
default this will be false set that to
true save the changes and we get compile
time error checking let's actually look
at that in action so there's a project
here and this project is created in this
folder MVC demo
so that's the solution folder within
that we have this MVC demo another
folder this is the project folder and
notice that there is a file with an
extension dot CS proj dot CS prod stands
for C char project so here the
programming language is c-sharp
hence the project files will have the
extension of dot CS prod on the other
hand if your programming language is VB
then the extension of the file would be
dot VB proj so let's open this with a
notepad and the easiest way to do that
is open notepad and drag and drop the
project file on to this and search for
MVC build views and then search for that
notice that by default it's false all we
need to do is change that to true save
the file and then flip to visuals to
really look at that since we have
changed the project file another project
needs to be reloaded so click on reload
so that should reload the project once
again and then now look at that we have
full name one let's try and build this
project and see what's going to happen
we should get compile time error
checking right now so build progress
it's still building the solution notice
that we get the compile time error okay
so we can detect these errors at compile
time itself now if I change that back to
full name and then let's recompile this
so bills started and notice that in the
status bar it should say now we'll
succeed it look at that bill succeeded
now we come back to the view refresh
that we should be able to see the
employee details there notice that we
see the employee details so those are
the three simple steps to enable compile
time error checking in MVC views and
please note that there's something else
called pre compiling views this is
completely different from compile time
error checking we will discuss pre
compiling views in a later video session
this slide you can find resources for
asp.net c-sharp and sequel server
interview questions that's it for today
thank you for listening have a
