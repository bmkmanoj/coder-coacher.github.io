this video we'll discuss how to use
optional URL parameters with UI router
along the way we'll also discuss
programmatically activating a state
using state service go method if you
recollect from one of our previous
videos in this series with any road
module to make a parameter optional we
include a question mark at the end of
the parameter name with ui-router
the parameters are optional by default
so there is nothing special that we have
to do so here is what we want to do at
the moment we are on students page where
we have the list of student names on
this page we also have search
functionality let's say for example
within the name textbox I type letters
ma and then when I click the search
button we want to pass whatever we have
typed in the search text box you know as
a URL parameter and on the destination
page we want to display the list of all
student names that start with letters ma
on the other hand if I don't type
anything within the search text box and
then when I click the search button in
this case we don't pass anything within
the URL parameter but on the destination
page we want to display all the students
so here we are effectively making this
name parameter optional let's see how to
achieve this the first step to do this
is to define students search State
notice we are defining this new state
and the name of the state is student
search when the state is active this is
the world that we want to navigate to
slash student search slash : name
surname is the URL parameter here now we
are doing nothing special to make this
name parameter optional no question mark
at the end with NZ road model we would
include a question mark at the end of
the parameter name to make it optional
so let's define the student search State
so within our script or JS file notice
we already have this man function which
is creating this route / - then search /
: name let's uncomment this piece of
code instead of using when method I'm
going to
state method and the first parameter
with state method is the name of the
state the name of the state is going to
be student search and when this state is
active this is the URL that we want to
navigate to slash student search / :
name name is the URL parameter now we
don't have to do anything special to
make this optional so I'm going to
remove that question mark at the end of
the parameter name so that's our first
step
define student search state the second
step is to modify student search
function that gets called when the
search button is clicked now if you look
at where we have the search interface
this is present on the students page so
the student search function is present
in students controller function so we
have to modify that student search
function so notice into the students
controller function we are already
injecting the state service and then we
are using the go method of the state
service to activate student search state
that we have created in step 1
programmatically so the name of the
state that we have created a student
search so that's the state that we want
to activate when we click the search
button and we are doing that
programmatically by using go method of
the state service but if you look at the
student search state it also has a URL
parameter that means we also have to
supply a value for that parameter when
we are activating that state and that's
what we are doing here we are passing a
JavaScript object it has got a property
and look at the name of the property it
matches the name of the URL parameter
name and then the value for that
parameter is coming from the view model
so whatever we type in the name textbox
here will be available on the view model
so we are retrieving that value and
passing it to the name property which
gets passed to the student search State
so let's do that now so the student
search function should be in our
students controller function we are
already injecting the state service so
what we want to do here
is use the state service go method and
activate students search state and we
also have to pass the value for name
parameter which is available on the view
model object that's our second step and
the final step is to modify students
search controller function to retrieve
the name URL parameter value to do that
we're going to make use of state params
service so here we are checking is there
a value for name parameter if that's the
case then we are calling get students by
name web method and then we are passing
the value for name parameter you know
for that web method and how are we
retrieving the name parameter value
using our state parameters if we have
not supplied a value for the name URL
parameter then it's going to come into
the else walk where we are invoking get
all students web service method which is
going to return us all the students so
let's make this final change so we
already have students search controller
function but this is commented so I'm
going to uncomment this and then inject
state params service instead of route
params and then we are going to use that
service to check if we have passed a
value for the name URL parameter if
that's the case then we want to call
this web service method get student
by name and then we want to supply the
value for the name parameter that this
web method has which is going to return
only the student names that start with
whatever value we have passed else is
going to come into this block and it's
going to call get all students web
method which is going to return us all
the students so let's say all these
changes and let's reload this page so
now let's try for example it is MA
and when I click search look at that you
know it's passed as part of the URL on
the destination page we see only the
student names that start with letters ma
on the other hand if we don't type
anything and then when we click the
search button look at that within the
URL we are not passing anything but then
on the destination page we see the list
of all student names so effectively we
have made that name parameter optional
and we don't have to do anything special
to make that name parameter optional
parameters are optional by default with
UI router
whereas with ng Road module you have to
include a question mark at the end of
the parameter name to make it optional
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
