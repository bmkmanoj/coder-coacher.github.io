this video we'll discuss sorting a list
of simple types this is continuation to
part 76 so please watch about 76 before
proceeding so what are simple types in
dotnet there are several of them
examples include end float string
decimal double care etc in this video
we'll discuss sorting a list of these
types so let's flip to visual studio
first of all let's go ahead and create a
list of integers so list of end and
maybe let's call this numbers equals new
list of integers and then let's
initialize this list right here I have a
list of numbers here so let's copy and
paste them now let's print the numbers
from this list as they are even before
we have sorted that list and to print
the numbers let's use a for each loop so
for each end maybe let's call this
number
n our numbers list all we want to do is
print that number so console dot
readline maybe let's call it number all
right and then let's print a message on
the top console dot write line numbers
before swatting alright and then to sort
the numbers all we need to do is invoke
the sort method on the list instance so
what's the name of our list numbers so
on that instance I'm going to invoke
sort function so this will automatically
sort the numbers in ascending order so
let me actually copy this loop paste it
right there and let's say in numbers
after sorting and then loop through that
collection and then print those numbers
so obviously as you might expect when we
run this you know the first list will
not be sorted because that is printed
before we have sorted and look at the
second list that is so
because we have invoked the short
function which is going to sort the data
and then we have printed the sorted data
okay now if I want to print these
numbers in descending order how do we do
that all you need to do is invoke this
reverse function on that list and then
print those numbers again so obviously
they are in descending order now so you
sort it and reverse the collection it's
as simple as that
so let's actually call maybe numbers dot
rivers so let's print that loop there
and maybe let's call it numbers in
descending order and let's run it now so
now we should have numbers in descending
order look at that now is it possible to
sort a list of strings absolutely and
you do it in the same way so let's
create maybe a list of strings and maybe
let's call this alphabets
and let's initialize the string right at
the place where we have declared it so
let's copy these alphabets and then
initialize this collection all right now
let's use a for each loop and then print
those so first of all console dot
readline we are printing alphabets
alphabets before sorting right so an
alphabet is stored as a string within
this collection so for each string maybe
let's call it alphabet in alphabets
collection what do we want to do we want
to print the alphabet okay now to sort
this list of strings all you need to do
is in work sort method on that list
instance the list instance here is
alphabets so let's in work sort and then
maybe let's print the alphabets after we
have sorted so maybe let's call it
alphabets after sorting and similarly if
I want to print these alphabets in
reverse order then all you need to do is
invoke reverse method on that collection
so alphabets dot reverse and then
print that alphabets and descending
order so let's run it now so alphabets
before sorting they're not in any order
alphabets after sorting they're in
ascending order and here alphabets in
descending order okay so we have seen
how to sort the complex types both in
ascending and this time in the simple
types both in ascending and descending
order now here I have this customer
class this customer class is not a
simple type it's a complex type and it
has got three properties ID name and
salary and then within our main method
I've created three instances of this
customer class so customer one customer
two and estimate three and then we have
a list here customer list so list of
customer so this list here it's not a
list of simple types it's a list of
complex types because of a customer
class is a complex time so now I want to
sort these customers so I can use the
sort function all right so look at this
I build the solution ctrl shift B is the
keyboard shortcut and look in the status
bar build it succeeded I don't get any
compilation error but then when I
actually run this look at this I have an
exception at runtime look at this after
the alphabets are printed in descending
order so which line of prints the
alphabets in descending order this line
okay so once this is done we have three
customer objects these customer objects
are added to the list and then once we
invoke this sort we have that exception
okay and that exception is basically
because dotnet doesn't know how to sort
these complex types so we have to tell
dotnet environment dotnet runtime how we
want these complex types to be sorted
because look at this this customer class
has got three properties ID name and
salary
how would dotnet runtime know to sort
this object do we want to sort it by ID
names vary it can't make assumptions we
have to tell it okay
so that's why by default out
the box sort functionality will not work
for complex types but the obvious next
question for us would be how is this
sort functionality working for simple
types that's because these types have
already implemented an interface called
AI compatible interface so if you look
at this integer so this inter type has
implemented this high comparable
interface and within this interface
there is a function compared to so you
know this is already implemented within
the dotnet framework okay
so that's why dotnet framework knows how
to sort integers and similarly if you
look at strings for example even string
type has implemented this high
comparable interface so dotnet runtime
knows how to sort strings ends decimals
floats etc but then if you look at our
customer class this class doesn't
implement that interface so we are going
to use that interface the I comparable
interface and then implement that
compare function so within this function
we are going to tell how we want our
customer objects to be compared so that
you know they can be sorted okay so we
will discuss that in our next video
session that's it for today thank you
for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
