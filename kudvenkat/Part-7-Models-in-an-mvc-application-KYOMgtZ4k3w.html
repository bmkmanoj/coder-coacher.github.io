venket this is part 7 of asp.net MVC
tutorial in this video we'll discus
models in an MVC application please
watch part 6 of this video series before
proceeding with this video let's
understand models with an example let's
say I want to retrieve an employee
information from this table TBL employee
and then display that specific employee
information in our MVC application as
you can see on the slide so obviously to
encapsulate employee information I need
to have an employee model class so let's
go ahead and add employee model class to
our MVC project so let's flip to visual
studio and then to add an employee model
class right click on the models folder
select add class and let's name the file
as employee dot CS because it this is
going to contain our employee class and
click add and then this employee class
needs to have properties to encapsulate
employee ID name gender and city columns
so let's go ahead and add those
properties to our employee class so
employee ID is going to be integer so
public end employee ID
let's have get and set accessors now
these are auto implemented properties so
if you're new to auto implemented
properties be discussed about you know
properties extensively in c-sharp video
series then let's go ahead and add
properties for name gender and City
columns as well so public string name
and the get and set accessors and let's
add properties for gender and city as
well gender and the final one is going
to be City okay so we have our employee
model class right now now let's go in
and add you know employee controller to
a project so right click on the
controllers folder add controller and
let's go ahead and call this employee
controller door employee controller
click add that should add employee
controller
ts file and look at this by default the
name of the action method within this
employee controller classes index but
let's change it to details because we
want to display you know an employee
details all right now in reality we
actually retrieve employee information
you know from this database table okay
but for now I'm going to hard-code an
employee information within this
controller action method in a later
video session we'll see how to actually
retrieve that from a database table for
now let me hard-code employee
information right here within this
detail section method now look at this I
need to use the employee class but I
don't find the employee class why is
that
the employee class is actually present
in this file employee dot CS and then if
you look at the class here this is
present in a namespace called MVC demo
dot models and various our employee
controller class present its present in
MVC demo dot controllers namespace okay
so obviously if I have to use the
employee class without using the fully
qualified name then it's better to
actually use this using statement using
MVC demo dot models and then let's
specify our employee class employee and
let's say the object is also employee
and let's instantiate the employee
properties here so the employee ID is
equal to let's say for example one zero
one name is equal to John and let's say
gender is equal to male
and city is equal to London okay so we
have the employee object that in the
controller now within the controller
action method now I need to hand this
employee object over to a view and then
the view will render that employee to
the you know browser it generates the
HTML sends it back to the request to the
client so obviously we need to add a
view which can present the employee
information to the end-user okay so
let's go in and add a view to our
project and the best way to add a view
you know you right click on this project
I mean in the 8 controller action method
and then from the context menu select
add view and look at the name of the
view details it matches with the name of
the action method and then this time I'm
going to check this box create a
strongly typed view and remember we have
already built employee model class ok so
I'm going to strongly type this view
with that employee model class and to do
that I need to select the employee model
class from this drop-down list but look
at this at the moment we don't have this
employee class you know within the
drop-down list why is that because after
we have added the employee class we
didn't really build up a project that's
why you know we don't have that within
this model class a drop-down list so
let's cancel out of this let's build up
a project now let's go back to our
action method right click on that from
the context menu select add view and
then check this box create
strongly-typed view now look at the drop
down list I have our employee class I'm
going to select that and click this
button add which should add details view
look at this it automatically added a
folder named full of its name employee
and then it added that details view to
that folder and look at the first line
here you know it says at model is equal
to MVC demoed models so now this view is
strongly type with this employee object
ok so the model for this view is
actually the employee class ok so the
employee properties will all be
available within this view ok
now what we need to do is we need to
display
you know the labels on the first column
and the actual values for those labels
in the right are in the second column so
I need a table with you know two TDs
you know I need for TRS and then every
TR should have two TDs so let's go ahead
and add a table to our view so first of
all look at you know the heading here it
says employee details so let's go ahead
and change this to employee details and
let's also change the title of the page
as employee details and now let's add a
table let's specify a style for this
table as font - family as area okay
now within this table let's add a table
row and then let's add two T's within
that table row so in the first DD we
need let's say employee ID and then
let's say I want that to be bolded the
label itself so we can put that in a
bold tag like so and I want to display
the employee ID itself here so how do I
get employee ID look at this the model
for this view is employee object okay so
I can simply say at model dot look at
that the intelligence shows the model is
employee object so when I say model dot
I get employee ID name gender and city
all these properties so I'm going to
select employee ID there and similarly I
need to add another TR and then specify
model dot name gender and city as well
and just to speed things up I have that
already typed so it's just that you know
I have three more TRS and each TR having
two TDs okay so let me copy this and
paste it in our view so if you look at
that it's very straightforward
I have another TR here you know actually
yeah I have another TR and then it has
got to Dedes so name and then model dot
name now you can have a pool tag as well
here
so that the labels are bolded let's do
that for gender as well and finally for
CP as well okay so at this point you
know we have all the HTML that's
required that's good and run this and
see what's going to happen so obviously
when we run this now you know the URL
will not have look at the URL it doesn't
have the controller name and the
controller action method so if we don't
specify the controller name and it's
action method it's going to by default
use home controller index action but
instead of that now we actually want to
go to employee controller and within
that we want to navigate to details
action method so to do that I'm going to
use employee as the controller name and
details is the action method name let me
press ENTER and see what's going to
happen now look at this I get this error
object reference not set to an instance
of an object meaning I have a null
reference exception why do you think we
have a null reference exception look at
the line where we have caught the error
it says at modal dot employee ID that's
where I have the problem you know when
it's trying to retrieve the employee ID
you know it's not present okay so
basically the model is now on a null
object I'm trying to retrieve employee
ID that's why we have null reference
exception okay why is the model now
that's because if you look at our
controller action method here we have
the employee object here the model
object but did we pass that object to
our view we didn't pass it that's why
but in the view within the details view
this model will be now so if it is null
on a null object we are trying to
retrieve properties so obviously we will
get a null reference exception so now
with another employee controller let's
go ahead and pass this employee object
to this fear all right with that change
let's go ahead and run this
and then let's change you know the URL
to employee details and let's see if we
get the output as expected look at that
employee details I get employee ID name
and gender and city as expected so the
controller responds you know if you look
at this Model View controller the
controller receives the request from the
URL and gets data from a model and hands
that model over to a view which will
then render the you know data to the end
user and our model usually consists of
entities or business objects alright on
this slide you can find resources for a
speed or net c-sharp and cycles of
interview questions that's it for today
thank you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
