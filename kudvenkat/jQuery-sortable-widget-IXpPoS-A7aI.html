this video we'll discuss jQuery sortable
widget jQuery sortable widget allow
elements to be reordered using the mouse
let's understand this with an example
here we've got weekdays from Monday till
Sunday we want to be able to reorder
them using the mouse to get this UI we
have an unordered list here and this
unordered list contains list items from
Monday till Sunday notice every list
item has got data - value attribute for
the weekdays this attribute is set to
weekday and for weekends
it is set to we can in a bed we'll
understand the purpose of this data -
value attribute I have this exact same
HTML already typed so here is that HTML
that we have seen on the slide in
addition to that I also have a style
here that is applied to all the list
items with this style that unordered
list will be rendered like this at the
moment this list items are not sortable
we want to be able to sort them so we
are going to find that unordered list
using the jQuery ID selector so within
our jQuery ready function let's find the
unordered list and on that I'm going to
call sortable jQuery UI function let's
save our changes reload this page and
look at this now I am able to reorder
these elements now behind the scenes
jQuery will apply a special class to all
the items that are sortable ok so we
want to find out what that special class
is so I'm going to launch developer
tools and let's click on this magnifying
glass and when we click on Friday here
for example look at that there is a
class uy dash sortable
- handle is applied now we can use this
class if we want to change the style of
all those elements that are sortable so
I'm going to include that class on our
page so within our Style section
UI - sortable
- handle and what I'm going to do here
has changed the background color
two green and I'm going to change the
font color to white since all the
elements and I'm just going to save the
changes since all these elements are
sortable now all those elements should
get that new style okay and notice when
we are dragging these elements there's a
placeholder there you know that's the
placeholder to which the item will be
dropped right so by default that
placeholder is a white space now you can
change how that placeholder looks like
using the placeholder option and the
value for that placeholder option is
going to be a CSS class so I'm going to
first specify a CSS class and let's name
that last placeholder you can give it
any name you want but I am going to name
it placeholder and I'm going to copy all
these styles and remove you know those
which we don't need so we need border we
need padding we don't need cursor
because that's going to be applied to
the placeholder so cursor style is not
required and similarly we don't require
this list style type property so what is
this list style type property doing on
the list item now by default an
unordered list list item will have a
bullet displayed next to it right and if
you look at the list items here we don't
have a bullet display next to it that's
basically because we have specified list
style type to none okay so that's going
to control what style is displayed next
to every list item okay now for a
placeholder we don't require that style
so I'm going to get rid of that and one
style I require here is the background
color I'm going to set the background
color of the placeholder to gray okay so
within our sortable function I'm going
to pass a JavaScript object and specify
placeholder option and the value is
going to be the class that we have just
defined let's see if the changes reload
this page and look at this now when we
drag look at that the
placeholder' it has got that class
applied and when we drop this item that
will be placed into that placeholder at
the moment look at this I am able to
drag this item horizontally as well as
vertically now if you want to restrict
that dragging for example to vertical
axis alone then you can specify that
using axis option so let's control the
direction in which we can drag using
this axis option now we want to be able
to drag only along the y axis so let's
specify the axis as Y and now look at
that I am able to drag it only along y
axis we will not be able to drag it
along x axis now when we are dragging an
item you know whatever is moving along
with you know the cursor that is called
helper by default look at that the help
of opacity is the same as the list item
opacity now let's say for some reason
you want to control or you want to
change the opacity of that helper to do
that you can use opacity options so
let's go ahead and change the opacity of
that helper to 0.5 maybe so this is
going to make that helper a bit
transparent
so let's reload the page and look at
this now the opacity of that helper is
0.5 and that's why that's transparent
now at the moment all these items are
sortable all the list items within this
unordered list are suitable let's say
for some reason we want to exclude
weekends from being sortable now to do
that we can use items options so let's
go ahead and specify that option now the
value of this option is going to be a
selector so whatever elements match the
selector only those items will be
sortable and if you look at the list
items within this unordered list all the
weekdays have got this data - value
attribute set - weekday and we can have
it set to we can now we only want
weekdays to be sortable so I am going to
specify the selector here as all list
items where data - value attribute equal
to weekday so let's save our changes
reload this page first of all notice the
style for Saturday and Sunday have
changed they are not suitable if they
are not suitable then this style class
that is UI - suitable - handle that will
not be applied by jQuery hence the
background color is not green but the
other items are sortable so that style
is applied to them now look at this when
I try to drag Saturday Sunday I am NOT
able to reorder them whereas I should be
able to reorder the other elements so
here we have the HTML here we have the
CSS styles that we have just used and
the jQuery code now let's look at
another example now what we want to do
is sort items from one list into another
and vice versa so we have got two lists
here list one and list two we want to be
able to sort items from this list to
this list and from this list to this
list so to get this UI I've got two
unordered lists here list one and list
two okay and we have got some numbers as
list items and we have some styles here
so this style will be applied to all the
list items and notice here we also have
a style specified for the unordered list
itself we have said the float to left
what is this going to do this is going
to render these lists side by side okay
and then we have that UI - portable -
handle which is applied for the all the
elements that are sortable okay so I
have the same HTML and styles already
typed in this platform - dot aspx so if
we view this page in the browser this is
how it looks like at the moment okay so
we want both of these lists to be
suitable in the first place so and they
have got
list1 and list2 so let's make them
sortable so let's use the jQuery ID
selector I want to find an element of at
idealist one and an element with ID list
two and we want to make both of them
sortable okay
so let's save our changes reload this
page since those list items are sortable
this class is supplied has the
background color change it to green and
font color change it to white now look
at this I am able to sort the items
within the list itself in both the lists
but then look at this when I try to sort
and sort that item into another list it
doesn't allow me to do that okay so to
do that to be able to sort items from
one list into another we will have to
use a different option and that is
connect with so I want to connect with
now again here we specify the value as a
selector so let's say I want to connect
with list 1 when we do that look at that
now I am able to sort into list 1 but
not into list - okay so if you want to
be able to sort into both the list from
list one to list oh and list two to list
one you can specify IDs like that so we
want to be able to sort into both the
list okay so when we do that now look at
this I am able to sort into this list
similarly I am able to sort into this
list that's one way of doing it another
way and the most common way of doing it
is like this look at that at the
unordered list level both of these lists
have got data - value attribute and I
have set it to a value of connect you
can give it any meaningful value that
you want now what we can do is here
whatever we're specifying here is a
selector and that selector should return
both of the list that we want to connect
in both the directions so here I can
specify I want unordered less we're data
-
value attribute equals connect and that
selector is going to return both of
those are not add less okay so now let's
see save all changes reload the space
and the behavior still should still be
the same look at that I am able to sort
into list 2 and similarly into list 1
and here is the jQuery code that we just
discussed thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
