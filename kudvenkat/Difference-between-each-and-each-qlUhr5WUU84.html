this video we'll discuss the difference
between dollar dot H and dot each
methods in jQuery there are two versions
of each method dot each dollar dot each
dollar dot each can also be written like
this
jQuery dot dollar is the shortcut for
this word jQuery so what's the
difference between dot each and dollar
dot each dot each method is used to
iterate over the items in a jQuery
object collection
whereas dollar dot each method is used
to iterate over JavaScript objects or
arrays let's look at a few examples and
that should make it clear so let's flip
to visual studio here we've got an
unknown @ list and this unordered list
contains a few list items so within our
jQuery ready function let's use the
selector dollar Ally so what is the
selector going to do it's going to
return all these list items using a
jQuery object collection so this
selector is going to return as a jQuery
object collection that will contain all
these list items so if we want to
iterate over all these list items in
that jQuery object collection we will
use dot each function and we discuss
this function in the previous sessions
of this video series and if you look at
this function it has got two parameters
callback and arguments this callback
parameter represents a function that we
want to execute for each item that we
are iterating over and this function has
two parameters index and element so what
is this index parameter represent this
index parameter represents the index of
the item that we are currently iterating
over within this collection and the
element parameter represents the element
itself so let's say we want to print the
index of the item and the value that is
the list item value so let's create a
result variable here let's initialize
that to an empty string and within our
jQuery each function let's say result
plus equals so we want to append this
word index equals and then we
the index itself so this parameter
contains the index of the element and to
that let's append comma space and then
this word value equals and we want to
get the list item value that is the text
of the list item and to refer to the
element we can use this element
parameter now the important question
that we have to ask here is what is this
element parameter represents we know
that it represents the element that we
are currently iterating over but is it
the raw Dom element or the JavaScript
object it's actually the raw Dom element
since it is the raw Dom element look at
this when I press dot the intellisense
does not show up Java Script methods for
example jQuery methods I mean jQuery has
got the HTML method look at that that is
not shown in the intelligence
similarly jQuery has got text method
that method is not shown all these you
know properties and methods that we see
here are the raw you know JavaScript
methods and properties but the jQuery
specific methods and properties are not
displayed in the intelligence here and
that's because this element is a rod or
element or not the jQuery object so to
convert this raw Dom element to a jQuery
object we have to use the jQuery wrapper
dollar so what is this going to do this
is going to convert this raw Dom element
into a jQuery object now on this when we
plus dot and then type text look at that
the jQuery method text shows up in the
intellisense which is going to return as
the text of the list item and to that
lets append an HTML break and a
semicolon so we are iterating over each
element retrieving it its index and the
list item text and then finally let's
display the result in this development
this development has got an ID so let's
find the development by ID ID selector
is hash and the ID of the element is
result div and let's call the HTML
method and pass the result variable so
let's save the changes and
we look at this we should get each list
items index and let's title text so if
you look at you know this each function
here we're using the element parameter
to refer to the element that we are
currently iterating over we could use
that parameter or we can also use this
keyword and again this keyword
represents the raw Dom element that we
are iterating over to convert that to a
jQuery object we wrap that using the
jQuery wrapper and then call the text
method on that so even at this point
when we reload this page we should get
the same result so here we are using the
jQuery dot each function to iterate over
the items in the jQuery object
collection now let's look at an example
of using dollar h when do we use dollar
h we use dollar dot each to iterate over
javascript objects or arrays so let's
look at an example of using dollar dot
each to iterate over JavaScript arrays
so let's leave that result variable
let's get rid of this each function here
and let's create actually a JavaScript
array let's call this integer array and
let's initialize that to 100 200 300 400
and 500 so we have got 5 elements here
now we want to iterate over those
elements and display the index and the
actual element value so this is not a
jQuery object this is a JavaScript array
now to iterate over the elements in this
JavaScript array we use dollar dot each
function so I'm going to use dollar dot
8 and if you look at this version of the
each function notice that we've got
three parameters so callback and
arguments we have seen those two
parameters in dot each version in
addition to those two parameters we also
have this object parameter so what is
this object parameter represents now at
the moment look at this we are calling
this each function on this dollar okay
so at the moment this each function does
not know the object or the array
that it has to iterate over so the first
parameter is the object or the array
that we want to iterate over so let's
pass that integer array so now this each
function that is dollar dot each knows
you know what it has to iterate over and
then obviously the next parameter is the
callback function which gets called for
each iteration so this is very much
similar to the callback function we have
in the each version that is in dot each
version so it will take two parameters
index and element just like the previous
version and we have the result variable
here so result plus equals let's say
index equals and to get the index same
idea we use the index parameter to that
let's append comma space value equals
plus and we can use the element itself
in this case and let's append HTML break
to that alright and we are displaying
whatever we have within that result
variable in this result div so let's
save the changes and when we reload we
should see those numbers within that
array okay so here it's a JavaScript
array so we are using dollar dot each to
iterate over this JavaScript array now
let's look at an example of using dollar
dete to iterate over a javascript object
so here within the notepad I have a
JavaScript object so let's copy this
javascript object and let's paste it
right here
okay so we have this javascript object
it has got a key and a value now we want
to iterate over this javascript object
retrieve the key and its value and
display it within the result tab okay so
this is a JavaScript object and to
iterate over this JavaScript object we
are again going to use dollar dot each
okay and this time the object that we
want to iterate over is J's object and
we have a callback function here
you know you can leave these parameters
names as is but in this case since this
is more like a key I'm actually going to
change its name to key so it's a bit
more meaningful and we're going to say
you know let's also change this text
here to key so key equals key value
equals element okay so now when we save
the changes and when we reload look at
this we get the key as the country name
and value as its capital so we have the
country names as keys and the capitals
as values so in this case we are using
dollar dot e to iterate over the
properties of the JavaScript object so
in short we use each method to iterate
over items in a jQuery object collection
whereas dollar dot each is used to
iterate over JavaScript objects or
arrays and these are the examples that
we just discussed this the first example
this is the second example way we use
dollar dot each to iterate over items in
a JavaScript array and this is the last
example where we use dollar dot each to
iterate over JavaScript object
properties thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
