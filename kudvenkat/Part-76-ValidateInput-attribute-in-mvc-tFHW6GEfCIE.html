this video we'll discuss validate input
attribute in MVC validate input
attribute is used to enable a disabled
request validation by default request
validation is enabled in asp.net MVC and
doesn't allow you to submit any HTML to
prevent a cross-site scripting attacks
let's understand this with an example
let's flip to visual studio here I have
a blank asp.net MVC for application
let's add a controller and let's name it
home controller we already have an index
action method here let's add index view
and we want to design this index view so
that it looks like this so let's get rid
of the code and HTML that's already
there let's use a div tag and set the
style attribute let's set font family to
area now the first thing though that I
want here is this word comments and that
should be bolded so let's use a bolder
tag and then in the next line we need a
multi-line text box and a generating
multi-line text box in MVC we use text
area HTML helper and let's name this
text area as comments and then we need a
submit button so let's use two breaks
and then input type equals submit and
value is also going to be submit right
now when we click the submit button we
want to post the entered comments to the
server so we need to form tag and to
generate a form tag in HTML we use begin
form HTML helper
now for us to have the closing form tag
auto-generated let's wrap the call to
begin form a helper using a using code
block all right so let's fill the
solution file up a browser and navigate
to the index action of the home
controller okay now when we enter
comments here and then when we click
Submit we need an action method that
responds to the post operation now the
index action method that's already here
responds to the get request but not to
the post request so let's go ahead and
include another action method and then
let's decorate this with HTTP POST
attribute this attribute word is
optional so we can simply say HTTP POST
and then so the comments that we enter
are going to be received by this index
action method using this parameter and
let's change the return type of this
index action method to string and let's
return a string
so all this action method does is it it
receives the comments the whatever
comments the user has entered and it's
going to return those comments along
concatenated with this word your
comments and that will be displayed back
on the screen alright so let's go ahead
and build a solution now if I enter this
word hello and then once I click Submit
look at that it works as expected your
comments and hello now let's say I want
this word hello to be bolded so let's go
ahead and wrap that inside a bold tag so
here I am trying to submit HTML
let's click submit look at that I get
this error I potentially dangerous
requests or form value was detected from
the client so why is this happening
that's because by default in asp.net MVC
it requests validation is turned on and
to prevent cross-site scripting attacks
you know it doesn't allow us to submit
any HTML ok we discussed cross-site
scripting attack in parts 55 and 56 of
this video series so if you are new to
cross-site scripting attacks
please watch those videos but here we
want to allow users to submit HTML as
part of their comments so how do we make
that possible all we need to do here is
disable the request validation and to
disable the request validation use
validate input attribute so let's
decorate this action method with
validate input attribute and look at
that it has got one boolean parameter
enable validation I'm going to pass
false as the value for that parameter
which means disabled request validation
let's build the solution let's go back
and then let's try to submit and see
what's going to happen look at that it
has accepted the HTML that we submitted
because we disabled a request validation
so basically we use validate input
attribute to enable a disabled request
validation if you want to enable request
validation back you can either remove
this attribute altogether because the
default is that request validation is
label or you can use the attribute and
pass a value of true for that parameter
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
