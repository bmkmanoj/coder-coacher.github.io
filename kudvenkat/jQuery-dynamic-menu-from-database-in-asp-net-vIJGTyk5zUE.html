this video we'll discuss how to build a
jQuery menu using data from a database
table so here is what we want to achieve
using this data from this database table
we want to build this menu so if you
look at the table here we've got four
columns the first column is ID the
second column is the menu text so this
is the text that will appear on our menu
and if you look at this parent ID column
this is very important this is what is
establishing the relationship between
these menu items if you look at the
first four items here they are the
country names USA India UK Australia so
they are the route items within the menu
and notice the parent ID column for
those four rows is not meaning that the
top items they don't have a parent about
them and if you look at the next two
rows Virginia and Maryland their parent
ID is one and this column references ID
column in the same table so the menu
item with ID one is USA so these two
rows that is Virginia and Maryland are
children of country USA and if you look
at the next three rows a PNP Karnataka
they are the children for row with ID 2
row with ID 2 is India
so a PNP and Karnataka they're the
states in country India and if you look
at the last three rows their parent ID
is nine and if you look at nine that is
Karnataka so these three last rows are
cities within Karnataka State okay so
notice the menu here we've got the first
four countries USA India UK Australia
those are the route items within India
it has got its children a PNP and
Karnataka the three states within India
and Karnataka has got three children the
three cities within Karnataka Bangalore
Mangalore and my soul so that's the
significance of parent ID column it
establishes the relationship between
these menu items and the last column
active this is going to determine
whether
if you want the menu item to be enabled
or not so this active column is one for
all the rows except Mysore so all the
menu items will be enabled
except Mysore so if you look at my
you'll notice that it is grayed out so
it is disabled so if you want any of the
menu item to be disabled you know simply
set that to zero all right so let's see
how to build this let's flip to sequel
server management studio so the first
step here is to create the table itself
so here is the table
create table script and here is the
insert script I've already executed the
script and the next step is to create a
stored procedure so here I have a very
simple stored procedure as we get menu
data and all the stored procedure is
doing is selecting all the rows and
columns from this table TBL menu all
right now let's flip to visual studio
here I have an asp.net web application
project within the web config file I
have included a connection string to my
database now let's go ahead and add a
class file to a project and let's call
this menu dot C s so the properties
within this class are going to
correspond to the columns in this table
that is ID menu text parent ID and
active so let's go ahead and create
those properties so I'm going to create
an integer property ID and this is going
to be an auto implemented property and
let's call this parent ID now if you
look at parent ID column parent ID can
be null so I'm going to make the data
type here nullable integer and we want a
string property and the name of the
property is going to be menu text so
this property corresponds to this menu
text column and the last property that
we want is active so I'm going to create
a boolean property because the
corresponding column in the DB is a bit
column so it can either store true or
false
so boolean and let
call this property active and I'm going
to add one more property and this is
going to be of type list of menu the
same class so why do we need this
property let's call the property list so
this property is going to store the
children of a given menu item so for
example if you look at country USA it
has children two children Virginia and
Maryland the two states that belong to
USA so to store that parent-child
relationship I am using this list
property here so if the country is USA
then its children is going to be
Virginia and Mainland stored in this
property list property alright so that
is our object now let's go ahead and add
a generic Handler and let's call this
let's select web and then generate
Handler and let's call this menu handler
so here we are going to write ad or net
code retrieve the database data so let's
bring in the required ad or net
namespaces so we need systems or data we
need system dot configuration and we
also need system dot data dot sequel
client so with no process request
function I'm going to write some radio
dot net code in the interest of time I
have already typed the required area dot
net code so let's copy that and paste it
right here so what are we doing we're
reading the configure a connection
string from web config file and then
here we are creating a list of menu
object and that we are creating an
instance of sequel connection object
using this connection string that we
have read from the web config file next
we are creating a signal command object
using this command object we want to
execute this tour procedure SP get menu
data
and since that is the stored procedure
we have to tell that to the command
object we are opening the connection we
are executing the command and while we
are looping through each row within the
reader we want to retrieve ID menu text
parent ID active and then you know add
that menu object to the list and you
know all these properties are
straightforward except for this parent
ID
now notice parent ID can be now so
that's why we are checking here you know
within the reader do we have a DB null
DB null value if that's the case then we
want to store null in that property else
if it is not equal to DB null value then
we want to convert that to an integer
and store that against this property in
the menu object finally we are adding
that menu object to this list that we
have created here on the top okay now so
that's straightforward ato dotnet code
so this process request function is
going to retrieve you know the menu data
from the database table now what I'm
going to do is write another private
function here so let's call this so
basically this is going to return us
list of menu object and let's call this
get menu tray so what is this function
going to do it's going to build us a
hierarchical menu tree and return that
for us and we're going to pass two
parameters to this function list of menu
and let's call this list and a nullable
integer the parent ID keep in mind
parent ID can be null so I made it
nullable integer okay so what are we
going to do here so we are going to pass
the list of menu items basically
whatever we have retrieved you know
within this process request function
from the database we are going to pass
that list to this function and this
function has to build us a hierarchical
menu tree for us for the
if you look at the data that we have
right here you know we have hierarchy
here but we don't have that you know
parent-child relationship in an
object-oriented fashion so what I'm
going to do here is write some code to
give us you know
okay the parent item is USA and all its
children are these the list property
should have all of them okay so we want
to build such kind of an hierarchical
tree so if you look at for example India
India has got three children and out of
these three children one of the child
has got three more children so we want
that entire hierarchical tree to be
built so we can easily construct you
know the menu from that object okay so
and that is what is this function going
to do so I'm going to return list dot so
I'm going to write some link code here
so list dot where X such that X dot
parent ID equals whatever parent ID we
pass to the function
and we want to select all such in our
rows now what I want to do is project a
new object X such that new menu object
and whatever we are going to project we
want to convert that to a left-hand
return that because the return type of a
function is list of menu okay so here we
are going to construct this menu object
and if you look at the menu object which
we have created here it has got all
these properties so let's go ahead and
initialize those properties so we want
to initialize ID property so ID equals x
dot ID so whatever we get back and menu
text equals x dot menu text parent ID
equals X dot parent ID active equals x
dot active and the most important thing
is the list property so what should this
list contain it should contain its own
children so to get its own children what
I'm going to do is call the same
function recursively so list equals
remember what is the data type of this
list property its list of menu and if
you look at this function get menu tree
what is it returning its returning list
of menu so I am going to call the same
function recursively so list equals get
menu tray and the parameters that you
pass to this function are important so
what are the parameters that we need to
pass we need to pass the menu list and
the parent ID so the list is going to be
the same but parent ID is going to be X
dot ID so this ID right here okay so
let's see how we are going to use this
function probability that will make it a
bit clearer so within our process
request function we have
already built you know a list of menu
items and here let's go ahead and create
another variable let's call this list of
menu and let's call this variable menu
tree equals I'm going to call this
function get menu tray and to this
function I'm going to pass this list
that we got from the DB and the parent
ID I'm going to pass null remember some
of the rows I mean the top-level items
within the menu the parent ID is null so
we are passing null to this get menu
tree functions the first time when this
function is called we are passing the
list that we got from the DB and the
parent ID is null so what is this
expression going to do it's going to
retrieve all those items all those rows
or objects that have parent ID now okay
and then it's going to build a list out
of that and for each parent that we get
back you know it's building their child
items by calling this get menu tree
function recursively so this is going to
give us a hierarchical you know menu
tree all right so all that is left now
is to convert that or serialize that to
Jason so let's go ahead and use the
JavaScript serialize a class this class
is present in a different namespace
system dot web dot script dot
serialization namespace so let's create
an instance of JavaScript serialize a
class let's call it J s equals new
JavaScript serializer J s dot serialize
and we are going to pass this menu tree
object and this function will see
realize that to JSON format and what do
we want to do with the adjacent string
let's go ahead and write it to the
response stream using this context
object so
context dot response dot right whatever
we get alright so let's go and save the
changes let's go ahead and build this
and see what we actually get from the DB
so let's navigate to menu Handler dot a
shx so look at what we are getting from
the DB so we have ID 1 menu text is us a
parent ID for USA is now right and
active it's true and look at the list
property this is the most important
thing so this list property now contains
two objects the first object is Virginia
and the second object is Maryland for
example if you look at Virginia look at
that ID is five menu Texas Virginia
parent ID is one so the item that ID one
is USA and it's active true and look at
the list that is an empty because
Virginia does not have its own children
okay so we've got a hierarchical menu
tree here now all that is left is to
write the required jQuery code and use
the jQuery UI menu function so here we
have a webform and within the webform I
have a development and I have an
unordered list element and I've set the
ID of the unordered list to menu you can
give it any meaningful ID you want so I
just called it menu now what we want to
do is build an HTML structure with
parent-child relationship that's what
the menu widget in jQuery expects so on
that unordered list if we call the
jQuery UI menu function it's going to
build us this menu for us okay so let's
go and do that so here within our ready
function I'm going to write a function a
JavaScript function let's call this
build menu now to this function I'm
going to pass two parameters and now we
are going to pass the parent HTML
element so I'm going to call parent
and the menu items the entire
hierarchical menu tree the JSON object
that we get from the database okay
so this is a collection of items so I'm
going to use jQuery each function and
loop through each item
so let's look through the items and as
we are looping through we want to call a
function so as we are looping through I
want to create a variable let's call it
list item so to this unordered list we
want to add list items so list item
equals Li and to that we want to append
the menu text I can use this keyword
here so as we are looping through each
item this refers to the item that we are
currently looping through and we know
the object that is returned back is
going to have this menu text property so
that's what we want to be you know
display in the menu so this dot menu
text and we want to close the list item
now another thing that I'm going to
check is this list item that we are
adding to the menu you know whether we
want that to be enabled or disabled
that's driven by this column active in
the object we have active property so
I'm going to check if not this dot
active right if it's not active then
what we want do we want that list item
to be disabled in the menu and if we
want the list item to be disabled we
need to add a class to that list item so
I'm going to use this li dot add class
so let's actually wrap this using a
jQuery wrapper so we get jQuery
intellisense
so Li dot add class and the class that
we want to add is UI - state - disabled
so jQuery e UI is going to make that
menu
I'm disabled if that classes are applied
okay now we want to append that list
item to the parent that we are going to
pass into this function so I'm going to
say Li dot append to unordered I mean
the parent that we are going to pass to
this function alright so now I'm going
to check the child items okay so as we
are looping through each item remember
the items can have children so for us a
for example it has two children and
whether the menu item has children or
not how can we detect that using the
list property that we have in this
object right so I'm going to check here
if this dot list if that is not
undefined and this dot list dot length
greater than zero then we know that you
know we've got child items so what do we
want to do at that point we want to
create an unordered list because if you
have chained items that should be the
submenu so I'm going to create an
unordered list so dollar unordered list
and let's close the unordered list okay
now we want to append this unordered
list to the list item because that is
going to be the submenu so Li dot append
to unordered list dot append to because
we want to append this unordered list to
the list item so unordered list dot
append to the parent list item okay and
then I'm going to recursively call this
build menu function again okay because
we want to build the child items and
again this build menu function it
expects you know two parameters the
parent so the parent element here
now is going to be the list item that is
going to the parent and list is going to
be this dot list okay so a very simple
recursive jQuery function which is going
to build you know the HTML structure
with that parent-child relationship for
us now let's go ahead and issue a jQuery
AJAX request so dollar dot Ajax let's go
ahead and build our options so the URL
that we want to call so the URL is going
to be menu handler dot a sh X so let's
copy that and specify it right here and
we want to issue a get request and if
the requests complete successfully we
want to call a function and the data
type that we are expecting back from the
server is JSON
so this function is going to receive the
data from the server what do we want to
do now we want to call this build menu
function so I'm going to call build menu
and to this function we need to pass the
parent element the parent element is
this unordered list element with ID menu
so dollar menu that is going to be our
parent item and the items we are going
to have in this parameter okay so that's
the data that we receive from the server
okay so all that is left now is to call
jQuery UI menu function so this is going
to build us that hierarchical structure
and on that we are going to call the
jQuery UI menu function okay so let's
save all these changes let's go ahead
and run the page and look at that we get
it but I think there is some issue so
let us see what is that now look at that
it's not building you know quite the way
we want it to be so let's see what we
are doing here
so basically here the parent is going to
be unordered list not the list item so
that's what is the mistake so let's save
our changes and run this one more time
and look at this we get what we expect
and if you look at us a we have its
children India we have its children and
if you look at Karnataka notice that
Bangalore and manglu enabled but my suit
is disabled because we have set that to
zero so here is the menu handler code
that we have seen and here is the get
menu tree recursive function which
builds us that hierarchical structure
and here is the HTML and jQuery code
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
