questions video series in this video
will answer this interview question what
is jagged RA a jagged array is an array
of arrays let's understand this with an
example
let's say we have three employees mark
Matt and John mark has three
qualifications bachelor's master's and
doctorate
whereas matt has only one qualification
that is only a bachelor's degree and
John has two qualifications bachelor's
and master's now here different
employees have different number of
qualifications so I want a data
structure where I can store these
varying number of qualifications jagged
array is one of the choices let's look
at an example of using this jagged array
so first is to create a jagged array now
what is a jagged array a jagged array is
an array of arrays now look at this
qualifications are strings ok so I'm
going to create a string jagged array
meaning an array of string arrays so
let's go and create a string jagged
array and to create a jagged array you
use square brackets like that
let's give it a meaningful name let's
call it check it array you can give it
any meaningful name you want and the
next step is to specify the number of
string arrays that you need so what is a
jagged array it is an array of arrays
here we are creating a string jagged
array that means an array of string
arrays okay so how many string array is
to be want we want three string arrays
so we specify the size of our jagged
array using the first set of square
brackets okay now the next step is so we
have we have specified that we need
three string arrays so the next step is
to basically set the sizes of each
string array so jagged array of 0 this
one is going to set the size of the
first string array so we want the first
string array size to be 3
because in the first stringer a we are
going to store mark qualifications and
honing qualifications does mark have
three so I want the first string that
rivet in this jagged array size to be
three similarly for Matt he has only one
degree so the size of the second string
array is going to be one and finally
the size of the third string array is
going to be two because for mark I mean
for John there are only two
qualifications so by this point we have
specified the sizes of each string array
within that this jagged array the next
step is to basically initialize each
string array okay so jagged array of
zero so this is going to give us access
to the first array so within the first
array within the first element of the
first array store whatever you want to
store so what do we want to store we
want to store bachelors okay and in the
second element of the first string array
we want to store masters and in the
third element of the first string array
we want to store doctorate because mark
has those three qualifications okay and
the next step is to initialize the
second string array so how do we get
access to the second string array using
the integral index one refers to the
second string array within this Jagd
array and within the second string array
in the first element we want to store
bachelors okay so these are the
qualifications for math finally John has
two qualifications so let's go ahead and
initialize the third string array let's
copy that okay so how are we going to
get access to the set up third string
array by using integral index are too
I meant to copy these two
so within the third string array in the
first element store bachelors within the
third string array in the second element
store masters okay
so by this point we have created a Jagd
array set the size of each string array
within that jacket array and then we
have initialized each string array with
some data now the next step is to
basically loop through this jagged array
and then print the values that are
present within each array so I'm going
to use a for each loop I mean for loop
for int I is equal to 0 I less than J I
get array dot length so what is this
length property going to give us what is
a jagged array it's an array of arrays
so here how many string that is do we
have within this jagged array there are
three so the length of property is going
to give us the number of arrays within
the jagged array that is 3i plus plus so
now as we look through the jagged array
what are we going to get back we are
going to get back each string array okay
so I'm going to create a variable of
type string array and let's call this in
a array equals so how are we going to
get the string array that is present
within the jagged array simply use the
indexer I so first time I value will be
0 jagged array of 0 what do we get we
get the first string array okay and the
first string that it has got 3 elements
within that so now what we are going to
do we are going to use another for loop
and then loop through the elements
within the inner array and print the
values out so for int J equals 0 J less
than in a array dot length
J + + so let's go ahead and plant the
value that is present within the in that
array so console dot write line in our
array of J okay so what is this going to
do so first time here I value is going
to be 0 so jagged array of 0 will give
us the first string array and within the
first string array how many elements do
we have we have three elements so it's
going to get into this for loop so it's
going to start at 0 and then it's going
to continue until less than 3 that is 2
and then from the inner array we are
going to retrieve the elements and print
them and then once we complete you know
for one user let's print console dot
write line so that we get a blank row so
let's go ahead and run this and see if
we get the output that we expect look at
that so mark has three degrees
bachelor's master's doctorate and those
are printed there and Matt has only one
degree and we can see that there and
John has two degrees okay so now in the
output you can actually see the names of
the employees as well so let's print the
employee names and that's very
straightforward all we need to do is
create a string array we have the
employees name there in the for loop
print the names of the employees from
that string array so let's go ahead and
do that so let's create a string array
here and maybe let's call this employee
names equals new string array and set
the size to 3 so employee names of 0
equals mark
so in the second element we want Matt
and in the final element we want John so
we have the string array here which
contains employee names I'm going to use
that array and then print the names of
the employees so console dot readline
employee names of I so that's going to
look into that employee names array
retrieve the name of the employee and
print that and if you look at the output
we also have a dotted line under every
employee name so let's use another
consult or trade line and print that
dotted line all right so let's go ahead
and run this now look at this we get the
output that we expect so basically a
jagged array is an array of arrays so in
this example you have created an array
of string arrays in a similar fashion we
can create an array of integer arrays an
array of decimal arrays an array of
boolean arrays etc that's it for today
thank you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
