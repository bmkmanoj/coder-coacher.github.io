in this video we'll discuss the
different view engines that are
available in asp.net MVC please watch
part 29 before proceeding with this
video out-of-the-box
asp.net offers to view engines aspx and
Razer let's flip to visual studio we've
been working with this project MVC demo
if you look at the views that we have
caught within this employee folder
all of them are arrays of views now when
we navigate to this URL notice the URL
employee slash index this is going to
invoke index action within employee
controller notice the last line that we
have within this action method return
view and to that view function we are
only passing the model object in our
case the model object here is list of
employees we are not specifying the name
of the view that we want to use so by
convention asp.net MVC is going to look
for a view with the same name instead of
this action method in the views folder
so within views we have employee folder
and within that we have a view with name
index dot CSS HTML the name of the view
here matches with the name of this
action method so by default it's going
to make use of that view and it's a
razor view now let's say instead of
using this razor view I want to use an
ASP X view is it possible to have both
razor views and aspx views to live side
by side in a given project absolutely in
fact let's go ahead and add an ASP X
view and to do that I'm going to right
click on this action method and select
add view from the context menu since we
already have a view with name index I'm
going to change the name here to list
and then I'm going to choose ASP X as
our view engine and then I'm going to
create a strongly typed view against our
employee object and the scaffold
template is going to be list and we are
not going to use any layout or
masterbate so it's uncheck and then we
are going to create we are not going to
reference any script library so I'm
going to uncheck that as well and let's
click Add this should add an ASP X view
notice the extension this aspx
you has got an extension of dot aspx
whereas this abuse has the extension of
dot CS HTML or dot VB dhtml depending on
the programming language in our case we
have chosen C sharp as a programming
language so the extension here for the
Rays of U is dot C as HTML if VB is your
programming language it's going to be
dot VB HTML
okay and another difference between
razor and aspx views is that look at you
know this is the HTML code head body and
paragraph tag and this code right here
is actually server-side code so to
switch between HTML and server-side code
in aspx views we use angle bracket
percentage through that indicates the
beginning of the code block
whereas this angle bracket I mean
percentage closing angular bracket this
is going to indicate the end of the code
block
whereas in c-sharp I mean in razor views
we use at symbol to indicate the
beginning of the code block okay
notice that in razor views we don't have
you know another @ symbol here to
indicate the end of the code block we
only indicate the beginning of the code
block and razor parcel is intelligent
enough to detect the end of the code
block and the beginning of another HTML
tag okay but whereas with razor views
you have to indicate both the beginning
as well as the end okay so we three the
views we have caught lot less number of
keystrokes and compared with aspx views
okay now let's make a few changes to
this aspx view first of all I'm going to
set the style attribute on this body tag
and set font family to area and then
let's set board of the table and to
differentiate between this razor view
and you know aspx view I'm going to set
you know within the h2 tag there this is
a razor view
let's make a similar change within the
aspx view so within this paragraph track
let's use an h2 tag and say this is an
ASP X fear and notice that we are not
making any changes to our controller
action method since we have not
specified the name of the view that we
want to use when I run this by
convention it's going to make use of
let's actually use the full URL here
let's say employee index so look at that
it's going to use the Rays of year okay
why is that because by convention if you
don't specify the name of the view that
we want to use it's going to pick up the
view which is got the same name as that
of the action method here there is a
view name matches with the name of the
action method so it's going to make use
of that view okay so if we want to use
you know this aspx view instead of that
rays of view we have to use a different
overloaded version of this view function
so if you look at this view function
there are several different overloads at
the moment we have a two different
overloaded versions I'm going to use a
version which is going to take the name
of the view as well so there is one
overloaded version so look at this
version it is taking in at the name of
the view as well it's taking the name as
a string and then the model as an object
type so I'm going to pass the name of
the view here it's going to be list so
with this change let's actually run this
and see if it's going to pick up the
aspx view so look at that now it's
making use of the aspx fear okay so
based on this view engines there could
be several interview questions as well
so let's flip to the slides so one of
the common interview questions is that
what is the difference between a razor
view and an aspx view it mostly boils
down to the syntax otherwise there are
no major differences between the two in
aspx view engine the server-side script
is wrapped between angle bracket
percentage whereas in razor we use at
symbol personally i prefer using razor
views because it's very easy to switch
between HTML and code
depending on the programming language
you have chosen laser views Bellator
have the extension of dot CS HTML or dot
PB HTML that has aspx views will have
the extension of dot aspx is it possible
to have both razor and aspx views in one
application absolutely in fact we have
seen that practically and it's port is
it possible to use third-party view
engine with asp.net MVC absolutely so at
the moment out of the box
asp.net supports a spirit an MVC table
supports two view engine switches which
are aspx and razor it's also possible to
plug in third-party few engines there
are several of them available and once
we do that we can actually see that new
engine within this drop-down list
when we try to add a view in fact we
will discuss that in detail practically
in our next video session on this slide
you can find resources face be dotnet C
sharp and Z equals the window your
questions
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
