venket this is part 23 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll learn about
the asp.net check box lists control
before continuing with the session I
strongly recommend to watch part 16 17
and 21 of this video series in these
parts we have discussed about drop-down
list control the concepts related to
drop-down list control are also equally
applicable to check box lists control in
fact both of these controls falls under
list controls category within asp.net we
have other list controls like radio
button list bulleted lists list box etc
whatever concepts that we discussed
today are also equally applicable to
these other list controls that are
available in asp.net we will be talking
about them in a later video session just
like a drop down list checkbox list is
also a collection of list item objects
items can be added to the check box list
in the HTML source at the design time or
in the code-behind file programmatically
checkbox lists can be bound to a
database table or an XML file we have
seen how to actually bind a drop-down
list to a database table or an XML file
drop-down list is generally used when we
want to present the user with multiple
choices from which we want him to select
only one option whereas if you want the
user to select more than one option then
a checkbox list control can be used
let's look at an example I have a simple
asp.net web application project here
let's drag and drop the check box list
control from the tool box on to the
webform and we know that checkbox list
is a collection of list item objects and
these list item objects can be added in
the HTML source at the design time or
programmatically in the code-behind file
and we know that a list item object has
got text and value properties okay so
let's you know display the list of
Education levels within this check box
list control for example diploma
graduate post graduation doctorate etc
now I have these list item objects
already typed just to save some time
okay so as you can see we have diplomat
and post postgraduate and doctorate
having values 1 2 3 4 so if I flip the
webform to the design mode you can see
all of the you know list item objects
listed here but then they are present in
a vertical direction is it possible to
change the direction of these list item
objects absolutely you just have it you
just have to flip one property called
repeat direction so repeat direction at
the moment it's vertical change it to
horizontal that's it okay now if you
look at these check list item objects
all of them are displayed in one column
is it possible to display them in two or
more columns absolutely again go to the
properties and then you have repeat
columns by default at 0 which means all
the list item objects will be shown in
one column if I said that 2 to look at
what's going to happen this will get
distributed across two columns all right
and there is another property you know
called enabled for each list item object
now if you remember when we discussed
about the drop-down list control if you
set the enable the property of a list
item object within the drop-down list to
false then that list item object will be
invisible within the drop-down list when
the page renders but whereas if you set
the enabled property to false for a list
item object within this check box list
then what's going to happen when we run
this that list item object you know it
will be rendered but the user will not
be able to check or uncheck that
checkbox look at that that's disabled
now but the others we can select them so
anytime you want to disable or prevent
the user from selecting a specific
choice all you have to do is set the
enabled property of that list item
object to false okay before discussing
about the selected index value and item
properties we will actually see how to
retrieve you know the text value and the
index of each list item object that the
user has select
remember let's remove this enabled
property for the diploma and if you flip
to the design mode you know they're
spread across two columns but let's
remove that okay so remember from a
checkbox list control a user can select
more than one list item object in the
drop-down list a user can select only
one list item object so you can simply
use drop-down list one let's select the
item and then you can say the text or
dot value that's simple but in a
checkbox list control a user has the
option of selecting more than one list
item object if that's the case I want to
retrieve the text value and the index of
each list item object that the user has
selected so let's drag and drop a button
control so when the user clicks that
button that's when I want to do that so
let's double click the button control B
generates the even handler okay so
response dot right so we want the text
so text is equal to okay now remember
the user can select more than one list
item objects so we need to loop through
each list item object within this
checkbox list control so obviously to
loop through each list item object we
can make use of the for each loop so for
each we know that a drop-down list or a
checkbox list is a collection of list
item objects so for each list item Li in
what is the name of our checkbox list
control its checkbox list 1 so let's
copy the ID and then this checkbox list
1 has got this items collection which
basically returns the list of list item
objects so we are looping through each
list item within that collection so if
you look at that this is a list item
collection okay so once we have the list
item object all you have to do is you
have to check if that list item is
selected and how do we do
that you can use the selected property
of that list item object so and if you
look at the selected property its
boolean which means it returns true if
it's selected otherwise it returns false
and some people use this incorrectly I
mean it's not incorrect but there's no
reason why you should be doing this if
Li dot selected is equal to true
selected is already boolean you don't
have to compare it again to a boolean
value of true you can simply say if a
lie dot selected which means if that
list item object is selected then what
we want to do we want to select the text
so response dot write text is equal to
Li the text and then let's put a space
and a comma so that the output will be
properly formatted and similarly I want
the value so if you want the value we
know that Li has got a value property as
well so Li dot value and what else we
want we want the index of the list item
object within that checkbox list and if
you want the index that's a little
different to achieve because on the list
item we don't have the index property so
if you look at this when I say Li dot
you don't find the index property there
okay now you want the index of this list
item within that checkbox list so the
way we achieve that is check box list
one in the items collection find the
index index of what the list item object
that the user has selected so if you
look at the intellisense you know this
index off method is expecting a list
item object to be passed so i am passing
the list item object there and since
this is the last one we don't have to
append the space in comma there and
let's put an HTML break at the end so
that each selection will come in its own
line
all right so now if we run this and once
we select our choices and when we click
the button each selected items list
items text value and index should be
displayed within the browser window so
if I don't select anything I click the
button nothing will happen why because
it tries to loop through each item
nothing is selected so it wouldn't come
into this block at all so on the other
hand if I select let's say doctorate I
click this button look at that text is
equal to doctorate
this is value is equal to 4 and that
index is equal to 3 we don't we have the
incorrect output that's because we
haven't changed this string so value is
equal to and index is equal to so now
let's run that again and we should see
the correct labels now okay so I select
graduate click the button text is equal
to graduate value is equal to 2 index is
equal to 1 and you can actually verify
that so if you look at that graduate is
at position 1 within that check box list
diploma is at 0 at position postgraduate
2 and that's the index basically and
these are the values ok so if I select
all of them obviously all of them should
be displayed so if you want to retrieve
the text value and the index of you know
all the list item objects within the
check box list we basically use D for
each loop and then use that selected
property to determine if the list item
object is selected or not okay now can I
use the selected index selected value
and selected item properties of the
check box list control absolutely you
can use them you can use them you know
for the drop-down list that's what we
use even for the check box list control
you can use them but the problem is they
only return the first selected item so
what we mean by that let's comment this
for the time being so when we were
discussing about drop-down list we spoke
about the selected index for example
even checkbox list control you know
supports that property so checkbox list
1 dot selected index look at that that's
an into
okay let's write that response dot right
since that is an integer let's convert
that to string now if I go ahead and run
this look at what's going to happen when
we run this and when we select more than
one option only the item which has
called the lowest index that will be
returned look at that I am selecting
graduate and doctorate if I click the
button it only returns me 1 0 is diploma
that's the index of diploma one is for
graduate so I am getting only one if I
select diploma and click the button I
only get 0
so since checkbox list control allows
multiple selections you know if you use
the selected index property then it
returns to you only the first selected
item okay
or the in are the item with the lowest
ordinal index on the other hand if I
don't select anything and then click
that button then I get minus 1 because
look at that I didn't select anything I
get minus 1 and this is one way to
identify if the user has selected
anything at all within the checkbox list
control or not
not only for checkbox list control we
can use that for drop-down list or list
box or any list control for that matter
similarly you can use the selected value
property so instead of selected index I
can use the selected value property
again selected value property is the
same thing it only returns the selected
value of the you know one item and if
you select multiple values it only
returns the selected value of one item
look at that I click that I get the
diploma I select a graduate I still get
what that one okay if I don't select
anything when I click the button you
know it basically returns an empty
string and that's why it you know an
empty string cannot be printed so that's
why there's nothing on the other hand if
I select postgraduate I get the correct
value so remember selected index and
selected value properties can also be
used
but they only return the index and value
of their you know one list item object
similarly I can use the selected item
property again the same idea selected
item returns only one item and then I
can use the text and value property to
retrieve the text and value of that list
item object so if I run this now
obviously I am able to I will be able to
retrieve the text of the selected item
along the same lines you can also
retrieve the value for example I select
a graduate I click this button
I see graduate but when I select diploma
no I only get the text of diploma list
item object so only one item if I don't
select anything that's when the danger
is when I click this button what's going
to happen you can expect that now
selected item will be null you know
there's nothing selected in the
drop-down list so when I click this
button selected item will property will
return null on a null object you are
trying to retrieve text property so
what's going to happen as you can expect
null reference exception so when I click
this button now look at what's going to
happen object reference not set to an
instance of an object this is the
nothing but null reference exception and
that makes sense so that's why it's very
important that if you are using the
selected item property make sure you
check for nulls maybe we can say if
checkbox list 1 dot selected item not
equal to now only then try to retrieve
the text or value property out of it
because if the user does not select
anything selected item will return now
and calling the text or value property
and a null object will through null
reference exception object reference not
set to an instance of an object okay so
now when we run this and if you don't
select anything obviously this condition
will become false and this piece of code
will not get executed and we don't end
up with that null reference exception so
I click this button I don't get any R
but if I select I get the selected items
text as expected so check for non when
using selected item property of a
checkbox list control
