in this video well disk is working with
block codes and less block codes are
useful for coding blocks of content from
another source within your webpage the
block code element can be used with any
HTML that you want as the code for
simple text coats boots strap recommends
using a paragraph element let's present
this famous code by Benjamin Franklin
using the block code element so let's
flip to visual studio let's use the
block code element and since the code
that we want to present is a simple text
code I'm going to wrap that inside the
paragraph element as recommended by
bootstrap and the code itself is by
failing to prepare you are preparing to
fail so let's save our changes and when
we reload this page notice that famous
code is displayed using the block code
element now we also want this footer and
to get that footer within the block code
element I am going to use footer element
and the footer text is this famous code
is by Benjamin Franklin let's save our
changes and when we reload this page
notice we get the footer as well now
when I hover over Benjamin Franklin the
name should also be displayed as a
tooltip as you can see here and to
achieve that I'm going to wrap Benjamin
Franklin inside site element and then
whatever we want as a tooltip when we
hover the mouse over let's include that
as the value for title attribute so
let's save our changes and let's reload
this and look at this when I have a our
Benjamin Franklin we see the title
attribute value displayed as a tooltip
and at the moment the block code content
is left-aligned if you want this to be
right
then all you have to do is use a class
on the block code element and that class
is block code rivers let's save our
changes reload the page notice now the
content is right aligned as expected and
here is the complete example it's now
look at lists for creating an ordered
list use oil and alai tags here is an
example we have an ordered list with
five different country names when we
reload this page notice the country
names are now presented using unordered
list for creating unordered lists use ul
and Li tags let's convert this ordered
list to unordered list to do that I'm
going to use ul tag instead of over L
tag when we reload this page notice the
country names are now presented using
unordered list to place all list items
of an ordered or unordered list on a
single line use list in line class at
the moment notice every list item is
present in its own line if you want all
these list items on a single line then
use lists in line class notice when we
reload the page all the list items are
in a single line to remove the default
list style of ordered and unordered list
use list unstyled a class now first
let's remove this class so this is
unordered list when we reload this page
now the default style for unordered list
is that we get a bullet against every
list item if you want to remove that
default list style use list unstyled
class when we reload this page the
bullets should be removed for creating a
list of terms with their associated
descriptions use DL DT and DD tags here
is an example in the interest of time I
have already typed the required HTML so
let's copy it from our notepad and paste
it right here
so we have our description list here and
we have the term asp.net and the
description for that term so asp.net is
a framework for developing web
applications similarly we have another
description term here and it's
description another term and its
description so let's save our changes
and when we reload this notice we have
our description term and the description
so we have the term here and the
description here term here and
description here so by default they
display like this but if you want a
horizontal you know term and description
if you want both of them to be lined up
side by side then use this class DL -
horizontal on the description list so
let's go ahead and use that + let's save
our changes and when we reload this page
notice now we have the term and
description side by side in the same
line in our next video well discuss
working with bootstrap list groups thank
you for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
