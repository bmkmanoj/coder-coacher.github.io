benkard this is part 21 inheritance in
c-sharp in this session we will learn
why inheritance advantages of
inheritance inheritance syntax and a few
concepts related to inheritance so let's
first look at an example of ye be
actually required inheritance now if you
look at these two classes on the slide
we have full-time employee and part-time
employee two types of employees working
within our organization now whether if
he is a full-time or a part-time
employee there are certain things that
are common to them like first name last
name email and you know calculating and
printing the full name of that employee
you know most of this code is actually
common between these two classes if you
look at these two classes there is a
slight difference you know for a
full-time employee we we have yearly
salary whereas for a part-time employee
we have
hourly rate so now that's the only
difference basic difference between
these two classes in reality there might
be several differences but just to
illustrate you know why we might have to
use inheritance you know let's take this
example so the difference between these
two classes is that you know this
employee has a yearly salary field
whereas part-time employee has an hourly
rate feel okay so these two classes
instead of duplicating a lot of these
discs oon between these two classes what
we can actually do is we can abstract
away most of the common code into the
base class as you see here now what is
the advantage of doing this number one
you get code reuse and when you get code
review so it could reuse the amount of
code the testing team has to test is
drastically reduced and the amount of
code that is there in in the application
is also reduced because of which you
know the probability of errors within
that code is also reduced so it could
save a lot of time as well as you know
it could also prevent from unwanted
errors within the application so
inheritance promotes reusability and
with that we get you know savings of
time and you know the probability of
less number of errors there it also
uses errors okay so if you look at this
we actually have rewritten this class
all the common functionalities in the
base class right now and you know
basically whatever are specific to
full-time employee or part-time employee
they are only present in that respective
classes so in our example only year's
salary was specific to time employee and
hourly rate was specific to part-time
employee
so these class specific code is present
in those respective classes whereas the
common code is abstracted away into the
base class so that it can be reused
across these two derived classes now
let's go ahead and look at an example of
how to do this okay so if I have to
create an employee you know class public
class you know this is going to be a
base class public class employee and in
this base class we are going to have all
of our common properties like first name
last name email and then full-name so
public string first name
and similarly they'll have his last name
and maybe email actually let's get rid
of the public access modifier for fields
it's not a good habit to have public
access modifier when we talk about
properties will come to know why so
string email so these are common to both
full-time employee and part-time
employee so print full name so basically
all this piece of code is common to both
types of employees now let's say I'm
going to create
our full-time employee
so full-time employee that this person
is going to inherit from the employee
class now this is a syntax for
inheritance your base class
I mean you derived class : your base
class so now what happens whatever is
present in this employee class will also
be available to your derived class okay
so basically I mean these fields are
private now at the moment but since if
they are public they will be available
to your class we look at those a little
while later you know we create fields
and then surrounding them we actually
create properties so that they will be
available to your derived class so
similarly here what is specific to a
full-time employee maybe a nearly celery
soup float eerily celery and similarly I
can go ahead and create a part-time
employee class so part-time employee
class inheriting from the employee this
piece of code again will be available to
this class and then this part-time
employee may have something like hourly
rate
hourly rate for now let's make this
public so these are available too but
keep in mind making your fields public
is not at all suggested in real time
instead we make our fields private and
expose those private fields to the
external world using properties which
we'll be looking at in a later session
so similarly let's make this public and
thus public we will be talking about
access modifiers as well in a later
session here the idea is to learn about
inheritance let's concentrate on that
concept okay so now we have created
full-time employee part-time employee
now I can go ahead and create my
full-time employee
so full-time employee FTE is equal to
new full-time employee I look at this
full-time employee object you know it
doesn't have the print full name prop
you know method or it doesn't have
first-name lastname
you know properties but still I will be
able to use them so for example FTE dot
you know you can basically say first
name is equal to maybe regime and
similarly we can say ft dot last name is
equal to tech so I'm able to initialize
the table jecht with these two
properties you know in spite of that
code for a full-time employee non
presenting not present here it since
this class is inheriting from the
employee class all these will be
available to your full-time employee so
similarly I can go ahead and call the
print full name method as well and even
that property is not present in this
class I mean that method is not present
in this class and the employee are
full-time employees specific feel that
which is yearly salary so yearly salary
is equal to whatever may be
fifty thousand five hundred thousand
whatever okay now look at this on the
other hand you will not have access to
hourly rate because that field is
specific to part-time employee and if
you look at here we are creating an
object of full-time employee so your
full-time object full-time employee
object will have access to all the cool
that's present in the base class plus
whatever code specific here so in a way
we can say this is this full-time
employee class is actually a
specialization of your employee class in
the sense it has all the capabilities of
your base class class additional
capability that is present in that class
so your derived class is actually a
specialization of your base class I mean
we can compare this to like you know a
general surgeon versus a specialized
doctor for example if you take you know
maybe a gynecologist she'll be able to
perform the duties of the generals
general surgeon as well as she
specialized in gynecology so at times
she can even be you know behave as a
general general surgeon okay so that's
kind of basically the difference between
a parent and a derived class so now we
don't have any implementation here but
if you want some implementation you know
we have seen in the other examples if we
want to print the full name we can make
use of the consume class to write line
and we can say first-name plus and then
give it space and maybe last name okay
so now if we go ahead and drop this you
will see obviously a full-time employee
object is created and its first and last
name is printed there similarly I mean
if you want to create a part-time
employee you can exactly do the same
thing and whatever is present in your
base class is actually available to your
part-time employee as well so part-time
employee dot first-name so that's still
available so maybe we will call this
part
and similarly last name is equal to
maybe time and then if you look at this
this object will have access to hourly
rate from the intelligence you can see
that it has access to hourly rate but
not yearly salad because yearly salary
is specific to full-time employee and
similarly we can also call the print
full name in this case part-time will be
printed so presumed Ekstrom the
full-time employee object part-time from
the part-time annually object so
basically inheritance allows could you
could reuse so why inheritance you know
in object-oriented programming we have
four pillars inheritance encapsulation
abstraction polymorphism and inheritance
one of the primary pillars of
object-oriented programming okay
several other concepts are actually
based on inheritance if you have to
understand polymorphism you need to
understand inheritance properly so so
that's the primary pillar of the
object-oriented programming it allows
code reuse we have just seen an example
and when we reuse code it can reduce
time errors and we have also seen that
we will specify all the common fields
properties methods in the base class
which allows reusability in the derived
class we will only have fields
properties and methods that are specific
to those respective derived classes okay
we have looked at an example of
inheritance syntax as well you know you
will have a parent class and the
implementation of that as you can see in
the slide and the derived class
you you include a coolin and then
specify the parent class we have seen
that within our example so here we have
our derived class for example part-time
employee : employee the parent class ok
in this exam
derived class inherits from parent class
c-sharp supports only single class
inheritance that's very important to
understand ok c-sharp does not support
multiple class inheritance in the sense
for your given class you can only have
one base class at a given point of time
I cannot specify another base class
let's say for example this part-time
employee class is inheriting from base
employee class let's say I have another
class maybe public class a this is
another class now
can I make my part-time employee class
inherit from employee class as well as
you know class a at the same time this
is not practical if we try to build this
build solution we will get an error
cannot help multiple base classes no
part-time employee cannot have multiple
to remember a class can have only one
base class at a given time but however
multi-level class inheritance is
possible for example part-time employees
inheriting from employee class so you
can say plus a inherit from part-time
employee class now this class a will
have all the properties all the code
that's available in part-time employee
plus the code that's available in
employee so if somebody now goes ahead
and create an an a object so let's say a
a one is equal to new a now what happens
a one will have access to everything
that's available in part-time employee
as well as employee so in in part-time
employee we have hourly rate in employee
we have the rest of the properties as
you can see them so multiple class
inheritance at the same time it's not
possible but multi-level class
inheritance is possible class a and
editing from Class B and Class C inherit
from Class A maybe so the the
multi-level class inheritance is
possible
okay but remember c-sharp supports
multiple interface inheritance at the
same time you know but we haven't spoken
about interfaces yet probably we'll
cover that in a later session but just I
want to bring that point here so that
it's there in the back of your minds but
we'll do an example of that and we
actually talk about interfaces so
remember c-sharp doesn't support
multiple class inheritance but it
supports multiple interface inheritance
okay and another point to keep in mind
is child classes a specialization of
base class which we have already seen
you know our part-time employee
full-time employee you know it's
actually a specialization or employee
class in the sense it can do everything
that your base class can do plus
whatever is specific in that class so in
a way it's a specialization of the
parent class okay base classes are
automatically instantiated before
derived classes and this is another
important concept to actually understand
let's get rid of this one so anytime we
create an instance of a child class okay
here full-time employees a child class
so anytime you create an instance with
this child it lasts it automatically
creates an instance of base class in the
sense before the child class constructor
gets executed before the child class
constructor gets executed
the base class constructor will be
automatically executed and it makes
sense because look at this this print of
full name is actually an instance method
now if you are new to methods and if you
are new to you know understanding this
difference between static and instance
methods please refer to my previous
video tutorials we have discussed that
there okay now here print full name
print full name is actually an instance
method which is defined in our employee
class now if you have to invoke an
instance method we know that we need to
have an instance of that class so
obviously and this this principal name
is actually present in the parent class
and if you look at the main method what
we are doing here is actually creating
an object of type full-time employed the
derived class we are not creating an
instance in the parent class but
printful name is present in the parent
employee class so if that method has to
be available for this object then that
class needs to be instantiated even
before we can create an object of this
class okay so when you try to create an
instance with your child class the
parent class gets instantiated even
before that so parent class constructors
are called before
Chael the class constructors let's
actually look at a simple example of
that so that it makes sense so let's get
rid of all this code I mean in terms of
just looking at it as a parent class in
the base class so public class parent
class okay and let's say public parent
class and we'll say console.writeline
parent class constructor called okay so
if you look at this we have a parent
class and it has a parent class
constructor similarly we can say Oh
Blake class chil the class inheriting
from parent class and we can have a
child class constructor so obviously
public child class and probably we can
say copy-paste are there and if you look
at this tail the class constructor call
now if you look at this cool it's pretty
simple we have a parent class a
constructor within that trails last a
constructor within that and now if we go
ahead and create an object of child
class so change the class CC is equal to
new child class you're only doing that
so you're creating an object of the
child's class but look at this we know
the fact that you know before chalice
objects are created children in a parent
class objects that gets created
so obviously parent class constructor
needs to be called so when I go ahead
and run that you see that parent class
constructor called child class
constructor called do we are not
explicitly calling you know parent class
we are explicitly not creating middle
class object okay on the other hand
let's say for example in the parent
class I have another constructor and
remember we can overload constructors we
have seen this as well in our previous
video sessions so let's overload a
constructor maybe I want to pass in
something like a string data type so
string message
okay now console dot write line all we
have to do is let's print that message
okay now if you look at this one the
parent class has two constructors okay
one which takes parameter and the one
and the other one which doesn't take the
parameter now when I go ahead and create
this Chancellors object obviously we
know that parent class constructors are
called but which one of them will be
called by default the parameter less one
will be called which means this
constructor will be called let's go
ahead and run that so parent class
constructor call which is the parameter
less constructor but on the other hand
let's say when I create a child class
object okay when I create this child's
last object I always want to make sure
this constructor gets called so I pass
in a message and that message can be
used to initialize some of the fields in
the parent class so how do I ensure that
you know the constructor of my choice in
the parent class gets called when I
create a child class object so how can
we do that that you can actually control
using the base keywords base
and then look at that your parent class
so base you know base keyword refers to
your parent class so we know that in the
parent class there are two constructors
and the intelligence clearly shows that
one constructor without parameters
another constructor with the message and
now you can pass whatever message you
want here for example let us say message
from or you know derive the class
control end parent class okay basically
from the derived class we are
controlling which constructor gets
called when an instance of this parent
class gets created okay so now when I go
ahead and run this instead of this
constructor getting call this
constructor gets called and it end and
you know this message gets passed into
this constructor that message is printed
and next the child constructor call will
appear so derived class controlling
parent class child class constructor
call okay so it's also possible that for
the derived classes to control which
constructors keep called when parent
class objects are created okay
