venket this is part 57 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll discuss
about opening a new window using
JavaScript method window dot open before
continuing with the session I strongly
recommend to watch parts 54 55 and 56 of
this video series in asp.net there are
different page navigation techniques as
you can see on the slide we've been
discussing about the techniques from one
to five in the previous sessions of this
video series in this session we'll see
how to use window dot open method let's
look at a simple example first let's
flip to visual studio I have an asp.net
web application project here with the
two web forms on web form one I've got
two text box controls where the user can
enter their name and the email now let's
drag and drop a button control onto this
waveform let's first add a row to this
table so right click in the TD insert
row below now every row in this table
has got two TD so the new row also has
got two TVs but we just need one TD
within the row so I'm going to delete
one of the TDS and I'm going to set the
call span attribute of this TD to two so
that this TD width spans across the
width of two TDs
okay now let's drag and drop a button
control onto this waveform now in visual
studio we have two button controls the
standard asp.net server side button
control and the HTML button control now
which one of those to be used now now
look at this we are going to open web
form to in a new window using the
JavaScript method window dot open now we
know that JavaScript runs on the client
browser okay so we don't really need the
asp.net server side button control for
that it's enough if we use the HTML
button so let me drag and drop the HTML
button from the toolbox so under HTML
tab you can find the HTML button so
let's drag and drop that so the value
here I'm going to save this as an HTML
button and this is going to use the
window open technique and let's also set
the style width property so width : I'm
going to set that to 300 pixels okay so
if I flip to the design mode you can see
the text there the value that appears on
the button now obviously when I click
this button what should happen we should
open web form to in a new window and how
do we do that
using window dot open method so the
simplest way to do that is this HTML
button has got an on click event so on
click I want to open a new window so I
can use the window objects open method
for that so window dot open and with
this method we can pass in the name of
the web form that we want to open in a
new window in our case we want to open
the form to dot aspx so I'm going to
copy the name of that waveform and pass
that to this method that's it we are
done so let me run this project now so
when I click that HTML button the
JavaScript is going to run on the client
browser and open web form to in a new
window
okay so I have two tabs here on the
first tab here on webform one so the
form 2 is now opened in its own tab okay
so basically we can use window dot open
to open a webform in a new window now if
you look at the syntax of this function
it has got four parameters and all these
parameters are optional including the
URL now if you look at the example that
we have done so far here the open method
is taking in the name of the web form
that we want to open and we said this is
optional so if we delete that and if I
run this now and click on the button
what or which web form is going to be
opened in the new window let's see what
happens when I click this now when I
click this now look at that a new window
is opened in a new tab and then it has
about : blank so that's what will happen
if you don't specify the web form that
you want to open in the new window so
now let's look at the parameters and
their purpose okay and to do that you
can actually visit my blog I have the
description there so on my blog you can
see that URL this is an optional
parameter the URL of the page to open if
URL is not specified and new
with about : Blanc is open and we have
just seen that and then the name this
parameter is also optional and this
parameter can be used for two purposes
you know you can use that for specifying
the name of the new window or you can
use that parameter to specify the target
attribute as well so now let's actually
look at a practical example now what we
want to do is if you look at this
webform one you have you know two text
box controls where the user can enter
their name and email and once they click
this button we want to open web form too
and if you look at web form to this
platform two has got two labeled
controls so whatever name and email that
we enter on this web form one we want to
display those on these label controls
and we want to do that using javascript
and the easiest way to do that is to
write a custom javascript function okay
so let me go to webform one and flip
into the source mode and then scroll all
the way up to the head section in the
head section we can write our custom
JavaScript function so let's use the
script tag script type is equal to
specify the type as text slash
JavaScript and then there we want to
write our function so function let's
call this function as open a new window
you can give it any name you want so
open new window and then the first thing
that we want to do is we want to
retrieve the name and email that the
user types into these text boxes and we
know that name will be in txt name
textbox and email will be in B txt email
text box so how do I get those you know
a reference to that text box using the
document object so the document the
JavaScript document object has got a
function called get element by ID get
the element by ID and the ID of the text
box is txt name and then once you have
the textbox control you have the value
property which returns the value within
the textbox and let me create a variable
called where name is equal to that
and we do the same thing to retrieve the
email so variable email is equal to and
email is present in txt email text box
okay so now we can use the window dot
open method so when do dot open now look
at this the intelligence of Visual
Studio shows us the different parameters
this method expects the URL we have seen
the purpose of the URL parameter and the
name you can use this parameter to
specify the name of the window or you
can also use this parameter to specify
the value for the target attribute so I
want to open webform to dot aspx so
webform - dot aspx and to this webform
you know I want to pass the values for
name and email whatever the user enters
into the text box and the best way to do
that is by using query strings we
haven't spoken about query strings yet
in this video series we will be talking
about them in a later video session but
remember that using query strings you
can pass values from one web form to
another web form now in our case we want
to pass the name and email values from
webform 1 to web form 2 so I'm going to
use query strings question mark
indicates the beginning of a query
string and I'm going to call this maybe
name of user or you can just say name
whatever you want so name of user is
equal to so various name coming from the
name is coming from the name variable
here and similarly I can pass in the
email so question mark indicates the
beginning of the query string and
ampersand indicates I'm going to add
another query string so you can add as
many query strings as you want using the
ampersand symbol so I'm going to say
email is equal to and various email
coming from the email is coming from
this variable email so I'm going to use
that variable there so that's my first
parameter that's the name of the
parameter that's the name of the user
and that's the email okay so the next
parameter is the name we can use that
parameter to specify you know basically
the name of the window or the values for
the target attribute so
now if you specify the target attribute
as blank then webform two will be opened
in a new window that's the default
anyway if you don't specify anything you
know the when the webform two will be
opened in a new window
or if you specify itself then within the
same window of a form two will be open
we want waveform 2 to be opened in a new
window so I'm going to set that to
underscore blank okay so that's the
second parameter and third parameter
features and these are very useful and
using these features parameter you can
customize various aspects of the new
window so if I go to this now you can
see here maybe for example if you want a
scroll bars in the new window you can
set scroll scroll bars is equal to s or
1 or otherwise you can use no or 0
similarly if you want toolbars you can
specify that if you want status bar if
you want menu bar or whether you want to
show the address bar or not so for now
let's say I don't want to show the
address bar so I'm going to set location
is equal to no and then I'm also going
to say you know resizable is equal to no
I don't want the user to be resizing the
vendor so I'm going to say resizable is
equal to now and then the final
parameter is free place we'll talk about
that parameter in just a bit so I'm just
going to pass true for that so if you
look at that replace parameter it's a
boolean parameter which accepts true or
false for now I'm going to pass in true
we'll talk about that just in a bit
because that's applicable only if you're
opening in the same window if you are
opening waveform too in the same vendor
that's when that parameter is applicable
so we'll talk about that at that point
of time ok so that's it we are done so
now when you run this ok let's close
these windows let me close that window
so I enter the name of the user prism
and maybe email pragya Matt presume
techcom ok now look at this when I click
this button so a new window is opened
okay now all we have done so far is we
have written the JavaScript function but
we are not really calling that when we
click this pattern so on click of that
button we have to call the JavaScript
function so instead of the hard-coded
window dot open I'm going to call that
function there and the name of the
function is open new window so let's
copy that and when you specify the
function you also have to specify the
opening and closing places there okay so
let's run this now obviously when we
click this button now it's going to
invoke that function and that function
will open the new window okay so let's
enter the name and email and then click
this button control so it's going to
open a new window look at that a new
window is opened and look at what we
have specified in the features you know
in the features we have specified we
don't want you know the location is
equal to no means we don't want the
address bar so the user will not be able
to change this address bar and we said
resizable is equal to no so he won't be
able to resize this window so see that
there is no that doubles double sided
arrow
we can't resize this window and look at
the URL the URL perform two dot aspx
name of the user the query string that
we passed them and the name whatever we
entered into the textbox is pressing and
email is equal to whatever email that we
entered there now we can actually
retrieve those values and display them
on the web form so let's see on web form
- how to read those query string values
to read the query string values we can
use the request objects or request dot
it has got query string and I can pass
in the name of the query string and if
you remember the name of the query
string is name of the user there so I'm
going to pass that that's the first
query string and then I'm going to set
that as the text for label name so LBL
name dot text is equal to that and along
the same lines we are going to retrieve
de mail so the name of the querystring
there what is email and we are going to
display that in email label that's it
so let's run this now so now we are
passing query string parameters to
perform - on webform - we are harvesting
those values and displaying them in the
label controls so let me say presume and
maybe test as the email I click this
button look at that new window is open
presume is the name test is the email
okay now just to expand on this now
let's set this you know the name
parameter to underscore self now when we
set that to self underscore self instead
of opening waveform - in a new window
it's going to open that in the same
window so first let me run this so when
the waveform loads and in the meantime
if you look at the last parameter the
last parameter is replaced it's a
boolean parameter that specifies whether
the URL creates a new entry or replaces
the current entry in the windows history
so we have this window now it doesn't
have any history this webform one at the
moment now let me type in pledgie m--
and then let me type in test ok and
click this HTML button look at that it's
opened in the same window and look at
this back and forward buttons they are
disabled okay now that's because now the
history is not maintained the window
history is not maintained here and
that's because we have set the replays
property to true and if you set the
replays property to true URL replaces
the current document in the history list
and that's why you don't have the
history here so webform one entry in the
browser history in this window history
is replaced by webform two that's why
you are not able to move back and forth
but on the other hand if I said that to
false and run this now now it won't
replace you know
the history so on webform one let's type
something and then click that button
look at that I can go back on the button
is enabled I can go back and come back
to waveform 2 so that's about the
replace parameter the last parameter of
the window dot open function okay let's
set this back to blank all right so we
have seen now how to use the HTML input
I'm in HTML button control to open a new
window can we do that using an asp.net
server side button control absolutely so
let's copy this TR and paste that so
that we get another row and instead of
the HTML button control I'm going to use
the standard asp.net button control so
go to the standard tab drag and drop the
button control and let's call this
asp.net button and again this is going
to use the window dot open technique and
then let's set ups that has to be the
text and let's set the IDS button too so
text of this button is going to be that
and let's set the width is equal to 300
pixels okay so now we have this is the
asp.net button so when I click this I
just want to do the same thing now the
asp.net server side button control has
got on client click property so on
client click can specify the same
function here so on client click open
this function that said so now when we
run this whether you click the HTML
button or the standard asp.net server
side control you know you will be open
it you'll be able to open a web form to
in a new window so it's type in test and
test as the email I click this button
look at that it opens in a new window
now we have seen how to do that in the
HTML in the HTML source can I open you
know a new window using the server-side
absolutely and the way you do that is
okay let's do that when I click this
button so let me get rid of this
onclientclick attribute so when I get
rid of that then I can double click this
button control the event handler gets
generated and here we can write the code
so basically look at this what do we
want to do we want to you know open a
new window so all we have to do for that
is invoke that JavaScript function
window open okay and to do that from
server side what you have to do is first
let's build it that string which will
have the JavaScript so I'm going to call
this string STR JavaScript and here I'm
going to specify the script now all we
want to do is we want to build a
function like this within the code so we
want to build a function like this
within this code so I'm going to say and
the code behind so script okay instead
of typing that I'm going to copy that
from here or we'll just quickly type it
so script and then here we need to
specify window open so what do we want
to open here we want to open web form -
dot aspx and you can also pass in the
query string so wave form - dot aspx and
i want to pass the query strings so one
the name of one of the query strings is
name of user so we're going to pass that
here so name of the user and since this
is the server-side code where is the
name of the user coming from it's coming
from txt name textbox so name of the
user and then that's going to come from
so let's get rid of that there so to
that we want to append txt name dot txt
okay and then we also want to pass
another query string which is nothing
but email and where is email coming from
email is coming from
txt email text box so basically here we
are
dynamically building the query string
that we want to have executed I mean the
JavaScript basically that we want to
execute so so we have waveform to dot
aspx name of the user and then the name
email and then the email from the
textbox and then what we need to do
basically is close the single quote and
close the closing brace of this window
dot open method and then finally close
the script tag so we have to build that
dynamically so I'm going to first close
the single quote close the closing brace
of the function and then so that's this
closing brace so once that is done we
need to close maybe you can put a
semicolon if you want and then close the
script tag that's it so that's the
JavaScript that we want to execute so
now I can use response dot write and
then all you do is use this JavaScript
so what happens when the browser
encounters this JavaScript it's going to
execute that okay so let's run this now
and see what happens so now if you look
at this on the in the HTML for that
server-side asp.net button control you
don't have the on client click property
so it's going to post back to the server
and within the post back event it's
going to build the script
javascript dynamically and then execute
that when it encounters this response
tort right so let's run this now
so when the webform loads we we can type
in something into these text boxes test
and test I click this button so it pulls
back look at that it is opening a new
window okay so I have a form one here
and waveform two and we have just seen
how to do that using the server-side
code on this slide you can find
resources for asp.net c-sharp and sequel
server interview questions that's it for
today thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
