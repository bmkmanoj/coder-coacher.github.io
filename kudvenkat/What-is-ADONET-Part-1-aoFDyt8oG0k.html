venket this is part one of ATO dotnet
video series in this session we'll learn
about what a do dotnet is what are
dotnet data providers so what's a do
dotnet a do dotnet is not a different
technology altogether in simple terms
you can think of a do dotnet as a set of
classes or framework that can be used to
interact with data sources like
databases and XML files the data from
these data sources can then be consumed
in any dotnet application Adu stands for
Microsoft ActiveX data object asp.net
web applications Windows applications
and console applications these are a few
of the different types of dotnet
applications that uses a dotnet to
connect to a database execute commands
and then retrieve data and display the
data within those applications let's
actually look at a simple example of how
to actually connect to a database
retrieve you know execute some commands
against that database and then retrieve
data and display it in an application so
let's flip to visual studio here I have
a simple asp.net web application and on
this webform let's drag and drop a grid
view control we haven't spoken about
grid view control let we'll be talking
about that in a later session the idea
of this session is basically to give you
an introduction to a do dotnet so let's
drag and drop the grid view control and
you can find the grid view control and
the data tab so expand that drag and
drop the grid view control on to the
webform and then you can for auto format
that to make it look nicer
let's select brown-sugar click OK now go
to the code-behind file now look at this
this is dotnet applicationnow this
dotnet application has to connect to a
sequel server and execute a sequel
command retrieve data and display that
within this dotnet application now if
you look at dotnet and sequel server
they are two different technologies now
sequel server will not understand C
sharp or VB or any dotnet programming
languages sequel server only understands
SQL so from within your dot net
application you know if this dotnet
application
to get the data available in sequel
server and in sequel server I have a
table called TBL product and that's
present in this sample table so
obviously if the dotnet application has
to communicate with sequel server and
retrieve data from there the dotnet
application first must establish a
connection to sequel server next it has
to prepare a sequel command and issue
that command to the server and execute
that and once you have the results back
display that within the application so
obviously we first need to create a
connection okay now remember we are
connecting to the sequel server so all
the classes that helped me to connect to
sequel server present in a namespace
called system dot data dot sequel client
ok system door data dot sequel client so
first of all I need to establish the
sequel connection so sequel connection
Korn is equal to new sequel connection
now don't worry about these objects you
know we will be talking about them in a
very great detail in a later session the
idea of this session is basically to
understand or to have a high-level
overview of what a do dotnet is all
about ok so obviously to connect to a
sequel server you need to tell to this
connection object what's the name of the
server and within that so which database
do you want to connect to and what's the
user ID and password to connect so you
have to provide that information to this
connection object otherwise it will not
be able to connect to the sequel server
so I will have to use
you know data source property and data
source is equal to dot which means
connect to a local instance of sequel
server database is equal to sample so if
you look at the database here within
which we have our table it's the sample
database and I'm going to specify
integrated security is equal to SS PA
now what does this mean this means that
I'm using windows authentication to
connect to the sequel server now again
as I told you don't worry too much about
this object here and about this
connection string we'll be talking about
them in great detail in next parts in
this video series here the whole idea is
to get in high-level overview of what a
do dotnet is all about and what do we
mean by dotnet data providers ok so I
have this equal connection object the
next thing is we have to prepare the
sequel command
so obviously sequel only understands I
mean sequel server only understands SQL
so we have to issue the sequel command
from within the dotnet application so
let's prepare the sequel command and to
prepare that I use the SQL command
object SQL command CMD is equal to new
sequel command and then we need to
specify the command so select star from
TBL product and execute this command
using this connection object so you have
to pass that as parameter as well ok so
we have the command now open the
connection so I'm opening the connection
now after you open the connection to the
sequel server
execute the command so execute reader
this is this will execute the command
and retrieve the results from the
database so once I execute execute this
method it's going to return that data
back in the form of a sequel data reader
so I'm going to store that in a sequel
data reader object let's call it as RDR
so when I execute this command using
this method look at the intelligence the
intelligence says it's going to return a
sequel data reader object so I'm storing
that results back in that object and
then all I am doing is we have this grid
view one control I'm setting the
datasource property of that control to
RDR meaning whatever data that we have
caught back you know assign that to the
data source property of the grid you can
draw and then finally call grid v1 dot
data bind so bind the data and then
finally close the connection all right
so it seems so simple until now ok so if
you look at this as I told you don't
worry too much of this too much about
this code we are going to talk about
every object that we see here in a very
great detail in later sessions all right
so we are preparing the connect
no object using this connection string
we are telling which database in which
server we want to connect to and then
you're preparing the sequel command
object and then you're telling execute
this command on this connection object
open the connection execute the command
whatever result you get back stood that
in this sequel data reader object and
then use that data reader as the data
source for your grid grid view control
and then call the data bind method so
now obviously when we run this
application what should happen the
dotnet application should establish a
connection to the sequel server issue
this command select star from TBL
product execute that retrieve the result
and bind that to this grid view control
that we have and as you can see the
result is here now if you notice here
I'm connecting to the sequel server okay
so my my backhand is sequel server for
this application for the.net application
now can a dotnet application get data
from an Oracle database absolutely it
can get data from any database okay any
any database not only databases even
from XML files text files etc okay now
okay we know how to connect to sequel
server now how do I connect to Oracle
server now again it's very simple now
can I use the sequel connection object
sequel command and sequel data reader
objects to connect to Oracle database no
different databases use different
protocols so obviously there are no
Universal set of classes that can
actually accomplish that so if you want
to connect to sequel server you are
using the class a sequel connection
sequel commands sequel data reader
that's present in this namespace system
door data dot sequel client okay now
let's say I want to connect to an Oracle
database then how do I do that
now you know if you know how to connect
to one database then connecting to
another database is no big deal
it's just that you use a different class
I mean different objects but the concept
is the same you have to prepare the
connection object you have to prepare
the command you have to execute that and
then store the results in a reader
object and then bind that to a control
so
let's look at that so let's say I want
to let's comment these lines for the
time being actually let me copy those
and then comment those lines so I'm
copying them let's paste that let's
uncomment these lines now so now if I
want to connect to Oracle database all I
do is instead of saying sequel
connection
I say Oracle connection and remember
this Oracle connection is actually
present if you look at if I say system
dot go to definition this is present in
system door data
Oracle client namespace okay so Oracle
connection is equal to new Oracle
connection and instead of using sequel
command as you might have guessed by now
you use Oracle command is equal to new
Oracle command because the data source
that I am talking to is now going to be
Oracle and again instead of sequel data
reader Oracle data reader command or
look at this the exact same code all I
have changed is instead of using sequel
connection I'm using Oracle connection
instead of using sequel command we are
using Oracle command instead of using
sequel data reader we are using Oracle
data reader okay and another difference
is that this Oracle connection is
actually present in system dot data
Oracle client namespace so what we can
say from this is that if you look at the
presentation data provider dotnet data
provided for sequel server is system
door data dot sequel client meaning all
the classes that will help us connect to
sequel server execute commands and then
retrieve data back are present in system
door data dot sequel client and if the
database is Oracle then those set of
classes are present in system dot data
dot Oracle client
another common naming pattern that you
have to observe here is if its sequel
server the prefix that we are using is
SQL if it's oracle the prefix for the
objects that we are using is oracle
oracle connection oracle command Oracle
data reader
and similarly if the data source is an
oily DB data source or LED video data
sources meaning data sources like
Microsoft Access Excel etc okay so if
you want to connect to them and then get
data you use oledb connection oily DB
command etc or LED B data reader and
those are present in the namespace
systems or data led B so I can now say
if I want to connect when oily DB data
source or LED B look at that LED we
commando led B connection will oledb
data adapter now what Israeli DB data
adapter don't worry about that we are
going to talk about that later in this
series okay and similarly if you want to
connect to any ODBC data source you use
ODBC connection ODBC command ODBC data
adapter etc okay so basically data
provider means the set of classes that
can actually talk to a specific data
source and then provide data to a dotnet
application so we can say dotnet data
provider for sequel server is system
door data dot sequel client because all
the classes that can help us to connect
to sequel server are actually present in
system data or sequel client namespace
okay so these are different dotnet data
providers and it's very important that
we understand these terms you know
because that makes our communication at
workplaces is a and not only that when
you read some articles on the Internet
there's a lot of technical jargon so if
you want to understand those articles
properly it's important that we
understand these terms okay so just to
give you I mean if you if you look at
this here this is a web application
right we were able to connect to a
sequel server database using web
application now using dotnet it's not
just web applications that we develop we
can develop friend with applications
console applications web services you
know there are there are different types
of applications that we can develop the
dotnet so all the web applications you
know I mean all the different types of
applications use if at all if they want
to display data then
they have to use ad or dotnet so it's
not just specific to an asp.net web
application developer everybody needs to
know ad or dotnet okay so here if you
look at this web vendors console any
type of dot up dotnet application uses
ad or dotnet okay with an ad or dotnet
we know that we have got let me actually
show you an example here we have just
seen how to work with a console
application I actually have a Windows
application that I have just written now
you know which can connect to a sequel
server so if you look at this I have
windows forms application in windows
forms application we have a control
called data grid view control so if you
look at the form this control is the
data grid view control that I have
dragged and dropped on this form and if
you look at the you know code behind for
that form look at that I am using sequel
connection sequel command signal data
reader and then I am using that as the
data source for our grid view control I
am closing the connection so whether it
is Windows or web you know you still use
ad or dotnet so when I run this
application see that it's the same data
my Windows application is using a do
dotnet to connect to a data source in
this case sequel server
you know retrieve data and display it so
no matter what type of dotnet
application you are developing if at all
if that if you want that application to
work with some databases then you will
have to use ad or dotnet so any type of
Daughter button tap location use this ad
or dotnet with an ad or dotnet we know
there are several objects connection
object command object data reader object
these three objects we have seen today
you know a simple example and there is
also data adapter object okay we will
talk about these objects in detail going
forward okay and then there is this data
set which is colored differently
you know depending on the provider the
connection command data reader and data
adapter objects are going to have a
different prefix for example if the
provider is system door data dot sequel
client then it's going to be sequel
connection sequel commands sequel data
reader and sequel data adapter if you
are going to interact with Oracle
database then you use the system
Oracle client which is the dotnet data
provider for Oracle okay so in that case
the connection is going to be Oracle
connection Oracle command Oracle data
reader Oracle data adapter okay and the
same logic applies for oily DB and ODBC
data providers but whereas when you
consider data set you know we don't have
sequel data set or Oracle data set now
it's just this data set because you know
once we connect to a database you know
execute the commands and get the data
into dotnet we can store that in a data
set object okay in a disconnected
fashion so this is not tied to any
provider in fact this data set is
actually present in system dot data
namespace it's not present in the
provider namespace so if you actually go
back to you know our application so when
you say system dot data dot look at that
I can find the data set within system
dot data set okay so this is not present
in system dot data dot sequel client or
system data Oracle client okay it's not
provided specific that's why I color
that a little different we will be
talking about these objects anyway in a
greater detail in the next sessions of
this video series okay and then these
different providers talk to different
data bases sequel client obviously talks
- sequel server Oracle client talks to
Oracle oledb - oledb and many other data
sources there on this slide you can find
resources for asp.net c-sharp and signal
server interview questions that's it for
today thank you for listening
