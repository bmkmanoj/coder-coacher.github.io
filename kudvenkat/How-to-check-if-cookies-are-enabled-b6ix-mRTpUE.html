this video we'll discuss how to check if
cookies are enabled most websites rely
on browser cookies being enabled for
example if you have disabled cookies and
if you try to log into Gmail comm you
will receive an error message saying
your browser seems to have cookies
disabled make sure cookies are enable
I'll try opening a new browser window
let's look at this in action let's fire
up Google Chrome let's disable cookies
to disable cookies click on this button
on the top right hand corner of the
browser window and then select settings
from the context menu on the settings
page scroll all the way to the bottom
and you will find a link button which
says show advanced settings click on
that and then click on content settings
button under privacy an account in the
settings page select this radio button
block sites from setting any data and
then click done to save changes so we
have disabled cookies now let's navigate
to gmail.com let's enter a username and
a password and then click Sign In look
at that since we have cookies disabled
we get an error message saying your
browser seems to have cookies disabled
make sure cookies are enabled or try
opening in a new browser window and
let's see how to write some JavaScript
code so we can detect if the cookies are
enabled or disabled let's flip to visual
studio let's include it development and
give it an ID and within the script
section let's include a JavaScript
function let's name this cookies enabled
and inside this function let's include a
variable let's name this our cookies
enable navigator object has caught a
property called cookie enabled this is a
boolean property and most modern
browsers support this property this
property returns true if cookies are
enabled otherwise false however there
are certain old versions of the
browser's which don't support this
property to cater for those browsers
we're actually going to write a test
cookie
and then read the test cookie once again
if we can successfully read that test
cookie then we know that cookies are
enabled otherwise they are disabled so
let's include a ternary operator here so
basically for those versions of the
browser which don't support cookie
enabled property this expression you
know will be evaluated to undefined
and as a result false will be stored in
this variable or cookies enabled okay so
for those browsers which don't support
cookie enabled property let's go ahead
and write a test cookie and then read it
once again
so if navigated a cookie enable if
typeof navigator dot cookie enable is
equal to undefined so basically the
browsers that don't support this
property they're going to return
undefined so if it's undefined and if
the value within this variable is false
then let's write a test cookie so
document dot cookie equals my test
cookie and then let's read that cookie
again so document dot cookie dot let's
use index or function let's find the
index of the string my test cookie now
if we are able to successfully read my
test cookie then the index of that one
in our should not be equal to minus one
so if the index of my test cookie not
equal to minus one
so that's actually said the value of
this variable our cookies enabled each
filter if index of my test cookie is not
equal to minus 1 then we have
successfully read the cookie that means
cookies are enabled
so let's store this value true in this
variable else false if it is minus 1
then we were not able to read that test
cookie that means we are not able to set
that cookie which means cookies are
disabled and then finally we'll return
this variable our cookies enabled ok and
now let's go and use that function if
cookies enable if that function returns
true then within this development let's
display a message saying cookies are
enabled so document dot get element by
ID the ID of the div element is
MSG dot inner HTML equals cookies are
enabled
else cookies are disabled and at the
moment within Google Chrome we have
cookies disabled so let's actually
navigate to this page because that it
says cookies are disabled now let's
check this within Internet Explorer but
before we do that let's actually enable
cookies and then reload this page and
see what result we get back so let's go
to settings show advanced settings
content settings and then I love local
data to be said click done and let's
reload this page now we should get a
message saying cookies are enabled
look at that cookies are enabled now
let's check the same page in Internet
Explorer so let's fire up ie
let's navigate to the same page look at
that cookies are enabled and in IE to
disable cookies click on this you know
settings button on the top right hand
corner of the browsers window and then
select internet options click privacy
and then let's actually slide this all
the way to the top and look at that it
says block all cookies let's apply click
OK now let's reload this page look at
that now the browser says cookies are
disabled and here is the function that
we have just written thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
