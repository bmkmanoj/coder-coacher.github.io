this video we'll discuss the reentrant
concurrency mode and dave is here with
an example 300 concurrency mode allows
the WCF service to issue callbacks to
the client application let's understand
what we mean by this statement let's say
we've got a WCF service and a client
application and let's assume the WCF
service concurrency mode is set to
single that means only one thread is
allowed to access the service instance
at any given point of time now let's say
this client makes a request to the WCF
service and obviously the service
instance gets locked by the thread that
is currently executing this client
request so at this point no other thread
can access the service instance until
the current thread has completed and it
has released the lock now let's say
awhile the service instance is
processing the client request as part of
that processing the WCF service needs to
call back into the client application
now you may be wondering what would be
the need for a WCF service to call back
into the client application while it is
processing a client request now let's
say this client request is basically you
know a time consuming task for example
something like processing report as the
WCF service is processing you know the
report you know the percentage that has
been completed we want to communicate
that percentage completed back to the
client application so that the end user
knows you know what is the progress that
has been made so far okay so there's a
need for the WCF service to call back
into the client application and now
let's assume that callback operation is
not one-way okay so if there is a
request obviously there is going to be a
response for that call back from the
client application and that response
should reach the WCF service instance
but then that response cannot enter the
service instance at the moment that's
basically because you know the
concurrency mode is currently single
meaning
only one thread can access there is a
thread all the day you know which has
the lock on that service instance which
is currently executing this client
request it's already holding a lock on
that one and this response is they're
trying to get a hold of that service
instance so obviously it will not be
able to do that it will be blocked and
you know the WCF service now cannot
complete this client request processing
until it receives this response but the
response cannot enter so the client
request cannot complete it's waiting for
the response to come back but the
response cannot end the WCF service
instance because it's locked ok so there
is a deadlock situation before we
discuss how to resolve the deadlock
situation let's actually simulate you
know the deadlock so let's flip to
visual studio let's create a new project
here let's create a class library
project and let's call this report
service let's delete this class 1 dot cs
file that's what we generated to this
project let's add a new item we want to
add a WCF service and let's name our WCF
service report service and here we have
the service contract iReports service
and let's name our operation contract as
process report and let's say this you
know operation is going to take some
time basically to compute that report
and while you know the WCF service is
processing the report we want to you
know report the report processing that
has been completed so far back to the
client application and in order for us
to be able to do that we need to have a
callback contract so we need another
interface so let's copy that
and let's call this eye report service
callback
and we are going to have another
operation contract here and let's call
this report progress basically the
purpose of this method is to report you
know the percentage that has been
completed back to the client application
so in order to convey the percentage
let's use a parameter and let's call it
percentage completed and this is going
to be the callback contract for this WCF
service so we need to associate it
that's the callback contract that this
service contract so how do we do that
using callback contract parameter so
callback contract equals type of I
report service call back okay
so we have our service contracts now
let's go and implement you know this
operation contract
so within report service dot C s file
click on the interface I report service
plus control dot that will give us an
option to implement the interface
methods this interface at the moment has
got one method that is process report
which is our operation contract so here
we'll have the logic to process the
report but here we are not going to have
some real-time logic instead let's have
a for loop here and let's say for into I
equals 1 I less than or equal to 100 I
plus plus so basically here we'll have
the logic to process the report in real
time but here we are going to simulate
some artificial processing time by
making the current thread that is
executing this request to sleep for 50
milliseconds and in order to be able to
do that let's bring in the system dot
threading namespace and make the current
thread sleep for maybe 50 milliseconds
and you know while this operation
contract is processing that report we
want to you know
communicate the progress that we have
made so far processing that report back
to the client application and in order
for us to be able to do that we have
already defined a callback contract so
this the operation contract which is
part of that callback contract that
we'll be using to communicate the
progress made so far back to the client
application okay
so first we need to get that callback
Channel and in order to get the callback
Channel we use the operated operation
context dot current don't get callback
channel okay and we need to specify the
type of the callback contract so what is
the type of the callback contract I
report service callback that is the type
I mean that is the end of his type which
has got the operation contract that we
can use to communicate the progress
information back to the client
application okay so dot we have got a
report progress and this method expects
a parameter that is an integer parameter
basically the percentage that we have
completed so far and if you look at this
variable I here it's running from one to
hundred so basically we can pass that
number to this method okay so let's pass
I all right so we have implemented our
WCF service at the moment now let's make
this WCF service concurrency mode single
and in order to do that let's use the
service behavior attribute and specify
concurrency mode single
all right and we want to host this WCF
service using a console application so
to the solution let's add a new project
select console application let's call
this host and we need to add the
application configuration file to this
project so right click on the project
add a new item and we want to add
application configuration file and to
speed things up I have already typed the
configuration so let's copy this and
paste it within the config file and
again this configuration we have
discussed it several times in the
previous sessions of this video series
so I'm not going to go into the details
of that so basically if you look at the
end point we have got the address we've
got the binding Asuna tcp binding and
the contractors iReports service right
and the next thing is to write the
required code in this program dot CS
file to host the WCF service so let's
bring in system dot service model
namespace but before we do that we need
to add a reference to system dot service
model assembly so right click on
references folder add a reference and
from the dotnet tab you should be able
to add a reference to system dot service
model assembly ok be I think added by
gnostic system dot speech actually want
to add system dot service model
alright and we also need to add a
reference to this report service project
so let's go and do that as well
alright now within program dot C s file
will write the required code to host
service and we have written this code
again several times in the previous
video session so I'm just going to copy
and paste it right there okay so we are
hosting report service alright let's set
our host project as the starter project
and run the application by pressing ctrl
f5 ok so there are build errors let's
see what they are expected ok so here we
need another closing brace so let's go
ahead and run this now so host started
now let's build a client for our WCF
service so here we have the Windows
client application at the moment you
know I've created a new windows forms
application and on this form all I have
at the moment is this button and a
textbox control I've changed the text on
the button to process report and the
name of the button to BT and process
report that's all I have done so far
the first thing that we need to do here
at the moment is to add a reference to
the WCF service so right click on the
references folder select add service a
reference option and if you look at our
WCF service where did we make the
metadata available we've made it
available at localhost colon 8080 ok
so let's use that URL to bring down the
metadata click go so this should
discover the report service that's up
and running so let's specify the name
space let's call it report service click
OK so we should get a reference to the
service contract as well as to the
callback contract
okay now let's double click on the
button to process the report so this
should generate the event handler now so
this client application is going to
receive a response from the
I mean a call back from the WCF servers
right so let's actually add system dot
service model assembly
you know let's bring in that namespace
now we need to specify the callback
behavior here so we are going to use
callback behavior attribute and there is
a property called use synchronization
context I'm going to set that to false
now what is the significance of this
callback behavior attribute and this use
synchronization context parameter we'll
discuss that in detail in the data video
session for now let's just set that to
false and then we want this form
basically to implement the callback
contract okay so if you look at our WCF
service at the moment it's reporting the
progress information back to the client
okay
using this callback contract okay now it
is the clients responsibility to
implement this callback contract okay so
the method at the client side that is
report progress method at the client
side is going to receive the progress
information that is the percentage that
has been completed and it's up to the
client application what it wants to do
with that progress information okay in
our case let's say we just want to
display that progress information within
this textbox control okay so for us to
be able to do that we need to first to
implement the callback contract
operation with the client application
okay so let's make this form implement
that and where is that callback contract
available that's present in report
service namespace dot I report service
callback okay so we want this form to
implement that interface click on that
interface and then plus control dot it
will get an option to implement the
interface method in this case it's
report Pro cast so what do we want to do
with this percentage completed we want
to display that within the textbox
control and the idea of the textbox is
text box one so text box one dot text
equals
percentage completed so let's convert
that to strain so whatever is the number
that is coming back plus percent
completed so basically you know if we
get number 10 back you know it says ten
percent completed within the textbox
control okay so the client at the moment
is implementing that call by contract
now let's go ahead and create an
instance of our report service client so
report service dot reports service
client equals new report service client
now if you look at the constructor of
this report service client it's
expecting some parameter here and what
is that it is of type instance context
and look at the name of the parameter
it's called call back instance okay so
we need tell to this client proxy class
what is the instance you know the that
is basically the call back instance
which contains the callback interface
implemented method in this case it's
going to be this class that is this form
one class and what is the type of the
callback instance it's instance context
so first let's go and create that
instance context type so instance
context and let's call it instance
context equals new instance context and
we need to you know which is the
instance nothing but instance of this
form one class so here we can simply say
this okay an instance of this class is
the one which is going to be the
callback instance which contains the
implementation for the callback contract
and we are going to pass this instance
context to report service client
and then we'll simply invoke process
report function okay so when the client
calls the function and/or the operation
contract of the WCF service what's going
to happen the WCF service is going to
process that and as part of the
processing you know the WCF service will
try to call back into the client
application using this callback contract
so it reports the progress to the client
application and at the client side we
have implemented that report progress so
this method is going to receive the
percentage completed and it's going to
display that within the textbox control
and then obviously it has to confirm the
receipt of the percentage that is
received to the client at our to the WCF
service because if you look at the WCF
service here
you know this operation contract it's
not a one-way operation contract okay
it's request reply so the request goes
to the client the callback request and
then the client sends a response for the
callback but at the moment if you look
at the WCF service the concurrency mode
is single meaning the response cannot
come back to the WCF service from the
client okay
so let's actually run this and see if it
works so let's flip to our Windows
client let's run this and let's click
this button process report so in a bit
we should get an error look at this this
operation would deadlock and that's
understandable okay because the reply
cannot be received until the current
message completes processing if you want
to allow out of order message processing
specify concurrency mode of reentrant
or multiple at the moment if you look at
the concurrency mode of the WCF service
it set a single which means only one
thread is loved to access the WCF
service instance okay so while the
report is being processed you know the
current thread already has acquired the
lock on the WCF service instance when we
report the percentage that is completed
back to the client
the client receives that percentage and
then it sends a response back to the WCF
service for that callback but then the
response cannot reenter the deputy of
service instance because that's locked
down the thread that is executing the
client request has already acquired the
lock on that one
okay now in order for this you know call
to enter the WC of service instance
there are two ways we can make it work
we can either make the concurrency mode
to multiple when we make it multiple you
know obviously any other thread can also
access the service instance because
there's no lock acquired but that's not
what we want we don't want full-blown
multi-threading here we just want the
callback responses to reach the WCF
service instance and that's what is
precisely the reason for using reentrant
concurrency mode so reentrant
concurrency mode allows the WCF service
instance to issue callbacks to the
client and the callback responses can
then reach into the WCF service instance
because we have set the concurrency mode
to reentrant so the response from the
client for the callback can re-enter the
BCF service okay
so let's set the WCF service concurrency
mode to reentrant let's actually close
the client as well as the WCF service
let's rerun the WCF service and let's
run the client application click process
report look at that now it works as
expected
ok all right so that's one way to solve
the problem you know set the concurrency
mode to reentrant or even better way is
if you look at this callback contract
operation you know it's not one way it's
2-way meaning there will be a request
and there will be a response as well
okay and the reason why it's deadlocking
at the moment is because the response
for the callback from the client is not
able to reach the WCF
this instance now is there really a need
for the response from the call back to
go to the WCF service now not really you
know because we are not you know this
the client doesn't require to report any
information back to the client so if we
make the response you know basically the
callback operation contract one way then
you know we can still leave the
concurrency mode as single and the
application will continue to work as
expected okay because there won't be any
response for the callback from the
client if we make it one way there will
only be a call back from the WCF service
to the client that line displays you
know the percentage that is completed
that's all it that it's not going to
confirm it to the WCF service and on
that it has received that percentage
that the BCF service doesn't really care
about that okay it's just going to issue
a call back send the percentage
completed you know the WCF service
doesn't really care what the client
application is going to do with that
percentage okay its responsibilities to
just communicate that information back
to the client so let's see how to solve
this issue by making the operation
contract one way so first of all let's
go ahead and reverse this concurrency
mode to single so now only one thread is
allowed but then we are going to make
this operation contract one way so we're
going to set each one way equals true
okay so let's stop the service horse
that's running let's read on the service
host and then let's flip to our Windows
client let's update the service
reference
so now the callback operation contract
is one way so let's run the client
application click on process report it
should work in the same manner okay but
if you look at the service here the
concurrency mode is still single but it
still works why is that that's basically
because there is no callback response
from the client going back to the WCF
service instance that's why there is no
deadlock
you know this callback is one way only
that a VCF service is going to send you
know the person to complete it to the
client the complete chair the client
just displays that person completed
within the textbox control okay there is
no response for that callback from the
client to the WCF service instance
alright that's it for today thank you
for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
