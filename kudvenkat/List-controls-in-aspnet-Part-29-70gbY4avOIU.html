frankerd this is part 29 of asp.net
video series in this session we'll learn
about the different list controls that
are available in asp.net before
continuing with this session I strongly
recommend to watch parts 26 27 and 28 of
this video series in asp.net there are
several list controls that we have been
discussing so far in this video series
like drop down lists check box lists
radio button list list box and bulleted
lists all of these controls inherit from
lists control class and this fact you
know because of this fact all these
controls are actually a collection of
list item objects and we can add list
items to any of these controls in the
HTML source at design-time or in the
code behind file programmatically at
runtime and all of them supports data
binding okay now let's drag and drop
these controls and see how how similar
it is to actually add list items in the
HTML source so I have these five
different controls here so let's paste
this HTML on to the web form let's
select that and format it properly okay
so all we have here is the five
different list controls drop-down list
checkbox radio button list box and a
bulleted list now we know that all of
these controls are actually a collection
of list item objects so adding list item
objects to these controls is very
similar all you have to do here is to
you know copy paste the list items
that's all so the only difference here
is the tag name
okay so now if you look at the design
look at that all of them are populated
with these list items so it's very
similar to work with these list controls
okay so this is the drop-down list we
have the checkbox list with all those
three list items radio button list list
box and the bulleted list okay so we
have seen how to add them at design time
using the HTML source and it's very
identical the only difference here is
the tag name now let us see how to
actually add items up programmatically
and again if we want to add
programmatically first we need these
tags so let the Matt let's add them now
okay so we have these controls here now
we want to add the list item objects
programmatically to these controls and
obviously the way we do it is we need a
method to add these list item objects
now since there are five different
controls do we really need five
different methods one method to add list
item objects to the drop-down list
another one to check box lists etc we
don't have to if we you know understand
the concepts of inheritance properly
then all we need is one method and we
can reuse that method so if you look at
this here I have a method called add
list item list items method and this
method is taking in a parameter list
control remember all these controls in
your drop-down list checkbox list etc
all these controls actually inherit from
list control class so we are using the
parent type as a parameter for this add
list items method and what we are doing
here the implementation of the method is
pretty straightforward all we are doing
is spin up three list item objects
specifying their text and value and then
we are adding those list item objects to
this list control and then look at how
we are using this method we are actually
passing in the drop-down list checkbox
list radio button list okay so depending
on to which you know list item
- which control you want to add these
list items you're passing in the ID of
that control and it's possible because
all these controls inherit from list
control class in fact inheritance is
used at its best here somebody asks you
an interview question like where can you
use inheritance can you give me a
practical example you can give this
example let's say I want to populate the
list controls we know that all these
list controls inherit from the list
control base class rather than having
different methods to populate these five
different list controls we can have one
method doing that and we use the base
type as the parameter and when we
actually use it we use the inherited
type and we have spoken about
inheritance extensively in c-sharp video
series if you haven't watched that I
would strongly encourage you to watch
the video on inheritance and
polymorphism which tells you that you
know a base class a reference variable
can actually point to a derived class
object that fact is allowing us to pass
in the derived class object at runtime
okay let's see this in action so first
we want a reusable method so let's
create that method I'm going to use
private as the access modifier because
I'm going to use that only on this
webform and let's call this populate
maybe items and then the trick here is
we use the list item the base class here
so relist control the base class for all
the list controls that we have in
asp.net so list control and what we want
to do we basically want to create a list
item object li is equal to new list item
and let's call this maybe item one is
the text and the value is one
let's actually say Li 1 and I 2 and Li 3
all we want to do at this point is to
add this list items to the list control
so let's control that items dot add and
we want to add Li one Li 2 and Li 3 so
Li - Li 3 that's that and the way vu set
is on the page load if it's not postback
we call this populate items and then if
you remember on the webform we have all
these controls which we want to populate
at the moment they don't show anything
because there are no list items we want
to add them programmatically so we can
pass in the IDS of those controls drop
down list 1 check box list 1 etc so drop
down list 1 I want to populate that and
along the same lines we want to populate
you know the check box list and so check
box list 1 and we want to pass radio
button list one list box 1 and bulleted
list ok so now when we run this at
runtime
it should programmatically add you know
these list items to all of the controls
that we have on the wave form and it
works so because of the this you know
fact base class reference variable can
point to derive a class object you know
because of this fact we are able to
reduce the amount of code that we have
to write drastically instead of having
five different methods to populate these
five different controls we just have one
method now now let us see how to
actually retrieve the item now depending
on the type of control now if you look
at these five different controls that we
have you know some of them allows
multiple selections where are some of
them only a
one item to be selected for example
dropdownlist he can select only one item
checkbox list you can select more than
one item radio button list again only
one item list box depending on the
selection mode if the selection mode is
single then you can select only one item
where a selection mode is multiple then
you can select multiple items whereas
bulleted lists you cannot select you can
only click on one item that - if the
display mode is set to a link button
okay
so depending on the type of control that
you are using you can either select
multiple items or you know one item if
if the control supports multiple
selections then you probably have to
loop through each list item and then
retrieve the text value and index of
that list item but whereas if the
control allows only one selection then
it's enough if you retrieve you know
that one selected item you don't have to
use a for each loop to loop through each
item okay let us see again how to write
a reusable method which can do that now
if you look at this it's again pretty
straightforward retrieve multiple
selections there is a method called
retrieve multiple selections and if you
look at this it's taking in a list
control parameter and then what it's
doing here it's using a for each loop to
loop through the list items within that
list control and then retrieving the
text value and index and I'm printing
that out using this response tour right
method if that list item is selected so
this method can be used by a checkbox
list control and a list box if the
selection mode is multiple it will also
work with radio button list and other
controls but but this is not the best
code because there is unnecessary
looping through each list item if it's a
control that only allows single
selection then this reusable method
works best
okay retrieve selected item text value
and index and what is this doing we know
that all list controls have selected
item property and selected index
properties okay so we are essentially
using that properties and then
retrieving the selected item text value
and index
okay let's quickly see how to write
these methods and use them so let's say
private void and I want to get multiple
selections and obviously we are going to
pass in a list control
so FX a list control that supports
multiple selections then we have to use
a for each loop to loop through each
list item so for each list item Li n
list control dot items if Li dot F the
list item is selected then what we want
to do we want to retrieve the text value
and index so text is equal to Li dot
text and then maybe we want to put a
comma and a space and then specify value
is equal to Li dot value and then we
want the index so comma space and X is
equal to how do we get the index lest
control dot items dot index off that
list item and since index is an integer
convert that to string and then put an
HTML break so that each selected item
will come in its own line so that's it
so we have this one method and then we
can use this method to get the
selections of a checkbox list or a list
box you know if it supports multiple
selections now let's say we have the
list box here let's set the selection
mode to multiple alright so now let's
put a button control there
let's drag and drop a button control
onto the waveforms which when I click I
want to get maybe the selected items
text value and index of a list box
control how do we do that instead of
writing you know my own code again we
can use that method get' what did we
call the method as get multiple
selections get multiple selections and
then it is expecting a control to be
passed in if you want to get the car you
know the selections of a list box pass
that in when we run this now and then
when we select some things and then
click that button so I have the list box
here I have selected okay we haven't
changed the text here let's change the
text to item two item three and let's
call this two and three just to give it
some sense okay so let's run this okay
so i have item 1 and i selected item 3
exit this button look at that when we
click this button it's going to call
this get multiple selections method
which will invoke this method and we get
the text value and index so i've
selected item 1 and item 3 and you can
see the text value and index there now
on the other hand let's say i want they
let's run this now if i don't select
anything here let's say there's a
checkbox list i select these items I
click this part and nothing will be
printed because I haven't selected
anything in the list box let's say when
I click this button I want to find out
what are all the items that are checked
then I use the check box list instead of
list box or you can call both of the
methods whatever is checked you know
that will be invoked and that
information will be displayed so I have
item 1 item 3 I click this button and I
see the text value and index of those
selected items now let's see how to
write the method you know which supports
single selection here we don't have to
use
for each loop we can just use the
selected item and selected index
properties okay
so let's call this method private void
get single selections and then as usual
we pass in the base class type which is
list control and you need to verify if
the selected index not equal to minus
one if the user has not selected
anything then you shouldn't try to
retrieve the text and value properties
of selected item because selected item
will be null and you might run into a
null reference exception okay so if you
want the text let's spawn Storch right
text is equal to how do I get the text
all you need to do is list control dot
selected item dot text and then put an
HTML break that's that and if you want
the value value is equal to list control
dot select item dot value and then the
HTML break and if you want the index we
can make use of the selected index
property so list control dot selected
index dot to string get rid of this HTML
break and that's it
so now we can invoke this method maybe
on the button click let's say I want to
get a single selection of the drop-down
list I can pass in the drop-down list
object or I can pass in maybe the radio
button list whatever so now when we run
this
and drop-down list let's say I have
selected item 3 I click this button so
item 3 value is 3 and index is 1 okay
and in the previous session we have
actually seen how to retrieve they arm
you know the text value and index of the
bulleted list upon which you have
clicked for example if I have a bulleted
less than if I have said the display
mode as link button then you you know
the bulleted let's suppose the click
event so whenever the user clicks on a
specific list item within that bulleted
list then we can tap into the click
event and retrieve the text value and
index we have seen how to do that that
