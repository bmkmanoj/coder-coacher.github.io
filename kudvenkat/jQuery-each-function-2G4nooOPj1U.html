this video we'll discuss the use of
jQuery each function how to exit from
each function implicit iteration in
jQuery and some performance
considerations that we need to keep in
mind when using jQuery each function so
what's the use of jQuery each function
jquery each function is used to iterate
over the items in a collection let's
understand this with an example here we
have an unordered list at the moment
this list contains five list item
elements with no already function dollar
Li so what is this selector going to do
this selector is going to give us a
collection of list item objects now what
we want to do is iterate over each list
item and then alert the index position
of the list item within that collection
and the list item text that is the name
of the country so we want to loop
through each element so we are going to
make use of this each jQuery function
now this each jQuery function is going
to receive two parameters so basically
when we are going to loop through each
item we want to execute some piece of
code and we are going to specify that
code that we want to execute using this
anonymous function now this anonymous
function is going to receive
automatically two parameters the first
parameter so the first parameter is the
index of the element within this
collection and the second parameter is
the element itself so let's alert the
index of the element and to that lets
append : and then the element text
so this is going to return as the
collection of all list items and on each
list item you know this anonymous
function will be executed and to this
function we are passing the index of the
item that we are currently iterating
over and the element itself and we are
alerting the index and the current
elements text so let's save these
changes when we reload the page we
should get the index position of the
element and the element text that is the
country name so 0 : u.s. and we should
get the index and the name of the
country for all countries now if you
look at this anonymous function notice
that it has two parameters is it
mandatory to pass these two parameters
every time we use this each function not
really you can refer to the element that
we are currently iterating over by using
this keyword instead of element and
that's what you see you know in many of
the articles on the internet you know
instead of using this element parameter
you can simply use this keyword okay so
this keyword refers to the element that
we are currently iterating over and this
text method is going to return as the
text of that element that we are
iterating over okay so when we save
these changes and when we reload the
behavior should be exactly the same now
if you don't want to you know alert the
index you can get rid of that that means
since we are not using the index
parameter we can remove this parameter
completely now if you look at this
anonymous function notice that it does
not have any parameters okay but we are
still able to get the text of the
element using text function and we are
referring to the element that we are
iterating over by using this keyword so
now when we reload this page we should
only get the name of the country
all right so now let's see how to exit
or break from each function let's say
for some reason if the country name is
UK then we want to break out of this
each function okay so to break out of
the each function all you need to do is
return false so let's copy this if the
text of the element that we are
iterating over if that is equal to UK
then let's return false okay
so let's save these changes and let's
reload the page so we get the first
country printed which is us click OK we
get India and notice that the next
country is UK and what are we doing
within this each function if the text is
UK be a returning false so what's going
to happen when you return false when you
return false it's going to break out of
that each function which means for the
rest of the elements this piece of code
will not be executed so once I click OK
here we should not get any more alerts
because we have returned false that
means we have you know broken out of
this each function now let's discuss
about this implicit iteration concept in
jQuery and let's actually understand
that with an example now let's say we
want to change the font color of all
these list items to read and to do that
we can make use of this jQuery CSS
function so let's get rid of all this ok
so we have the collection returned by
this selector and on each element within
that collection what we want to do is
apply a CSS style what style we want to
apply we want to apply color and we want
to set that to red okay so this is going
to return as the collection of list item
elements
and you know we are using the each
function to iterate over each list item
and then on each list item we are
calling the CSS function right and the
CSS is a jQuery function so when we
reload this look at that all the list
item color is changed to red now here we
are explicitly iterating over each list
item within the collection using this
jQuery each function but you don't
really have to do that when you're using
CSS jQuery method instead of this what
you can do is look at that I am removing
that each function call so what is this
going to do this returns a collection of
list item elements on that collection I
am directly going to call the CSS
function so what is this CSS function
going to do implicitly automatically
this is going to iterate over each
element within this collection and then
apply this color property to that
element so here there is no need to
explicitly iterate over each element
within the collection using and each
function because many jQuery methods
implicitly iterate over elements within
the collection CSS is one of them so
when I save these changes when we reload
this
you know the behavior should exactly be
the same so here though we are not
explicitly iterating over each element
within the collection this is still
going to apply the color red to all the
elements because implicitly this jQuery
function is going to iterate over each
element within the collection so that is
what is called as implicit iteration in
jQuery now let's discuss some of the
performance considerations that we need
to keep in mind when using jQuery
function and let's understand that with
an example so what we want to do is
include a div element here let's give it
an ID let's call it div result so what
we want to do is display all these
countries in this development
okay so dollar Li so what is this
selector going to do this is going to
return us a collection of list item
elements so we're going to use this each
function to iterate over each element
within that collection okay so what do
we want to do we want to find this
development so how are we going to find
the element so this div element has got
an ID so we use the ID selector hash and
what is the ID of the element they've
resolved so find the element by ID and
we want to set the HTML for that div and
what should be the HTML we want each
country's name okay so I'm actually
going to make a copy of this one and
paste that here so what does this mean
we are taking the HTML of that div and
then setting that as the HTML okay for
the first time the div is empty so it's
not going to really add anything to that
let's append an HTML break and to that
lets append the current elements text
okay so one line of jQuery code here so
what are we doing find the development
with ID div result and to that append
what we already have within that
development at the moment in on first
iteration will not have anything so we
are append an HTML break and then the
name of the country us on the second
iteration you know this is going to
return us us and then to that we are
appending break and then the next
country name which is India so when we
reload this page what is going to happen
within the development we should get all
the five country names
okay now this jQuery code you know it's
producing the output that we expect but
from a performance standpoint there are
two problems with this code the first
problem is that look at this this line
will be executed for each list item
within this collection since we have
five list items this line will be
executed five times that means jQuery is
trying to find this Dom element that is
div result within the Dom that is the
document object model five times it's
going to search the Dom five times so
that's not you know efficient from a
performance standpoint why are we
unnecessarily searching it five times
why don't we search it once store it in
a variable and then reuse that variable
and that concept is called as caching
right so instead of trying to find the
same development within the Dom five
times let's find it once so outside of
the each function let's create a
variable let's call this div element
equals we can use the selector search
the Dom find that element and then once
we have found the element we can use
that variable so development dot HTML
development dot HTML so now it's not
going to search the Dom for the same
element again right we found it the
first time and then we are using you
know the cached version of that element
ok so it's now going to search that
element only once so this is much better
from a performance standpoint but there
is another problem the other problem is
that this div element is actually a Dom
element and what are we doing with the
Dom element we are updating that with
new data now updating Dom element
frequently in a loop again is bad for
performance instead what you can do is
use another variable maybe a string
variable
build this that variable with the
required data and then outside of this
each loop you know update that Dom
element once that will again be much
better for performance
so instead of updating this Dom element
five times we can update it once outside
of the loop and for that let's create
another variable let's call this result
and let's initialize that with an empty
string and instead of updating the Dom
element what I'm going to do is use this
variable so result plus equals we can
get rid of all this okay result plus
equals to that append an HTML break and
then the text of the element that we are
iterating over so now this variable is
going to contain the HTML that we want
to display within this development so
outside of this loop what we can do is
now at the moment we don't even need
this variable so I can you know get rid
of that variable
and then use the selector directly and
use the result variable all right so
let's reload this page we should get the
same output but this version of the code
is much better than what we had
previously okay here you know we are
trying to find that element only once
and then updating that element only once
and then again you know a within the
each function that is within the loop we
are not trying to search the Dom element
or update the Dom element so whenever
you use each function you know when
you're looping through items in a
collection you know keep these two
things in mind don't try to find the
same Dom element over and again if you
have to ever you know find a Dom element
in a loop try to find that outside of
the loop once cash that in a variable
and then use that variable and again you
know if you want to update a Dom element
then out don't try to update that inside
a loop assign the value you know to a
variable build that variable dynamically
and then maybe update the Dom element
once outside the loop that will be much
better for performance so here is the
example that we just discussed thank you
for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
