tutorial in this video we'll discuss
what is HP dot net Web API
what are restful services difference
between WCF and web api and when to use
one or the other so what is asp.net web
api the term API stands for application
programming interface asp.net web api is
a framework for building web api's that
is HTTP based services on top of the
dotnet framework the most common use
case for using web api is for building
restful services these services can then
be consumed by a broad range of clients
like browsers mobile applications
desktop applications IOT s so what are
yo TS the term IO T stands for Internet
of Things Internet of Things are the
objects and devices that have an IP
address and can communicate over the
Internet with other Internet enabled
devices and objects examples for IOT
include security systems electronic
appliances their must-haves cars etc in
addition to desktops laptops and
smartphones one important thing to keep
in mind is that though asp.net Web API
framework is widely used to create
restful services it can also be used to
create services that are not restful in
short asp.net Web API framework does not
dictate any specific architectural style
for creating services in this video
we'll discuss creating restful services
from scratch using the asp.net Web API
framework so what are restful services
rest stands for representational state
transfer rest was first introduced in
the year 2000 by Roy fielding as part of
his doctoral dissertation rest is an
architectural pattern for creating an
API that uses HTTP as its underlying
communication method the rest
architectural pattern specifies a set of
constraints that a system should adhere
to now let's look at the rest
constraints client--server constraint
this is the first
trained client sends a request and the
server sends a response this separation
of concerns supports the independent
evolution of the clients a logic and
server-side logic this is a
straightforward constraint we've got a
client and a server client sends a
request to the server and the server
responds to the client request the next
constraint is the stateless constraint
the communication between the client and
the server must be stateless between
requests this means we should not be
storing anything on the server related
to the client that requests from the
client should contain all the necessary
information for the server to process
that request this ensures that each
request can be treated independently by
the server
cashable constrained some data provided
by the server like lists of products or
lists of departments in a company this
data does not change that often this
constraint says that let the client know
how long this data is good for so that
the client does not have to come back to
the server for the same data over and
over again caching avoids unnecessary
processing and significantly increases
the performance of the system uniform
interface the uniform interface
constraint defines the interface between
the client and the server to understand
the uniform interface constraint we need
to understand what a resource is and the
HTTP verbs get put post and delete in
the context of a REST API resources
typically represent data entities
product employee customer etc are all
resources the HTTP verb get put post or
delete that is sent with each request
tells the API what to do with the
resource each resource is identified by
a specific URI Uniform Resource
identifier the table right here shows
some typical requests that you see in an
API the resource here is employee so the
URI for slash employee so the typical
URI might be a
- DP : four slash four slash your
website name maybe prism techcom for
example forward slash employees that's a
URI and that URI but this verb get is
going to get us the list of all
employees and HVB : four slash four
slash presume tech comm four slash
employee 4/1 so one here is the ID and
that along with get HTTP verb is going
to return us employee with ID equals one
four slash employees with the post verb
creates a new employee on the server
four slash employee four slash one that
put verb is going to update the employee
with ID equals one and the same URI with
delete verb is going to delete the
employee with ID equals one we look at
examples of all these in our upcoming
videos another concept related to
uniform interface that we need to
understand here is hey toes
so hey toes stands for Hyper media as
the engine of application state all this
means is that in each request there will
be a set of hyperlinks that lets you
know what other actions can be performed
on the resource if this is not clear the
moment don't worry we will discuss this
in a later video there are two other
constraints as well layered system and
the code on demand code on demand
constraint is optional we'll discuss
these two constraints in a later video
now let's discuss the difference between
WCF and web api and when to choose one
over the other WCF windows communication
foundation we can also use WCF for
creating restful services so why do we
have to use asp.net web api
the problem with WCF is that a lot of
configuration is required to turn at WCF
service into a restful service the more
natural choice for creating a restful
service is asp.net web api which is
specifically created for this purpose so
when should we use WCF over asp.net web
api WCF is more suited for
services that are transport or protocol
independent for example you want to
build a single service that can be
consumed by two different clients let's
say a java client and a dotnet client
Java client wants transport protocol to
be HTTP and message format to be XML for
interoperability whereas the dotnet
client wants the protocol to be TCP and
the message format to be binary for
performance for this scenario WCF is the
right choice what we do here is create a
single WCF service and then configure
two endpoints one for each client that
is one for the Java client and the other
for the dotnet client if you're new to
WCF please watch our WCF video series
i'll have the link available in the
description of this video there's
nothing wrong to use WCF to create
restful services it's just that it's a
bit more complex and configuration can
be a headache if you are stuck with
dotnet 3.5 or you have an existing soup
service you must support but want to add
rest to reach more clients then use WCF
if you don't have the limitation of
dotnet 3.5 and you want to create a
brand new restful service then use
asp.net web api in our upcoming videos
in this series
well disc is creating restful services
from scratch using the asp.net Web API
framework so please stay tuned thank you
for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
