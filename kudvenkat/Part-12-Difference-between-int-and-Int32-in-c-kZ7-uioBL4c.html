questions and answers video series in
this video we'll discuss the difference
between intern and 32 in c-sharp this is
a very basic and the common interview
question in 32 and int are synonymous
both of them allow us to create an
integer that is 32 bit long and is a
shorthand notation that is it's an ally
as for in 32 when declaring an integer
in a seashell program most of us prefer
to do it using int keyword or we're
using int 32 now whether we use int
keyword or in 32 to create an integer
the behavior is going to be identical in
both of these cases we are creating an
integer variable that is 32 bit long
let's slip to visual studio so to create
an integer variable it's very common for
us to do something like this int I
equals 10 now look at this when I hover
the mouse over this int keyword it's
actually system dot int 32 structure
which means I can either say int I
equals 10 or in 32 I equals 10 in both
of these cases we are actually creating
an integer variable called I that is
32-bit in length now the only place
where in 32 is not allowed is when
creating an enum now to create an enum
we would do that using enum keyword
followed by the name of the enum let's
call it tests and by default the
underlying type of the enum is going to
be integer but let's say we want to be
explicit about it and we want to specify
the underlying type now let's use int
keyword like that and then let's say
member is xxx and the value is 1 and
look at this when I build the solution
notice the status bar will succeeded no
compilation errors now again if we hover
the mouse over notice that it's actually
system dot n 32 structure so if I use
int 32 instead of end look at this we
have the treads quickly there which
means we have a compilation error right
away so here when creating enums in 32
is not allowed we will have to use end
however there are some minor differences
between Intendant a little one of the
differences in readability
we use in 32 we are being explicit about
the size of the variable okay and to use
in 32 either we need to use you know
using system declaration or we have to
specify the fully qualified name that is
system dot and 32 whereas with int
keyword it's not required so look at
this we already have this using system
declaration here and since we have that
using system declaration you know we
don't have any compilation error if we
build this now what do you think is
going to happen if I remove that using
system declaration we are going to get a
compilation error saying that the type
or namespace name int 32 could not be
found
okay so one option is to use that using
system declaration or we have to at
least use the fully qualified name that
is system dot in 32 okay but when we use
the end keyword we don't have to do that
you know we can simply say int I equals
10 and in spite of not having that using
system declaration we can still compile
the solution now the interviewer may
also ask you what is the difference
between keyword string and system dot
string you know again there's no
difference it's very much similar to you
know what are the differences between in
10 in 32 so just like that there is no
difference between string and system dot
string string is an ally as for system
dot string that's it for today thank you
for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
