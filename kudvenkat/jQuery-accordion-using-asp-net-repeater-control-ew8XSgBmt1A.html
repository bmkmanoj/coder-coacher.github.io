this video we'll discuss how to
implement an accordion in an asp.net
webforms application using asp.net
repeater control and jQuery this is
continuation to part 74 so please watch
part 74 before proceeding this is the
same example that we worked with in the
previous video session and the accordion
that we have implemented is here we have
implemented this accordion by
dynamically constructing these h3 and
div element pairs using jQuery if we use
a repeater control then we can offload
this responsibility of constructing
these h3 and div element pairs to that
control so the code looks much cleaner
so let's see how to implement an
accordion using asp.net repeater control
and jQuery in our previous video session
we have used this country service to
retrieve the country name and
description from the database table so
for the purpose of this demo we'll be
using the same web service so the first
thing to do here is to add a reference
to this web service and to do that I'm
going to right click on references and
select add service reference and I'm
going to click this discover button so
this should discover our country service
and within this namespace text box I'm
going to provide the namespace as
services let's click OK so this should
add a reference to a country service now
I'm going to add another web form to a
project so add new item and we want to
add a bed form so within the form here
we have caught a development I'm going
to give an ID to this day let's call it
accordion and let's also set the width
of this div to 600 pixels alright and
I'm going to drag and drop a repeater
control inside this development so let's
go to the toolbox and we should find the
repeater control on the data tab so here
we have the repeater control so that's
our repeater control and within the
code-behind file I'm going to call the
country service retrieve the data and
bind it to the repeater control so the
namespace that we have given for the
service reference is services so let's
type services dot and we should find a
country service sub client so that's the
class that we have to use to call the
web service let's call it client equals
new country service sub client and let's
call the get countries function and what
is this function going to return it's
going to return an array of country
objects and we want to set that as the
data source for our repeater control so
repeat a 1 dot data source equals
whatever we get back from the web
service and let's call the data bind
method all right so we are going to get
an array of country objects and if you
look at this country object we've got
you know ID name and country description
properties so now within the code-behind
file of our webform to dot aspx we are
actually calling the web service binding
the data to the repeater control now all
that is left is within the repeater
specify the structure that you want and
to do that I'm going to make use of the
item template and what do we want we
want first you know a header element so
I'm going to use h3 you can use h2 h1
you know any header element basically so
with an h3 what do we want we want to
display the country name in the header
right so we can use angle brackets
percentage hash and then use the eval
method and what is the property to which
we want to bind the data we want to
retrieve data from name property and
display that within the h3 element and
then we also want a div element so I'm
going to include a development
and we want to retrieve the country
description and bind it to this div
element so I'm going to use the same
eval method the property name is country
description so let's copy that from here
and paste it right there so this is
going to build us so this piece of code
will be executed for every row that is
returned by the web service so it's
going to build pairs of h3 and
developments for us automatically
okay and this repeater is present inside
another development that has got this ID
accordion so all that is left now is to
reference the required script files and
then call the accordion function on this
development okay so we need jQuery
itself so let's drag and drop jQuery we
need jQuery UI you know CSS and
JavaScript and we need another script
element and let's include the ready
function so document dot ready and let's
find the div element by ID so we want to
find this container Davidge has caught
the idea of accordion so let's use the
jQuery ID selector and on that let's
call the accordion function all right so
let's save those changes let's go ahead
and run this so notice we made a request
to their form two dot aspx and here we
have the accordion which is very similar
to what we have on this web form one dot
aspx now here to implement the accordion
we're using the repeater control you can
also do exactly the same thing by using
the list view control again list view
control you can find that you know under
data tab so let's see how to do the same
thing using list view so I'm actually
going to include a couple of break
elements here and let's copy this entire
HTML code and paste it right here okay
so instead of this repeater I am going
to simply use list view and we already
have a development with ID accordion I
am actually going to change that this ID
to accordion to okay
and the idea of this list view let's
actually change it to maybe something
like list view one because that's not a
repeater it's a list view control and
within the code-behind file we need to
bind the data to the list view control
as well
so ListView one the data source equals
client get countries and just like this
we want to call data bind on list v1 and
then within our jQuery code we need to
call accordion function on this
container div so let's make a copy of
this and instead of accordion we're
going to use accordion to okay so let's
go ahead and run this one more time so
now we should have two accordions on the
page so the first accordion here is
using the repeater control and the
second accordion here is using the
ListView control thank you for listening
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
