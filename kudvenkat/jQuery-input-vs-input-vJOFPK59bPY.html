this video we'll discuss the difference
between input and : input selectors so
what's the difference
: input selector is going to select all
input elements first let's understand
what are input elements look at the form
here we've got two text boxes two radio
buttons three checkboxes a drop-down
list a multi-line text box and a submit
button here is the HTML that gives us
that UI I'll have this entire HTML
available on my blog in case you need it
now to get these text boxes notice that
we are using input element and the type
is taxed to get the radio buttons again
notice that pay using input element but
the type is radio for checkboxes a using
input element but the type is checkbox
for the submit button notice that the
element is input and the type is submit
so for the text boxes radio buttons
checkboxes and for the submit button
we're using input element and the type
varies depending on the type of element
to get this drop-down list be using
select element and to get the multi-line
text box be using text area element so
if you look at this colon input selector
this is going to select all input
elements that is all elements with an
input tag and in addition to that it is
also going to select all text area
elements all select elements that is the
drop-down list all button elements all
image elements etc whereas this input
selector that is without a colon in
front of it this is only going to select
those elements with an input tag so
let's look at that in action so now what
we want to do is retrieve the values
from all these elements and display them
in a JavaScript alert so let's see how
to do that so within this jQuery ready
function let's use input selector so we
are using the input selector without :
so this should only select those
elements which have the input tag
and I'm going to use this each function
which is going to iterate through each
item in the collection that is returned
by this selector and then as we iterate
through we want to execute some code so
I'm going to use an anonymous function
here and I'm going to use dollar this so
this is going to refer to an item that
is within this collection which we are
currently iterating over and then I'm
going to call Val function so what is
this well function is going to do it's
going to return the value from that HTML
element and let's alert that using
JavaScript alert function all right so
let's save these changes and when we
reload look at that first we get the
value from the first text box which is
John once I click OK we get the value
from this text box major then we should
get the drop down I mean
radio button values that is male and
female followed by that we should get
the check box values so JavaScript
jQuery and c-sharp now since we are
using only the input selector without a
colon in front of it this should not
select this element that is the drop
down list and text area elements so now
once I click OK it should only get the
value from the button control skipping
the drop down list and the multi-line
text box so once I click OK look at that
we get the value from the button once I
click OK it's over okay now let's change
the selector to colon input so what is
this going to do this is going to select
everything okay including this drop-down
list and multi-line text box so let's
save these changes and when we reload
this so we get the values from the text
boxes join in major then from the radio
buttons then from the check boxes okay
now once I click OK we should get the
selected value from the drop-down list
USA
once I click OK we should get the value
from the multi-line text box which is
I'm a senior Dortmund developer with 10
years and then once I click OK on that
we should get the value of the button
okay so basically : input selector is
going to return us all input elements
all text area elements select elements
button elements image elements etc
whereas input selected without a colon
this is only going to give us elements
with an input tag now let's say we want
to retrieve only the values from these
two text boxes ok first name and last
name now there are two ways we can do
that so I can use colon input so this is
going to written as all elements on the
form but then I can use you know where
type equals text so what is this going
to do this is going to filter the items
and only written as the text boxes okay
so when we save the changes and when we
reload look at that we get John and we
get major now we can also achieve that
without using this colon in front of it
so let's save these changes and when we
reload look at that we get John and
major ok so both the ways we get the
same output so which one is better for
performance input type equals text or
colon input type equals text input type
equals text is better for performance
over : input type equals text why is
that
that's because colon input type equals
text it's going to scan you know all the
input elements text area elements
selects images etc whereas input type
equals text this one's can only input
elements you know that have an input tag
so obviously the list to scan when you
use this input selector without a colon
will be shorter that means to get in our
elements with an input tag it is always
better to use input type equals text
over colon input type equals text thank
you for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
