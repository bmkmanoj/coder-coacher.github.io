in this video we'll discuss if
javascript is object-oriented
programming language yes javascript is
object-oriented programming language
here we have the four pillars of any
object-oriented programming language
inheritance encapsulation abstraction
and polymorphism we'll discuss examples
of these in a later video session for
now let's concentrate on creating
objects in JavaScript objects in
JavaScript can be broadly classified
into two categories standard built-in
objects custom objects what are standard
built-in objects so far in this video
series we already seen many of the
javascript standard built-in objects
examples include a string array a
regular expression date etc in this
example notice we are using the date
constructor function to create an
instance of type date and on that date
instance we are calling carefully a
method which is going to return the
current date custom objects in c-sharp
to create a custom object we first
create a class and then create an
instance of that class
however in JavaScript we don't have the
concept of classes instead we use
functions in JavaScript there are two
ways to create a custom object construct
a function and literal notation first
let's look at an example of using
constructor function to create an object
let's flip to visual studio so we want a
function let's call this function
employee and this function is going to
have two parameters first-name and
lastname now we want the employee object
with two properties first name so this
dot first-name so here this dot
first-name represents the property of
the employee object and we want this
property to be initialized with the
value that is present in this parameter
first-name similarly we want to have
lastname property within the employee
object and that should be initialized
with the value that is going to be
present in this parameter lastname
and we want this employee object also to
have a method and we want the name of
the method to be get full name so this
we want to be a function so function and
what do we want this get full name
function to do we want to return the
full name of the employee first name and
last name separated with the space so
return this dot first name and to that
append space and to that append last
name so here we have a constructor
function employee which is going to
construct an employee object for us with
first name last name properties and get
full name function so now let's go ahead
and create an object where let's call
the variable employee equals we are
going to call employee constructor
function and this employee constructor
function expects two parameters
first-name and lastname we want the
first name to be Pragya and we want the
last name to be Tech so what's going on
here
both of these values gets passed into
the parameters of this function
constructor so presume gets passed in
the first name that gets passed into
last name and those parameters are used
to initialize the properties of the
employee object first name and last name
respectively and then this get full name
method is going to return the full name
of the employee so now let's go ahead
and spit out first name last name and
full name to the document so document
dot write we want first name so first
name equals we have the employee object
dot first name property should give us
the first name of the employee and let's
also append an HTML break similarly we
want to retrieve last name and full name
to get last name we use last name
property and to get full name we use
get full name function of the employee
object right let's see if these changes
load the page notice that we get first
name last name and full name as expected
so here we are using a constructor
function to create an employee object
let's see how to do the same thing using
object literal notation so here this is
the constructor function let's comment
this for now now we want to create an
employee object using literal notation
so I'm going to use variable and then
create an object with named employee and
this employee object should have two
properties first name and last name
first name colon and we specify the
value for that property so we want
presume to be the first name and we
separate the properties in literal
notation using comma so comma we want to
have another property last name and we
want the value to be Dec and we also
want to have a method and let's call
that get full name and we want this to
be a function and we want this function
to return the full name of the employee
object so return this dot first-name to
which we want to append space and then
append lastname okay so here we using
little notation to create the employee
object so we already have the employee
object employee objects first name is
presumed last name is tag and this
method is going to return the full name
since we already have an object here to
retrieve the first name of the employee
object we simply call first name
property on that and last name and get
full name okay alright so let's save
these changes and let's reload this page
you know the output should not differ in
any way here we are using the object
literal notation to create
your object now let's look at the
differences between using K constructor
function versus literal notation now in
the constructor function notice that so
this is the constructor function notice
that here we are separating the
properties and the values using an equal
to sign
whereas in little notation the
properties and the values are separated
using a colon and within constructor
function at the end of every property we
can have an optional semicolon whereas
in literal notation the properties must
be separated by a comma and with
constructor function we first have to
create an instance of the employee
object using that constructor function
something like this so if I want an
employee object so let's uncomment these
so if I want an employee object I will
have to say VAR e equals new employee
and then specify the value for first
name and last name so we have to first
create an instance of the employee
object using that constructor function
and then if I want the first name
property I simply say e dot first-name
but with literal notation we already
have an object so we simply call first
name property to retrieve the first name
property value so here we have those
three differences there is yet another
major difference between you know
constructor function and literal
notation which we will discuss in our
next video session thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
