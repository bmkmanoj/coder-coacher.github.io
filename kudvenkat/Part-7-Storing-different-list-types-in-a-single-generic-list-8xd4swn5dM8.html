questions video series in this video
will answer this interview question is
it possible to store n number of lists
of different types in a single generic
list the answer is yes by creating a
list of list of objects notice that here
we are creating a list of list of
objects so in this list we can store n
number of lists of different types let's
look at an example
so first let's create a list of list of
object let's call it list now let's
create another list of object let's call
this list 1 equals new list of object
and to this list one let's add integers
okay so here the type is object but we
are adding integers how is that possible
that's because every type in dotnet
directly or indirectly inherits from
system dot object so here we are adding
integers as an inherited type so let's
now create another list let's call this
list 2 and to this list let's add
strings let's add three strings let's
call it test2 test3 okay so here we have
list 1 which is of type list of object
list 2 which is of type list of object
and this list is a list of list of
objects so to this list we can add list
one and list two so list dot add list 1
and list2 now let's use a for each loop
to retrieve the items and print them so
for each list of object and let's call
this object list in list so what does
this list contain this list contains
list of objects okay
so that's what we are getting out so now
this object list is going to contain you
know objects so let's use another for
each loop so for each object obj in
object list so now we are looping
through the inner list and then let's
now print the items that are present
within that list using console dot
readline okay after printing the items
within each list we want a new line so
let's use console dot write line here
all right so let's go ahead and run this
and look at the output so we got
integers and then strings okay
so is it possible to store n number of
lists of different types in a single
generate list the answer is yes by
creating a list of lists of objects
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
