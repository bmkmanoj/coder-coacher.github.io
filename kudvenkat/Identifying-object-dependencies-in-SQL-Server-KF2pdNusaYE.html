tutorial in this video well discus how
to identify object dependencies in
sequel server using sequel to the
management studio let's understand this
with an example here I've got some
sequel script which creates two tables
to store procedures a view and a
function the first table is the
department's table this table is not
dependent on any other database object
the second table is the employees table
notice this table has got department ID
column which is a foreign key column
referencing ID column from the
department's table that means this
employee's table is dependent on
departments table and then we have the
stored procedure which depends on
employees table and then we have another
stored procedure that depends on both
the tables employees and departments and
then this view depends just on the
departments table and finally this table
valued function depends on both the
tables employees and departments now
let's see what's going to happen when we
delete some of these objects now we know
that this employees table is dependent
on departments table now let's see
what's going to happen when we try to
delete departments table look at that we
get an error message when it tried to
drop the table and look at what the
error message says it says could not
drop object DB or departments because it
is referenced by a foreign key
constraint so there is a foreign key
constraint which is preventing you know
from this departments table from being
deleted okay and that's a good thing now
we also know that these two stored
procedures and this table valued
function all of these three objects
depend on employees table now let's see
what's going to happen when we try to
delete the employee's table let's see if
we get a similar error message look at
this when I click OK the employees table
is deleted without any warning or
message now what do you think is going
to happen for the two stored procedures
and the table valued function that
depend on employees table they are going
to break look at this when I try to
execute this stored procedure we get an
error message saying invalid object
named employees and why do you think we
get that error because when it tries to
execute the stored procedure it's trying
to retrieve data from employees table
sequel server couldn't find it so we get
the error message and valid object named
employees and the same is going to
happen when we try to execute this
stored procedure which also depends on
employees table notice we get the same
error and we are going to get the same
error if we try to retrieve data using
this function okay so it's very
important to identify these object
depending sees when you intend to modify
or delete an object upon which other
objects depend otherwise you may risk
breaking the existing functionality and
it's very easy to identify object
dependencies using sequences or
management studio now let's go ahead and
create this employee's table again let's
refresh this folder just to make sure we
have our employees table back now let's
say we want to identify what are all the
objects that depend on employee is table
because I am intending to delete that
table now we can simply right-click on
that and then select this view
dependencies option from the context
menu so this object dependencies window
will show you all the objects that
depend on employees table notice this
radio button is selected objects that
depend on employees so we have two
stored procedures and a function
depending on employees table now I know
that if I delete the employee's table
these three objects are going to fail so
now I can make a better decision and we
can also find you know the objects on
which employees table depend we know
that employees table has got a
department ID foreign key column which
references the ID column from the
department's table that means employees
table is dependent on departments table
similarly we can find in other
dependencies of
Department stable so these are the
objects that depend on Department stable
we have this employees table depending
on departments and a view depending on
departments and then when we expand the
plus sign next to the employee's table
we can see all the other objects that
depend on the employees table objects on
which departments depends okay we don't
have any other object you know on which
departments depends so we don't see
anything there similarly if we want to
find out what are all the dependence is
of this stored procedure simply
right-click on that select view
dependencies in our objects that depend
on the stored procedure we don't have
any other objects that depend on this
stored procedure now we can find out
objects on which this stored procedure
depends so this true procedure depends
on an employee's table and that's what
we see there and when we expand
employees we can see the objects on
which employees table depend on so it's
very important identifying object
dependencies otherwise you may risk
breaking the functionality when you
modify or delete an object if other
objects depend on that there are several
other ways also of finding these object
appearances in sequel server which we
will discuss in our next video thank you
for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
