this video we'll discuss the concept of
event delegation in jQuery this is
continuation to part 36 so please watch
pather t6 before proceeding
so what's event delegation even
delegation allows us to attach a single
event listener to a parent element that
will fire for all descendants matching a
selector whether those descendants exist
now or added in the future both on and
delegate functions allow us to perform
event delegation in fact in our previous
video session we discussed how to
perform even delegation using on
function let's quickly recap that
example let's flip to visual studio so
this is the same example that we worked
with in the previous video session
notice that here we have an unordered
list element and to list items
so here the unordered list is the parent
element and these two are the
descendants and look at the jQuery code
here notice we have a single click event
listener attach it to the parent element
that is to the unordered list element
and look at the selector Ally so this
selector matches all these list items
all the descendants of unordered lists
so now when a click event is triggered
on any of these list items since those
list items does not have their own click
event handler that event will get
bubbled up to its parent that is the
unordered list and since the unordered
list has a click event listener that's
going to handle the click event of those
list items now these two list items are
present at design time that is now now
we can also add list items to this
unordered list dynamically at runtime in
fact if you look at this UI notice that
we have got a button add a new list item
when we click that button you know this
piece of code is executed and look at
what we are doing here we are adding a
new list item to the unordered list that
is to the same parent element now even
when we click on this new list items
that is dynamically added even that
click event will be handled by the same
parent element that is this unordered
list
okay so what is even delegation even
delegation allow us to attach a single
event listener to a parent element and
that will fire for all descendants
matching a selector so in this case all
these descendants match this selector
and if an even is triggered that is if a
click event is triggered on those
descendants which match that selector
then that event will be handled by this
single click event listener that is
attached to the parent element that's
nothing but event delegation and these
list items they could be present now or
you could add them dynamically at
runtime and here we are doing even
delegation using on function so let's
quickly look at this example in action
let's add a couple of new list items
look at this when I click on the
existing list item that fades out and
even the new list item fades out so at
the moment we are doing even delegation
using on function we could also do even
delegation using delegate function so
instead of on we can use delegate let's
look at that so let's change the name
here from on to delegate but if you look
at this delegate function notice that
with the delegate first we have to
specify the selector and then the type
of event with on we first specify the
type of event and then the selector so
we have to reverse these two parameters
so first the selector and then the type
of event and here notice we are using
delegate function let's save the changes
reload this page and see if this is
going to work in the same manner let's
our new list items and look at this when
I click on the existing it works new it
works so here they use in delegate
function to perform event delegation so
why do we have two functions in jQuery
to do the same thing now delegate
function is introduced long back
whereas on function is introduced in
jQuery version 1.7 so jQuery recommends
if you are using 1.7 or higher version
jQuery actually recommends to use on
function to perform even delegation but
if you are using jQuery version 1.6 or
Leigha then your best bet to perform
event delegation is delegate function
now let's see how to stop event
delegation let's throw in a button which
says under legate and then when we click
that button we want to stop event
delegation
so let's first include a button let's
make a copy of this and let's change the
ID of the button to button on delegate
and let's also change the value on the
button to under legate so the ID of the
button is PT and under legate so let's
find the button by ID and when we click
that button we want to stop even
delegation all right so let's find the
unordered list element that is the
parent element so find the unordered
list and what do we want to do we want
to stop event delegation now to stop
even delegation there are two ways you
could either use off function or under
legate function first let's see use off
so we are using off and with off
function we first need to specify the
type of event and then the selector so
the type of event that we want to stop
even delegation is click and the next
thing is the selector and the selector
is a lie okay so we are using off
function to stop even delegation all
right so let's save these changes reload
the page and let's have a couple of list
items look at this at the moment even
delegation is in action but let's click
this unde Ella gate button so even
delegation should be stopped now look at
this when I click on the existing list
item or the new list item nothing
happens right so now we stopped event
delegation and to stop even delegation
we using a function we can also do the
same thing using
unde ellicott function so let's use on
delegate but if you look at the syntax
of this function notice that it does we
have to first specify the selector and
then the type of event okay
so let's save the changes reload this
and look at this in action quickly add
couple of list items at the moment event
delegation is working under legate look
at this when I click on these list items
and now it doesn't fade out so again to
perform or to stop even delegation you
have two choices you could use the
either use of or under legate so which
one we should be using if you're using
jQuery version 1.7 or higher then use
off if you're using jQuery version 1.6
or earlier then your best bet is to use
under legate thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
