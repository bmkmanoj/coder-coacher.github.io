this video we'll discus jQuery button
widget jQuery button widget enhances
standard form elements like buttons
input elements and anchors to buttons
let's look at an example on this page
right here we've got three elements an
input element of type button a submit
button and an anchor element if we view
this HTML in the browser by default
those three elements will be rendered
like this let's see how to enhance them
as buttons using the jQuery button
widget for that we first need to find
these three elements so with no a jQuery
ready function let's use a selector we
want to find input elements of type
equals button we also want to find input
elements of type equals submit and enter
elements on this selector I'm going to
call button jQuery UI function let's
save our changes reload this page and
notice all those three elements are now
enhanced as buttons we can also
associate icons with these buttons to
associate icons use the icons option of
the button which add a button can have a
primary Aten and a secondary icon a
primary icon is displayed on the left by
default and the secondary icon is
displayed on the right for the list of
all icons that are available please
visit this URL right here so on this
page you can see all the icons now let's
go to associate this icon as the primary
icon so back in visual studio just like
any other jQuery UI widget even with
button widget we can specify options so
I'm going to specify icons option and
the value is going to be a JavaScript
object we want to associate a primary
icon and this is going to be our primary
icon we also want a secondary icon and
secondary icon is going to be this image
right here so let's copy the name and
paste it right there so let's save our
changes reload our web form
and notice we have a primary icon and a
secondary icon on this anchor element
but these two buttons this element is of
type button and this is a submit button
so notice both these buttons doesn't
have icons why is that that's basically
because icons are not supported with
input elements of type button submit or
reset we can also use this jquery button
widget to enhance checkboxes to buttons
let's look at an example of that so i
have the HTML to produce some checkboxes
already typed so let's copy and paste it
right here so here we've got three
checkboxes bold underlined italic so now
if we view this HTML in the browser by
default checkboxes will be rendered like
this now we want to enhance them to
buttons so we want to find all input
elements of type equals checkbox and on
that selector I'm going to call this
button jQuery function let's get rid of
this options object let's save our
changes reload this page notice now
those checkboxes are enhanced as buttons
though they are enhanced as buttons
their behavior is still like checkboxes
so when I click a button for the first
time so that is checked look at that it
has got a different color and border if
I click on it again it is unchecked now
okay so what we want to do is whenever
we click on any of these checkboxes if
it is checked then we want to display a
message saying for example here
underline checkbox is checked so we want
to display a message saying underline
checkbox checked if I click on that
again its unchecked so underline
checkbox is unchecked so let's see how
to achieve that to achieve that we need
to associate a click event handler so on
all this I'm going to associate a click
event handler so first we need to
determine whether if that checkbox is
checked or not so I'm going to create a
variable let's call that is
and to do that I'm going to use this
keyword here so this is going to refer
the element that on which we have
currently clicked so this dot I'm going
to use the ease function and I'm going
to use checked selector so this function
is going to return true if the checkbox
is checked otherwise false if it returns
true then in this variable we want to
store this string checked if it is
unchecked then we want to store this
string okay so this variable will
contain either checked or unchecked a
string now we want to alert the message
so let's use the JavaScript alert
function and dollar DES so we want to
determine which button the user has
clicked so if you look at these check
boxes look at the IDS for the bold
checkbox that is bold around the line
it's underlined and for italic it is
italic right so let's retrieve the ID
attribute value so that's going to tell
us which checkbox is click so I'm going
to use the attr function get the ID
attribute value and to that I'm going to
append this message so bold button or
it's a checkbox underneath so I'm going
to say bold checkbox yes whether if it
is checked or unchecked and that is
present in this variable so I'm going to
use that variable here is checked so
let's save our changes reload this page
and look at this and I click the button
look at that bold checkbox is checked if
I click it again bold checkbox is
unchecked similarly if we click on
underline underline checkbox is checked
and Han align checkbox is unchecked we
can also use this jQuery button widget
to enhance radio buttons to buttons
again I have already typed the required
HTML to produce two radio buttons so I'm
going to copy those two
and paste it right here so we have got
two radio buttons male and female let's
save those changes and by default the
radio buttons will be rendered like this
now let's enhance them as buttons so we
want to find all input elements of type
radio and on that we are calling the
button jQuery function and we still want
to associate a click even handler but
you know as far as radio button is
concerned you can only check it you
can't uncheck it and these radio buttons
are going to be mutually exclusive
because we have set the same name right
so you can either select male or female
radio button similarly you can either
select only male or female buttons on
the UI okay
so whenever we check we select the male
radio button we want to display male
radio button selected okay
so for that we don't need this variable
so I'm going to get rid of that so
dollar this attr ID that's going to give
us which radio button it is and will
simply display this message is selected
okay and let's get rid of this variable
all right so let's save our changes
let's reload this page first of all note
is they are now rendered as buttons when
I click on mail it is mainly selected
look at that at the moment mail is
selected now when I select female look
at that female is selected but male is
unselected and here it says female
selected because those are radio buttons
so they will be mutually exclusive now
we have another function called button
set so we can use this button set widget
to enhance a group of radio buttons or
checkboxes to buttons so here if you
look at what we have we have two radio
buttons right so I'm going to put them
inside a development so Dave ID let's
give it an ID let's call it radio
buttons so now these radio buttons are
present inside a development
now what I can do is since this
development has got an ID I can use a
jQuery ID selector so let's copy the ID
so find the development and on that I'm
going to call button set widget okay so
what is this going to do it's going to
render all the radio buttons inside that
they've development as buttons
okay so let's comment the rest of the
code that we have here save the changes
reload this page notice now okay for
some reason they are not rendered as
buttons let's see why's that so we have
radio buttons we are finding the
development and on that okay that's
because we have an error here we didn't
calm in this line so let's comment that
as well
reload this notice they are now rendered
as radio buttons right so you can either
select male or female if you select you
know one it will automatically unselect
the other if it's already selected okay
so now associating click event handler
here as a bit tricky you can't really
add a click event handler on top of this
button set function you can do it but
it's not going to work as expected so
what I'm going to do is to associate
click event handler I am actually going
to use another selector so find all
input elements of type equals
radio and then let's uncomment these
lines here and then I'm going to
associate click event handler to those
elements okay
so let's save our changes reload this
page panel occurs when mail is clicked
mail is selected similarly when we
select female it says female is selected
thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
