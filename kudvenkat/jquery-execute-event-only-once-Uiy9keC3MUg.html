this video we'll discuss how to execute
even handler of an element only once
let's understand this with an example
look at the jQuery code here this code
associates a click event handler with
this button the tidy BTN and to do that
we are using on function so every time
we click this button we get this alert
saying button clicked let's flip to
visual studio so here we have a button
with ID BTN with no a jQuery ready
function let's find the button by ID and
then let's use the on function to
associate click event handler so when
click event is triggered on the button
this is the function that we want to
call and we want this function to
display a JavaScript alert saying button
clicked so let's see if the changes
reload this page and look at this every
time we click the button we get the
alert right now what we want to do is we
want this click event handler code to be
executed only once to achieve that we
have to remove the click event handler
on first execution so when we click the
button what happens this is the
anonymous function that gets called it
displays the JavaScript alert and then
immediately after that we want to remove
the click event handler to remove the
click event handler we can use all
function and to call the or function we
have to first find this button so let's
use this keyword to find the button and
then call the off function and to this
function we need to specify the name of
the even that we want to remove in this
case it's going to be click so what's
going to happen here when we click the
button first time this anonymous
function is called it's going to display
the JavaScript alert and then you know
it immediately removes the click event
handler so subsequently when you click
the button nothing is going to happen so
let's look at this in action let's save
the changes let's reload this page and
look at this first time and we click the
button it displays the alert I click OK
then it should have immediately removed
the click event handler as well so
subsequently when we click the button
look at this nothing happens so to
achieve that we're using two functions
on and off now instead of using these
two functions we can use another
function
in jQuery called one the purpose of this
function is exactly the same thing it
will ensure that this click event
handler is executed only once so instead
of using on and off like this I can use
one function and get rid of this call to
off function so this is equivalent to
using on and off so let's save the
changes reload this page and look at
this first time when we click the button
we get the alert it should have removed
the click event handler now when I click
the button nothing happens right so if
you look at this example at the moment
we only have one event now let's look at
an example of where we have multiple
events let's associate these three
events that is mouse over Mouse out and
click with the button so let's flip to
visual studio first let's see how to do
that using on function so we are going
to use on function and associate three
events mouse over Mouse out and click
and to do that I'm going to make use of
JSON object and the first even that we
want to associate is mouse over when
that event is raised we want to call an
anonymous function and what do we want
to do one more so what we want to change
the background color of the button to
arrow so I'm going to use this to refer
to the button lets you CSS function and
the property that we want to change is
background color and we want to change
the background color to yellow right so
at the moment we only have one event
let's associate mouse out next so put a
comma and then the other event is going
to be Mouse out and when that event
occurs we want to call this anonymous
function on Mouse out we want to change
the background color to white and
finally we want to associate a click
event so on click we want to call this
function and when click event is
triggered we want to simply display a
JavaScript alert saying part and clicked
all right so at the moment we're using
own function so let's save the changes
and look at this every time we mouse
over the background color has changed to
L of similarly every time we
the background color is changed to white
and when we click the button we get that
alert every time okay that's because
we're using on function and these even
handlers are executed every time those
events are triggered but that's not what
we want we want those even handlers to
be executed only once and to achieve
that we can use on and off functions
like how we did it before
so when mouse-over event is triggered
change the background color to yellow
and then immediately you know remove the
mouse over even handler and to do that
let's use this keyword to refer to the
button element and let's use all
function and then we have to specify the
name of the event the name of the event
is mouse over we have to do the same
thing for all the three events so
onmouseout you know change the
background color to white and remove the
event handler for Mouse out and finally
do the same thing for the click event
right look at this we have to call off
function three times so let's save the
changes and let's look at this now
reload the page look at this onmouseover
background colors change to yellow
onmouseout white now when I mouse over
again look at that nothing happens on
Mouse out nothing happens and similarly
when we click the button the first time
we get the alert when I click the button
again notice that nothing happens but to
achieve that we are using on and off
functions okay
instead of that we can use one function
like that and since we are using one
function we don't have to explicitly
remove the event handler so we can get
rid off the call to off function so
let's save the changes
reload this page and look at this first
time onmouseover background color change
to yellow on Mouse out white and when we
click the button we get the alert but
nothing happens after that onmouseover
on Mouse out or when we click OK so here
we are using one function so here is
that example which we have written you
are rewritten using one function and now
let's look at an example of way we have
multiple elements so at the moment we
only have one button and that ask
an idea of median now what if we have
let's say two or three buttons like this
okay we have three buttons at the moment
three buttons cannot have the same ID so
let's get rid of this ID attribute for
the time being and within our jQuery
selector at the moment we are using ID
selector instead of that let's use
element selector so we want to find all
input elements where type equals button
okay so what is this code going to do
this is going to find all the button
elements and then associate mouse over
mouse out and click event to all the
three buttons okay so now let's save the
changes let's reload this page look at
that we have got three buttons now and
three buttons have got these three
events associated okay now how is the
behavior going to be now look at this
onmouseover of this button background
color change it to ello onmouseout white
and when I mouse over again nothing
happens now what do you think is going
to happen when I mouse over this pattern
well the mouse over even handle be
executed it will be look at that
background color is changed to yellow
and onmouseout white similarly the same
happens for this similarly when we click
the button the first time we get the
click event handler I click it again
nothing happens when I click this button
it executes the code when I click this
button executes the code but
subsequently when we click these buttons
nothing happens so the important point
to keep in mind is that this one
function executes the event handler at
most once per element per event type so
in this example click mouse over and
mouse out events are executed at most
once for each button element here we
have two buttons but in our example we
have used three buttons thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
