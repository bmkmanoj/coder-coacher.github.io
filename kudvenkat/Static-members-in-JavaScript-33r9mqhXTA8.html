in this video we'll discus static
members in JavaScript in an object
oriented programming language classes
can have static members that is static
methods and static fields here we have a
c-sharp circle class in this class pi is
a static field radius is an instance
field now let's understand the
difference between static and instance
members and when to use one over the
other
an instance member belong to a specific
instance so for example if I create
three instances that is three objects
then there will be three copies of
instance fields in memory whereas there
will ever be only one copy of a static
field no matter how many instances we
create so in this example right here
radius is an instance field so radius is
going to be specific to the circle
instance that we are going to create so
for example if we create hundreds circle
objects then there will be hundred
copies of this radius field each one
being specific to the circle object that
we have created but whereas there will
be only one copy of this static field
that is pi and that one copy will be
shared by all the hundred different
circle objects so if you want a member
to be shared by all the instances then
make it a static field otherwise make it
an instance field we know that
javascript is also an object-oriented
programming language so objects in
JavaScript can also have static members
that is static methods and fields let's
look at an example let's go ahead and
create a circle constructor function and
to this constructor function we are
passing radius parameter and let's
create an instance fail
so basically radius is going to be
specific to each circle object that we
are going to create so radius is going
to be an instance field and notice to
create an instance field by using this
keyword so basically this keyword
represents an instance of the circle
now pi is going to be constant it's not
going to change on a pair circle object
that we create in our it's going to
remain constant and we want all these
circle objects to share that value to
share that pi value so it's not going to
be specific to an instance that we are
going to create so that's why we want pi
to be a static view to create a static
field we use the name of the constructor
function so the name of the constructor
function is circle so circle dot pi
equals three point one four one so
basically in this example pi is a static
field and radius is an instance field
now let's go ahead and create a function
so this dot calculate area equals
function so basically this function is
going to calculate the area of the
circle now to calculate the area of the
circle the formula is PI R square so PI
into radius into radius so now pi is a
static field to create a static field
notice that we are using the name of the
constructor function similarly to invoke
a static field again we have to use the
name of the constructor function circle
dot pi into radius radius is an instance
field so let's use this keyword which
represents an instance of circle so this
dot radius into this dot radius and
let's return the area back so we have a
very simple circle constructor function
with one instance field one static field
and one instance method and let's go
ahead and create a circle instance let's
pass 10 as the radius now let's go and
print the area so area equals circle dot
calculate area let's save these changes
reload the page we expect the area to be
3.14 I mean three one four point one
so to define a static member use the
name of the constructor function to
invoke a static member again use the
name of the constructor function to
invoke an instance member use the
instance of the constructor function
let's look at an example of using static
methods are in JavaScript
so to understand static methods let's
look at a different example so let's go
ahead and create a function let's
actually name it shape and let's pass a
parameter shape name now for the time
being let's create two instance fields
the first one is going to be shape name
and we are going to initialize that with
the parameter that's coming into the
shape constructor function and I'm going
to create another instance field and
that's going to be count equals plus
plus discount or one so basically what
is this instance field going to do now
the reason I have this instance field
here is because we want to keep track of
the number of you know shapes that we
have created so if I create three
instances of shape then we want the
count to tell us that in our value that
is we have created three instances so to
keep track of the number of instances we
have created we are going to use this
but notice at the moment this is and
then this is an instance field so it's
not going to quite work the way we want
it to we'll look at that in just a bit
but what is this line going to do here
if this field already exists then
increment its value by one if it doesn't
exist then initialize it to 1 okay
that's what this line basically means
now let's go ahead and create a function
again this is going to be an instance
function so let's call this show count
equals function and this function is
simply going to return the value that is
present in the count variable
okay now let's go ahead and create three
different shapes so shape one equals new
shape let's say first we want to create
this circle shape let's actually create
three different shapes so two and three
shape to let's say it's rectangle and
shape three is triangle okay
so shape count equals now look at this
we've created three shape objects and if
you look at show count method that's an
instance method so we have to use the
instance of shape
so here shape 3 is an instance of shape
so shape 3 dot show count now since we
have created three shapes we want the
count to show you know the value 3
because we have the count is 3 let's see
what it is going to display so when we
load the page notice that it says shape
count equals 1 why is that that's
basically because if you look at this
count feel that's an instance feel so
every time you create a new shape what's
going to happen count does not exist so
it creates that initialize that to 1 so
when I create shape 1 you know the count
which is specific to this shape 1 object
that we have created it's value is 1 and
then when we call for example shape 1.0
count it will be 1 look at this and
similarly when we say shape 2.0 count it
will still be 1 because count here is
specific to the instance that we are
creating now our intention is to
actually share this count field across
all instances that we have created so
that we can keep track of the number of
shape objects that we are creating so if
that's the case then make it a static
feel and to make it a static field
instead of using an instance of shape we
have to use the name of the constructor
function so in this case the name is
shape so shape dot count equals plus
plus shape dot count or 1 and let's
actually make this also a static method
and to access static feel again use the
name of the constructor function shape
dot count and again here it has to be
shaped count so now this count field is
a static field and show count method is
a static method so let's save these
changes and so notice we have created
three shape objects so when we reload
this page shape count should now be
three now if we go ahead and create a
new shape square so this is our fourth
shape so now count should be four notice
that so now this static freely shared
across all instances of shape thank you
for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
