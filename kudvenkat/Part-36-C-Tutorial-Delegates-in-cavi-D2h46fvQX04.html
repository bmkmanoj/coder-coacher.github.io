venket this is part 36 delegates in this
session we will learn the basics of
delegates in the previous sessions we
have learned about structures classes
and interfaces we know that structures
are value types whereas classes and
interfaces are reference types
similarly delegates are also reference
types now delegates is one of the
complicated subjects in any of the
programming languages but trust me if
you get the basics rights
delegates are extremely easy and you
love to work with them in fact when I
was learning delegates I was like what
the hell why do we use this these are so
complicated but then once I realized the
flexibility they provide us with you
know they are I love to work with them
right now okay so let's get our you know
hands around the basics in this session
and in a later session we'll actually
see how to apply this you know delegates
to solve some real time business
problems okay let's look at an example
now what's a delegate a delegate is a
function pointer actually a delegate is
a type save function pointer so this is
the actual definition of a delegated
delegate is a type save function pointer
meaning a delegate points to a function
and then when you invoke this delegate
the function will be invoked now you
will be wondering why do you have to
create a delegate make make it point to
a function and then invoke that delegate
why don't you call the function directly
now the reason why we have to do it in
that way is because of the flexibility
that we will get with that approach okay
that's what we'll examine in a later
session but in this session we'll only
concentrate on the basics of delegates
so once we are very comfortable with the
syntax of creating a delegate and then
making it point to a function and then
invoke the delegate and and we get all
the you know
basic strong about these delegates then
we will see how to apply this delegate
to a real-time project and solve some
real business problems all right now
since a delegate is a type save function
pointer meaning it points to a function
so we need a function so let's go ahead
and create a simple function now I have
a simple function public void let's say
hello and this function takes in a
message of string type let's say STR
message and all this function does is
output that message to the console so
console dot readline STR message so it
pinch that message to the console let's
make it static so this static method and
if you haven't you know watched my video
series on methods and if you're new to
methods I would strongly encourage you
to watch the video tutorial on methods
in this series okay now if you look at
this method it has got the wide return
type and it takes a string parameter
okay now we know that a delegate is it
is a function pointer so to actually
understand the delegate you know think
of it the syntax of a delegate is
actually similar to a function okay now
to create a structure we use the struct
keyword created class we use the class
keyword similarly if you want to create
a delegate you use the delegate keyword
okay so public delegate now to remember
the syntax of the delegate think of it
as if it's a method with a delegate
keyword okay a method will have a return
type name of the method and then any
parameters okay similarly a delegate
will also have a return type let's say
why this return type and then the name
of the delegate now this delegate is
going to point to this function so let's
give it a meaningful name you can give
it any name but let me give it as hollow
function delegate
okay and then just like a method a
delegate also takes in a parameter so
I'm going to pass it a string parameter
that's it so if you look at this
delegate you know apart from this
delegate keyword it's actually like a
method signature that's got the access
modifier a return type name of the
delegate of function whatever and then
the parameter but if you put the
delegate keyword there it becomes a
delegate meaning this delegate now can
be used you know to point to a function
which has a similar syntax
I mean similar signature now this
delegate can point to any function that
has got wide return type and takes in a
string parameter okay now how do we make
this delegate point to a function okay
to do that you have to create an
instance of this delegate and this is
where a delegate is similar to a class
okay now if I have a customer class I
can say customer c1 is equal to new
customer c1 is the instance of the class
similarly I can create an instance of
this delegate so to create an instance
of this delegate all you do is hello
function delegate okay let's say
delegate is equal to new hollow function
delegate and to the constructor of this
delegate you pass in the name of the
function to which you want this delegate
to point to okay
in our example I want this function to
point to this hello method so I'm going
to pass in that function name and if you
look at the intelligence here okay the
parameter that you are going to pass in
should be a method name because that's a
delegate okay and that method should
have a wide return type and it should
take a string parameter so is our method
confirming to that signature yes it has
got wide reason type and it's taking in
a string parameter so now I can pass
this hello now to invoke that
method all you do is invoke this
delegate and if you look at this
delegate it is expecting a string
parameter to be passed in so when I try
to call that delegate I have to pass in
the string parameter so let's say hello
from delegate so now what's going to
happen this delegate call will actually
internally behind the scenes it will
automatically invoke this method and to
this method it will pass this parameter
and whatever this method has to do it
will do its job in this case it will
print that message onto the console so
if I go ahead and run this now look at
this hello from delegate we get that you
know this is being printed by this
method okay so it's it's very simple a
delegate is a types a function pointer
will come back to type safe part in just
a bit but let's understand this a
delegate is a function pointer why is it
called a function pointer because to
this delegate you're passing in the name
of the function which you want to invoke
and then when you invoke this delegate
since this delegate is pointing to that
function that function get called
automatically that's why delegate is
called as a function pointer because
this delegate is pointing to this
function so this delegate is a function
pointer but what do we mean by types a
function pointer okay actually in
c-sharp delegates are types a function
pointers what do we mean by that now
let's say I have another method or let's
take this method itself instead of the
string return type I mean instead of the
wide return type I am saying the return
type is going to be string now look at
this I have already caught a red
squiggly indicating that you know hollow
method has the wrong return type now
this delegate if you look at the
signature of this delegate it has a wide
return type and it expects a string
parameter but if you look at this method
to which this delegate is pointing this
method has got a different signature it
has got it
String return type okay so the point to
keep in mind is the signature of the
delegate should match the signature of
the function to which it points to if
the signature of the method does not
match then we get a compiler error like
this so that's why the delegate is
called as a type safe function pointer
so the signature of the delegate should
match the signature of the function to
which it points to that's the reason
delegates are called
types a function pointer look at this
the moment I change that to void now the
signature of this method matches the
signature of this delegate hence the
compiler warning goes away okay so let's
go back to the slides now you might be
wondering okay why all this complexity
now all I want this I want to print this
message hello from delegate by calling
you know this hello method now why do I
have to declare a delegate create an
instance of that and into the instance I
want to pass this method and then call
the delegate okay so there are so many
steps why do you want to do that you
know instead of all this simply say
hello and pass in the message hello from
delegate okay which is actually very
easy to do and you get the expected
output but then here we are trying to
learn the delegates okay so actually
delegates give us a lot of flexibility
in real-time projects okay which we will
be exploring in a later session so don't
worry about that piece now okay so
that's why we are trying to understand
the basics of delegates here okay so
what does a delegate a delegate is a
typesafe function pointer that is it
holds a reference or a pointer to a
function and the signature of the
delegate must match the signature of the
function the delegates points to
otherwise you get a compiler error and
this is the reason why delegates are
called as types a function pointer and
if you look at it a delegate is very
much similar to a cup class you can
create an instance of set and when you
do so to the constructor of the delegate
you
in the name of the function that you
want your delegate to point to and a tip
that I followed to remember you know the
syntax of the delegate it's very much
similar to the syntax of the method
except that it has delegate keywords
within that just like a method it has
got a written type name of the method or
delegate and then the parameters with a
delegate keyword and this that simple
example that we have seen okay if you
look at this delegate it has got
signature very much similar to a method
with the delegate keyword and here we
are creating an instance of this
delegate and to the constructor of the
delegate we pass in the name of the
function and this functions signature
must confirm to the signature of the
delegate otherwise we get a compiler
error that's why we call a delegate is a
type save function pointer and then to
invoke the delegate we just invoke the
delegate and pass in the string message
which will behind-the-scenes
automatically invoke the function to
which this delegate is pointing to all
right on this slide you can find some
resources for asp.net and C sharp
interview questions that's it for today
