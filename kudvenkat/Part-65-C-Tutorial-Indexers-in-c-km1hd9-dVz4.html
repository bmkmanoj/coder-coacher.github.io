vented this is part 65 of c-sharp
tutorial in this video we'll discuss
about creating indexes please watch part
64 before proceeding with this video in
part 64 we discussed about how and where
indexes are used within dotnet framework
now let's practically understand
creating indexes with an example let's
flip to visual studio here I have an
asp.net web application project let's
add a class file to this project and
let's call it company dot CS now a
company contains employees to
encapsulate employee information let's
add a class employee so public class
employee this class is going to contain
you know three auto implemented
properties employee ID so public int
employee ID it's going to have the
default get inset accesses without any
specific implementation now let me add
name and gender properties as well name
is of type string so let's change the
data type to string and the property
name is going to be name and gender is
also going to be string all right so we
have an employee class with three auto
implemented properties now within the
company class usually a company contains
a list of employees too so to hold those
lists of employees I'm going to create a
private variable here of type list
employee and let's call this list
employees and then within the
constructor of this company class I'm
going to initialize this list okay so
usually a constructor will have the same
name as that of the class and doesn't
have a return type so here this is the
company class constructor look at the
name is the same name as that of the
class and it doesn't have a return type
so I'm going to initialize this list
here so list employees is equal to new
list of employee and then I'm going to
add some employees to this list here so
as soon as
the company object then I will have all
the list of employees that belong to
that company within this object here
okay now in reality we may actually load
the list of employees from a database
table but to keep things simple here to
understand indexes and focus on indexers
I'm going to add some employees within
code okay
so list employees dot add I'm going to
add a new employee and obviously we need
to specify the properties so employee ID
let's say that's one name of the
employee is going to be let's say Mike
and his gender is male alright so at
this point we have an employee added to
our list but let's add a few more
employees and to speed things up I have
that already type so let me copy and
paste that here and look at this bullets
very simple it's the same code we are
adding you know different employees here
with different IDs and names and genders
okay so at this point we have this
company class within that we have this
private variable of type list employee
and within the constructor we are
initializing that object and adding
employees to that list okay so this is a
private list meaning nobody can access
this list outside of this class okay
but then remember in the previous
session we discussed about using sequel
data reader object and a session object
using the indexers in a similar fashion
I want to be able to use this company
class and and retrieve the employees
using employee ID and at the same time
using employee ID indexer I should be
able to change the names of the
employees okay is that possible to
implement an indexer like that for our
class company absolutely let's see how
to do that okay now we create indexes
using this keyword so public so the
return type of this indexer is going to
be string because I give it an employee
ID to this company class I give an
employee ID and it has to return me the
name of the employee you know whom whose
ID matches with that employee ID so it's
going to return the name which is string
and then we create an index in
using this keyword and then I open the
square bracket and then what is the data
type of employee ID it's an integer so
I'm going to pass an employee ID and the
class should return me the name of the
employee whose ID matches with the past
an employee ID so int employee ID okay
so just like properties you know if you
are familiar with properties
implementing indexes is very straight
forward just like properties it's going
to have get and set access service we
discussed about properties in the
previous session of this video series so
please watch that video so it's going to
have a get accessor so what should this
get access or do you know for the given
employee ID it should return me the name
of the employee okay so to do that
whether the list of employees present
the list of employees present in this
list okay so what I'm going to do here
I'm going to use little bit of link here
you know to return the employee name
whose ID matches with what is being
passed into this index ax so I'm going
to say return you know we have the list
list is list employees so from this list
okay I want to get a first or default
element so within this list find an
employee EMP such that that employee dot
employee ID should match with whatever
we are passing into this indexer okay so
this method is going to return an
employee object okay look at that first
or default method you know look at the
return type from the intelligence it's
returning an employee object and from
that object I want to pick up their name
and return that so that's the get
accessor of this index ax now what
should the set access or do now if I set
an employee ID you know for example I
will say company of employee company of
one you know something like this the
usage of this indexer should be
something like this if I say let's say I
have a company object and when I say
company of three
is equal to you know maybe Jade
that's the name then what should happen
for an employee with ID is equal to
three we should change the name to Jade
okay so that's what the set access issue
for the given employee ID change their
name to whatever value they are going to
set so to do that what I'm going to do
from the list first we should find that
employee
so let's employees first or default you
know the same kind of the expression so
for the given employee find the employee
ID if that matches with what is passed
then then set their name to whatever
value they are passed setting so here we
are setting Jade so Jade will be
assigned to the name of property of the
employee so it's basically employee ID
so let's cop it here so Jade will be set
as the name for the given employee ID
you know whatever employee ID you pass
in if there is an employee with that ID
you know we get the employee and their
name is set to that value Jade in this
case okay so we have the indexer
implemented here so the points to note
here is we you we implement the indexer
using this keyword and x-rays will have
a return type and it it has parameters
and then it has gettin set accessors
just like properties okay so we are done
implementing the indexer for our company
class so let's build the solution let's
see how to actually use this indexer on
a webform
so let's go back to the code-behind file
of this waveform one and let's print the
names of some of the employees so here
we have lists of around 8 employees so
let's say i want to print out the name
of employee two five and eight okay
using indexers and to do that so
response dot right let's say name of
employee with ID is equal to two let's
say
now I'm going to use you know first we
need to create an instance of company
class just like how you know we are we
are using the session object and sequel
data reader object so first let me
create an instance of the company class
company is equal to new company and
remember what happens when we create a
constructor of this you know when we
when we create an instance of this
company class you know the constructor
gets invoked and within the constructor
we are creating a new list and
populating the list with some employees
here okay
so that's what happens when I create
this company object now I want to
retrieve the name of the employee whose
ID is two and look at this the moment I
open the square bracket it detects that
there is an indexer on employee ID and
then the moment I pass to it look at the
return type its string meaning it's
going to return the name of the employee
that's that and then let's put an HTML
break so that the next employee will
come in a different line all right so
let's copy this and you know let's say
name of the employee with ID is equal to
five name of employee with ID is equal
to eight let's get the employee name
with ID five and eight and then what I
also want to do here we are only
retrieving you know the names of the
employees okay by passing in the IDS
obviously when we pass in the ID and if
you want to the name then this get
access or of this indexer will be
invoked and now let's say I want to
change the names of those employees is
it possible with the indexer absolutely
so let's say response tort right let's
say here changing names of employees
with ID is equal to 2 comma five and
eight
and let's write an HTML break there and
how do we change the employee names
using indexes all you need to do is so
use the company object here so company
object let's say if I want to change the
name of the employee that ID is equal to
to company of two is equal to let's say
second employee name changed similarly
let's do it for five and eight as well
so five and eight so after the name is
changed let's print their names once
again so it's the same piece of code so
we can just copy and paste it there
alright so these three lines should
print the name of the employees before
change so if you look at employees to
five and they eat within the company
class two is spam 5s Emily a test ban so
that's what should be the names of the
employees you know before we have
changed them and we are retrieving them
using the indexer so Pam Emily and Ben
and we are changing and we are saying
changing names of employees with ID is
equal to two five and eight so second
employee name change oh it should
actually be fifth employee name change I
think it's because of copy/paste error
there so let's actually call this first
employee name changed eighth employee
name changed and let's also have an
additional HTML break there so the doubt
put will be properly formatted so here
look at that the employee names with two
five and eighty spam Emily been changing
names of employees with ID is equal to
two five and eight and look at that
you know after we have changed the names
second employee name changed fifth
employee name change and that should be
eight employee name changed I think we
didn't do it for the last employee so
that should be a the employee anyway so
here we are using the set X
I mean set accessor of the indexer to
actually change the values there okay so
if you understand properties
implementing indexes is pretty
straightforward
so the points to remember we use this
keyword to create an indexer just like
properties indexes have get and set
accessors indexes can also be overloaded
we will discuss about overloading
indexers in our next video session and
this is how we have used the get and set
accesses of our company object you know
of that index our employee ID integral
indexer on this slide you can find the
sources face be dotnet c-sharp and
sequels of interview questions that's it
for today thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
