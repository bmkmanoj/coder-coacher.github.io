few tutorials we discussed how to create
a sample HelloWorld program in Java note
that we saw a mean method that executed
our program the main method was entry
point to over-application in this
tutorial we will learn in detail about
what is a method water functions and
procedures which are related terminology
associated with methods what is Method
syntax how do we call methods now let's
understand water methods in Java a
method is simply a set of code which is
referred to by name and we can call at
any point in a program simply by
utilizing that methods names now think
of method as a sub program that is
taking some input and returning some
value so method is essentially a
collection of statements that we have
grouped together and we have given it
some name and then we can call that
method from anywhere in our program and
we can provide it some input parameters
and we can expect some value in return
the value in return is optional a method
may not return a value you might also
see words or terms like functions and
procedures for this course they are all
alike as they all refer to collection of
statements in different programming
paradigms different terminologies is
used but for us functions procedures and
methods are all same functions and
methods usually return a value and
procedure is also used to denote a
method that contains a sequence of
statements click together I may not
return any value you might wonder what
happens when we call a method so
whenever you call a method the
application branches to the body of that
method and when that method executes
and finishes the control returns back to
the area of the program from where it
was called to understand this in more
detail let's recall our hello world
program where we had a method called
with the name means note that she we had
a main method which was taking string
arguments as the input and it was
printing hello world by calling the
println function from the system score
library you might wonder that this
method mean is taking in something which
is called arguments which is an array of
strings however we are not using it
anywhere why does it exist so let's do
some experiment
so let's say I remove this string err er
GS and now let's compile the program the
program will successfully compile
because this is a valid method
declaration however when you execute
this program we might see an error this
is because the java application expects
some method with the name main which
takes string array arguments and which
is static and there does not exist any
such method therefore the errors main
method not found in class program
therefore even if we do not use the
input we have to specify it I hope this
is clear now let's start to dissect what
each word means in this main method
declaration you will observe that this
declaration starts with keyword public
now public is access modifier which
indicates that this method is visible
outside this class also then we have a
return types in this case it is void
what it means the method doesn't return
anything main is the name of the method
and then we have a parameter list in the
parentheses in this case string
arguments is the parameter list and then
we have set of statements inside the
method body and then if there is a
return type associated with the method
we may optionally return some value from
the method the keyword static in this
method indicates that this method is
associated with a class
note that there are other kinds of
methods also which are not static if you
remove the static keyword from this the
method will become a non static method
and non static methods are also called
instance methods we will learn about
object classes and instances and
instance methods in our next tutorial
for now let's understand how do we
create more methods in our program let's
say I want to introduce another method
which adds to number and returns their
sum so it returns an integer value which
denotes the sum and the name of the
method is add two numbers it takes two
parameters first number and second
number
I declare I declare a variable of type
sum I declare a variable sum of type
integer and I assign it a value first
number plus second number and then I
return this value now from this main
method I can call this method add two
numbers and I can pass two and three to
this method note that this two value
gets mapped to the parameter first
number and this three gets mapped to the
value second number and since this
method returns this one I can collect it
here back and then I can print that from
now let's compile this program and when
we execute this program we should expect
the sum of two and three as the output
and so we get five note that if I remove
this keyword static from here and then
if I compile the program I'll get an
error that you are trying to call a non
static method add two numbers from
static context what this means is I am
trying to call a method add two numbers
from a static method mean and this add
two numbers is not static so the point
to take away from this slide is you can
only refer to static methods and static
numbers
from static context if you want to refer
a non-static method from a static
context like a main method here you will
have to create something called instance
which we will see in detail quickly in
our next tutorial
but for now understand that if you have
a static method main and if you want to
directly call another static method it
is possible but you cannot call a non
static method without creating any
instance our program is compiled able
again now and we can see its output so
to recall to revise we created us add
two numbers method where public was the
excess modifier the method web static
its name was add two numbers and it was
returning an integer value and it was
taking two parameters number one and
number two and it was returning an
integer value which denoted the sum and
how did we call the number we call the
method by specifying the name of the
method followed by parentheses and we
provided T two values two and three
which are mapped to the parameters
number one and number two when we call
the method and the values that we pass
are called arguments and these arguments
gets mapped to the parameter number one
and number two that we specified while
declaration of the methods if the method
return type is void it may not return
any value in this tutorial we also
discussed about static methods static
keyword makes the method static static
method means that these methods belong
to the class
and we can invoke these methods without
creating any instance of the class so in
this tutorial we understood what is the
syntax to create a method whoa what is
the way to call the method and water
static methods in our next tutorial we
will learn in detail about classes and
object-oriented programming so stay
tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
