this video we'll discuss the different
instancing modes that are available in
WCF instancing modes are also called as
instance context modes before we try and
understand what we mean by instance
context mode let's understand the
request response cycle when a WCF client
makes a request the WCF servers will
create an instance of the service class
itself and on that service instance we
invoke the respective operation and the
operation does whatever it has to do and
after the processing is complete we
return the response back to the client
who has made that request so the big
question now is what should happen to
that service instance object should that
remain on the silver memory forever that
is for the lifetime of the application
or should that service instance be
destroyed right away after the request
has been fulfilled or should that
service instance remain on the server
for the session you know duration of the
client okay that's what the instance
context mode dictates so in short
instance context more dictates how long
the service instance remains on the
server in WCF there are three instance
context modes as you can see here per
call as the name suggests you know every
call drizzles n a new service instance
being created so a new instance of
service object is created for every
request irrespective of whether that
request came from the same client or
from a different line okay which means
every call results in a new service
instance being created which also means
indirectly that you know that service
instance get destroyed right away after
the request has been fulfilled
so a request comes in you know an
instance gets created request is
fulfilled response it to the client and
the service instance get destroyed right
away which also means indirectly you
know the state is not maintained between
requests their session and new instance
of the service object is created for
each new client
and that service instance is maintained
on the server for the duration of that
session okay so every client gets a
service instance and that service
instance is maintained you know until
the session times out okay if the
request is from the same client then the
service instance that's there on the
server will be used to service the
request from that client okay and single
as the name States a single instance of
the service object is created and it is
going to handle all the requests for the
lifetime of the application and
irrespective of whether that request has
come from the same line or from a
different client okay so if the instance
context mode is single there's a single
instance you know residing on the server
which is going to serve each and every
request from every client and how do we
set this instance context more we use
the service behavior attributes for that
purpose and then set instance context
mode so we use this enumeration and as
you can see there are three choices here
per call per session and single in our
next video we'll discuss each of these
instance context modes with an example
and we'll also see what their
implications are that's it for today
thank you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
