venket this is part 11 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll learn about
the properties and the events of an
asp.net radio button control radio
button control is actually used when you
want the user to select only one option
from the available choices for example
the gender of a person a person can be
male or female
he cannot be both at the same time so if
the user has first selected male and
then if he tries to select female the
initial male selection he made should
automatically be selected so this is one
of the scenarios when we can actually
use the radio button control another
example would be when you want the user
to select his or her favorite color
in fact for both of these choices we can
actually use another control called
radio button list control in asp.net we
will be talking about radio button list
control in a later video session so in
short we can see that if you want to
provide the user with mutually exclusive
choices then choose the radio button
control now this radio button control
exposes several properties and events
that we need to be aware of as a
developer let's actually look at an
example so here I have an asp.net web
application which has got three radio
buttons on this waveform male female and
unknown and these radio buttons are
actually wrapped between an HTML field
set element and this field set element
has got this legend legend contains this
text gender so if you're wondering what
a legend is that's the text that you can
see within the field set and then and
then inside that fields that we have
these three radio button controls which
has got the ID and the text properties
so the ID property as we know it's used
to uniquely identify the control on this
waveform and then the text property is
something that you can actually see for
the radio button so we can use this text
property to set or get the text of the
radio button control alright so now
let's go ahead and run this so there is
a slight problem with these three radio
buttons that we have on this waveform
now
the gender of a person can be male or
female or unknown it cannot be you know
all of them at the same time but then if
you look at this radio buttons here I am
able to select all of them at the same
time which is a problem we will correct
the problem just in a bit but before
that we will look at the other
properties that are available for this
radio button the first properties that
check the property this is a boolean
property meaning it's going to return a
true or a false it's going to return
true if the radio button is checked it's
going to return false if it's not
checked ok so we can use this check to
property to determine what is the radio
button that the user has clicked so
double click the button it generates the
even handler so f mail radio button
that's the ID of the male radio button
dot checked is equal to true so which
means if the user has selected the male
radio button then we know that he has
made a choice of male so response dot
write your gender is instead of
hard-coding the text we can actually
retrieve that from the control itself
using the text property so male radio
button dot text and then just to display
this properly we can use the HTML break
element so that each response is written
in its own line all right
so if the male radio button is checked
on the other hand if the female radio
button is checked then we want to say so
so if female radio button that checked
is equal to true then your gender is
female radio button
along the same lines if unknown is
checked
okay now there is a slight problem with
the score actually you look at this kind
of code on the Internet
the problem is look at this checked
property you know the checked property
itself is a boolean property so which
means it's going to return a true or a
false you don't really have to compare
that value to a true you can just say if
checked okay that itself is enough you
don't have to retrieve that and then
compare it with unnecessary processing
this can be slightly better in terms of
performance all right so obviously when
we run this now and then when you make
your choices you know whatever are the
choices that the user has made you know
those will be printed so I select all
three of them so it's saying your gender
is male your gender is female and
unknown as expected okay so this checked
property is used to determine whether if
the user has actually checked that radio
button or not and we can use the text
property to get or retrieve the text of
the radio button control and then there
is another property called text aligned
property and this is very simple to
understand
you know this basically dictates the
alignment of the text of the radio
button control do you want that to be on
the right side or on the left side so at
the moment if you look at the radio
button controls you know for all the
three radio button controls we have the
text aligned on the right hand side
let's say for example for this radio
button I want the text to be aligned on
the left-hand side I go to the
properties window text a line and I can
just choose left and then that flips
that to the left side so let's put this
back to right side so that's the text
aligned property
auto post back and this is similar to
other controls like the auto post back
property of a textbox control or a
drop-down list control we set this
property to true if you want the webform
to be posted immediately when the check
the status of the radio button changes
okay now if you look at the textbox
control textbox control exposes text
change the event and that's by default
is cached in the view state of the
control and then this event the text
changed event will be fired only when
you post the
webform back to the server by clicking a
button control okay so in a similar way
you know the radio button exposes an
event called checked changed in the
sense you know the check that selection
changed event this event is fired
whenever the status of the radio button
control is changed that check the status
is changed now by default this even is
cached in the view state if you want to
treat that as a postback event set the
auto post back property to true so if
you look at this for example you know
when i double click that look at that
check that changed even handler is
generated and let's say a response dot
right and since this is the mail radio
button I'm going to say mail radio
button selection changed
all right so now when we actually run
this you know let's rerun that once
again so when we run this and when we
change the selection of that male radio
button look at this it's not selected I
select that but the even didn't get
fired immediately but when I click the
button look at that that's when it gets
fired because the event is cached in the
view state of this control and it's
fired by default only when you post the
waveform back to the server for
processing but if you want to convert
that cached event of this radio button
control into a postback event all you do
is is set the auto post back property to
true and we do that by going into the
properties window and then set this auto
post back property to true so when we
run the application now and then change
the selection it will be immediately
posted back to the server so I select
that you know immediately post it back
unselect that it will again post back to
the server if you want to unselect you
know these are not mutually exclusive
now so you wouldn't be able to unselect
that will correct that problem just in a
bit all right let's turn this off the
auto post back property so we have seen
the auto post back property and along
the same lines we also have seen the
only event exposed by the radio button
control check that changed event okay
and the very important property is the
group name property and if you look at
these radio button controls they are not
interacting with each other meaning they
are not mutually exclusive at the minute
if you want to make them mutually
exclusive then these radio button
controls have got a property called
Group name property so if you want all
these three radio button controls to be
mutually exclusive set the group name
property of all these three radio button
controls to be the same so I'm going to
set the group name for this radio button
control to be let's say gender group and
use the same group name for all the
three radio button controls
select both of them go to properties and
I'm going to select set the same group
name now if I go ahead and run this and
try to select the radio buttons will be
mutually exclusive as expected so that's
the significance of group name so look
at this now these are mutually exclusive
and obviously if I select now your
gender is unknown on the other hand I
select female click that your gender is
female you know it correctly works as
expected okay but then if you look at
the code we know that at the minute
these radio buttons are mutually
exclusive which means only one of these
radio buttons is going to be checked
okay so if that's the code and if that's
the case then you can slightly improve
the performance of your code by using an
else--if else--if else
so what you are telling here
actually let's put this condition here
so here we are making these conditions
mutually exclusive because the user will
be able to select only one option
we are also checking in our code ok is
it if if this is checked we know that
these two will these two conditions will
be skipped so the performance of the
code will be slightly better to what it
was before so the behavior will be
exactly the same except that this is
slightly better in terms of the
performance so mail your gender is male
similarly if I select female your gender
is female on this slide you can find

sequence of interview questions that's
it for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
