in this video we'll discuss what is a
CDN advantages and disadvantages of
loading take with you from CDN what if
the required jQuery file cannot be
loaded from CDN so what is the CDN CDN
stands for content delivery network a
CDN is a system of distributed servers
that host resources such as images CSS
JavaScript files etc companies like
Microsoft Google Yahoo have a free
public CDN from which we can load jQuery
instead of hosting it on our own web
server here we have the URLs for
Microsoft and Google jQuery CDN I'll
have these links available on my blog in
case you need them now let's flip to
visual studio this is the same example
that we have been working with in parts
1 &amp;amp; 2 of this video series notice within
our application we have a jQuery file
and on this page the script element is
referencing this jQuery file so at the
moment of our application is using the
jQuery file that is hosted within our
own application now we can also load the
jQuery file from a CDN server in a bird
we'll discuss the benefits of loading
the jQuery file from a CDN server for
now let's go ahead and comment the
script element save the changes and
let's reload this page now when we get
to developer tools we should see a
script error notice that we get a script
error which says dollar is not defined
so basically this is complaining that
this dollar function is not defined and
that is because we don't have the jQuery
file loaded now let's see how to load
the jQuery file from the CDN server so
here is the URL for Microsoft CDN and
here is that page on this page we have a
link which says jQuery releases on the
CDN click on that link and notice we
have different jQuery versions here so
let's grab this latest version of the
jQuery file and within our page let's
use script element script source equals
the URL that we have just copied
let's close the script element save the
changes
and now when we reload this page the
script error should go away
notice that the script error is gone and
when we click this button we should get
the other ciao jQuery tutorial at the
moment our application is loading the
jQuery file from the Microsoft CDN
server so what are the benefits of using
CDN there are several benefits
distributed CDN servers the jQuery file
can be downloaded from the CDN server
that is closest to the user let's say we
have a web application and we hosted
that in a server that is in the United
States and let's say we have a client
from India now when this client acts as
a page within your application all the
resources required by that page that is
the images CSS files jQuery files all
these files need to be downloaded from
the server that is there in the United
States now let's say our application is
actually loading the jQuery from a CDN
server now what is a CDN it's a system
of distributed servers so there are
loads of CDN servers across the globe so
there could be a CDN server in India as
well so when the same user requests the
page from your application since there
is a Syrian server in the in India you
know the jQuery file can be downloaded
from the CDN server that is in India
which is closest to your client and that
means you know your page load times can
be improved because you know it's being
downloaded from a server that is closest
to the user so that's going to improve
the download time which in turn improves
your page load time the other benefit is
browser caching jQuery is used on many
popular websites if a user has already
visited a web page that uses jQuery from
a CDN and then if he arrives at your
page the jQuery file has already been
cached by the browser so there is no
need to download it again parallel
downloads there is a browser limit on
how many files can be downloaded from a
given domain this number varies from
browser to browser for example if the
browser allows only two concurrent
downloads from a given
main the third download is blocked until
one of the previous files has been fully
downloaded since the jQuery file is on a
CDN it is born being downloaded from a
different domain so this means the
browser allows another two parallel
downloads from the CDN server reduced
server load the HTTP request for jQuery
file is handled by the CDN server so the
load on your web server is reduced this
also means there is a saving on your
website bandwidth consumption which in
turn will reduce your hosting cost
there's one disadvantage that you need
to keep in mind now your client
firewalls may block the CDN so you may
have to request your clients to
whitelist the CDN and this is especially
true when you are switching the CDN
provider now when you have initially
developed your application let's say you
using Microsoft CDN and you told your
clients about the CDN domain name so the
clients have unblocked their firewalls
for that domain name now all of a sudden
because of some you know technical issue
you may want to switch to another CDN
provider now when you do that you will
have to tell your clients about that new
Syrian ploy der because if it is not
whitelisted the firewalls may block that
CDN provider as a result the jiggli file
will not be loaded and your application
may not work now what if the required
jQuery file cannot be downloaded from
CDN let's assume that either the CDN is
down or because of some network issue we
are not able to download jQuery from CDN
in this case we will have to fall back
gracefully to use the jQuery file that
we have hosted on our own web server so
let's see how to do that so at the
moment if you look at our application we
are loading the jQuery file from a CDN
server now let's write code to fall back
gracefully to these this jQuery file
that we are hosted within our
application in case you know we are not
able to load it from the CDN server
so when doe dot jQuery or I'm going to
use document.write and we're actually
going to write a script element here so
script source equals this jQuery file so
I have that within the single quotes
here and then we need to close the
angular bracket and we need to close the
script element itself so open the
angular bracket forward slash and close
the script element now this forward
slash has got a special meaning so we
need to escape that and the escape
character is backslash so let's use that
so what is this line of code doing here
now what is this jQuery property on the
window object if jQuery file is
successfully loaded okay now it's going
to add this jQuery property to the
window object okay so when do dot jQuery
if jQuery property is present on the
window object that means the jQuery file
is successfully loaded okay and look at
this this is an or condition if this
condition is true then it's not going to
execute this piece of code okay so if
the jQuery file is downloaded and it's
not going to execute this if jQuery file
is not downloaded then this property is
not going to be there so it's going to
execute this one and look at what it's
doing it's actually referring to this
script file that is present within our
application okay at the moment my
internet is working so that means this
script file can be loaded from the CDN
server let me go ahead and turn off my
internet okay so the internet is turned
off now let's actually try to navigate
to google.com look at that unable to
connect to the internet now when I load
this page we shouldn't get any error and
when I click this we should get the
alert now since I am NOT able to connect
to the internet it's actually not able
to load this jQuery file
on the CDN server so it's falling back
to this jQuery file that is present
within our application thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
