in this video well discuss events in
JavaScript first let's understand what's
an event an event is a signal from the
browser that something has happened for
example when a user clicks on an HTML
element click event occurs when a user
moves the mouse over an HTML element
mouse-over event occurs when events
occur we can execute JavaScript code of
functions in response to those events
and to do that we need to associate
javascript code of functions to the
events the function that executes in
response to an event is called event
handler in JavaScript there are several
ways to associate an email handler to
any event we can do that using the
attributes of an HTML tag or using Dom
object properties I'll be using special
methods in this video well disk is
associating even handlers to events
using the attributes of the HTML tag and
in a later video session we'll discuss
the rest of the two other options let's
look at an example now let's include a
button control so input type equals
button value equals click me and let's
give it an ID of BTN now onmouseover
that is when we move the mouse over this
button control we want to change the
background color of this button to red
and font color to ello notice that the
moment I press spacebar I can see all
the attributes here the attributes that
have got the lightning bolt symbol these
are actually the events and within this
events list notice that we have got on
mouse-over event so basically this event
occurs when we move the mouse over this
element so when we move the mouse over
this element we want to change the
background color of the button to red so
I'm going to use this keyword this
keyword here reference is the current
element in this case this keyword
reference is the button control so this
dot style dot background so we want to
change the background color of the
button to red and in addition to that we
also want to change the
font color so this dot style dot color
equals yellow so let's quickly run this
and when I move the mouse over notice
that the background color is red but the
font color is not changed to ello for
some reason let's see why is that that's
basically because we have not used the
single quotes around this color so let's
use single quotes and let's run this one
more time so when I move the mouse over
background color is red font color is
yellow now notice when I move the mouse
out of the element nothing happens now
let's say when I move the mouse out of
the element we want to change the
background color to black and font color
to white in that case we are going to
use on Mouse out attribute of the
element so on Mouse out we want to
change the background color to black and
font color to white let's run this one
more time and quickly test it so
onmouseover and onmouseout now in this
example the code that we want to execute
or you know when mouse over and Mouse
out events occur that code is present
directly within the HTML markup it's
also possible that we can move this code
into a separate JavaScript function and
we can reference that function using
this onmouseover attribute so when mouse
over event occurs you know we call the
function and the function contains the
code that we want to execute in response
to mouse over event so let's look at
that now so let's include the script
element and within the script element we
are going to have our JavaScript
function let's name this change color on
Mouse over
and I'm going to move this code from the
HTML markup into the JavaScript function
and that this keyword here will not work
okay so we have to somehow reference
this button control so I'm going to
create a variable here and I'm going to
call this control and then let's use
document.getelementbyid function and
this function let's pass the ID of this
button control which is BTN so now this
variable control has a reference to the
button control and we want to change the
background color of that button to red
and font color to yellow and now we are
going to reference this function with
this onmouseover attribute in a similar
fashion let's create another function
and change the name of this function to
on Mouse out and onmouseout we want to
change the background color to black and
font color to white and onmouseout we
want to call this function so in this
example the code that we want to execute
when mouse over and mouse out event
occurs that's present in respective
functions here all right so let's
quickly run this and test it so
onmouseover and onmouseout so the
behavior is exactly the same except that
the even handler code is now present in
a separate function and we are
referencing those functions within the
attributes and we have that same example
here
even's are very useful in real world
applications for example they can be
used to display confirmation dialog box
on submitting a form for form data
validation and many more like animations
etc now let's look at a simple example
of how to display a confirmation dialog
box when we submit the form
so I'm going to have a submit button
here so input type equals submit value
equals submit and let's give it an ID of
BTN let's include a scrip section and
within here let's have a JavaScript
function and let's call this confirm on
submit so basically what we want to do
is when we click the submit button we
want to display confirmation dialog box
to the user are you sure you want to
submit and that confirmation dialog box
should have two buttons okay and cancer
when the user clicks okay then we want
to display a message saying you selected
okay if it clicks cancel then we want to
display a message saying you selected
cancel when they click OK we want to
display that message you selected okay
and then we want to submit the page to
the server for processing when they
click cancel then the form should not be
submitted to the server for processing
and they should be displayed with a
message saying you selected cancel so
let's see how to achieve that in
JavaScript to display confirmation
dialog box we use the confirm function
and this method expects the message
parameter that's the message that you
want to display to the user so the
message is are you sure you want to
submit and this function is going to
return true or false if we select the OK
button on that confirmation dialog box
then it's going to return true and in
that case we want to display this
message you selected okay and we want to
return true now if they have selected
cancel then we want to display you
selected cancel and we want to return
false so we want to call this confirm on
submit function
then click event occurs and we are going
to associate this event handler with the
click event using the on click attribute
of this HTML button control so on click
equals we want to call this confirm on
submit function now this function
returns true or false so we are going to
return that value so if this function
returns true we return true in which
case the form will be submitted to the
server for processing otherwise we
return false in which case it won't
submit the form to the server so let's
quickly run this and test it so click
the button we get the confirmation
dialog box with the message are you sure
you want to submit I click ok it says
you selected okay
I click OK now when I click Submit and
cancel it says you selected cancel ok
now let's look at another example of
form validation let's say for example
these two fields let's first name and
last name I required fields now what we
want to do is as soon as you know a
controlled receives focus that is as
soon as we place the cursor inside the
textbox and when we start to type when
we type the first character then the
background color of the textbox should
immediately change to green indicating
that you know there's a value within the
textbox now if we delete all the
characters or if the control loses the
focus so the control gains focus and
then if the control immediately loses
focus without typing anything you know
the background color should be changed
to red or if you delete all the
characters immediately even if the
control doesn't lose the focus you know
the background color should still be red
indicating that the field is required on
the other hand if you have characters
within the textbox the background color
should be green indicating that you know
basically the required field has a value
okay so let's see how to achieve that
first of all we need to get those two
text boxes and that literal text
first name and last name to speed things
up I already have typed that required
HTML so let's copy and paste that fit in
this platform so here the HTML is pretty
straightforward we have a table element
within that we have got two TRS the
first tier has got two TDs and within
the first TD first name text and then
the HTML text box and then we have last
name and then the text box now let's
include a script section here and let's
include our JavaScript function let's
call this function validate required
field and this function is going to take
a parameter and let's call it control ID
that is the ID of the control that we
want to validate and we are going to use
document get element by ID function and
to this we are going to pass this
control ID and we are going to store the
reference of the control and available
called control now if control dot value
so the value within the control if it is
an empty string then in that case we
want to change the background color of
the control to red you know basically
that indicates there's nothing in the
text box so we have the control variable
which has a reference to the text box
that we are validating so control dot
style dot background equals
Fred
if it is not empty then we know
something has been typed into the
textbox in which case we want to change
the background color to green in any
case we want the background color or I
mean the font color to be white because
white color on both red background and
green background looks good so I am
going to set the font color to white
always okay so we have the function
which is going to validate the form okay
so now the important decision that we
have to make is when do we want to call
this function now remember the
requirement the requirement is as soon
as we type the first character into the
textbox you know the function the
background color of the text box should
become green so let's quickly run this
now as it stands we are not calling the
function at all so no matter what you do
you know nothing is going to change so
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
make use of on key up event so so when
does this on key up event occurs this
event occurs whenever we release a key
okay so when we release a key at that
point we know that something has been
typed into the textbox or even if you
press backspace key you know key up
event occurs so at that point when a
when the last character is deleted we
still want the background color to be
red okay so in that case we want to call
this function so anytime there is a key
up event we want to call this validate
required field and obviously this method
expects a parameter so we want to pass
the control ID in this case the ID of
the control that we want to validate is
first name textbox so on key up we are
calling this now let's quickly test this
look at this the control has received
the focus now if I move away to the next
control without typing anything within
then again in that case we want the
background color of that textbox to be
red okay because it's a required field
and we have not typed anything so when
the control loses focus then we still
want to do validation okay so there is
an event called on blood on blood event
is fired whenever the control loses
focus so I'm going to use the attribute
on bla and then I'm going to call this
function so on blur and on key app we
are calling a validation function so
let's do the same thing for the next
textbox so here we have the last name
textbox and then we need to change the
name of the I mean the ID of the control
in this case the ID of the control is TX
de last name and DX T last name so let's
run this one more time so now notice
that the control has received the focus
now if I type into the second text box
without typing you know anything into
the first text box look at that the
background color is changed now if I go
to the first name textbox again the
background color is changed to red
because there's nothing in both of these
text boxes now look at this the moment I
type the first character the background
color is change to green indicating that
there is a value already so now you can
type as many characters you want now
when you delete you know these
characters nothing happens but when you
delete the last character look at that
the background color is again changed to
red okay now when I type one or more
characters and tab away or click into
the next text box you know it is still
green indicating that we have you know
satisfied the required field and the
same here
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
