tutorial in this video we'll discuss how
to set and get multiple cookies in
JavaScript
this is continuation to about 69 so
please watch what 69 before proceeding
when we click this set cookie button we
want to store these three key value
pairs in three different cookies and
when we click get cookie button we want
to retrieve all those three key value
pairs from the three cookies so let's
see how to achieve this let's flip to
visual studio this is the same example
that we worked with in the previous
session so the moment we are using a
custom object and this custom object has
got three properties name email and
gender and then we are converting this
custom object into a JSON string using
JSON dot stringify method and that JSON
string we are then storing in the cookie
of the document object but let's see how
to store these three different key value
pairs in three different cookies so
let's modify this setcookie function so
we don't require this custom object
anymore let's get rid of that and within
the document objects cookie property we
are going to first store the first name
value pair name equals whatever is the
name that the user has entered into the
name textbox similarly within the second
cookie we are going to store email so
email equals whatever email the user has
entered into the email textbox and
finally gender so again documented
cookie equals gender equal to whatever
is the gender within the gender text box
and that's it so let's throw in a
breakpoint and this function and let's
run this page in debug mode let's
provide values for name email and gender
and let's click the set cookie button so
it should hit that breakpoint at the
moment
notice what we have in the cookie
property of the document object we don't
have any cookies at all
so the document dot cookie property
actually returns an empty string now
let's + f10 and execute that statement
now let's look at what we have in the
cookie property notice that within the
cookie property now we have one name
value pair name equals one cat now when
I + f10 one more time look at that that
in the cookie property we now have two
name value pairs name equals winged cat
email equals could wangle at gmail.com
now let's + f10 one more time so let's
look at the string here notice that we
have all the three name value pairs and
look at that each name/value pair is
separated by semicolon and then a single
space character okay so at the moment
within the document our cookie property
of the document object we have a single
string with all the three name value
pairs so now let's see how to retrieve
all those three name value pairs from
the cookie property of the document
object let's modify this get cookie
function so we know that at the moment
within the cookie property we have a
string that looks like this
so what I'm gonna do here within this
cat cookie function is create a variable
let's name this cookies array and then
document dot cookie properties going to
return as a string that look like this
and we want to split the string using
equal to I mean using semicolon and a
single space character as the separator
and when we split the string using that
as the separator we are going to get a
string array back and that string array
will contain three strings and each
string will look like this so the first
thing will contain name equals wink at
the second string will contain email
equals could wink it at gmail.com and
the third string will contain gender
equals male okay so let's go and split
that
and the separator is going to be
semicolon and a single space so that
should give us a string array back which
contains three strings now let's use a
for loop for VAR i equals 0 I less than
cookies array dot length I plus plus so
let's start with 0
let's create another variable here let's
call this name value array so now if you
look at each of this string what do we
have in it we have the name and we have
the value so we want to split that
string as well and this time we are
going to split the string using equal to
as a separator and that is going to give
us another string array back which
contains two strings the first string
will contain the name and the second
string will contain the value okay so
let's go ahead and split cookies array
or Phi using equal to symbol as the
separator if name value array of zero if
that is equal to name then retrieve name
textbox
and the value is going to be name value
array of one okay so now let's go ahead
and do the same thing for email and the
email text box ID is txt email and
finally for gender
and gender text boxes txt gender okay so
with all these changes let's run the
page in debug mode let's throw in a
breakpoint and get quickly function as
well let's provide values for name email
and gender
let's look set cookie + f5 now let's hit
let's run this one more time so name
equals wankered email equals good banker
at gmail.com gender equals male set
cookie
let's press f5 and now let's click get
cookie so it should come in to get
cookie function so when we press f10
within the cookies array we should have
three string arrays okay
and now we are going to loop through
each string array so when we split the
first string within the name value array
we should have two strings name and
venket and since name value of array of
0 is equal to name it's going to come
inside and it's going to set the value
to name value array of 1 and if you look
at name value array phone what do we
have we have the name of the person so
we are setting that as the value within
the name textbox so let's press f10 f5
and look at that the values are
displayed within the respective text
boxes let's actually detach the debugger
and let's clear what we have here and
the form fails and then when we click
this get cookie look at that we get name
email and gender of the person now at
the moment you know we have the cookies
that's why this code is working as
expected but if we don't have anything
within the cookie property of the
document object then we want to display
a message saying cookie not found so if
we want to do that
including if condition if
document.cookie dot land not equal to
zero if the length is not equal to zero
then do all this
otherwise I let the message saying
cookie not found
alright let's run this one more time and
you know we don't have any cookies at
the moment so when I click get cookie
notice that it says cookie is not wrong
if there is a cookie let's say for
example if we provide only values for
name and gender and then when we click
get cookie look at that it still says
cookies not found that's basically
because we didn't hit the set cookie
button so let's click set cookie and
when we cleared cookie look at that we
get the respective values clear click on
get cookie we get those values and here
are the two functions that we have just
discussed set cookie and get cookie
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
