tutorial in this video we'll discuss
content negotiation in asp.net Web API
so what is content negotiation one of
the standards of the restful service is
that the client should be able to decide
the format of the response they want
from the server for example does the
client want the response in XML JSON etc
when a client sends a request to the
server the request also includes
something called accept header using
this accept header the client can
specify the format for the response they
want from the server for example if the
accept header is set to application for
slash XML the server sends the response
in XML format if it is set to
application for slash Jason then the
response format is going to be in JSON
let's look at this quickly in action
let's flip to fiddler now look at the
composer tab right here we are issuing a
request to this URI for slash API for
slash employees and look at the accept
header value application for slash XML
so in this case the client wants the
response from the server in XML format
so let's execute this and let's inspect
the response that we get notice here we
get the response in XML format as you
can see now in addition to the server
sending the response in XML format it
also sends the content-type header of
the response to appropriate value since
the response is in XML format content
type of the response header is set to
application for slash XML now if you
want the response from the server to be
in Jason then instead of using
application for slash XML we use
application for slash Jason let's
execute this and here is the response
from the server let's double click on
that notice now we get JSON response and
if you look at the content type header
within the response notice it is set to
application for slash Jason as expected
so depending on the accept had a value
in the request this server since there
is
this is called content negotiation now
let's understand what does the web api
do when we request for data in a
specific format the Web API controller
generates the data that we want to send
to the client in our example the
employees controller is generating the
list of employees that we want to return
to the client once the list of employees
is generated the job of the controller
is over it's going to hand that list to
the web api pipeline which then looks at
the accept header and depending on the
format that the client has requested web
api will choose the appropriate
formatter for formatting the data for
example if the client has requested for
xml data web api uses XML format if the
client has requested for JSON data web
API uses JSON format these four matters
are nothing but classes and they are
called media type for matters we know
that asp.net web api is greatly
extensible this means we can also plug
in our own for matters for custom
formatting the data we can also specify
multiple values for the accept header
notice here we have set accept header to
XML and JSON so now in this scenario
this server is going to look at the list
of all for matters that are available
and then it is going to pick the first
formatter which happens to be the JSON
format and in this case it's going to
format the data in JSON let's quickly
look at this in action so let's set the
accept header to both application Jason
and application XML and let's execute
our request let's double click on the
response that we get notice the response
is in Jason you can also specify a
quality factor in the accept header
notice we have set the XML quality
factor to 0.8 and JSON quality factor to
0.5 so in this case XML has got higher
quality factor than Jason so the server
is going to use XML format to format the
data in XML and return it to the client
let's quickly look at this in action
so let's say that Jason quality factor
20.4 and the XML quality factor to 0.9
since XML has got higher quality factor
than Jason we should get the response in
XML now if we don't set the accept
header at all then by default Web API
returns data in JSON format
let's quickly look at this as well in
action so let's remove the accept header
altogether and when we execute this
request notice we get the response in
the default JSON format one important
thing to keep in mind is that these
media type formatters are used by the
server for both request and response
messages when the client sends a request
to the server we set the content type
header to the appropriate value to let
the server know the format of the data
that we are selling for example if the
client is sending JSON data the content
type header is set to application for
slash Jason so in this case the server
knows it is dealing with JSON data so it
uses JSON formatter to convert JSON data
to dotnet type similarly when a response
is being sent from the server to the
client depending on the accept header
value the appropriate format is used to
convert dotnet type to JSON or XML etc
we can very easily change the settings
of these media type for matters to meet
our application requirements let's look
at an example of that now let's slip to
fiddler first let's request for JSON
data if you look at the raw JSON data
that we have here notice this JSON data
is not properly indented and if you look
at the property names they using Pascal
case now what we want to do is in this
data properly and use camel case instead
of pascal case for the property names so
first name should really be lowercase
letter F and uppercase letter n let's
see how easy it is to achieve both of
these things simply by changing these
utilization settings of the case and
serializer
so let's flip to visual studio within
our Web API config dot CS file we have
our register method which is receiving
HTTP configuration object as a parameter
so we are going to use that config
object config dot formatters and we want
jason formatter and we want to set
serializer settings and we want to set
the formatting of that to Newton's of
dot json dot formatting dot indented so
this is going to properly indent the
json data and we also want to use camel
case instead of pascal case for the
property names and to do that again we
are going to use the same thing config
dot for matters dot JSON format ax dot
serialization serialized settings dot
contract resolver equals new camel case
property names contract resolver so with
just these two lines of code
let's below solution build it succeeded
now let's go ahead and request json data
again so let's go to the composer tab
execute it and now if we look at the raw
data notice the raw data is properly
indented and the property names are now
using camel case instead of pascal case
here's the code that we just looked at
thank you for listening and have a great
