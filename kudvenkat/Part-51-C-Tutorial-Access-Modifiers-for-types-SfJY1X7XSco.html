I'm ranked it this is Pat 51 access
modifiers for types if you haven't
watched part 48 49 and 50 I would
strongly encourage you to do so before
continuing with this session in this
session we'll be learning about the
access modifiers that can be applied for
types themselves in the previous session
we have learned the different modifiers
that can be applied for type members now
we know that in c-sharp there are five
different access modifiers and from the
previous sessions we have already
understood all these five different
access modifiers can be applied for type
members but when it comes to types you
can only use public and internal access
modifiers with types trying to use any
other access modifier will generate a
compiler error let's look at an example
and in order to understand internal and
public access modifiers properly we need
to you know two assemblies okay so let's
add two class library projects to the
solution and to do that right click on
the solution add and select new project
select visual C sharp as your
programming language and let's select
class library as the project type I'm
going to name this as assembly one
project click OK that should create the
project let's add another project I'm
going to call this assembly two project
click OK and it should create another
project
now within assembly one
in class 1 dot CS file I'm going to
create a class called assembly one class
and with this class I'm going to have a
print method so public void print method
and what this method does it just prints
a message onto the console so control it
right line hello
all right so if you look at this code we
have this class and this class access
modifier is public and from the slide we
understood that you know with types you
can only use internal or public access
modifiers what happens if I use any
other access modifiers for example what
happens if I use private access modifier
on the type if I do that if I try to
build the solution look at what happens
if we will get a compiler error and look
at the error
it says elements defined in a namespace
cannot be explicitly declared as private
protected or protected internal now what
do we mean by elements defined in a
namespace now what are the different
elements that can be defined within a
namespace we can define a class we can
define a structure we can define an
interface delegates etc so all these are
examples of types okay
so types can only have internal or
public access modifiers trying to use
any other access modifier will give you
a compiler error so if I convert this
back to public we will get no compiler
error so if I build this control-shift
be shortcut for building a solution on
the status bar you can see been
succeeded so you can use public access
modifier now what do we mean by public
if you mark him a type as public then
obviously it will be available anywhere
no restrictions whatsoever all right now
let's try to access this class which is
present in assembly one
in assembly to project okay and
obviously to do that in assembly to
project we need to add a reference to
assembly one project okay and to do that
just open the reference is folder and
right-click on that add reference select
assembly one project from the list click
OK and you should see assembly one being
added there okay so now let's go to
class 1 dot CS file of assembly -
project get rid of this unnecessary
using statements which we don't use I'm
going to call this male class as
assembly - class so that the names will
be clear so within this assembly to
class let's have another method public
void test and within this method I'm
going to create an instance of this
class assembly one class and to do that
assembly one can you see that you see
the namespace but not the class -
assembly one but assembly one class you
can either use the fully qualified name
or you can actually use the using
statement so using assembly one so
assembly one class and let's call it as
instance is equal to new assembly one
class and on the instance I can invoke
the print method so now I am able to
access the type that is defined in
assembly one in assembly - ok why
because that's public that's accessible
anywhere no restrictions whatsoever
so now if I build the solution we get no
compiler errors so you see on the status
bar build succeeded ok now let's go back
to class 1 dot CS file of assembly 1
instead of public let's use internal
access modifier all I did here is change
the access modifier from public to
internal we know that if a member is
internal then it will be available only
in the containing assembly and the same
is the true even for types if you
archetype as internal then that type is
available only within that assembly
where it's defined trying to access that
type outside of that assembly will
generate a compiler error now we are
using this assembly one class which is
internal and which is present in
assembly one project in assembly two and
look at that we already have that red
squiggly lines indicating in some sort
of error okay so if I try to build a
solution we should get about four errors
and all of them look at that assembly
one dot assembly one class is an
accessible units protection level which
is very clear that you are not allowed
to access that particular class outside
of assembly one so any internal member
or type defined as you know within an
assembly can be only accessed within
that assembly trying to access that
outside of the assembly will generate a
compiler error and to get rid of those
errors all you need to do is make it
public since public member is accessible
anywhere if I try to build this now all
those errors should have gone and Bill
succeeded
let's do another thing let's delete the
excess modifier altogether now I am not
having any access modifier whatsoever so
then what is going to be the access
modifier now four types if you don't
specify an access modifier the default
will be internal ok so if I build the
solution now we again get those four
errors because why if you don't specify
the access modifier four types the
default will be internal but on the
other hand if you don't specify an
access modifier for a type member then
it will be private in fact this is
actually an interview question they will
ask you in general in an interview ok
what is the default access modifier the
type member in private what is the
default access modifier for types if you
don't specify one internal ok so just
keep in mind type members can have all
of the access modifiers
whereas types can only have two access
modifiers for type members if you don't
specify an access modifier the default
will be private so types if you don't
specify an access modifier the default
will be in turn
and you can see that on this slide so
private is the default for type members
whereas intima is the default for types
okay and if you're not sure about the
other access modifiers you know private
protected and protected internal we have
already covered that in the previous
session so please go check that session
all right on this slide you can find
some resources for asp.net and C sharp
interview questions that's it for today
thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
