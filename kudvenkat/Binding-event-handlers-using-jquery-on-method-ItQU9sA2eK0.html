this video we'll discuss how to bind
even handlers to events using own method
in jQuery this is continuation to part
33 in part 33 we discussed binding event
handlers using bind method now if you
are using jQuery version 1.7 or higher
then you should be using on and off
methods instead of bind and unbind
methods to bind even handlers the syntax
reusing on and off methods is very
similar to using bind and unbind methods
here we have the same example that we
worked with in the previous video
session notice that we are using bind
method to bind an event handler to click
mouse over and mouse out events now if
you have to use own method instead of
bind for this example all you have to do
is change the name of the function from
bind to on and it should continue to
work the same way let's look at this in
action let's flip to visual studio so
here we have the same example that we
worked with in the previous video
session at the moment when we mouse over
this click Me button we get that mouse
over effect on Mouse out we lose that
mouse over effect and when we click the
button we get the x and y-coordinates of
the mouse pointer where the click event
occurred right now when we click disable
mouse over effect now when we move the
mouse over look at that we don't get
that effect now to bind the event
handlers they using bind method and to
remove the even handler via using unbind
method right so here we are using bind
and here unbind now instead of bind
let's go ahead and use on method and
instead of unbind I'm going to use off
method so this method removes the event
handler this method binds the event
handlers all right so let's save the
changes now this example should continue
to work the same way so let's reload the
page and look at this when I mouse over
we get that effect on mouse over we lose
Mouse out we lose it and we click the
button we get the x and y-coordinates
now when I click this disabled mouse
over effect we should remove the event
handler for mouse over so now when we
mouse over this pattern notice that we
don't get that mouse over effect but
when I click it we should still get the
x and y-coordinates
all right so at the moment we are using
one and all functions instead of bind
and unbind whether there are other
capabilities of on and off functions
which we will discuss in a later video
session now if you look at this example
right here notice that you know when any
of these events occur we are calling the
same anonymous function right so for
these three events we have the same even
handler function now to this function we
are passing the event object depending
on the type property of the event object
you know we are executing the code that
is appropriate for that event so if even
dot type is click then we are retrieving
the x and y-coordinates and displaying
them within the development if the even
type is mouse over then we are adding a
CSS class to this button element if it
is Mouse out then we are removing the
CSS class but then all this logic is
present within the same anonymous
function now in your application there
might be a need where you want to
execute different function for different
event is that possible using on function
absolutely in order to achieve that we
are going to make use of JSON object so
I am going to delete all this code and
let's use the on function and to this
I'm going to pass you know a JSON object
and here I'm going to first specify the
event which is click and when that click
event occurs we want to call an
anonymous function and to that we want
to pass the event object so what do we
want to do when the click event occurs
we want to display the x and y
coordinates or the mouse pointer within
this div element and the ID of the
development is div result so let's find
that element first and then use the HTML
method so we want to display the string
button clicked at you want the x
coordinate x equals event object dot
page x
and to that we want to append y equals
event object dot page y okay so f click
event has occurred this is the function
you know that's called and then next you
know this adjacent object so this is the
name and this is the value so when the
click event occurs we want to call this
function and then we are going to
specify another name value pair so the
name of the event is going to be mouse
over and when that even type errors we
want to call a different anonymous
function and what do we want to do on
mouse over event we want to add a CSS
class to this button so this is the
button on which the mouse over event is
triggered
so to refer to that button element I'm
going to use this keyword and then call
add class method and then specify the
name of the class and the name of the
class is button style so let's copy that
and pass it to this function okay so
that's what we want to do onmouseover
and finally on Mouse out we want to call
another function and what we want to do
on mouse heart onmouseout we want to
remove that CSS class so I'm going to
use remove class function okay so notice
here we are executing different
functions when different events occur
okay we are using on function at the
moment so let's save the changes reload
this and it should continue to work the
same way
look at this onmouseover and onmouseout
and when we click we get the x and y
coordinates so here at the moment we
using on method we can do the same thing
using bind as well so even with mind you
can pass a JSON object and associate a
different function to be called when
different events occur so I'm going to
use bind let's save the changes and when
we reload you know it should still
continue to work the same way right
now in the previous sessions of this
video series we discussed jQuery
shorthand functions that is dot click
mouse over dot mouse out etc these
functions actually call on method behind
the scenes right so if you look at for
example let's take this button element
and then look at this we can use to
associate a click event handler we can
use the shorthand function dot leg now
if you look at this you know shorthand
function when you right click on that
and when you select go to definition so
this is our jQuery source code and look
at what's happening here this function
is actually calling on method okay so
all the short hat functions
you know like mouse over for example you
know even this calls on method behind
the scenes look at this this is also
calling on method so all the jQuery
shorthand functions behind the scenes
actually use on method now so far in
this video series we have seen three
different ways of binding even handlers
in jQuery one of the ways is by using
shorthand functions dot click dot
mouse-over etc how do we use them on the
element you call dot click dot mouse
over and then specify the function that
you want to execute when that event
occurs if you are using jQuery version
1.7 you know less than 1.7 then you can
also use bind method and what is the
syntax for that on the element you call
the bind method and specify the name of
the event and the function that you want
to call and that event occurs and if you
have jQuery version 1.7 or higher on
method can also be used so on the
element you call on and then specify the
name of the event and the function that
you want to call but keep in mind
according to jQuery com the recommended
approach is to use you know on method if
you're using the equity version 1.7 or
higher to bind event handlers thank you
for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
