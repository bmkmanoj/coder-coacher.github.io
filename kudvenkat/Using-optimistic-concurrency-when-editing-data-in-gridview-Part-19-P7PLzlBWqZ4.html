banquette this is part 19 of asp.net
crib view tutorial in this video we'll
discuss about using optimistic
concurrency when editing data in grid
view in part 18 of the asp.net grid-view
tutorial we discuss the basics of
editing and updating data in grid view
control we didn't discuss about
concurrency in part 18 let me explain
what I mean by this now when I run this
project you know the code is the same as
in part 18 so if you haven't watched
part 18 I would strongly encourage you
to do so before continuing with the
session so when the web form is accessed
it's going to retrieve this data from
TBL employees table and then display
that within this grid view control now
let's say I click Edit and then while
I'm still editing this data let's say I
want to change the name of this employee
from mark to mark 1 while I'm still
editing this data you know someone else
has changed the same row in the
underlying database table so initially
it was mark I want to change it to mark
1 in the grid view control and then
somebody else has changed it to mark 2
the same rule that I am trying to change
now if you look at the state of the data
in a Mark's name is already updated to
the latest version which is marked 2 but
then without me realizing that this data
is already updated you know now when I
click update look at what's going to
happen it's going to overwrite the
change which is made by the other user
in fact which is the latest change I'm
overwriting those changes so when I
press f5 now look at this mark 2 is now
overwritten to mark 1 without me even
realizing that this data has changed
since it was loaded into the grid view
control ok so this may or may not be a
problem depending on the requirement of
your application but if your project
requirement warrants that the data
should not be overwritten if it has
changed since it was loaded into the
grid we control then we need to think
about implementing optimistic
concurrency in our project let's see how
to achieve that first of all let's
understand the reason for having this
data overwritten ok so let's go to
employee data access layer and if you
look at the update employees method
which is actually updating the
employee's record look at what are the
parameters that we have we only have 4
parameters employee ID name gender and
city which are going to carry
you know the new values when I click
Edit and then when I say update it's
going to carry all these new values and
then send them to this method and this
method is going to simply you know
change the name gender and city to the
new values which are coming in as
parameters and look at what we have in
the where clause we only have employee
ID so we are only comparing the employee
ID we are not comparing the name gender
and City for what was the original
values we don't have them in the
bearclaw's
so this update query will simply
overwrite name gender and city even if
they have changed after the data was
loaded into the tribute control so
that's the reason why we have this
concurrency problem ok so to solve this
obviously the first thing to do is to
change the sublet employee method along
with the new values we also need
parameters to pass old values okay so
just to speed things up I have this
already typed so let me copy and paste
this here and then we'll go over the
code so if you look at the method you
know the only thing that has changed
here is the signature you know where we
have caught a couple of other parameters
look at this there are four parameters
here which is going to contain original
employee ID original name gender and
city and along with the original values
we also have three more parameters to
contain I mean to carry the new changed
values gender name gender and City now
if you notice we don't have a you know
an additional parameter to contain to
store basically the new employee ID why
is that because employee ID is the
primary key and I don't want to allow
the user to be changing that primary key
column so employee ID is not going to
change it's going to be the original
employee so I only have one parameter
which is going to carry the original
employee ID but for name gender and City
they can change so to carry the new
values I have these three set of
parameters and to carry the original
values I have these three parameters
okay and the rest of the code is again
the same code obviously this line is
reading the connection strength from web
config file using that connection string
we are creating the sequel connection
object and then the important thing to
notice here is the update query now look
at the update query
in the way applause we are not only
using the primary key of this table
which is employee ID we are also using
name gender and city and we are
comparing that with the original name
gender and city so if they have changed
since the data was loaded into the grid
view control you know the where class
doesn't find you know we don't find a
matching record in the database table as
a result of which no row gets updated
pretty straightforward and then the rest
of the lines here though this method
looks very big or this is just you know
copy pasted code basically to add all
these parameters to the command object
using parameters collection property of
the command object so once we have added
all the parameters we open the
connection and X you know call this
execute non query which is going to
execute this update query on the
database okay so that's the first step
change your update employees method okay
to include parameters to convey original
values as well and then let's rebuild
this project and then reconfigure our
object data source control okay so let's
go to webform configure datasource our
business object is still going to be a
demo dot employee data access layer demo
is the name space employee data access
layer is the class select method is
going to stay the same get all employees
which is going to return list of
employees the update method has changed
this now we are using a version which is
going to carry which is going to have
parameters that's going to carry
original as well as the changed or
edited updated values let's click finish
and then let's reassociate this grid
view control with that grid you know
object data source one control so we
want to enable it for editing so let's
save that now if I flip this waveform to
the source mode look at this within the
object data source control
we should also now have parameters
update parameters which are going to
store original employee
I mean original values along with the
new values okay so that's the second
second step reconfigure object data
source control now the other step is
basically we are going to have set you
know two properties on opt
data source control and two properties
on the grid view control what are the
two properties on object data source
conflict detection we need to set that
to compare all values so setting
conflict detection is equal to compare
all values will pass original values for
employee ID name gender and city to
update employees method otherwise if you
set a conflict detection look at this
conflict detection can actually have two
values you can either set it to compare
all values if you said that to compare
all values then these original pair are
you know update parameters are basically
the object data source is going to send
values for this original parameters if
you set it to override changes then it
doesn't pass those values only new
values are passed so that's why set it
to compare all values because our
intention is basically to compare all
the values before we actually update
that record and the next property that
we need to set is old parameters I mean
old values parameter format string so if
you look at the update method look at
the update method here look at the
parameters that are going to contain
original values all of them are fixed we
are prefixed with original underscore
original underscore employee ID original
score name Original Score gender you
know every one of them have original
underscore basically the parameters
which are going to contain the original
values so to convey that information we
need to set that property to whatever is
that prefix string that here that we are
using in our case we are using original
underscore so let's go ahead and set
that and let just to get it correct I'm
going to copy that and then paste it so
in the object data source control I'm
going to set that to original underscore
and then a placeholder so this
placeholder will either be employee ID
name gender or city all right so that's
the two properties that we have to set
on the object data source control and
then there are two other properties that
we need to set on thread view control we
don't want this employee ID column to be
editable it's unusual to change the
primary key of a table so I'm going to
set the bound fill which is going
to display that employee ID you know I'm
going to set its read-only attribute to
true and then finally we need to set the
data key names property to employee ID
so for this grid view control we need to
set the data key names property so that
said that data key names is equal to
employee ID okay so those are the two
properties read-only property on
employee ID column and data key names to
employee ID at the gridview level
alright let's save these changes let's
read on the application and see if we
can detect the conflict in data while
updating so let's say I click on edit at
the moment in the database table the
name is mark 1 ok now that's what we are
let's say I want to update it to mark 3
you know look at this in the grid view
control we are looking at you know at it
as mark 1 now let's say I want to change
it to mark 2 and even before I have hit
this Update button somebody else have
changed it to mark 3 okay so since the
data was loaded into the grid view
control for editing purposes you know
this data is changed now you know MOC
name has the latest name now if I try to
change it to mark two okay it shouldn't
allow that to happen so let me try to
update and see what happens
look at that it simply refreshes the
credit doesn't update it to mark two
because it has detected it data conflict
and then it doesn't find any match and
that's why it doesn't type update any
row okay in the next video session we'll
actually you know display an information
within the label control here if we have
updated the data successfully then we
will display that if the data was not
updated due to data conflict we will see
how to display a message stating so in
our next video session on this slide you
can find resources for a speedo or Nancy
sharp and sequence of interview
questions that's it for today thank you
for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
