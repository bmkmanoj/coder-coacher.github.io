tutorial in this video well discus when
to use asp.net controls client ID
instead of ID in JavaScript every
asp.net server side control has ID
property at runtime this ID property is
converted to ID attribute and the
resulting HTML is sent to the client
browser let's look at this in action
let's drag and drop a text box control
onto this waveform notice the server
side ID property is set to textbox 1 now
let's view this page in the browser
right click on the web page and let's
view the generated HTML notice for this
server-side asp.net text box control
this is the HTML element that is
generated input type equals text and
look at the ID attribute the client-side
ID attribute and the server-side ID
property they have the same value in
this case both of them are textbox 1 now
what we want to do is when the webform
loads we want to set the keyboard focus
to this textbox control
so let's write some JavaScript script
type equals text slash JavaScript
document dot get element by ID enter
this function let's pass the ID of the
textbox control and let's call the focus
method so when we'd reload this page we
expect the keyboards for curse to be set
to this textbox control and the reason
this JavaScript works is because the
script is trying to find an element with
ID textbox 1 and within this generated
HTML we have an HTML element with ID
textbox 1 so the script finds the
textbox and then calls the focus method
which is going to set the keyboard focus
to that control so everything is working
as expected but what in case if we have
this textbox control in a master page
in real world most asp.net web
applications have master pages if you
have a master page and if the control is
present inside a content control then
the generated ID attribute value of the
control will be different from ID
property value let's look at that in
action so to this project let's add a
master page so within this master page
we've got two content placeholders the
first content placeholder is the head
content placeholder and here is the main
content placeholder so let's right-click
on this master page and add a content
page so now I'm going to include a text
box control within this content page
okay look at the ID of the text box
control its text box 1 when the webform
loads what we want to do is set the
keyboard focus to this text box control
so I am actually going to copy the
script that we have on this web form 1
and paste it on this page okay so
document dot get element by ID text box
1 so we are using the server-side ID
property value and we are calling the
focus method so let's view this platform
2 in the browser so we expect the
keyboard focus to be set within the text
box control but look at this we get a
JavaScript array unable to get property
focus of undefined unknown reference so
why are we getting a null reference
error that's because if you view the
generated HTML look at that this is the
text box control that is generated for
this server-side asp.net text box so we
have an input type equals text but look
at the ID attribute value the ID
attribute value is content placeholder 1
underscore text box 1 but look at the
server-side ID property value it is text
box 1 and the reason we have different
ID attribute value is because this text
box control is actually present inside a
container
examples of container controls include
master pages user controls grid view etc
so when you have it control within a
container control like these then the
generated client-side ID attribute value
will be different from the server-side
ID property value okay so to make the
script work there are several ways and
one of the first things that comes to
our mind is why don't we simply use the
generated client-side ID attribute value
so we know that the generated
client-side ID attribute value for this
textbox is this one content placeholder
one underscore text box one so let's
quickly look at how it has generated
this one so if you look at this text box
one control this is actually present
inside a content placeholder with ID
contentplaceholder1 so it takes that
they contain a control ID which is
content placeholder one and then adds
underscore to that and then it uses the
ID of the textbox control so content
placeholder one underscore text box one
that's the generated client-side ID
attribute value so we can use that
within the script content placeholder
one and a score textbox one so when we
load this now the keyboard focus should
be set within that text box control so
it works okay but the problem with this
approach is that if somebody changes the
ID of the content placeholder let's say
I change this to main content okay now
since we have changed the content
placeholder ID now the generated ID
attribute value for this text box will
be main content underscore text box one
that means this script will fail again
right let's look at that in action since
we have changed the content placeholder
ID here we have to change that within
the master page as well and now when we
run this the form tool we get a
JavaScript error
look at that
Danelle reference era that's because if
you view the source look at the
generated client-side ID attribute value
it is main content underscore Xbox one
but our script is trying to find four
you know ID value content placeholder
one underscore text box one it can't
find it
so we get a null reference era so this
is not really a preferred option the
other option is to set client ID mode to
static so when we set this attribute to
static this will ensure that the
generated ID attribute value matches the
server-side ID attribute our ID property
so there will be a one-to-one mapping
there but with this approach you will
have to make sure that no other control
on that page has the same ID so let's
add the client ID mode to static on this
text box control so this attribute is
going to ensure that you know the
server-side ID property value is going
to match with the generated client-side
ID attribute value so we can safely use
textbox 1 as the ID within the script so
when we load this notice the keyboard
focus is set to the textbox control and
when we view the source look at the ID
attribute value it is textbox 1 so
that's the second option and the third
option is to use the client ID property
of the server control in your script
so this server-side control is textbox 1
right so let's get rid of this attribute
and I'm going to use the server-side
control
angle brackets percentage equals textbox
1 dot client ID so this client ID
property is actually going to return the
generated client-side ID value okay so
since this textbox control is present
inside this main content control so the
ID is going to be main content
underscore text box 1
that's what this client ID is going to
return and this javascript will find
that and calls the focus method so when
we view the page in the browser look at
that the focus is set to the textbox
control and if you view the source look
at what is passed to this JavaScript
method main content underscore text box
one the generated client-side ID now
with this approach even if somebody
changes the content placeholder ID for
example to main content
1:01 for example since we have changed
it here we have to change it in a master
page as well and now when we view the
web form within the browser it will
still work look at that the keyword
focus is set and when we view the source
look at now what is passed to get
element by ID main content one zero one
underscore text box 1 but what if the
text box is present in the master page
now here the text box is actually
present within the content page so let's
move this text box to the master page
so now this textbox control is present
within the master page on the content
page we don't have any textbox control
but then when we view this waveform -
since the textbox is present in the
master page it will be available now
what we want to do is set the keyboard
focus within the textbox control which
is there on the master page so if you
view the source look at this for the
generated HTML element the ID attribute
value is the same as the server-side ID
property so we can safely use document
dot get element by ID and the
server-side ID property value it's going
to find that so document dot get element
by ID text box 1 you know that should
work so when we load this look at that
the keyboard focus is set so if the text
box is present in a master page and not
in the content page then the generator
ID attribute value of the control will
that be the same as ID property so in
this case you can still use the
server-side ID property value so in
summary if the asp.net control is not
present inside any other container
control like a master page grid view or
user control then the generated ID
attribute value of the control will be
the same as server-side ID property
value so in this case you can use
document or get element by ID and the ID
value of the server-side ID property
value but if the asp.net control is
present inside any other container
control then the generated ID attribute
value of the control will be different
from ID property value so in this case
you must use the client-side ID
attribute value and to get the
client-side ID attribute value you can
use the client ID property thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
