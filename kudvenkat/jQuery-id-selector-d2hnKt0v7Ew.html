this video we'll discuss what are jQuery
selectors different selectors in jQuery
and the ID selector in detail so what
are jQuery selectors one of the most
important concept in jQuery selectors
jQuery selectors allows you to select
and manipulate HTML elements here we
have the list of different selectors in
jQuery jQuery selectors allows you to
select HTML elements in the Dom by
element ID element tag name element
class name element attribute element
attribute values and many more in our
upcoming videos we'll discuss these
different selectors one by one in detail
in this video let's find elements by ID
using the jQuery ID selector so let's
look at an example now on this page we
have an HTML button with ID button 1 and
the script right here especially the
piece of code that's highlighted so this
is equivalent to saying document dot get
element by ID button 1 so hash symbol
within jQuery is the ID selector okay so
this piece of code is going to return
the button with ID button 1 and then we
are attaching the click event handler to
that button that is returned and within
the click event handler we are alerting
a message jQuery tutorial so when we
save this and when we click this button
we should get an alert saying jQuery
tutorial so basically within this
example we are finding the button using
the ID selector and attaching the click
event handler you can also manipulate
the you know attributes of this button
if you want for example you can change
the background color of this button
using a jQuery method CSS and if you
look at this method it has got two
parameters name and value name is the
name of the CSS property that you want
to change and value is the value that
you want to assign to that CSS property
so I want to change background
color and I want to change the
background color to ello so let's save
these changes reload the page and look
at that the button gets uh its
background color changed so jQuery ID
selector uses the JavaScript document
dot get element by ID function
behind-the-scenes jQuery ID selector is
the most efficient among all jQuery
selectors if you know the idea of an
element that you want to find then
always use the ID selector over any
other selector because when we use ID
selector you know it doesn't have to
scan the entire Dom you know because
it's optimized to find elements by ID
HTML element IDs must be unique on the
page
jQuery ID selector returns only the
first element if you have two or more
elements with the same ID so let's
understand this with an example at the
moment on this HTML page we only have
one button with ID button 1 now let's
make a copy of this so now we have two
buttons with the same ID so what is this
going to do this piece of code that's
highlighted is it going to return both
the button control so one it's going to
return only the first button control ok
now basically these selectors not just
the ID selector but all the selectors
are going to return a collection and
since ID selector is going to return
just one element the collection will
contain only one element ok so now when
we save these changes and when they
reload this page only the background
color of the first button control should
be changed because ID selector returns
the first matching element now having
more than one HTML element with the same
ID on the HTML document is illegal ok
but let's assume you know we have two
elements with the same ID in that case
the ID selector is going to return only
the first matching element
javascript document dot get element by
ID function throws an error if the
element with the given ID is not found
whereas jQuery ID selector will not
throw an error to check if an element is
returned by the ID selector use length
property now if we use let's comment
this line so if we use document dot get
element by ID and then let's say specify
the IDS button to and then let's say we
want to change the background color so
to change the background color using raw
JavaScript we use the style property and
then background color and let's set that
to hello now do we have a button with ID
button too on this page no we don't so
when we actually save this and reload
this page and when we go to developer
tools by pressing f12 we should have a
script error there so it says cannot
read property style of null so basically
this code is returning an error because
it cannot find element with ID button
too but whereas the ID selector in
jQuery let's comment this now and
uncomment this so this is the ID
selector now if the ID selector in
jQuery does not find an element with
that ID doesn't throw an error instead
it's going to return an empty collection
so to find out if the given jQuery
selector is returned returning an item
or not use the length property of the
collection that is returned by jQuery so
we know that this is going to return a
collection so I want to know the length
of it
so if length is greater than zero then
we know that the element is found so in
that case let's alert that message alert
element found else element not found so
let's save these changes now we have
button 1 on this page and look at this
first of all notice we don't get the
script error and it says element found
on the other hand if I put like button 2
which does not exist we shouldn't get
the script error notice that no script
error and it says element not found
because the length will be 0 Java
scripts document dot get element by ID
and jQuery ID selector are not the same
document dot get element by ID returns a
fraud Dom object whereas jQuery ID
selector returns a jQuery object that
wraps the Dom object and provides jQuery
methods this is the reason you are able
to call jQuery methods like CSS click on
the object returned by jQuery to get the
underlying Dom objects from a jQuery
object index start with the index
position so let's understand this
statement so basically to find an
element by ID using raw JavaScript we
use document dot get element by ID and
to do that in jQuery style we use the ID
selector so document dot get element by
ID is that equivalent to I mean is that
the same as dollar you know ID selector
not really because document dot get
element by ID this is going to return a
raw JavaScript object a raw Dom object
whereas the ID selector in jQuery what
is this going to do is wrap that Dom
object inside a jQuery object and then
it's going to return that jQuery object
so since we get a jQuery object back
that is the reason we are able to use
you know properties are methods like CSS
etc these methods are not available on
the raw Dom object that is returned by
document dot get element by ID okay so
jQuery creates a wrapper around the raw
Dom object that is returned by you know
document or get element by ID and then
that's the reason we are able to use
jQuery specific objects on the object
that is returned by jQuery and if you
want the raw Dom object to be returned
then you know we know that this is going
to return a collection with one object
within it and if I want to get the draw
Dom object I can index that with the
index position because this collection
is going to contain just one element I'm
going to index start with zero and then
when we let's alert this
so look at that it basically says
undefined let's see why is that because
we don't have an element with ID button
too so let's pass button 1 as the ID
reload this page we should get HTML
input element and that's the raw Dom
object document dot get element by ID is
faster than jQuery ID selector use
document dot get element by ID / jQuery
ID selector unless you need the extra
functionality provided by the jQuery
object now let's say for example I want
to change the background color I could
very easily do that using document or
get element by ID and using the style
and background color properties now if
you want to use some extra additional
functionality provided by jQuery for
example you want to attach a click event
handler and you want to do that in a
cross-browser way with the least amount
of code then jQuery is the better option
there okay but if you want to do
something like this really simple where
you don't want to use the power of
jQuery then probably using document dot
get element by ID is better because this
is slightly faster than using the jQuery
ID selector that's it for today thank
you for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
