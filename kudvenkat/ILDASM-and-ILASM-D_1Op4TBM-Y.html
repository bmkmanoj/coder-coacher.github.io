venket this is part 2 of dotnet Basics
in this session we'll understand about
these two tools intermediate language
disassembler and intermediate language
assembler now in part 1 of this session
we have understood that when we compile
any dotnet application and assembly gets
generated and we know that assemblies
generally have the extension of dot DLL
or dot exe depending on the type of the
application that we create for example
if we create a Windows or a console
application a dot exe is generated
whereas when we create a class library
project or a web application project a
dot dll is generated now irrespective of
whether it is a dot exe or a dot DLL and
assembly consists of manifest and
intermediate language now we know that
when we compile the application
intermediate language is generated for
example you know if you look at this
example now this is the source code you
know this is a senior project which I
have created and all this project does
is prints out this message onto the
console now you look at the source code
here we have so you look at the source
code here but now when we compile this
you know by right-clicking on the
solution and say build solution so that
project gets compiled so this source
code now is packaged up into an assembly
since this is a console application the
assembly will be dot exe and to look at
the assembly just right-click on that
project and open the folder in Windows
Explorer get into the bin directory and
debug and you should see the assembly
there now this is your high-level
language your source code and when you
compile that using C shop compiler built
into this visual studio tool you have
intermediate language generated and
packaged into this assembly ok here in
this project I just have one class file
but in reality in you know we may have
several other class files you know all
these files basically will be packaged
up you know into this particular
assembly ok and this assembly contains
the intermediate language now if you
look at this this is
the source code but if I want to get a
feel of how the intermediate language
looks like are there any tools to
disassemble this assembly and then look
at that intermediate language and that's
what is the purpose of intermediate I
mean il Dasom intermediate language dis
assembler tool and to use that tool you
have to get into the Visual Studio
command prompt okay so to get to the
Visual Studio command prompt click on
start get to all programs and Microsoft
Visual Studio 2010 if you have 2008 or
you know whichever version of Visual
Studio you have you can get to that
version as well but let's get to Visual
Studio 2010 and within that you should
see Visual Studio Tools expand that
folder and there you should see Visual
Studio command prompt 2010 right click
on that run as administrator' and that
should open up the Visual Studio command
prompt now if you look at the assembly
this particular assembly introduction to
c-sharp exe this assembly is present in
this particular path so we need to get
to that path or we need to give the
fully full path of this assembly okay so
let's give the full path of this
assembly let me copy that go into the
visual studio command prompt and then
type in il Dasom dot exe dot exe is
optional and then paste the path okay
that is just the path at that path the
name of the assembly is introduction to
c-sharp Exe copy that paste that here
now when I press ENTER you know this il
desam tool opens this window and if you
look at this the assembly okay any
assembly in.net basically consists of
two things the manifest and the
intermediate language itself okay we'll
talk about manifest in a bit but let's
look at the intermediate language and
understand how it looks like now if you
look at this in this assembly okay I
have a class called main class and
within which I have a static main
third okay so there is this presume
namespace so when you expand the presume
namespace within that I have this main
class presume dot main class and within
that main class I have a constructor
which is automatically provided by
dotnet you don't see it here but for
this main class if you don't provide a
constructor dotnet will provide one
automatically so that's that constructor
and this class has got a static method
look at this
there is a main static method that s
indicates static method okay and if I
just expand double click that look at
this this is how your intermediate
language looks like you know for example
this is the string and we want the
string to be you know basically printed
load STR load string so so this is how
basically your intermediate language
looks like so this is your high level
language c-sharp and this is your
intermediate language for this method
okay so that's intermediate language now
what is this manifest manifest basically
consists of the metadata about your
assembly okay what do we mean by
metadata metadata means information
about information so this manifest
basically contains information about
this assembly for example what is the
name of this assembly if you look at
this the name of the assembly is
introduction to c-sharp okay and then
what is the version of this assembly now
we haven't spoken about versions yet but
we'll be talking about them which is
very important especially for solving
the DLL hell problem so we'll be talking
about what is DLL hell how to version as
assemblies what is the difference
between weak named and strong named
assemblies in a later session but for
now understand that this is the
information about the assembly the name
of the assembly what is the version of
this assembly now if you look at this
particular project this project has got
this properties folder and when you
expand that there is another file called
assembly info dot CS and when I get into
this file okay when we were talking
about c-sharp video tutorial in that we
have spoken
attributes for example we have seen how
to use you know basically deprecated
attribute okay so there are several
attributes like that and here in this
file
you see Assembly version attribute using
this attribute you can actually change
the version of this particular assembly
for example I can say okay this assembly
I want that to be two now if I go ahead
let me close this otherwise we'll get an
error so let me close this and build the
solution okay so build succeeded now if
I come here and run the same command
once again
and look at this look at the version of
the assembly right now version two okay
so whatever you're specifying in your
source code you know the information
about that particular assembly will be
present in this manifest the name of the
assembly the version number and the
types within that assembly for example
if you look at this this project this
project has caught like just one type
which is main class okay but in reality
there will be several classes and
structures and other things as well so
entire information about what are the
different types and their return types
etc all that information about this
assembly will be present in this
manifest not only that this assembly
will we'll talk about this in a later
session but basically and assembly might
depend on other assemblies for for some
of the services for example if you are
developing a web application and to to
make any security-related
programming you basically use system dot
web security namespace okay so basically
the classes that represent inside that
assembly so your assembly might depend
on another assemblies okay so when you
are assembly is depending on other
assemblies okay on which other
assemblies is this program depending
upon and what is the version of that
assembly etc okay all this information
is basically present in the manifest and
why is this manifest very important
the
at runtime when your program executes
okay all the dependent assemblies had to
be loaded okay you know the correct
versions of those dependent assemblies
has to be loaded and how does your
program decides that based on the
information that is present in this
manifest so that's how manifest is
extremely useful so we have seen how to
use this il desam tool to disassemble
and peek inside an assembly to look at
its manifest and intermediate language
another use of this tool is basically to
export this intermediate language to a
text file if you wish to and to do so
what you basically can do is select File
and then select this dump and then it
show you it shows you this dump options
window just click OK and then it will
ask you to save this il file somewhere
ok I've already saved this here let me
delete that ok I want this file to be
saved to this C Drive and I am giving it
sample dot IL name and then click Save
so it's already there I am just
replacing it so it gets saved there now
if I go to the C Drive if we go to the C
Drive there is a sample dot il file now
you can open that with notepad so let's
open that so start from notepad and drag
and drop this il file onto that notepad
look at this the entire intermediate
language and the manifest of that
assembly is present in this notepad now
I mean in this text format okay now
let's say for example you have
intermediate language in this format in
this in the text format and you want to
reconstruct your assembly back is that
possible absolutely and how do we do
that there is another tool for that
which is nothing but your I lesson
intermediate language assembler tool and
the way we use it exactly the same way
open up visual studio command prompt and
in the command prompt type I lesson dot
exe
dot exe is optional again and then give
the fully qualified path of the il text
file that is there and we know it is
actually present in C colon backslash
sample dot IO and placenta so what is
the Silas I'm tool going to do it's
going to read the contents of that file
and reconstruct an assembly for us okay
so operation completed successfully and
if we go back to C Drive you should see
sample dot exe and if I run that now you
should see your program executing so
basically you know in short we use il
Daz an intermediate language
disassembler to look at inside an
assembly to look at its manifest and
intermediate language and we use a
lesson basically to reconstruct an
assembly from intermediate language that
is present in a dot IL file and we'll
talk about strong named and week named
assemblies in the next session on this
slide you can find resources for asp.net
and C sharp interview questions that's
it for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
