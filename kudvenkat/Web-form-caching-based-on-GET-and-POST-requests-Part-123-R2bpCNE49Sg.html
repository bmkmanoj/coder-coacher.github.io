am venket this is part 1 to 3 of asp.net
video tutorial in this video we'll
discuss about waveform caching based on
get and post requests this question was
actually asked by one of my YouTube
subscribers related to part 120 of the
asp.net video tutorial we discussed
about caching multiple responses for a
single waveform if you haven't watched
part 1 2000 glie recommend to do so
before proceeding with this video let me
give quick background information about
the question asked by the Youtube
subscriber in sequel server I have this
table TBL products which has got these
four products and we have this waveform
one dot aspx which basically displays
those products in the grid view control
and on this platform I also have this
drop-down list control at the moment
look at the selection that drop-down
list we have all selected so all the
products are displayed within the grid
view control now if I want to filter the
products that are displayed in the grid
view control I can do so by changing the
selection in the drop-down list for
example if I change the selection to LCD
TV look at that within the grid view
only that products selected in the
drop-down list at the moment LCD TV is
displayed in the grid view control and
another important thing to notice is the
server time and decline time since we
don't have caching enabled for waveform
1 at the moment the waveform is
reprocessed every time we send a request
back to the server
now since we have set auto post back
property of the drop-down list control
to true every time we change a selection
in the drop-down list the waveform get
processed I mean posted back to the
server the waveform is free processed
and hence the server time and the client
time are the same things ok now let's go
ahead and enable caching obviously to
enable caching we use the output cache
directive and at the moment I have set
the duration attribute to 120 seconds
and vary by per am is equal to none so
since we have set the duration to 120
seconds this waveform is going to be
cached for 120 seconds and since we have
set vary by param to none there will be
only one response of this waveform cache
okay so let's go ahead and run this
webform so let's close this let's run
the waveform with caching enable look at
this this waveform is cached at 1825 51
so the get request for all products
should have been cached at that point of
time 1825 I mean 1852 51 now look at
what what has the user got to say when
we have set vary by / am is equal to
none and accessed webform 1 dot aspx the
form displayed all products as expected
in select product drop-down lists all
products is selected and that's what we
see here and now when I change the
selection in the drop-down list to
iPhone webform 1 dot aspx get posted
back to the server
the form is reprocessed at this point
only iPhone product is displayed in the
grid view control and then the drop-down
list iPhone is selected so look at this
when I change the selection to iPhone
okay so you know iPhone is displayed in
the grid view and that's what is
selected in drop-down list okay so let's
look at look at the server time and
client time you know they're the same
meaning this platform is reprocessed at
this point of time let's go back to the
first question of the user why was the
get request for the webform not cached
for all product selection in the
drop-down list so when initially this
waveform loaded we had that all product
selection so when I select all look at
that it is reverting its selection back
to iPhone so I am getting you know the
the cached response for the iPhone
selection but I'm not getting the cached
response for all product selection which
was initially displayed when we access
this waveform okay so obviously the user
question is why was the get request for
the waveform not cached for all products
the answer turns out to be the get
request for all product selection is
actually cached and to retrieve that
cached response all we need to do is go
back into that waveform you know address
bar and then click somewhere over there
and then when we press enter now it's
going to send another get request to the
web server okay because look at this
when I press ENTER so I get requests and
look at the time at the moment
18:54 50
think two minutes has passed that's why
this get request is reprocessed again
but now look at this when I change the
selection to iPhone okay so the Bev form
is posted back and this you know
postback request is cached but then to
get the initial get request
look at that click on the address bar
somewhere I click enter look at the time
eighteen fifty four fifty that's when
this waveform is cached the get request
so obviously the simple answer is the
get request is also cached and to
retrieve a cached copy of the get
request you need to send a get request
to the web server and to send a get
request all you need to do is you know
open another browser window you know
simply paste that URL and press Enter or
simply go to the address bar and press
Enter which will simulate a get request
to the server okay so the answer to that
question is the get request for all
products in fact is cached and to
retrieve that in the address bar click
anywhere and then in a press Enter which
will send another get request to the web
server and we should be getting the
cached response for that get requests so
what's the second question why am I not
getting the cached response for the get
request when I change the selection in
the drop-down list tool so the other
interesting question to answer is look
at this when I change the selection
okay iPhone is cached at eighteen fifty
six Oh ten now when I change the
selection to all why am I not getting
the cached response for the get request
okay why is it you know giving only this
iPhone a cached response for this iPhone
because technically when we select all
within the drop-down list since we have
set out a postback property to true for
the drop-down list it is going to post
back so this is not when you select all
in the drop-down list the waveform gets
posted back so that's a postback request
for all product selection in the
drop-down list it's not a get request
for all product selection in the
drop-down list and since we have a you
know a a response cached for a postback
request in this case for iPhone you know
that's what I get when I send a postback
request by changing the selection to all
in the drop-down list so technically
when you're changing the selection to
all you are sending a postback request
and since you are sending a postback
request you will get a cached response
for that postback request that's why
it's not showing all you know it's not
serving you with the cached response for
all products because that's the get
request okay whatever
we have cached there is actually a get
request
so it's cached at eighteen fifty seven
twenty six if I change the selection to
desktop it gets in a reprocessed for
that now if I change the selection in
the drop-down list to all I will only
get whatever is cached at that point of
time okay for that postback request but
if I want the cached response of the get
request I have to initiate a kainoa get
request by sending you know clicking in
the address bar somewhere and hitting
Enter
okay so obviously this is because when
the selection in the drop-down list is
changed it to all a postback request is
sent to the server since for the
postback request there is already a
cached version of the waveform we get
that version and not the cached version
of the get request because you are
sending a postback request by changing
the selection in the drop-down list to
all so I think when we set Barry by
param is equal to nan then a separate
response is cached for the get and post
requests so this statement should clear
all confusions about you know about
around these two questions the first and
second questions that we have just
discussed I welcome any suggestions to
improve this answer please leave your
valuable comments you know on this video
on the slide you can find resources for
asp.net c-sharp and sequel server
interview questions that's it for today
