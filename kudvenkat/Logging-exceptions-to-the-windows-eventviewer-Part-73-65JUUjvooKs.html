venket this is part 73 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll discuss
about logging exceptions to the Windows
Event Viewer in the previous session we
discussed about the Windows Event Viewer
itself as part of that we have discussed
how to create a custom windows log and a
custom windows source in fact if you
remember we have created this custom
Windows log presume tag if you haven't
watched the previous session I would
strongly encourage you to do so before
continuing with the session in this part
of the video session will discuss about
logging exceptions to this custom
windows log prizm tag I have an asp.net
web application project here on this web
form 1 I have a gridview control and
this web when this web form one loads up
we are creating an instance of this data
set object and then this data set object
has got this read xml method which is
trying to read the xml data from
countries dot xml and that data will be
loaded into the data set which in turn
we are setting as the data source for
the grid view control and finally we are
calling the data bind method but then if
you look at this project it doesn't have
this countries dot XML file so obviously
when we run this we get a file not found
exception and when that happens we want
to lock that exception to this custom
windows log play game tag let's see have
to do that in order to do that I'm going
to add a class file to this project I'm
going to call that class file as a
logger dot C s let me add that that
should add the class public class logger
and this class is going to contain a
method called
log method and this is a static method
and then if you look at this method it's
actually taking in an exception object
as a parameter so whenever an exception
happens within an application you know
we call this method pass it the
exception object and this method is
going to take up the responsibility of
logging that exception to the Windows
Event Viewer we'll talk about this code
in just a bit
first let's resolve some of the errors
that we have here now the stringbuilder
class is not recognized that's because
the string builder class is present in
na
system dot text namespace and along the
same lines we have another error here
this event logger class is not
recognized that's present in system
Diagnostics namespace so let's go ahead
and impose that as well so system dot
Diagnostics so at this point we don't
have any compilation errors okay so what
we have to understand at this point is
that we have a class called logger which
has caught the static method log that
takes in an exception object when we
pass an exception object to this method
it's going to take up the responsibility
of logging that to the Windows Event
Viewer so anywhere we have an exception
we can pass that exception to that
method now if you look at the code that
we have here it's present in the page
load event but then we don't have any
try-catch block here so obviously if
there is an exception that get ruled up
till the page level because if it's not
handled in page load event so it gets
rolled up till the page level and at the
page level we don't have page underscore
error event handler so obviously it's
going to propagate one more level up
till the application level and at the
application level we have this global
dot si X file which has got application
underscore error event handler this gets
executed so we are going to handle that
header error here now we need to get a
reference of that exception so how do we
do that we have the server object and it
has called this get last error method
that returns an exception object back
you can see the return type I'm going to
use a variable of type exception to
store that object okay so we have the
exception object if that exception
object is not null then what we want to
do we want to log that so if the
exception object is not equal to now
then we want to log it to the Windows
Event Viewer now to do that we can make
use of that logger class which we have
just created we'll talk about this log
method in just a bit
and then it has got that log method so
we are going to use that method so
logger dot log and then I'm going to
pass that this exception object okay so
the exception is logged now what we need
to do we need to clear the error and to
do that calls
over the clear error and finally
redirect the user to the custom error
page I have a page here a custom error
page errors toward aspx and this is a
very simple page that has got this you
know simple message that lets the user
know that there is an application error
so I'm going to redirect the user to
this page so let's copy the name of that
let's go to global dot asex and then
let's use server dot transfer and I'm
going to specify the URL so till the
four slash errors to aspx okay so at
this point let's go ahead and run this
now when we run this the exception will
be unhandled at the page level it gets
ruled up till the application level at
the application level in global dot aasa
X we are handling that exception logging
that to the Windows Event Viewer and
then redirecting the U user to errors
errors today's specs and if you look at
the URL you will still see webform one
dot aspx that's because we used server
transfer all right now let's go ahead
and look at the Event Viewer look at the
message on the top new events available
ok so let's go ahead and refresh this
and we should see that exception there
and let me copy this to the notepad so
that we can see it better
ok so if you look at this exception
there are two exceptions actually this
is file not found exception and another
exception HTTP unhandled exception so
why do we have to that's because first
the exception happened here and since
you didn't handle that you know it got
you know propagated till the application
level and at the application level you
know it has this unhandled exception
which is wrapping this file not found
exception so the outer exception is HTTP
unhandled exception and the inner
exception is filenotfoundexception and
if you look at the way we are logging it
we have exception type and the type of
the exception message the exception
message and the stack trace basically
where you know that exception occurred
similar
the exception type here the message and
stack trace and if you look at this it
will specify the line number and the
file where that error has occurred it
has occurred on webform one dot aspx CS
at line number 16 okay so now let's see
how did we log this to the Event Viewer
now if you look at this method itself
the log method it's pretty simple it's a
static method and it's it has got this
parameter exception object okay and if
you look at this exception object now if
you look at the message that we have in
the Event Viewer it has got the
exception type message and stack trace
okay
so those are the you know like headings
so how are we getting them look at this
exception type that's a hard-coded
string okay and if you look at what we
are doing here we are actually using a
stringer builder object why aren't we be
using string object and why be using
string builder because strings of type
string are immutable
whereas strings of type string builder
object are mutable because we are
changing the string object several times
it's better to use string builder
instead of string object for performance
reasons and again we have talked about
the differences between string and
stringbuilder objects in the C sharp
video series so if you haven't checked
those videos I would encourage you to do
so first before continuing with asp.net
video series okay so we have the string
builder object and then to the same
string builder object we are appending
this hard coded text exception type and
then you might be wondering what is this
environment dot newline now that is the
you know newline character that spits
out newline character what's newline
character in c-sharp backslash n so
instead of having that string you know
environment dot newline that's more
readable so we have that because if you
look at the message look at that after
exception type the exception type is
coming in the next line that's because I
have a newline character there so I am
appending that to this exception type
and then we are actually getting the
exception type itself how are we getting
that when we pass in this exception
object look at that we are getting the
type name and then printing that there
that I have to environment dot newline
strings that are appended so obviously I
will have you know one environment
outline and then the other one there
okay and then we have this message and
then another environment dot new line
and then the exception message itself
I'm getting the message property and
then appending two new lines and then
finally stacktrace getting this track
trace using the stack trace property and
then two new lines so we have got until
this point okay that's the outer
exception okay now we need to check if
there is any inner exception how do we
check that exception dot inner exception
property look at the return type that
returns another exception object if if
there is an inner exception and we are
storing that this inner in this inner
exception variable so while inner
exception is not equal to null what I
have done here I have copied this exact
piece of code and pasted it here all I
have done here is instead of using here
we are using the exception object but
here we are using inner exception object
it's exactly the same piece of code and
then finally what we are doing we are
saying inner exception is equal to inner
exception dot inner exception in case if
we have three levels of inner exceptions
or four levels it's going to use this
look how many ever inner exceptions you
have whatever is the depth it's going to
go all the way till the bottom till the
till the final inner exception retrieve
the exception type message and stack
trace and then it is getting appended to
this you know stringbuilder object espy
exception message and then what we are
doing this is where this is the only bit
of piece of code that's required to log
the exception to the Windows Event
Viewer so in systems or Diagnostics
namespace we have called this event log
class and this event log class has got
this method source success if you
remember yesterday we have created a you
know the source as presume techcom okay
because if you go to the Windows Event
Viewer look at that when I highlighted
the
I select this one look at the source
regime techcom is the source and in the
previous session we have seen how to
create a custom window source and
windows lock that is that source so we
are checking is that source existing
okay using source exists if that returns
true the source is present so I am
creating a new event log object okay and
look at the name of the event log I am
passing in the name of the log here so
that you know whenever you log a message
that gets logged against this custom log
and if you remember we have that custom
log here presumed tech okay and then log
that source source name is prism tech
comm we are specifying that here and
finally this is the line that writes
that object string object to the event
viewer the right entry method and if you
look at this right entry method it is
taking in the message itself so string
builder object dot - string that returns
the string out of that string builder
object and then the the second parameter
is like what type of you know entry do
you want do you want an error entry or
information entry or audit entry what it
is okay so because if you look at the
event viewer look at the application for
example you can have several types you
get you have information errors etc so
if you right click on that and say
filter current log you can see the
different types of event log entries
critical entries warning entries etc but
exceptions are errors so we are going to
lock them as errors look at that it's
logged as an error and to specify that
how you want to log that to the event
viewer you use the second parameter
event log entry type that's an enum and
when I plus dot you have all the entry
types there it's an error okay so that's
it so it's very simple I mean it looks
big but then all this is a copy-paste of
the same piece of code and then the only
line that's important to us is this
right entry method it takes in the
string that you want to write to and
then specify what type of
create is is it error information etc
that's it we are done and then it's also
possible now look at this since we are
allowing this exception to get ruled up
all the way till application underscore
error we have inner exceptions but if
you have handled that where that
exception has occurred then you wouldn't
have this you know HTTP unhandled
exception let's quickly do that okay
instead of allowing the exception to
roll up till the application level I can
handle that exception here and log it to
the Event Viewer how do we do that
simply use the try catch blocks so I'm
going to say try and then I'm going to
use this catch block and then we catch
whatever type of exception that happens
and then all you have to do is e^x dot I
mean we use the logger class dot log and
pass the exception object so it gets
logged and then maybe you can show a
meaningful error message to the user
saying that file not found or whatever
maybe we can have a label control on
this webform and we can shoot through
the user you know in this catch block a
message okay but then I'm not going to
do that now we are simply going to log
that exception so let's go ahead and run
this now or you can rewrite the user to
errors paid depending on what your
application is trying to do you can
either redirect the user to the custom
errors page or you can display on this
web form in a label control and error
message stating that the file is not
found it completely depends on the
application requirement so let me go
ahead and run this and obviously we get
an exception but nothing will be shown
here because we are not doing anything
we are simply logging that exception so
let's go back to the event viewer and
refresh this look at that I got an
exception but then let me copy this
exception to a file I'm into a notepad
and if you look at that I just have one
exception that's because at the first
chance I handle that exception I didn't
love that to be unhandled when you allow
that to be unhandled and you handle it
in global dot ASX it's going to be
wrapped inside an unhandled exception
that's going to act the HTTP unhandled
exception will be the outer exception
and whatever exception that initially
cost you know to get it rolled up till
the application level is going to be the
inner exception okay on this slide you
can find resources for asp.net c-sharp
and sequel server interview questions
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
