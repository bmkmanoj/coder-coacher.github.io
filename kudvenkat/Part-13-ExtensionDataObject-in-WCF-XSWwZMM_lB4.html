this video we'll discuss the use of
extension data object this is
continuation to part 12 so please watch
part 12 before proceeding we'll be using
the same example that we worked with in
the previous session let's understand
the use of extension data object with an
example let's flip to visual studio so
this is where we left in the previous
session we introduce the city field and
we made it required and this is a
breaking change meaning existing clients
who have built their proxy classes
already are going to break because they
will be unaware that there is a new
field that is required as a result they
won't be supplying value for this field
and since this is a required field the
service is going to throw an exception
let's actually look at that in action so
the service is already running getting
an employee shouldn't be a problem but
then if we try to save this employee
with a different ID look at that we get
an exception okay in order to prevent
this exception from happening all we
need to do is make this anon required
field introducing a new non required
field is a non-breaking change okay and
let's make it non required and let's say
for some reason we also want to remove
this gender field from the employee data
contract and this gender is a non
required field removing non required
fields from existing data contracts it's
not going to break the existing clients
okay so with this change you know if we
compile this we get compilation errors
that's basically because we have removed
this gender property from the employee
data contract and we didn't remove the
references of that gender property
within the employee service itself so
wherever we are referencing gender
property we need to remove all those
references so let's go and do that
all right now we need to modify the
stored procedures as well so let's flip
to sequel server management studio so we
basically need at the text of SP save
employee and now gender property we are
not going to supply a value for gender
column so let's specify a default value
of null so if we don't supply a value a
default value of null will be stored in
the database table in a similar fashion
let's modify SP get employee so within
this procedure let's actually return I
mean let's not return gender so let's
change this to alter all right so with
all these changes let's close the host
that's already running let's read on the
host and let's get to the client
so now let's get employee 1 mark let's
say marks gender is male and let's save
this employee with ID 3 okay and if you
look at the database table at the moment
we only have two employees we are going
to save this employee with ID 3 employee
saved so let's check the database table
and if you look at you know row number
three gender is basically not because we
didn't supply a value for it so it's -
that's not now that's fine now look at
this
the client has specified 3 you know male
as the gender for this employee 3 ok now
when we saved it you know the viewstate
of this web application is just
displaying that value but if I go and
get the employee look at what's going to
happen you know where is the gender
value we basically lost
during their own trip okay so and why
did we lose it that's basically because
you know decline this supplying value
for gender that's fine so if you look at
the client proxy classes so within this
waveform one we have this employee proxy
class if we go to the definition on this
one decline the proxy class has got ID
so ID name and we have got gender as
well okay now if you look at the
employee class on the service side we
don't have gender property okay now when
a client has to invoke the service the
what will the client do the client is
you know building the employee object
okay and before the service can be
invoked that message that employee
object needs to be turned into an XML so
all these properties are going to be
converted into XML and that XML will be
sent to the servers okay so within the
XML we have a value for this gender as
well so when that XML is received at the
service this service is going to
deserialize that XML and it's going to
build an employee object out of that XML
okay so that that's the process of
digitalization so during that DZ
realization process this ID data will be
mapped you know from the XML into ID
property of the employee object on the
service side similarly named name now on
the service side we don't have gender
property within the employee object so
the XML has got a value for gender so it
doesn't know the service doesn't know
what to do with that gender property
value so it's going to simply by default
you know throw away that unknown data
okay now let's say for some reason we
want to preserve that unknown data and
return that back to the client okay so
how do we preserve that unknown data
with the help of this extension data
object so let's see how to use this
extension data object and
that unknown data so now if you look at
the client sorry the employee service so
within the employee service you know
employee data contract basically this
court data contract has to implement an
interface that is I extensible data
object and this interface is present in
system runtime dot serialization
namespace and if you look at this
interface this interface has got a
single property you know i extensible
data extension data object you know
that's the return type and this is the
name of the property now the
implementation of this one is going to
be straightforward we are going to make
this an auto implemented property so
basically what is the purpose of this
extension data property now you know if
at all if there are any unknown elements
of data within the XML that is received
on the service side those unknown
elements will be stored in this object
in this extension data object and then
when you know we want to return that
data back to the client basically you
know we need to serialize the data into
xml during that serialization process
what we are going to do is take the
unknown elements from this extension
data object and put them in an xml
format in a way that we receive them
when the service was initially called
and once this data is sent in an XML
format to the client the client knows
how to pull that data from XML you know
basically deserialize it and then
display it in the appropriate controls
on the user interface okay so basically
this is going to act as a data store for
those unknown elements on the service
side we can use this even on the client
side as well it works in both the
directions okay all right so that's the
change within the employee data contract
and if you look at the employee service
itself here I'm going to introduce a
private variable within this
as of type employee and let's call this
underscore last saved employee in a bit
you will understand you know the use of
this variable so when we call the save
employee method what we are going to do
is within this variable we are going to
stay save
I mean store the employee object that we
just saved to the database table and
then when somebody invokes this get
employee method obviously they are going
to pass the ID of the employee that they
want to get in that case what we are
going to do is just before we return the
employee object itself we are going to
check ok if under school last saved
employee if that is not equal to now and
if the ID so if the ID that is coming
into this method you know the ID of the
employee that the client is requesting
if that ID equal to underscore last
saved employees ID in that case what we
are going to do is the employee object
that we are going to return we are going
to set the extension data property to
the extension data of last saved
employee okay now if this is not clear
at the moment don't worry we'll put a
breakpoint and understand how this code
is going to work okay so that's all we
have to do and one final change with an
employee service we need to change the
instance context mode so I'm going to
make use of service behavior attribute
and that's present in system dot service
model namespace so let's decorate this
class with service behavior attribute
and we need to basically set this named
property instance context mode so
instance context mode equals instance
context mode dot single we'll discuss
the different instance context modes in
detail in the later video sessions will
now understand that
in a single instance context mode means
that a single instance of the service
class is going to serve multiple clients
okay
all right with all these changes let's
actually run this in debug mode let's
delete all the breakpoints that we
already have let's put a breakpoint and
get employee and save employee let's go
and run the service and let's close this
client browser and let's also run the
client in debug mode okay so now we
should be able to preserve the data the
unknown data basically right so let's
get employee one okay so we are going to
return employee one let's you know skip
through the breakpoint now let's say we
want to save this employee if you look
at the database table at the moment we
have got three employees let's save this
employee now mark the tidy four and
notice that we have set gender to male
okay so let's click save employee here
so now save employee you know a call to
this method is made and if you look at
this employee object first notice that
there is no gender property within the
employee object itself okay but there is
extension data okay so since there is no
gender property the data for gender
that's present within the XML can't be
DC read deserialized
you know into this employee object as a
result the value for that gender
property is unknown at the service ID
and what what the service is going to do
is put it in this extension data
property and if we expand this look at
this there are there is one member and
if you look at the members itself and
you dig further and look at that there
is a name of the XML element called
gender and the value of that is actually
you know if you scroll down further you
should see so extension data on public
members members so gender is the name
and if you look at the value the value
itself is male okay so you know it's
preserved in that extension data now I
think we have time dot we have already
got an exception there
okay so let's you know detach all these
and let's run the client I mean the
service once again and the client so
that's what happens during the get
process I mean during the save process
so I think it might not have saved the
employee because the service timed out
okay but basically during the process of
saving what's going to happen the
unknown XML data is stored in that
extension data property and when we
actually in you know invoke get employee
method what's going to happen look at
this when we save employee yes
storing that employee within this
private variable underscore last saved
employee okay now when we invoke this
get employee method what's going to
happen you know obviously we pass an ID
to get the employee okay so we execute
this ad or dotnet code as usual and then
when it reaches this line it checks okay
is last saved employee not equal to null
meaning we have just saved an employee
to the database table and if the ID you
know of that employee is equal to the ID
that the end user has requested if they
match then he we know that he is
requesting the same employee object in
that case what you do is retrieve the
extension data from that last saved
employee object and then put it in the
extension data property of the employee
object that we are going to return to
the client okay so now the client has
the extension data
meaning there is gender property value
within that extension data and then
that's going to be DC realized I'm in
serialized into XML and once that XML is
arrived at the client the client knows
how to pull the data out of that XML
basically DC realize it and display it
within the controls so it's that
straightforward okay alright so let's
actually look at that in action so let's
disable all these breakpoints so that we
don't get a timeout so let's get
employee one so we got that employee and
let's save this employee you know with
the ID three so employees save now if
you look at the database so basically we
have two employees with ID three
actually let's do this let's get
employee to so we got a part-time
employee Mary
let's save the gender as female and
let's save the ID with one zero one okay
so employees saved so if we come here so
one zero one maybe and gender look at
that it's now now let's get rid of this
gender there and look at this when I say
get employee get all the data including
you know gender if you look at the
database table we don't have gender for
Mary so where is that coming from that's
coming from extension data okay now if
you you know build a new client for the
service you know if there is a new
client then if that if that new client
build the proxy classes obviously that
client will know that gender is not a
required field because obviously a
property gender property on the employee
class will not be constructed okay so
obviously new clients are not going to
supply values for gender so extension
data will be null you know for new
clients and that's fine all right
so in short use I extensible data object
to preserve
unknown elements during serialization
and deserialization of data contracts on
the service side at the time of BZ
realization the unknown elements from
the client are stored in extension data
object and for the service to send that
data back to the client the service has
to serialize data into XML format and
during the serialization process the
data from extension data object is
serialized into XML as it was provided
at the time of the initial service call
and the client basically knows how to
pull that data and then display it in
the appropriate UI controls that's it
for today thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
