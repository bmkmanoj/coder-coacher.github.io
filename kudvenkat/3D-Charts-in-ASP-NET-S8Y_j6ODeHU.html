tutorial in this video well discus
creating three-dimensional charts in
asp.net this is continuation to part 6
so please watch part 6 before proceeding
asp.net chart control supports 3d charts
to use 3d charts all we need to do is
set the respective chart areas any will
3d attribute to true let's look at this
in action let's flip to visual studio
this is the same example that we worked
with in the previous video session
notice we've got chart areas element and
within this chart areas element we've
got one chart area with named chart area
one to use 3d charts all we need to do
is set enable 3d attribute to true with
this change let's go ahead and run our
project and now the chart and data
should be displayed using a three
dimensional chart as you can see now
there are several properties that we can
use to customize the look and feel of 3d
charts let's flip to visual studio and
let's flip this waveform to the design
mode at the moment notice the chart
control does not display any test data
at design time why is that that's
basically because if you recollect from
the previous video session we have
deleted series one element and the
reason we have deleted series one
element is because to bind data to the
chart control we are using data binding
method so this data bind table method is
going to automatically create a new
series and add that series to the chart
control so there is no need to specify a
series declaratively in the HTML at
design-time
just the reason we deleted it but if we
want the chart control to display some
test data at design time then we need to
have at least one series element present
so let's go to and include a series
element here let's set its name to
series 1 and let's associate this to
this chart area
now let's flip this to the design mode
notice that some test data is displayed
within the chat control now let's get to
the properties of the chart control and
within the properties window click on
the ellipsis button next to chart areas
property and in the window that pops up
notice that there is a section called 3d
and here we have area 3d style and we
have already said enable 3d property to
true and here we have the rest of the
properties that we can use to customize
the look and feel of our 3d charts for
example notice here we've got wall width
property now if you want to know what
this property actually does at the
bottom of the window notice we also have
got help text so basically this property
is going to get our set the width of
chart area walls in pixels at the moment
this property is set to 7 pixels let's
actually change its value to 20 and then
once we click away and notice that its
effect is immediately reflected within
the chart control so you can play around
with the rest of the properties now
let's delete the series element we need
to delete it otherwise we will get a
runtime exception when we try to change
the chart type from the drop-down list
because we are using data bind table
method so let's go ahead and run this
now so let's select PI as the chart type
and notice that again the pie chart is
displayed you know in a three
dimensional format similarly when we
select do not it is also displayed in
three dimensions thank you for listening
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
