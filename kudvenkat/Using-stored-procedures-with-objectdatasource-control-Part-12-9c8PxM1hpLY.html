venket this is part well of asp.net
grid-view tutorial in this video we'll
discuss about using stored procedures
with object data source control in my
sequel server database I have two tables
on the left you can see TBL department
table which has department ID and name
columns and on the right you can see TBL
employee table which has employee ID
name and Department ID columns
Department ID is the foreign key so if I
ask you to which department does Mike
belong to since his department ID is for
he belong to administration team now
based on these two tables I want to
design a waveform on this waveform you
can see a drop-down list here which is
listing all the departments from TBL
department table now as soon as I select
the department from the drop-down list
we need to retrieve all the employees
belonging to that department from TBL
employees table and then display them
within the grid view control
I want to achieve this using stored
procedures and object data source
control we discussed about doing exactly
the same thing but using sequel data
source control and stored procedures in
part 11 of the asp.net grid view
tutorial so please watch part 11 before
proceeding with this video now let's
flip to sequel server management studio
we'll be using the same two tables okay
now the script to create these tables
and populate them with some sample data
will be available on my blog now we will
also be using the same stored procedures
as well so obviously this drop-down list
is listing all the departments from TBL
department table so we need a stored
procedure which is going to retrieve all
department IDs and department names from
that table and if you look at the stored
procedure SP get the departments it's
doing exactly the same thing look at the
Select query very straightforward select
department ID name from TBL department
table let's quickly test this so we get
the list of departments now as soon as
we select the department from the drop
down list then we need to retrieve all
the employees belonging to that
department okay and look at what we need
in the grid view control we need
employee ID employee name and Department
name columns now if you look at dB
employee table it doesn't have
department name call so obviously we
need to join these two tables okay so we
need a stored procedure which joins
these two tables and then based on the
past in department ID it has to retrieve
the employees belonging to that
department ID okay so this is what that
stored procedure is doing here SP get
employees by department ID so it is
taking in department ID parameter and
then it's joining TBL employee table
with department retrieving employee ID
employee name and the department name
and look at the where clause
we are only retrieving those employees
you know whose department ID is whatever
we are passing in as a parameter it has
to match with that passed in parameter
okay so let's quickly test this through
procedure as well so here I am passing
in a department ID of 1 so let's execute
that so all the employees belonging to
department ID 1 which is IT are returned
all right now let's see how to use
object data source control and then
directly execute those two procedures
retrieve this data and then display them
in the grid view and drop down list all
right so if we have to use object data
source control first we need to have our
objects defined in our application now
in reality depending on the project our
you know project architecture it may
have several layers in it and it's very
common for projects to have layers like
you know presentation layer business
logic layer data access layer ok
presentation layer is usually the
asp.net web application project whereas
business logic layer is a class library
project where we define our business
rules and business objects and data
access layer is also a class library
project but that is responsible for all
the database crud operations like insert
selects updates and deletes ok now
usually the presentation layer talks to
the business logic layer which in turn
talks to the data access layer and the
data access layer is responsible for the
database creation but for the purposes
of this demo we will have our data
access layer
directly within our asp.net web
application project that is the
presentation layer okay so obviously to
retrieve Department related data we need
Department data access layer so let me
go ahead and create department data
access layer class within this project
directly okay
so let's call the department data access
layer class file as department data
access layer dot CS so let's add that
class file to this project right click
add a class file and then let's specify
the class file s Department data access
layer dot CS click Add now to represent
a department we need a department class
which is going to have department ID and
name properties so I have the class
there just to save some time I have that
already type and if you look at this
class it's pretty straight forward all
this help this class has got is two
properties auto implemented properties
department ID and department name ok
department ID is integer
whereas department name is a string
property all right now within this
department data access layer class I
require a method which is going to
retrieve all the departments by
executing this store procedure SPG at
departments so let me copy this method
and paste it there ok now we will have
some compilation errors here that's
because configuration manager signal
connections equal command these are ad
or dotnet related classes so we need
those names pieces here so let me copy
and paste them as well so system data
system data dot sequel client and system
that configuration namespaces that
should get rid of those call you know
compilation errors now look at this
method it's a static method that's the
important thing so we if we have to call
this method we don't have to create an
instance of this class because that's a
static method and look at what is this
method doing it's returning a list of
Department objects pack cake get all all
departments
obviously so the first line is we are
creating a list of departments object
and then look at this this is pretty
straightforward
ad or dotted code now if you're new to a
do dotnet we have discussed about you do
dotnet extensively in a do dotnet
tutorial where we discussed about
creating connection objects and command
objects so what are we doing here using
configuration manager class we are
reading the connection string from web
config file and using that connection
string we are creating a sequel
connection object and then we are
creating a sequel command object look at
this to the sequel command object we are
passing in the stored procedure SP get
departments which is going to return all
the departments and then since that is a
stored procedure we're specifying that
as a stored procedure using command I
property opening the connection
executing that command and then we are
looking through each row that is
returned and then we are converting the
you know that a data row into a
department object look at that we are
retrieving the department ID from that
row and then you know storing that in
the department ID property of the
department object name into the
department name property of the
department object and then we are adding
the department object to this list which
we have created on the top and finally
you know once we complete looping
through all the rows you know we will
have all the department objects added to
that list and we are returning that list
back because if you look at the return
type of this method it's a list of
department okay so at this point we are
done with the department data access
layer let's build that solution now
let's go to our web form and then drag
and drop an object data source control
because we have over a department object
ready so we should be able to show those
departments in a drop-down list so let
me go ahead and first get object data
source control and configure that so
configure object datasource choose your
business object because that my business
object is going to be demoed or
department data access layer click Next
within that you know data access layer
class I have a method called get all
departments and look at that what it is
returning back
it's returning a list of Department back
so click finish we are done now I want a
drop-down list to be present on this
waveform so let's go ahead drag and drop
a drop down list and let's configure the
drop down list choose data source the
data source is going to be object data
source one since it it's a drop down
list we have to specify a display text
and a value for the list item object
within the drop down list
so display is going to be department
name and the value is going to be
department ID that's it
now if we run this we should be able to
list all the departments within the drop
down list control and we have used that
stored procedure SP get departments look
at that we see all the departments here
now let's go ahead and use another
object data source control to you know
basically retrieve employees by
department ID but then before that we
need to have our employee data access
class as well so let's go ahead and add
our employee data access class to this
project so add a new class and I'm going
to call that as employee data access
layer so let me copy that and paste it
there so employee data access layer dot
CS now to represent an employee look at
what we need in the grid view control I
need employee ID employee name and
Department name columns so my employee
class is going to contain those three
properties okay and just again to save
some time I have this already typed so
let me copy that implementation of the
class and then paste it in our employee
data access layer file so this is our
employee class with three properties
employee ID which is of type string and
an employee name and Department name
again these are auto implemented
properties okay so in this employee data
access layer class now I need a method
which is going to return you know all
the employees by department ID so I need
a static method which is going to have a
department ID as the parameter
and then based on that passed in
department ID we need to retrieve all
the employees okay so the first thing to
note this is a static method first let's
get rid of these compilation errors
because we need those namespaces data
access layer our ATO dotnet code of the
namespaces systems or data systems or
data dot sequel client and configuration
alright so this is a static method which
is returning a list of employees back
and the name of the method get employees
by department ID so we are going to give
it a department ID this method will give
a department ID all the employees that
belong to that department ID need to be
returned by this method so the return
type is list of employee so obviously we
are creating a list of employees object
so using the configuration manager class
to read the connection stream from web
config file using that connection string
we are creating a sequel connection
object and then we are specific sequel
command which is sp get employees by
department ID and if you remember this
stored procedure expects a parameter to
be passed in department ID parameter now
since this is a stored procedure we're
specifying that it is a stored procedure
using command I property of the command
object and then we need to pass in a
parameter so at the department ID is the
name of the parameter and the value for
that is coming into this method as a
parameter so we are passing this method
parameter as a value for the stored
procedure parameter later when we
actually configure you know the object
data source that's when we will
understand how will this get how will
this method get a value for this
parameter alright so we are adding that
parameter object to the parameters
collection of the command object open
the connection execute the command and
then what are we doing we are looping
through each row that is retrieved after
executing the stored procedure reading
the employee ID and storing it an
employee ID property of the employee
object name into the employee name of
the project and department name into the
department name property of the employee
object and then we are adding that
employee object
this list once we are done looping
through all the rules then we are
returning that list back you know
because the return type of this method
is list employee so we are done creating
our employee data access class as well
so let's build that solution let's go
back to our waveform drag and drop
another object data source control onto
the web form and let's configure that so
select your business object in this case
it's going to be employee data access
layer let's click Next
choose your method it's going to be get
employees by department ID which takes
Department ID as the parameter and
returns list of employees so click Next
now look at this this method has a
parameter now look at what happens when
I click Next this wizard will detect
that the method is expecting a parameter
and it is asking us ok so this method
has a parameter where is the value for
this parameter going to come from ok
it is going to come from this drop-down
list remember when I select a department
within the drop-down list we need to
pass in I mean we need to retrieve that
selected department value and give it to
this stored procedure SP get employees
by department ID but then this stored
procedure if you remember it is being
called by our employee data access layer
you know in this class we have a method
called get employees PI department ID so
we need to pass in a value for that
parameter ok so where is that going to
come from from this drop-down list so
the parameter source is going to be a
control and then what is the control ID
drop-down list 1 that's it so department
ID is going to come from drop-down list
1 selected value ok so we are done
configuring that as well all that is
left out is drag-and-drop a gridview
control and then associate that with
object datasource to control and then
auto format that to look better that's
it let's go ahead and run this now
so we should see IT departments elected
and then all the departments there now
when I select HR all the employees
belonging to HR should be shown but not
because we didn't you know the waveform
is not posted back when I selected you
know another department so we need to
set the auto post back property of the
drop-down list to true all right now
let's run that as soon as the selection
changes in the drop-down list of F
should post back and we should get the
new Department values so payroll
administration alright on this slide you

and sequel server interview questions
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
