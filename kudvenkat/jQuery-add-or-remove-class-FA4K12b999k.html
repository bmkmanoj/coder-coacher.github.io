this video we'll discuss how to check if
an element has a specific CSS class how
to add or remove CSS classes and how to
toggle CSS classes so let's understand
all these jQuery class methods with an
example so we want to design a page that
looks like this we want to include a
paragraph element with this text regime
technologies and we want to have these
six buttons so the idea is to have three
CSS classes color class italics class
and bold class when applied the color
class should change the font color to
red italics class should change the font
style to italics and bold class should
change the font weight to bold so when
we click this button add color class it
should apply the color class to this
paragraph element similarly when we
click the second button it should add
both the class's color and italics to
the paragraph element and when we click
the last button we want to apply all the
three classes to the paragraph element
so when we click these remove buttons
for example when we click remove all
classes button we want to remove all the
classes from the paragraph element when
we click the second button it should
remove color and italics classes the
first button should remove just the
color class so let's see how to achieve
this so the first step here is to design
a page that looks like this in the
interest of time I have already
implemented the required HTML so within
the head section we have got a section
for style and within the style section
we've got three classes bold class
italics class and color class and this
bold class changes the font weight to
bold italics class change the font style
to italic and color class changes the
color to red and within our body section
we have got the paragraph element with
the text prism technologies and we also
have an HTML table so at the moment this
is how the page looks like so we have
the paragraph element with the text and
the six buttons and these six buttons
are present in an HTML table so the
table is having three table rows so when
I expand this table element notice that
we have got three table rows and within
the first
Abell drove we've got two TDs and within
each TD we have caught a button so in
three table rows we've got six buttons
and if you look at the HTML of the
button it's pretty straightforward it
has got an ID attribute style where we
have set the width of the button to 250
pixels type equals button and value
equals add color class so the only
attributes that change you know for
these buttons are ID and the value
attributes you know style and type are
the same okay
so I'll have all this HTML available on
my blog in case you need it so at the
moment when we click these buttons
nothing happens okay so we need to
associate click even handlers to these
buttons and then depending on the button
we have clicked we want to either add a
class or remove class all right
so let's launch developer tools and look
at the HTML that we have in the Dom at
the moment so we have the paragraph
element without any CSS class at the
moment all right so let's go to visual
studio so within our script section we
have the ready function wired up so the
first thing that we want to do is find
the element by ID we want to find the
button element and button elements have
got an ID we want to find this button 1
when we click that button 1 we want to
add color class and ID selected in
jQuery is pound and the ID that we want
to find is PT and 1 and 2 that we want
to associate it click event handler when
click event occurs we want to execute a
function so what do we want to do when
click event occurs we want to add color
class to the paragraph element so we
want to find this paragraph element now
at the moment the paragraph element does
not have an ID so let's use the element
selector so find the paragraph element
and to that we want to add a CSS class
so I'm going to use add class method and
to that method we need to specify the
name of the CSS class that we want so
what class do we want to add we want to
add color class so let's copy the name
and pass it to this add class method
so this should add the color class to
the paragraph element similarly when we
click the second button we want to
remove the color class and to remove a
class we use remove class CSS function
so find the element by ID in this case
button 2 and when we click that we want
to remove the class ok so this method is
going to remove color class from the
paragraph element so let's make two more
copies of this code so now let's first
change the IDs of the buttons so this is
going to be button 3 button 4 button 5 +
button 6 so let's save that now when we
click button 3 what should happen so
button 3 is present in the second tier
when we click button 3 we want to add
color and italics classes notice we want
to add two classes so this add class
method is going to add just the color
class but in addition to that we also
want to add italics class so let's copy
that name so when you want to add two or
more classes you simply pass them to the
add class method with a space in between
so this is going to add both the classes
to the paragraph element and when we
click button 4 we want to remove those
two classes and the idea is again you
specify the class names with a space in
between them so this remove class method
is going to remove both the classes from
the paragraph element so when we click
button 5 we want to add all the three
classes color italics and bold so first
of all let's go ahead and copy this code
so at the moment this will add two
classes but I also want to add bold
class so let's copy that and pass it to
this so this method is now going to add
all the three classes to the paragraph
element and when we click the last
button we want to remove all the three
classes so if you want to remove all the
three classes you can do this so pass
all the three class names
with a space between them that's going
to remove all these three classes or you
can also do this don't specify any class
name so this is going to remove all the
classes that this paragraph element has
not just those three if it has another
class maybe in or something like
underline class it's going to remove
that as well
so let's save the changes and let's
reload this page so now when we click
this button add color italics and bold
classes it should add all the three
classes and look at the paragraph
element in the dorm at the moment it
does not have any class applied so let's
click this button and see what's going
to happen look at that first of all the
paragraph element color this change its
italicized and it's bolded as well and
if you look at the paragraph element
let's call the class attribute and all
the three CSS classes are applied color
class italics class and bold class now
what's going to happen when we click
this button remove color class it should
remove the color class look at that the
color class is removed but italics class
and bold class are still present now
when I click remove all classes button
it should remove all the classes look at
that and similarly when I say add color
and Dericks class it should add color
class and italics class and when we say
remove color and Telex it should remove
both the classes and when we click add
color class it should add just the color
class and when we remove color class it
should remove the color class okay so we
have seen add class and remove class so
basically the purpose of add class is to
add one or more specified classes and if
we want to add multiple classes simply
separate them with a space between and
if you want to remove classes use remove
class this method is going to remove one
our multiple classes or all classes to
remove multiple classes separate them
with a space if you want to remove all
the classes then don't specify any class
name what is this has class method this
method is going to chat if a given
element has a specific class if the
given element has that specified class
then this method is going to return true
otherwise false then what is this toggle
class
to understand this function with an
example so let's actually include
another HTML button so to this HTML
let's add another TR and let's include
two more TDs and within the first TD
let's include another button and let's
change the button ID to be t + 7 and
let's change the text on this to toggle
classes so the idea of the button is
button 7 so what is this toggle class
method going to do this method basically
you know it's going to toggle the
classes in the sense that if the element
has this specified that classes already
it's going to remove those classes if
the element does not have the classes
then it's going to add them so basically
the idea is if the class is present it
will remove it if it's not present it
will add it so that's what toggle class
method does so let's look at that in
action so when we click this button we
want to toggle all the three classes
color class bold class and italics class
so within our ready function let's find
let's actually copy this so let's find
the button by ID so we want to find
button 7 and when we click that we want
to use toggle class and look at what
we're passing we are passing all the
three class names to this function so
what is this function going to do if
these three classes are not present on
the paragraph element then this method
is going to add those three classes if
they are already present then it's going
to remove those three classes so let's
look at that in action let's save the
changes reload this page so we have this
toggle class button look at the
paragraph element at the moment it does
not have any of the CSS classes so since
it doesn't have any classes when I click
this toggle classes button it's going to
add all those three classes look at that
it added all the three classes and look
at the style of the paragraph element
here now when I click this button again
all the three classes are present
already it's going to remove those
classes so that's what the toggle class
method does now let's look at another
example so basically in any data entry
form you know you would have already
seen this kind of a behavior when the
textbox receives focus in on the
background color of the text box changes
to something maybe in our example here
it's changing to green and the font
color is white okay so at the moment the
focus is on first name textbox so the
background color is changed and the font
color is changed when the text box loses
focus we want to remove that class and
if last name receives text our focus we
want to change you know basically apply
that class to that text box so let's see
how to achieve this so the first thing
here is to write the required HTML you
know to get that design and in the
interest of time I have already done
that here is that HTML again I'll have
all this HTML available on my blog in
case you need it and this HTML is again
pretty straightforward so within our
body section let's include this HTML
table and let's get rid of the script
that we have within the script section
so I'm going to remove everything and
leave just the ready function there and
we don't require all these style classes
so let's remove them as well and let's
actually create another style class
let's call this text box style and what
is this style class going to do it's
going to change the background color of
the text box to green and font color to
white
okay so again it's simple CSS style
class and with an already function so
what do we want to do we want to you
know associate basically focus and blur
events to all the text boxes on this
page okay so basically we want to find
all text boxes and to find all text
boxes I'm going to use this jQuery
selector
so give me all input elements where the
type attribute is equal to text okay so
this is going to give us all the textbox
elements so now we want to loop through
each textbox element and as we are
looping through we want to execute some
code now what we want to do is associate
focus and blur events to each of the
textbox control that we are iterating
over and to refer to the element that we
are currently iterating over we use the
disk keyword so dollar this refers to
the element that we are iterating over
and we want to associate focus event
handler and then focus event occurs we
want to execute a function and what do
we want to do when the textbox receives
focus we want to apply this CSS class so
I'm going to say dollar this dot add
class and the name of the class that we
want to add a textbox style and you know
as we are iterating over the elements
not only we want to add focus even
handler we also want to add blur event
handler on blur what we want to do we
want to remove the class and to remove
the class we are going to use remove
class function so pretty straightforward
code there so let's save the changes
reload this page so we should get the
text boxes and the drop-down list
now look at this as soon as the first
name textbox receives focus look at that
in the background color has changed to
green font color is white as soon as the
text box loses focus look at that we
remove the CSS class and that happens
only for the text box controls and not
for the drop-down list because in our
code we are saying we want to change
only or apply this class
remove that class only from the elements
of type text okay so this is how we can
use add and remove classes thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
