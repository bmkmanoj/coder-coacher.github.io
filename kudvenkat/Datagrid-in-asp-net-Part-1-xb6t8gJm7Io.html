venket this is part 1 of a SP dotnet
grid-view tutorial in this video we'll
discuss about the differences between
data grade and creed view controls and
what to choose data grade or criteria
control now data grid control is
introduced in asp.net 1.1 and it is
still supported today whereas grid view
control is introduced in asp.net 2.0 on
my machine at the moment I have Visual
Studio 2010 install now if you're not
sure about the version that's installed
on your machine it's very easy to
identify open visual studio click on
help and then click on about Microsoft
Visual Studio and you should see the
version of Visual Studio that you have
so here I have Microsoft Visual Studio
2010 and then I have dotnet framework
version 4.0 okay so I have an asp.net
web application here which I have
already created and then if I navigate
to the toolbox here look at this I have
some set of standard asp.net controls
under the standard tab and here I can't
find data grid control and then if I
scroll you know to the data tab again
here I can't find my data grid so where
is this data grid control you know it
doesn't appear in my tool box a lot of
users has actually asked this question
it turns out that if you're using Visual
Studio 2008 are later versions by
default data grid control is not shown
in the visual studio toolbox if you want
the data grid control to appear in
Visual Studio toolbox there are three
simple steps to follow so flip to Visual
Studio so this is my toolbox here now
let's say for example I want the data
grid control to appear under data tab
then right click you know on the data
tab and then select choose items now
within choose toolbox items dialog box
navigate to data grid actually you
should find two data grids there so here
we can see two data grids and if you
look at this data grid the second one
it's actually present internationally
called system dot Windows or dot forms
so obviously this is a data grid that
belongs to Windows application
development
but we want a data grid that is required
for an asp.net web application so I'm
going to use the one which is present in
system web assembly so check that and
click ok so now we should have data grid
displayed under data tab okay so we have
the data grid and we also have grid view
control okay now did a grid in grid view
control if if if we want to display node
tabular data that's present in a sequel
server database or an XML document then
we can use either of these controls but
then keep in mind data grid is
introduced in asp.net 1.1 and grid view
is a relatively new control which is
introduced in asp.net
2.0 okay now let's say for example I
want to display some data on this grid
view control how do I do that now there
are several ways to display data in a in
a data grid or a grid view control but
then today let's see you know how to use
some of the declarative data source
controls that were introduced in dotnet
2.0 now here you can see some data
source controls like XML data source
sequel data source and then object data
source you know all these are called as
declarative data source controls we'll
be talking about them in a great detail
in the upcoming videos but then let's
use sequel data source for the time
being let me drag and drop this on to
the web form now here I have sequence of
a management studio in this you know I
have this database called sample where I
have this table TBL products let's say
for example I want to display this data
within a grid view control obviously we
can write you know manually write ad or
that code to do that but I can also use
these declarative data source controls
to do that okay so I have this
declarative data source control which is
called as sequel data source control now
I click on this icon here and then look
at this I have the smart tag configured
data source so once I click this
configure data source look at this
configure data source window appears now
I can create a new connection to sequel
server if I want otherwise actually at
the moment if you look at in my web
config file I already have a connection
string here and if you look at the name
of the kind
since trinkets called DB connection
string and it's pointing to the sequel
server that's installed on my local
machine and I'm using Windows
authentication here okay so now let's
flip back to that web form click on that
sequel data source and then click on
configure data source now look at this
drop-down list here that shows the
connection string that I already have in
my web config file now if you don't have
a connection string defined you can
create a new connection if you want okay
so since I already have a connection
string I'm going to select that and then
obviously that shows the connection
string that we have in the web config
file and then click Next now the sequel
data source is going to connect to the
database and then it's going to display
all of the tables that I have in my
database so at the moment we want you
know all the rows from TBL products
table so I'm going to select that and
then I'm going to select all the columns
look at the query here select star from
TBL products if you don't want to use
star you can uncheck that and then
select ID name description' etc okay and
then click Next you can test that query
if you want so test query that should
display all the rows from that sequence
of a database table click finish now
look at this what we have done so far is
we have configured a control called
sequel data source control we have told
it to which database to connect to and
and from which table to retrieve the
data from and then we have done that
using the designer so if I flip it to
the source mode you can actually see
that it's actually a control called
sequel datasource
we just caught an ID of sequel
datasource one run at is equal to server
just like any other standard asp.net
control and look at the connection
string so connection strings door you
know : DB connection string that's the
connection string that we have in our
web config file so this connection
string that tells the sequel data source
control to connect to which database and
then look at the Select command select
ID name description from TBL
cross-products okay so this sequel data
source control nav knows to connect to
the database and then retrieve data from
that
table and then all we have to do at this
time is let's say for example I want to
display this data within a data grid
control so let me go ahead and drag and
drop the data grid control on to the
webform so I have this data grid control
here and then if I click on this icon
here and then look at this there is a a
drop-down list here choose data source
and then once I click the drop-down list
I have my sequel data source control so
now I am associating the sequel data
source control with this data grid
control okay so I select that look at
this the moment I select that you know
this data grid control knows that you
know ID name and description columns are
returned back by the sacral data source
control look at this it shows the name
of the columns already okay now look at
this there are three things here we have
the sequence of a database table we have
the sequel data source control in
between and then the grid we control
itself that I mean sorry the data grid
control so this data grid control is
actually presenting the data to the
end-user and then this data grid control
doesn't communicate directly with the
database instead it talks to signal data
source and sequel data source control
knows how to connect to the database
execute command and retrieve data okay
so let's go ahead and run this now and
see what's going to happen so obviously
when this waveform renders you know this
data grid control should actually
display the data from that table
look at that ID name description I have
those four rows and if we click on the
source all we have done here is you know
data grid we have an ID and run this
equals server and data sewells ID is
equal to sequel data source one pretty
simple now if I want to display the same
data in a grid view control how do I do
that let me drag and drop a grid we
control onto the waveform and then
obviously look at this is exactly
similar I click on this smart tasks
button and then choose data source and
then here again I see you know sequel
data source one I select that look at
that you know again the grid view
control detects these are the three
columns that are returned by sequel data
source control now when the wave form
renders you should see the same day
in data grid as philosophically to be
control okay so either its grid view
control or data grid both of these
controls know how to work with this
declarative data source controls but
keep in mind declarative data source
controls can be used with data grid only
for data selection but tasks like paging
sorting deletes and updates must be done
we know in code manually but the grid
view control can achieve all of these
using the declarative data source
control so grid view works best that
with these data source controls then you
know data grid control and again another
point to keep in mind is that grid view
introduces new column types so if you
look at you know data grid control for
example obviously the column types if
you look at that you know the columns
there are only a very few columns in a
bound column button column edit command
hyperlink template but then on the other
hand if you look at the grid view
control it has got more column types so
there are more more column types than
data grid control not only these column
types even grid view control introduces
some new events as well and it gives you
more flexibility so the obvious next
question is what to choose data grid or
grid view control now if you are using
asp.net 2.0 or later I personally
suggest to use video control over data
grid control because it's more flexible
it's more advanced than data grid
control now if you are wondering why is
data grid control still there in spite
of having this grid view control that's
because for maybe backward compatibility
but if I'm using a spirit 2.0 or later
versions then there's no reason why I
want to actually use data grid control
or will good view control on this slide
