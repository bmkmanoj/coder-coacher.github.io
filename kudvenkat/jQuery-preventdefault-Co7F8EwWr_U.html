this video we'll discuss how to prevent
browser default action using jQuery
first let's look at some of the browser
default actions when you right-click on
a web page by default the browser
displays the context menu
similarly when you click on a hyperlink
by default the browser navigates to the
page specified in the length let's see
how to disable some of these browser
default actions first let's look at
disabling right-click we discussed how
to do this using raw JavaScript in part
43 of JavaScript tutorial in this video
we'll discuss how to do the same using
jQuery it is what we want to do we have
a page with some text on it now every
time we right-click on this page we
don't want the context menu to appear
and then we want to display this message
saying right click disable so we want to
do this every time we right-click on the
page so let's see how to achieve this
using jQuery let's flip to visual studio
so here we have an h3 element with the
message which says right-click disabled
on this page try to right-click and see
what happens and then we have a div
element and this is the div element
within which we want to display this
message right click disable and within
our scripts section we have the ready
function wired up so here I'm going to
used all of this and then I'm going to
use jQuery on function and then the
event name is going to be context menu
and we want to execute this anonymous
function when that event is triggered
now look at this when we want to
associate a click event handler we
specify the name of the event as click
now when we right click on a webpage the
even that is triggered is context menu
so basically here we are saying when we
right-click on a webpage we want to call
this anonymous function so this is the
even handler for context menu event so
when that event is triggered this
function gets called so this is the
event handler to this even handler let's
pass the event object and what do we
want to do with that event object we
want to call prevent default function so
what is this prevent default function
going to do this
going to prevent the default action from
happening so when we right-click on a
web page it's going to prevent the
context menu from appearing and after we
have done that we also want to display
this message right-click disabled within
the development and this development has
got an ID
they've result so here let's find that
development by ID and let's append this
message right click disable and let's
also append an HTML break so next time
and we right-click on the page this
message right-click disabled will be
appearing on a new line so let's save
those changes reload this page and look
at this every time I write like first of
all notice we don't have the context
menu appearing and then we get that
message rightly disabled displayed
within the development when I
right-click again we get the same
message you know every time we do it we
get that message right-click disabled
appended to the div element let's look
at another example now let's see how to
prevent the browser from navigating to
the page specified in the link when we
click on a hyperlink so here we have an
hyperlink with ID my hyperlink and the
href is said to presume techcom now
usually when we click on that hyperlink
you know we will be redirected to
presume techcom web site that's the
default action but let's see how to
prevent that default action so when we
click on the hyperlink we don't want the
user to be redirected to presume techcom
and we want to display this message
saying hyperlink default action
prevented so let's see how to achieve
that so instead of this h3 element let's
include an anchor element let's give it
an ID let's call this my hyperlink and
let's set the href attribute to HTTP
colon four slash four slash presume
techcom and let's display a message here
saying clicking here does not take you
to presume techcom
all right so here this hyperlink has got
an ID so let's find the hyperlink
element by ID and the ID of the
hyperlink is my hyperlink and on click
of the hyperlink so the event here is
going to be click event so when we click
on this hyperlink we want to call this
anonymous function and to this function
we are passing the event object and on
that event object they are calling
prevent default so that's going to
prevent the default action of the
hyperlink so upon clicking hyperlink now
we will not be redirected to this URL
that default action is prevented and
then within the development we want to
display this message hyperlink default
action prevented so hyperlink
default action prevented so let's save
the changes reload this page and look at
this when I click on the hyperlink
I'm not redirected to play I'm tech calm
and every time we click on the hyperlink
we get that message hyperlink default
action prevented appended to that
development thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
