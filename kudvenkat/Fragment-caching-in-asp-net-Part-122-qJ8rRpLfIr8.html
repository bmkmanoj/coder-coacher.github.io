am venket this is part one to do of
asp.net video tutorial in this video
we'll discuss about fragment caching in
asp.net we discussed the basics of
caching in parts 119 to 121 please watch
these parts from the asp.net tutorial
before proceeding with this video
caching parts of a webform is called as
partial of fragment caching in a web
application development there might be
scenarios where most parts of the web
page changes but a specific section of
the page is static and let's say that
specific section also takes a long time
to load then this is an ideal scenario
where fragment caching can be used for
example let's say I have a web form
where we are displaying you know company
events on company news along with some
other information that's free that
frequently changes along with that
information we are also displaying let's
say this passed at 10 years total sales
by product line
ok now since this is past 10 years sales
data this is unlikely to change
frequently
and moreover obviously if I have to
compare I mean compute the past 10 years
total sales just imagine how much time
it's going to take depending on the
volume of data that's there in the
database it could take at least a few
seconds obviously for the query to
process you know since it's taking a
little time it adds up to the page load
time okay and since this data is not
bound to change obviously this is an
ideal candidate for caching ok but look
at the scenario on this platform we
don't want to cache everything we only
want to cache that section which
displays this total sales but all the
other sections you know they have to be
reprocessed every time we load that
waveform so how do we cache only that
specific portion of the waveform using
fragment caching ok so how do we achieve
fragment caching there are three simple
steps and capsulate that specific
section of the page in our case this
past 10 year to total sales by product
line you know into a user control and
then we use the output cache directive
on the user control to specify our cache
settings and finally we'll drag and drop
that you
control on the webform but on the bed
form itself we do not specify any cash
settings since we have specified the
output cash directive on the user
control only that user control will be
cashed let's look at this in action now
we will be using a table called at TBL
products in our example and this table
is going to contain ID name and product
description columns and it also has some
sample data so select star from TBL
products so there are four rows which
are produced using this insert script
here and obviously I also have the
stored procedure SP get products and if
you look at the stored procedure
it simply retrieves all the rules from
that particular table since there are
only four rows obviously the query
completes in less than a second but
let's introduce some artificial query
processing time and to do that we can
make use of you know wait for delay in
sequel server so wait for delay and we
can specify time how much time you want
to block the execution of this stored
procedure in my case let's say I want to
block it for 0 hours 0 minutes and 5
seconds so let's alter the stored
procedure and if we execute the stored
procedure now it's going to take at
least 5 seconds why because we are
intentionally blocking that using this
wait for delay ok look at that
as soon as 5 seconds is completed we get
the data back alright now let's go ahead
and invoke this stood procedure in an
asp.net web application now remember we
want to encapsulate you know this data
into a user control so obviously in our
asp.net web application project let's go
ahead and add the user control so add
new item and I want to add a web user
control and I'm going to call this you
see products control because this is
going to display product related
information ok so what are we going to
do here we are going to invoke this
stored procedure and display this
product data on this user control and
just to speed things up I have the HTML
already typed in for that user control
and if you look at the design of this
user control it's pretty simple and
straight
forward all I have here is you know one
two three and four TRS so there are four
table rows you know I have created a
table with style is equal to I have set
border the table border as one pixels
solid black that's why you see a border
around the table and then in the first
row we have that static text products
user control that's the heading that you
can see their products user control and
then I have a grid view control in the
next TD in the next TR I have the grid
view control and in the third TR we are
displaying the server side at time so
user control server time that's the
static text and we have a label control
here to display the server side time and
then finally in the last row we have the
static text user control time and then
we are using Java Script obviously to
print the client time okay so we are
using the Java Script date function to
retrieve the client side date date and
time and then we are using document dot
write obviously to print that to the
browser all right so that's the simple
UI design I'll have this HTML posted on
my blog so if you want to copy it I mean
you can copy it from there obviously in
the page load what we want to do we want
to set the label one text to the current
date and time so date time dot now dot
two strings so this will retrieve the
current date and time and display that
within this label one control okay and
the next thing that we want to do is we
want to call the stored procedure
execute that and then retrieve the
result and displayed within this grid
view control obviously to do that we
need to write a bit of a do dotnet code
and we have discussed about ad or dotnet
in the area dotnet video tutorial so if
you haven't watched that I would
strongly recommend you to do so before
proceeding with this video and again to
speed things up I have this a do or
dotnet code already okay so in the page
load I'm going to create you know the
connection string obviously
configuration manager
connection these are present in their
own namespaces so we need to import some
namespaces here system data and system
configuration because configuration
manager class is present in system
configuration and finally system data
dot sequel client that should get rid of
all the compilation errors there so we
are reading the connection string from
web config file so let's quickly check
in web config file if we have the
connection string there so the
connection string here it's DB
connection string so let me copy the
name of the connection string and paste
it here so we are reading that
connection string into this variable and
using that variable we are creating the
sequel connection object sequel data
adapter and we are calling the stored
procedure SP get products this is the
stored procedure SP get products and we
are specifying into the command type is
stored procedure and creating a data set
filling the data set with you know the
data from the stored procedure and
finally setting the data set is the data
source for the grid we control and call
the data bind method pretty simple and
straightforward okay so now look at this
we didn't specify any cache settings on
the user control at the moment okay so
let's go ahead and specify the cache
settings how do we specify cache
settings using the output cache
directive so I can go ahead and use the
output cache directive there and the
output cache director has got two
mandatory attributes one is the duration
so let's say I want to cache this
waveform maybe for 30 seconds and
another one is vary by pattern so for
now I'm going to set vary by param to
none okay so we specified the output
cache settings on the user control all
that is left out is use this user
control on a web form because since we
have specified the cache settings here
you know this waveform I mean this this
user control is going to be cached all
right so let's flip to the web form now
let's say on this waveform I want to use
that user control so let's save
everything
drag and drop that user control onto the
waveform actually let's flip to the
design mode and then drag and drop it so
that it gets added properly so we have
the user control there okay so the
register directive is added and then we
have the user control here now let me
design this waveform I have the HTML
here so on the web form let's copy and
paste this HTML again I will have this
HTML and code available on my blog just
in case if you want to follow the
example along with me okay
so again if you look at this this is a
pretty simple design all we are doing
here is we have a table here and within
the table we have one two three and four
PRS okay in the first tier and what we
are doing we are having the static text
page content that changes so basically
if you look at this waveform you know
let's say we might have some data that
frequently changes here you know at all
these locations and this is the user
control which we dragged and dropped on
the webform so if you look at this in
the last TR I have the user control okay
and in the TR about the user control we
are printing the page client time the
client time on the web form okay so
that's using the JavaScript and document
dot write method and then page server
time that's the static text there and we
have a label control on this platform to
display the page time the page the bed
forms server time and similarly this is
the static text on the page on the top
row okay so simple waveform design
so obviously the one last thing that we
have to do in on this waveform is we
have a label control baby want to
display the current date and time so
let's go and display that using
date/time dot now and let's convert that
to string all right so let's browse this
waveform so that's where form one dot
aspx so let's run this plus control f5
remember
the first time this platform loads it's
going to take at least five seconds why
because we haven't introduced that
artificial late and say I mean query
processing time in the stored procedure
using wait for delay okay so when the
webform loads up
notice the times page server time twenty
twenty one fifty one and the client-side
time is twenty twenty one fifty eight
and notice the user control server time
twenty twenty one fifty one and twenty
twenty one fifty eight that's because
you know the query processing took that
six to seven seconds and that's why the
difference between the server-side time
and client ID and client times between
the user control on the webform but now
since this is going to be cached for the
next 30 seconds look at this when i
refresh pay attention to user control
server time it's cached at twenty twenty
one fifty one that time is not going to
change but rest of all the data and
times will change so let's see that look
at this for some reason it is still
processing that may be that thirty
seconds is elapsed but now let's quickly
refresh
look at that the client-side time the
paid server-side time and the plate
client time and the user control client
time all keeps changing but the user
control server time doesn't change look
at that so this time is going to change
when thirty seconds elapsed is currently
at the moment the time is twenty twenty
three then when this becomes you know so
look at that
thirty seconds is over it's now
processing it's taking five seconds look
at the time twenty twenty three twenty
twenty three twenty eight seconds and
now if i refresh this once again all the
times change but the user control server
time does not change because that code
is not reprocessed okay but
so now let's discuss about the shade
attribute of the output cache directive
now look at this on this waveform we are
using this user control okay it's
possible that I can use this user
control on many different web forms as
well let's say for for example in my web
application I have 10 to 15 waveforms
and on all these platforms I'm using
this user control now by default what
happens is asp.net caches a separate
response for each waveform that uses a
cached user control so obviously if I
have 10 waveforms and on all the 10
waveforms I am using this products user
control then there are going to be 10
responses for this user control you know
stored in the cache
one for each waveform now since all the
pages are displaying the same data
there's no point in caching 10 responses
I want a single cached response to be
shared by all the waveforms so how do I
do that all you need to do is set cached
attribute I mean shade attribute to true
that's what is the significance of this
attribute shade attribute can be used
with output cache directive to cache a
single response from a user control for
use on multiple waveforms
okay now this shade attribute is
available for the output cache directly
only when it's used on the user control
when when we try to set you know the
shade attribute when I use the output
cache directive on the waveform look at
that and I select output cache directive
and if I try to select shared look at
that intelligence doesn't show that up
so it's not applicable when the output
cache directive is used on the web form
it's only applicable when the output
cache directive is used on a user
control so here I can set the shared
attribute to true let's not set the
shade attribute to true let me actually
copy this entire HTML and let's go to
waveform to
and let's paste it there and then in the
code-behind file of this lay we want to
set the label text or label one dot text
is equal to date/time dot now dot to
string all right and obviously we need
to have the registered director for the
user control on waveform 2 as well so
let's copy that and paste that on
waveform to okay now let's go to the
excess perform one dot aspx so obviously
this will take five seconds to load and
then let me copy that URL as soon as
that waveform loads we'll try to
navigate to waveform two dot aspx and
see how long is that going to take okay
look at that that's loaded now if I
press ENTER it's going to refresh
quickly because there is a cache
response now let's try to navigate to
waveform two dot aspx and look at this
this is going to take additional five
seconds for some reason we don't have
the user control there let's go ahead
and see if there is user control on
waveform two dot aspx
so we don't have that user control so
let's actually copy the HTML from
webform one and paste that on webform
too let's delete that let's place that
there yeah okay
now the cash flow webform one might have
already been expired so let's run the
form one once again plus control f5 that
should load a platform one dot aspx it's
going to take five seconds and then
immediately when that loads up
okay so we have webform one dot aspx let
me refresh that look at that only the
server's paid civil side time client
page client time and user client time
changes but not the user control silver
time let's navigate to waveform two dot
aspx and notice that this is going to
take another five seconds to load but on
the other hand look at this this
waveform loads immediately look at that
that's because look at this so if you
look at this web form this user control
is is cached at twenty twenty eight
fifteen and this is cached at twenty
twenty seven fifty three okay so
basically you know if I have ten
different waveforms and I use the same
web you know user control on all these
ten different forms then there are going
to be ten different responses cached in
the memory but I don't want that I want
to use the same cached response on all
the waveforms I want to share that among
all web forms to do that all we need to
do is set the shade attribute to true so
let me set the shade attribute to true
here and see the behavior so shade is
equal to true save that let's close all
this let's copy that URL
so let's run this obviously van webform
1 loads it's going to take five seconds
but when we try to navigate to waveform
two it loads instantly okay so we are
there on webform one let me copy the URL
let's go to waveform two dot aspx look
at that it immediately loads and look at
the cached date and time twenty twenty
nine twenty two and look at the time
here twenty twenty nine twenty two so
it's using the both the waveforms we're
from one and waveform two are sharing
the single cached response of that user
control alright on the slide you can
