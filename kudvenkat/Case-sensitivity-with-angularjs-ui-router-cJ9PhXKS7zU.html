in this video we'll discuss how to make
routes that are configured using
ui-router case-insensitive by default
the routes that are configured using
ui-router a case sensitive let's prove
this at the moment we are on the home
page look at the URL for slash home all
the letters are in lower case and
everything works as expected now let's
change all this to uppercase and look at
this when I hit enter the first time the
app does not react for some reason and
nothing happens but then when I click in
the address bar once again and then when
I hit enter look at that the app reacts
and nothing is displayed in the layout
view that's basically because by default
the routes that are configured using
ui-router a case sensitive to make
routes case insensitive all you have to
do is inject Dollar URL match a factory
provided service into the config
function and then call its case
insensitive function and pass it a value
of true let's look at this in action
let's flip to visual studio so I'm going
to inject Dollar URL matcher
factory provider service into the
convict function and then call its case
insensitive function and pass it a value
of true with ng wrote module we use a
different service and that's dollar
route provided service and then we set
its case insensitive match property to
true to make routes case insensitive but
at the moment we are using UI router so
we don't need this line so I'm going to
delete that let's save our changes and
look at this when I reload this app it
works as expected so whether your routes
are in lowercase or uppercase or a
combination of both they are still going
to work is expected let's quickly try
with courses so when I click on courses
look at the URL it's all in lowercase
which working is expected now let's
change this to uppercase and then when I
hit enter the first time nothing happens
let's click in the address bar once
again and then
when I hit enter look at that it still
works is expected thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
