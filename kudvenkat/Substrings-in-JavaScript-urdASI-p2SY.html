in this video we'll discuss different
methods that are available in JavaScript
that can be used to retrieve a substring
from a given string these are the three
methods that can be used to retrieve a
substring the functionality of all these
three methods is almost identical I'm
not really sure why we have so many
methods to do the same thing if you know
the reason please feel free to leave
that as a comment now first look at this
substring method this method has two
parameters start and end in fact Visual
Studio intellisense will show us the
names of those two parameters so here we
have the string variable strname and
notice that the moment we open the
bracket it shows the names of those two
parameters start end start parameter is
required and it specifies the position
away to start the extraction and
parameter is optional and it specifies
the position way to end the extraction
the character at the end position is not
included in the substring we'll look at
an example in just a bit if the end
parameter is not specified all the
characters from the start position till
the end of the string are extracted the
interesting thing is if the value of
start parameter is greater than the
value of the n parameter then this
method is going to automatically swap
those two parameters meaning start
parameter will be used as an parameter
and end parameter will be used as a
start parameter let's look at a few
examples now so here within this
variable STR we have the string
JavaScript tutorial and on that variable
we are calling the substring method
notice that they are passing zero as the
starter ammeter and 10 as the end
parameter now the index position within
a string starts at zero that means at
index position 0 we have this letter J
and at index position 1 we have this
letter A so on and so forth so basically
we are telling we want to start at index
position 0 that is at letter J and we
want to end the extraction at index
position 10 so if you look at this
javascript word it has got 10 characters
in it since we are starting at index
position
zero this letter T is present at index
position nine and this whitespace is
present at index position ten so
basically the N parameter is ten that
means and the substring extraction at
that index position so the character
that is present at the end parameter
will not be included in the substring
that means within the output will get
JavaScript word now in this example
notice that start parameter is greater
than the n parameter now if that's the
case this substring method is going to
automatically swap those two parameters
meaning it's now going to use zero as
the start parameter and ten as the end
parameter so we will end up with the
same output now let's look at sub STR
method again this method is very
identical to substring method again this
method has got two parameters they are
named slightly differently from
substring method but substring method
the parameters are named start and end
with sub STR they are named
start and count so just like substring
method start parameter specifies the
position way to start the extraction and
it's a required parameter count
parameter is optional and it specifies
the number of characters to extract now
on the internet you might find you know
on some of the articles you know this
second parameter will be named as length
parameter now irrespective of however it
is named you know it specifies the
number of characters that you want
within the substring now if the count
parameter is not specified all the
characters from the start position till
the end of the string are extracted if
count is 0 or negative then obviously we
will get an empty string back let's look
at a few examples of using sub STR
method so again within that STR variable
we have that string JavaScript tutorial
and we are using the substring method
here and we are saying the start
position is 0 so start at letter J and
then give me ten characters if you look
at this javascript word it has got ten
characters within that so
@j give me ten characters so that's
going to return this word JavaScript now
in this example notice that we are not
specifying the count parameter because
just like substring method the second
parameter is optional even with sub STR
method so when we don't specify the
count parameter it's going to start the
substring extraction at index position
11 and at index position 11 we have this
letter T so start the extraction of that
position and give me all the characters
of that so it's going to return us this
word tutorial now if you have any other
characters after L that is maybe three
exclamation marks you will get them SL l
in the output now let's look at this
lysed method again just like the other
two methods this method also has got two
parameters and just like substring
method the parameters of this method are
also named start and end start parameter
is required and it is by the position
where the extraction should start and
parameter is optional and it specifies
the position where the extraction should
end the character at the end position is
not included in the substring so this is
almost identical to substring method if
the end parameter is not specified then
all the characters from the start
position till the end of the string are
extracted let's look at a few examples
of this method so here we are calling
the slice method and we are saying
started in X position 0 and you know the
end parameter is stand so and at that
position at 10 we have whitespace so
this is going to return exactly the same
output as substring method in this case
we are not specifying the end parameter
so we are basically telling start at
position 11 and give me all the
characters in the string so that's going
to return this word tutorial now let's
look at the difference between these
methods so what's the difference between
sub STR &amp;amp; substring methods the
difference for these two methods is in
the second parameter the second
parameter of substring method specifies
the index position where the extraction
should stop the character at the end
position
is not included in the substrain the
second parameter of sub STR method it's
named as count or length and that method
specifies the number of characters to
return another difference is sub STR
method does not work in ie8 and earlier
versions so if you want support in those
browsers then it is better to use
substring over sub STR method now let's
look at the difference between slice and
substring these methods are almost
identical except for one difference that
one difference is if start parameter is
greater than stop parameter then
substring will swap those two parameters
whereas slice method is not going to
swap them another method that is very
useful when extracting sub a substring
from a given string is index of method
so this method returns the position of
the first occurrence of a specified
value in a string if the specified value
is not present then -1 is returned to
indicate that you know that specified
value does not exist within the given
string so here is an example so within
this variable we have got an email
address ok and what we are doing here is
we are using the index of method and we
are saying we want the index of this at
character within that index and
obviously we know the index position
start at 0 so PR a gim so m is at index
position 5 so the @ symbol is present at
index position 6 in our next video we'll
discuss a simple real time example of
where we can use this index of method
and substring methods and do something
interesting thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
