tutorial in this video well disk is
creating a drop-down menu using
bootstrap let us understand this with an
example here is what we want to do when
we click on this link which says
drop-down that's when we want the
drop-down menu to appear when I click on
that again we want the drop-down menu to
disappear let's see how to achieve this
let's flip to visual studio the first
thing that I'm going to do here is
create a development and set its class
to drop-down so basically this class
specifies that we are creating a
drop-down menu and within this
development the first thing that we need
is this anchor element in our case the
central element is the trigger element
so what's a trigger element trigger
element is the one which when we click
either the drop-down menu appears or
disappears so in our case the trigger
element is the central element so let's
create that anchor element so within the
div element I am going to create an
anchor element and set its class to
drop-down toggle this class is required
on a trigger element and we need another
thing on this anchor element and that is
data
- toggle attribute I am going to set
this data - toggle attribute to drop
down this attribute is required on the
trigger element to either show or hide
the drop down menu so on this anchor
element in our case which is the trigger
element we need these two things class
set to drop-down toggle and data -
toggle attribute set to drop-down and
then we obviously need to display the
text for our drop-down so for now let's
display drop down and then we need this
little triangle that's pointing
downwards to get this little triangle
that's pointing downwards I'm going to
use this pan element and set its class
to carrot so basically this pan element
that that class is going to display that
downward pointing arrow finally we need
to build the drop-down menu items and to
do that we use an unordered list so I'm
going to use an unordered list here
and I'm going to set its class to
drop-down menu so this class specifies
that we are building the drop-down menu
items so within the unordered list let's
build the menu items themselves and for
that I'm going to use a list item and
within this list item I'm going to
create an anchor element for now I'm
going to set its href attribute to a
hash symbol but you can point it to any
valid URL you want and then the text for
the menu item is going to be action 1
similarly let's build two more menu
items so the second one says action two
third one say is action 3 all right so
let's save our changes and when we
reload this page notice we get a link
which says drop down with that little
downward pointing arrow when I click on
that the menu shows up and I click on
that again the menu disappears so here
we have a Anchor drop down here is the
HTML required and the classes and the
purpose at the moment what we have here
is a hyperlink drop down the triggering
element here is a hyperlink now instead
of a hyperlink drop down like this we
want a button drop down that looks like
this so here the triggering element is a
button to get a button drop down all we
have to do is replace this anchor
element where a button element let's
reload this page notice we get the
button drop down as expected and here is
the HTML required for that at the moment
we haven't applied any of the boot share
button classes on this button element
and that's why it's using the browser
defaults let's apply would share button
classes I'm going to apply BTN and BTN
primary classes let's reload this page
notice now the bootstrap button styles
are applied and here is the HTML
required for that
the next thing that we want to do is
create a drop-down menu header notice
here we have three actions action one
action - action 3 and these actions have
got their own header which says header 1
similarly at the bottom we have three
more actions again these three actions
has their own header to create these
headers all we have to do is create a
list item with its class set to
drop-down header let's look at this in
action let's flip to visual studio so we
have three actions here we want a header
for them so I'm going to create a list
item and set its class to drop-down
header and the text for this header is
going to be header 1 let's bold this
text and to do that I'm going to include
a strong element so let's make a copy of
these list items and let's change the
text here to header two let's save our
changes reload this page notice now we
have two headers you cannot select the
headers you can only select the menu
items under those headers and here is
the HTML required for that let's now
discuss how to create a menu divider
notice here we have a divider between
the first set of actions and the second
set of actions to create this menu
divider all we have to do is create a
list item with its class set to divider
let's look at this in action so we want
to divide it between these two set of
actions so I'm going to insert a list
item here and set its class to divider
let's save all changes reload this page
notice now we have a divider between the
first and second set of actions and here
is the HTML required for that next let's
discuss how to disable a menu item to
disable a menu item all we have to do is
use disabled class on that respect to
menu item let's disable ax
- from both header 1 and header 2 let's
flip to visual studio so here we have
action 2 under header 1 so on this list
item I'm going to use disabled class
let's do the same thing with action 2
under header 2 let's say what changes
reload our page notice now action 2
under header 1 action - under header 2
both of them are disabled as expected
and look at the third style the cursor
style changes to a stop sign indicating
that this menu item is disabled and
cannot be selected is the HTML for that
finally let's discuss how to create a
drop-down menu whose items expand
upwards at the moment when we click on
this drop down the menu items expand
downwards instead we want them to expand
upwards to achieve this I'm going to cut
all this drop down HTML I'm going to
create another development and paste the
drop down HTML inside that development
and on this outer development I'm going
to use drop up class instead of drop
down let's save all changes reload this
page now notice the little triangle
points upwards and when I click on that
the drop down menu items expand upwards
we don't have enough room on the top so
let's include a few break elements here
let's see what changes reload the page
now look at that we have the menu items
expanding upwards instead of downwards
is the HTML for that thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
