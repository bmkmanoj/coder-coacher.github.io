tutorial in this video and in the next
few videos well discus form validation
in angular with simple examples
well discuss validating text boxes
checkboxes radio buttons drop-down lists
etc we'll also discuss how to fix one of
the common error that we get when
exporting ng model directive into a
local template variable the error that
we get is this cannot assign to a
reference available
well discuss what causes this error and
how to fix it
to understand form validation in angular
we need to understand these three sets
of properties touched untouched pristine
dirty valid and invalid these six
properties are available at an each
individual form control level and also
at the entire form level so first let's
look at these properties in action at an
individual form control level notice
this full name input field we made this
field required by including this
required attribute required is html5
validation attribute basically this
attribute specifies that this full name
field is required in addition to
required
we have many other html5 validation
attributes like Max land pattern min Max
etc to learn more about these html5
validation attributes visit this URL
right here
I'll have this link available both in
the description of this video as well as
on my blog we will discuss most of these
attributes with examples in our upcoming
videos the point to keep in mind is
Angela uses these html5 validation
attributes for validating form fields
and displaying validation error messages
now we already know about this ng model
directive this directive provides
two-way data-binding that is it keeps
this full name input field and its
corresponding property full name in the
component class in sync now what I'm
going to do is expose this ng model
directive into your local template
reference variable and the way we do
that is like this first we create a
variable and we use the hash
and then let's call this variable full
name and I'm going to export
ngmodel directive into this local
template reference variable called full
name now different people call this
variable with different names some
people simply call it local variable
some people call it template variable
and some people call it local template
reference variable at this point let's
save all changes and then take a look at
the browser notice we don't have
anything displayed in the web page at
the moment we are on a console tab and
look at the error that we have cannot
assign to a reference a variable first
let's understand what's causing this
error if we take a look at the template
here we have said the name attribute to
full name and ng-model
also to full name and we know what this
is going to do the angler generated for
model is going to automatically create a
property with full name and that
property keeps track of whatever we type
into this full name input field and look
at what we are doing here we are also
creating a local template reference
variable with the same name full name
hence we get this error we cannot assign
to a reference or variable so basically
this is complaining that we cannot
assign this ngmodel directive to our
reference or a variable there is already
a variable called full name so we cannot
assign this ng model directive again to
that variable there are two ways we can
fix this error one way is by using our
own model instead of the angular
auto-generated form model now if you
recollect from our previous videos we
already have a model for employee and
that is present in this file employee
dot model dot tears well discuss using
this employee model instead of the
angler auto-generated phone model in our
upcoming videos now the other way to fix
this error is by giving our local
template reference variable a different
name other than full name so let's call
this full name control instead of full
name notice we have the form displayed
as expected and we don't have any
validation errors now we are going to
use this local
played reference variable full name
control to access those three sets of
validation properties touched untouched
dirty pristine valid and invalid so just
below this full name input field let's
create another development and first we
want to display touch property value so
touch testers display text here and then
we are going to use interpolation and
let's use this template reference
variable full name control and on that
we can use the touch property like that
and we'll be able to see whether if this
full name control is touched or not and
similarly to access the untouched
property first let's change the display
text to untouched and the property name
is untouched notice we have touched an
untouched properties below the full name
field let's zoom in a bit notice the
full name field is not touched yet so
touch property is false now when I click
within the full name field notice the
touch property is still false these
properties change only when the
respective field loses focus notice when
I tab out of the full name field the
properties change automatically touched
is now true and untouched is false now
I'm going to paste in some HTML here now
if you notice this HTML this is pretty
straightforward
all we are doing is creating a table and
we are displaying those six validation
properties and their values so let's
save our changes and then quickly take a
look at the browser notice we have the
six validation properties and their
values in a table as expected we already
discussed touched and untouched
properties
now let's discuss pristine and dirty
pristine means the form field has not
been changed whereas 30 means it has
been changed at the moment we have not
changed full name field so pristine is
true and dirty is false so look at what
happens to these two properties when we
change the text within the full name
field so as soon as I start typing look
at what happened to pristine it changed
it to false and dirty changed to true
and even after I delete everything that
I have typed within the full name field
this still pristine it's false and dirty
is true that's because we have changed
the full name field now
let's reset the form by reloading it
again so we can discuss valid and
invalid properties at the moment full
name is a required field and we did not
type anything within the full name field
so valid is false and invalid is true
now look at what happens as soon as I
start typing valid is true and invalid
is false
now we also have these same six
properties at the Forum level now if we
take a look at the form tag notice we
are already exporting the ng form
directive into this local template
reference variable employee form so if
we can use this variable now to access
those six validation properties at the
Forum level so here's what I'm going to
do I'm going to make a copy of this HTML
table and then we will use the employee
form template reference variable to
access the validation properties at the
Forum level so let's copy of our form
level template reference variable which
is employee form and then change the
variable here to employee form instead
of full name control so we can access
the validation properties at the Forum
level and let's also change the text
here to employee form instead of full
name notice we have the validation
properties both at the forum level and
at the full name field level now let's
make our email field also required now
before that between the two tables that
displays the validation properties let's
include an HTML break and then let's
also make this email input field
required by including the html5 required
attribute notice the touched property at
the full name field level and at the
forum level both of them are false now
look at what happens when the full name
field receives focused
when it loses focus touched of the
full-name field becomes true and the
attached property at the Forum level
also becomes true the same is true for
dirty and pristine properties now let's
take a look at the final set of
validation properties valid and invalid
notice the valid property of full name
field is false and the valid property
the forum level is also false
now look at what happens when we type
something in the full name field the
valid property of the full name field
becomes true but the valid property at
the forum level it still Falls why is
that
that's because remember we made this
email field also required at the moment
email field is not valid hence the form
is not valid and look at what happens as
soon as we type something in the email
field the email field becomes valid so
does the form so all the fields on the
form are valid so the form is also valid
this brings us to a very important
conclusion if all the form fields are
valid then the form itself is valid if
any of the form fields are invalid then
the form is also invalid along the same
lines if we have touched any of the form
field then the form is marked as touch
and along the same lines if any of the
field is dirty then the form is also
marked dirty now we included this HTML
right here to demonstrate validation
properties we don't need these two
tables anymore so to keep our form clean
let's delete that HTML so to check if a
form field is valid first include the
html5 validation attributes such as
required for example on the input field
that you want to validate in our case we
want to validate the full name input
field and we want to make it required so
we're using the html5 required attribute
on that full name field and then export
the ng model directive to a local
template reference variable so in this
case we are exporting the ng model
directive of the full name field into a
local template reference variable with
the name full name control and then
finally we can use this local template
reference variable to access the
three sets of validation properties
touched dirty valid pristine etc to
check if the entire form is valid export
the ng form directive to a local
template reference variable this is very
similar to exporting ng model directive
to a local template reference variable
and then we use that local template
reference variable to access the three
sets of validation properties available
at the Forum level in our next video
we'll discuss how to display validation
error messages thank you for listening
