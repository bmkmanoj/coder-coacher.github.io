wankered in this part we will look at
the common operators in C sharp just
like any other programming language
even C sharp has some common operators
okay and we can actually classify these
operators into assignment arithmetic
comparison conditional ternary and null
coalescing operators so assignment
operators in M C sharp is equal to and
similarly we have several arithmetic
operators like + - etc let's look at a
simple examples on how to use these
operators so we have a simple program
here for example if I create a variable
of type integer you know into I and if I
want to initialize this to a value of 10
I can use the assignment operator equals
so just like C or C++ you use equal 2 to
assign a value to a variable of any type
it could be integer boolie and whatever
for example if it's boolean I will
simply and be equal to true or false
whatever is the value that you want to
initialize that variable to so that's
about the assignment operator single
equals is the assignment operator in
c-sharp where as we have several
arithmetic operators like + - n - and as
the name suggests they do the respective
operation for example if you want to add
two numbers you use the plus sign and
similarly to sub for subtraction you can
use - etc there are these two operators
you know if you have two numbers to
divide and you know when you divide two
numbers you get two results one is the
quotient and the other one is the
reminder okay so if I divide number 10
by 2 I get the quotient as 5 and the
reminder as 0 okay so depending on which
operator you use either for slash if you
use forward slash you get the quotient
which is 5 in our example if you use
percentage you get the remainder which
is 0 in our case so let's do a quick
demo on that so for example if I have a
numerator and let's set that to let's
say 10 and we want to you know add
denominator and let's set that to maybe
two denominator to end result equals
numerator and look at this I am using
the forward slash numerator by
denominator and forward slash will give
us the cushion turn on the reminder so
if I print this result out
console.writeline and let's use the
placeholder syntax to print that so
result we want to just say result equals
result okay so now if we go ahead and
run this
we know if we divide 10 by 2 we get the
cushion that's fine so if you want coach
and use the forward slash on the other
hand if you want reminder use percentage
so this will give us the reminder so 10
divided by 2 is 0 so we get the reminder
so simple arithmetic operators just like
any other programming language plus
minus into 4/4 quotient modulus or
percentage for the reminder and
comparison operators you know we have
already seen single equal to is the
assignment operator but whereas if you
want to compare two numbers then you
have to use double equals for example
let's say I have you know maybe we are
initializing them you call this number
instead of numerator just to give it a
meaningful name so in number is equal to
10 now if I have to compare or if you
have to check in my program if the
number is 10 I can't say if now
equal to10 you can't do that because a
single equals MC sharp having meaning
it's basically used for the assignment
operation and not for comparison if you
want to really compare then you have to
use double equals okay so if you are
using double equals you're you're you
know using the operator for comparison
okay I am checking here is the value of
number ten okay on the other hand if you
want to check for not equal then you use
an exclamation if number not equal to
ten okay and this expression obviously
returns a true false in the number is
ten in this case it will actually return
false because number is equal to ten so
if you want to check for not equal to we
use this one if you want to check for
equal to we use double equals similarly
we have greater than greater than equal
to less than and less than or equal to
again this is very much similar to any
other programming language like C or C++
Java and the other most important
operators that we have in c-sharp or the
conditional operators the and and R okay
so basically if I have to you know check
two conditions then I can use the and
operator if one of the conditions is
satisfied if that's enough then I can
use the odd or operator let's look at an
example for this let's say I have number
I and I have another number
maybe that's let's say set to 20 okay
now if I want the number to be 10 and
another number to be 20 and only then
will I have to do something then I can
say if number is equal to 10 and another
number is equal to 20 so in this case
both the conditions should be satisfied
otherwise you know whatever code that
you have here will not be executed
console.writeline
okay so hello
now since number is ten and another
number is twenty this hello hello will
be printed but otherwise it won't even
if one of the numbers if we set let's
say for example another number to 21 so
obviously another number is not equal to
20 so this condition is Nets not
satisfied so it will not print this one
so if we go ahead and run this it
doesn't print hello there because this
condition is not satisfied but on the
other hand if you use the or operator
the or operator is the pipe symbol so if
I use or operator if any of these
conditions are satisfied then this piece
of code will be executed okay
so in this case number is equal to 10 is
satisfied that's true so it doesn't even
the compiler doesn't even the runtime
and wire and doesn't even want to check
this condition because this is already
true and if one of the conditions is
satisfied you know it can execute this
code so if we go ahead and run this now
so the hello world is printed okay so
conditional and unconditional are if it
is conditional and all the conditions
will be satisfied to enter that block of
code otherwise if it's or one of the
conditions you know if one of the
conditions is satisfied that it's more
than enough
all right the next operator that we
talked about is the ternary operator
which is in a kind of actually very
interesting or greater so let's take a
simple example to understand ternary
operator let's say I have this variable
call number which is equal to 10 what I
want to do is I want another variable
maybe boolean variable is number equal
2:10 or let's assembly is number 10 I
have a boolean variable here now F so
that if number is equal to 10 then I
want to set this variable is number 10
equal to true air else I want to set
that variable to false because it's not
equal to 10 so if you look at here now
we are using the comparison operator we
are using the assignment operator and
finally what I want to do is console dot
write line number is equal to 10 is
whatever true or false and who will let
us know that the variable is number 10
okay so if you look at this program it's
a very simple program int we have
declared an integer variable of type
with a value of 10 and we're checking if
that number is 10 we are assigning this
boolean variable to true otherwise false
and then we are saying number is equal
to 10 is into this placeholder we will
substitute this one if it's true true
otherwise false so now here number is 10
so if we go ahead and run okay number is
equal to 10 is true but on the other
hand if we change the value maybe to 15
number is not equal to 10 so number
equal to 10 is false
now look at this just to check if this
number
is ten or not and initialize this
variable with true or false we are
having so many lines of code but if you
actually use a ternary operator all this
can be done in just one line so if you
look at this one two three four five
lines of code can actually be replaced
by one line if you know how to use
ternary operator so let's see how to use
this ternary operator
so bool is number equal to if number is
equal to ten then return true else
written false it's actually as simple as
that now you can get rid of all these
lines so if you look at this it's a
three line program right now okay so
what we are doing is basically we have
declaring a variable of type is number
10 of type boolean you know and this
variable value should be equal to if
this expression is true then return true
this expression is not true then return
false ok whatever follows question mark
is the true part and whatever follows
the Kulin part is the false part and
that value will be stored here now if I
go ahead and run the output of the
program will be exactly similar except
that we are using the ternary operator
here so that's the ternary operator null
coalescing operator we will talk about
this in a later session when we actually
talk about nullable data types in
c-sharp okay so we need to understand
multiple data types and then we will
talk about alkalizing operator and we
have seen this example in a demo
you know without ternary operator we
have to have so many lines of code but
with the ternary operator the program
size is relatively much smaller you know
