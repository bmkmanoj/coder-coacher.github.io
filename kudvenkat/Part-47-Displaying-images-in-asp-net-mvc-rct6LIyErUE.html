this video we'll discuss displaying
images in an MVC application please
watch part 46 before proceeding we'll be
working with the same example that we
worked with in part 46 now notice that
when we navigate to this details view we
can view an employee's personal details
along with the personal details let's
say we also want to display the
employees photo the parts for this photo
is going to come from this photo column
just in case of the photo that path is
missing then we are going to make use of
this text from this column as the
alternate text so here first of all
let's go ahead and add these two columns
to this table TBL employee let's flip to
sequel management studio notice that at
the moment this table doesn't have those
two columns and this is the secret
script to add those two columns in this
case photo and alternate text let's now
select the data back notice that we have
the two columns but then they are null
obviously now let's go ahead and update
the photo and alternate text column
values for John Smith so this is the
update script
I'll have the sequel script available on
my blog just in case if you need it
notice that the photo for John Smith is
going to be present in photos folder and
where is this photos folder going to be
present notice the symbol here Tilda
/so what is still the indicate till
indicates the Drude directory of our web
application what is the root directory
for our web application here MVC demo so
with an MVC demo we are going to have a
folder with named photos and within that
there's going to be a photo John Smith
dot PNG so let's go ahead and add a new
folder to the fruits folder here and the
name of the folder is going to be photos
and I already have this image John Smith
dot PNG so let me copy that and paste it
into this photos folder so we have the
image now the next step is to update our
ato dotnet entity data models over here
we have sample data model which is again
I mean nothing but the area dot int
entity data model that we have built
based on this table TBL employee and if
you notice this model
this model has got the properties for
all columns except for this - newly
added columns that's photo and alternate
text notice that at the moment we don't
have properties for those two columns so
obviously we need to update this model
and to do that right-click on this and
select update model from database so
this is going to connect to the database
and retrieve all the tables views and
stored procedures click on this refresh
tab and then expand tables select table
TBL employee click finish so this should
add properties for those two columns as
well photo and alternate text
let's save everything and let's build
our solution just to make sure
everything still compiles all right now
notice that at the moment we already
have details we but I'm going to delete
that and regenerate it once again let's
navigate to the home controller and
notice that within the home controller
they're actually path I mean storing
this employee object within view data
but let's delete that and pass this
employee object to the view itself and
now let's add details view the name of
the view is going to be details we're
going to make use of rays of view engine
and let's create a strongly typed view
against employee model class the
scaffold template is going to be details
let's add that so this should add
details view and let's use a div tag and
set style attribute let's set font
family to area
let's get rid of these action links at
the bottom
let's save everything and let's refresh
overview and once this view is refreshed
as you might expect we should display
photo and alternate text properties as
well but look at what's going to happen
instead of rendering the photo it's
actually displaying the photo part
itself okay
so why is that that's because if you
look at the generated view notice that
for the photo property and for alternate
text property you know you're using
display for HTML helper which is
literally going to display the value
that is stored within those two columns
in the database table okay but instead
of displaying the column value we
actually want to render if the photo of
the employee okay and to render images a
photo is nothing but the image so to
render an image we use image right so we
expect an MVC to have something like at
HTML dot image but do we really have
that HTML helper no unfortunately okay
but in our next video we'll discuss
creating this custom image HTML helper
okay but for now to render an image I'm
going to use the image tag itself so
image and obviously to display an image
to render an image we need to specify
the source for the image so where is the
source going to come from the source is
going to come from the photo property of
the model object but then if we look at
this photo property you know whatever we
have stood there is a relative part okay
now we need to somehow convert that
relative part into a URL you know URL
basically and to do that we have another
HTML helper in MVC at URL dot content
this HTML helper is going to take that
relative path which this photo property
is going to return and then it resolves
that to a URL okay for that specific
resource in this case John Smith dot PNG
so that is the source and then the
alternate text just in case of the image
is missing where is the alternate text
going to come from it's going to come
from model dot alternate text property
so we have the image tag right there and
we can get rid of this div tag which is
displaying alternate text because we
don't want to display alternate text we
want alternate text to be set as the
value for this alt attribute you know
for that image all right so with all
these changes let's build our solution
and let's refresh the sphere and notice
that we have the image as expected but
then look at the amount of code that we
have written though this is not hugely
complex but this is still quite a bit of
code to be pleasant in a view so views
are supposed to be as simple as possible
any complicated logic that in the view
need to move in you know into an HTML
helper we want to keep our views as
simple as possible so in our next video
we'll actually develop an HTML helper so
maybe something like image and then we
simply specify the source which is going
to come from you know model dot photo
and the alternate text is going to come
from model dot alternate text so we want
something like this as simple as that
but then for that we need to build this
custom HTML helper which we will be
doing in our next video session all
right on this slide you can find
resources for asp.net c-sharp and
sequence of interview questions that's
it for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
