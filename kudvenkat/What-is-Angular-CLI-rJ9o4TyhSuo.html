in this video we'll discuss what is
angular CLI why should we use angular
CLI and the benefits it provide before
watching this course I strongly
recommend to watch our angular 2
tutorial for beginners course in which
we have discussed all the basics of
angular once you have a good
understanding of the angular basics
it'll be easy for you to get the most
out of this angular CLI course first
let's understand why should we use
angular CLI and what problems it solves
if you have any experience with angular
then you already know manually setting
up an angular application from scratch
is laborious and time-consuming process
there are several steps the first step
is to create the application folder and
add the required configuration files if
you look at the application that we have
been working with throughout angular 2
tutorial for beginners course this is
the folder angular 2 demo is our
application folder and within this
folder we've got several configuration
files the most important one is this
package store JSON file which contains
the angular dependencies and we also
have other configuration files like TS
length dot jason BS config dot jason
well discuss what these configuration
files are and their purpose in our
upcoming videos for now understand that
they first tap to manually set up an
angular application is to create the
application folder and add the required
configuration files next we need to
install all the required packages using
the node package manager so here within
visual studio i have opened that package
dot JSON file and notice here we have
dependencies and dev dependencies all
these packages needs to be installed
using node package manager so this is
our second step next create the root
application component app component so
if you look at this project right here
the root component for this project is
present in this file app component dot
TS and by convention the root component
is called app
component every angular application
should have at least one component which
is the root component and this root
component bootstraps the angular
application next create the root
application module app module so if you
look at this project the root
application module is present in this
file app dot module dot yes and by
convention the root application module
is called app module next create main
tortillas file which is the entry point
or application so if we look at that
file in this project is right here main
dot TS and notice here we have code to
load the root application module at
module so if we look at this app module
notice here we have included our root
application component app component as
part of the bootstrap array by doing
this we are telling angular that the
bootstrapping component is our root
application component app component so
angular creates an instance of this
component and then obviously this
component also has got a view template
so angular is going to insert this HTML
within our application host page which
is index dot HTML so naturally our next
step is to create that in X dot HTML now
the obvious question that comes to our
mind is where with an index dot HTML is
angular going to insert this HTML now if
you look at this component right here or
root component it has this selector my
app and if you look at our index dot
HTML which is right here we're using
that component selector as an HTML tag
right here so within this location of
our root components view template will
be inserted so that's how an angular
application bootstraps and as you can
see manually setting up an angular
application from scratch is time
consuming and laborious not only that
every time we have to create a component
pipe service directive routing guard etc
we'll have to write that same
boilerplate code let me explain what I
mean by boilerplate code for example to
create a component we have to create a
class
expose that decorate this class with at
component decorator and obviously to be
able to use this at component decorator
will have to import it from angular core
so we have to write all this boilerplate
code similarly to create a service we
have to again create a class exported
decorated with at injectable decorator
and we also have to import that
injectable from angular so every time we
have to create a component pipe service
directive routing guard we have to write
all this boilerplate code writing that
same boilerplate code over and over
again is not only monotonous but also
time-consuming and error-prone in a real
world application we will have many
components pipe services directives etc
so just imagine the amount of time be
based writing that same boilerplate code
in a real Val we usually have more than
one developer working on a given angular
project while all these developers are
creating these different files and
writing the required boilerplate code
are they following the angular teams
best practices and conventions what if
the developers are not following them
how do we enforce them well one way to
enforce these is by manual code reviews
manual code reviews are not only
time-consuming
they're also error-prone the other
option is to have some tooling in place
angular CLI is such a tool it helps us
create angular applications components
modules pipes directives services and
much more with great speed and
consistency while still following the
angular team's best practices and
conventions so what is angular CLI
angular CLI is a command-line tool that
helped us create angular applications
faster and with great consistency create
the boilerplate code for angular
features like components directives pipe
services etc we can also create
boilerplate code for typescript features
like classes interfaces ins etc it
follows angular teams best practices and
conventions out-of-the-box run unit and
an
in tears create optimized bills for
deployment of production will see all
these in action in our upcoming videos
no doubt angular CLI will greatly help
us improve our productivity as it can
get an angular app up and running in no
time however to get the most out of this
tutorial and to understand what CLI does
it is better to first learn how to
manually create an angular project from
scratch also learn how to manually
create components pipe services modules
etc once you have a good working
knowledge of how these different pieces
fit together in an angular application
we can then use tools like angular CLI
to boost our productivity otherwise if
there is a problem with a feature
generated by angular CLI then it might
take a very long time to identify what
is wrong and fix it we've got the basics
of angular in our angular 2 course I'll
include the link for the course in the
description of this video in our next
video we'll discuss installing angular
CLI thank you for listening and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
