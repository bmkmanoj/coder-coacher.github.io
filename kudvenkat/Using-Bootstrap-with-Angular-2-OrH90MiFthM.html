tutorial in this video we'll discuss how
to install and use bootstrap with
angular and along the way we'll also
discuss how to enable intelligence to
bootstrap in Visual Studio there are
several options available to install
bootstrap one of the options is by using
node package manager to use node package
manager click on start and then within
the program list look for node dot J's
folder so as we scroll down here we have
the node dot J's folder expand that and
here we have no J's command prompt right
click on that and run it as an
administrator and within the command
prompt navigate to the folder where you
have your angular project our angular
project is present in C Drive in a
folder called angular 2 demo this
dissolution folder and inside that we
have another folder with the same name
angular 2 demo which is our project
folder so let's navigate to that folder
and then here we have to type this
command NPM install we want to install
bootstrap version 3 and bootstrap has a
dependency on jQuery so we are
installing jQuery as well so type this
command right here and then press Enter
notice both bootstrap and jQuery are
installed as you can see we have
bootstrap version 3.3 points and jQuery
version 3.2.40 is to install the node
package manager installs them in the
node modules folder so let's flip over
to visual studio here is the angular
solution that we have been working with
so far in this video series within the
solution Explorer select the angular
project and then the cycle show all
files shows up make sure you select your
angular project and other solution if
you select solution the shawl files icon
will not show up so select your angular
project and then click the second show
all files notice VCD node modules folder
and within this node modules folder as
we scroll down we should see a folder
called bootstrap
into which bootstrap is installed here
is that bootstrap folder and as we
scroll down further we should also see
jQuery folder and that's the folder into
wit jQuery is installed here is the
jQuery folder now let's take a look at
package dot JSON file with Nava angular
project here is the package dot JSON
file and if you look at the dependencies
property notice it is automatically
updated with dependencies on bootstrap
and jQuery notice we have a dependency
and bootstrap version 3.3 points and
jQuery version 3.2.40 HTML we need to
reference the required javascript and
CSS files so let's open index dot HTML
and be new bootstrap and jQuery
installed and load modules folder
so first let's reference jQuery because
bootstrap has a dependency on jQuery so
here is the jQuery folder let's expand
that we go to the D is T folder and then
here notice we have jQuery min-ji so
let's reference this within our index
dot HTML page so let's drag and drop it
within our index dot HTML so when we
drag and drop it it will automatically
generate the required script tag we
don't have to use these two dots so with
reference node modules just like how we
have referenced it here and let's do the
same thing to reference the required
bootstrap files bootstrap dot min dot
CSS and bootstrap dot min dot J s now we
are all set up to use bootstrap within
our angular project so let's scroll down
a bit that in our index dot HTML and
within the body section let's include a
button element the only issue we have at
the moment is we don't have any
bootstrap intelligence notice when I
type the button and class and then when
we press control space notice none of
the bootstrap CSS classes show up so at
the moment we don't have bootstrap
intellisense
now to enable until
cents for bootstrap installed using the
node package manager there is a
workaround the workaround is to include
the bootstrap folder within our angular
project so let's navigate to the
bootstrap folder within our node modules
folder at the moment this folder is
excluded from the project so right-click
on this bootstrap folder and then select
this option from the context menu
include in project so this is going to
enable intelligence now notice when we
type control space all the bootstrap CSS
classes show up not just within our
index dot HTML even within any of the
component HTML files we will have
bootstrap intelligence now let's quickly
verify that so let's navigate our app
folder and then to employee folder and
in here we have our Employee List
component HTML file so within the th
element here let's include a button
element and then when we type class
notice we have all the bootstrap CSS
classes shown up in the intellisense at
this point if you still do not have
intellisense
restart visual studio once and it should
fix it as I said before there are
several ways to install bootstrap add in
Visual Studio one way is by using the
node package manager which we have just
seen the other way is by using NuGet
package manager now to use new gate
package manager to install bootstrap
right-click on the project for which you
want to install bootstrap and then from
the context menu select this option
manage new get packages we have the new
kit package manager window open at the
moment we are on the installed tab let's
go to the Browse tab and we want to
browse for bootstrap select the first
option bootstrap and then we can either
click this icon here or this button
right here to install and this is going
to install both bootstrap and jQuery
this option copies they required
bootstrap and CSS files in three
different folders within our angle
project so we have the contents folder
phones folder and scripts folder so into
these three different folders it has
copied the required CSS and J's files
now if we install bootstrap using NuGet
package manager then we don't have to do
anything special to enable intellisense
since we have already installed
bootstrap using the node package manager
I'm going to uninstall in a bootstrap
and jQuery that we have installed using
the package manager to do that simply
click this uninstall button so this is
going to uninstall only bootstrap and
not jQuery so to uninstall jQuery let's
go to the install tab that's where we
have all the installed packages let's
delete bootstrap from the text box and
here we have jQuery and to uninstall
jQuery installed by NuGet package
manager click this uninstall button
right here and this is going to
uninstall jQuery as well both these
options that we have discussed just now
downloads bootstrap to a local machine
and we then reference the downloaded Jas
and CSS files within our index dot HTML
page if you do not want to download then
the other option that is available is to
use the CDN links to get the CDN links
navigate to this URL right here get
bootstrap dot-com for slash getting
started and here you have the bootstrap
CDN links we can reference the CDN links
directly within our index dot HTML page
so to install bootstrap you can use node
or nougat package manager there are
other options available as well which
way to use depends on your project needs
after bootstrap is installed reference
the required CSS and J's files in index
dot HTML page if you do not want to
download bootstrap then you can use
their CDN links and here is the URL from
where you can get the official bootstrap
CDN links thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
