this video we'll discuss including
default content in content placeholder
of a master page a content placeholder
in a master page
can include default content let's
understand this with an example let's
first add a master page let's call it
site dot master notice that we get two
content placeholders one in the head
section and another within the body
section let's get rid of the content
placeholder from the head section and
notice that at the moment we don't have
any default content within this content
placeholder but let's specify some
default content let's say this is master
page default content now let's add a
content page and notice that we have
caught a content control inside the
content page let's actually flip this to
the design mode let's drag and drop
maybe a button and a calendar control
now as you might expect when we run this
this webform one dot aspx is going to
display button and calendar control now
on the master page we have some default
content that content is being overridden
by this waveform one dot aspx now let's
say we want this platform 1 to default
to the master page content instead of
overriding it if that's the case all you
need to do is right-click on the content
page and then select this option default
to masters content but before you do
that let's examine the source of this
page so if you look at the source within
the content page we have caught this
content control and inside that we have
that button and calendar control now
let's go back to the design mode let's
now right-click on this content
placeholder and then select this option
default to masters content and look at
this we have caught an alert here if you
default to the master page content
everything in this region will be
removed from the
Paige do you want to continue s or no so
once we click yes look at what's going
to happen so obviously this waveform
here has default to the master page
content so if we go to the source one
look at what's happening here what
happened to the content control it's
removed all together okay so if you want
the content page to default to the
master page default content then all we
need to do is remove the content control
from the content page so obviously now
as you might expect if we run this
what's going to happen instead of
displaying button and calendar control
it's going to display the default master
page content now you may be wondering
where is this feature useful in reality
your master mate page can include
multiple content placeholders and there
may be one content placeholder you know
which is overridden only by one or two
pages in your entire project if that's
the case for that content placeholder
you can specify some default content
which will be used by all the other
pages and only those two pages which
wish to override the master default
content you know they will include a
content control and you know override it
in the way they want to override it
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
