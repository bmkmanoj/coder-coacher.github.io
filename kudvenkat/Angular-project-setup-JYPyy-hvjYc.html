in this video and in our upcoming videos
in this series we will discuss
performing all the crud operations in
angular that is creating reading
updating and deleting with simple
examples now setting up a new project
from scratch is a tedious and
time-consuming process
however angular CLI makes it super fast
and easy with angular development we
write the same boilerplate code to
create components pipe services
directives etc manually creating these
consumes a lot of time angular CLI can
generate these with lightning speed
while still following anglers best
practices and conventions so basic
knowledge of angular CLI is definitely
helpful here are the prerequisites for
this course basic knowledge of angler
CLI angular 2 and bootstrap will be
using bootstrap 4 styles in our
application if you're new to these
please check out our courses I'll
include the links for these courses in
the description of this video
now let's install the tools required we
need node so download and install the
latest version of node from this URL
right here I've already installed it on
my machine as of this recording the
latest version is eight point nine point
two and that's what I have on my machine
next let's install the latest version of
angular CLI to install angular CLI
execute this command and boom install -
G at angular four slash CLI this flag
right here - G installs angular CLI
globally on our machine now when you
execute this command from the command
prompt make sure you're running command
prompt as an administrator I've already
installed angular CLI on my machine and
as of this recording the latest version
of angular CLI is one point six point
zero and that's what I have on my
machine to verify the version of angular
CLI you have execute this command ng - V
n G stands for
anglers Eli itself as you can see the
version I have is one point six point
zero the latest version of angular CLI
as of this recording we will be using
Visual Studio code as the editor for
this course if you don't have Visual
Studio code already installed on your
machine download and install the latest
version from this URL right here another
common question that you might get is
which version of angular are we using
with this course as of this recording
the latest version is angular 5 and
that's what we'll be using with this
course but the concepts that we are
going to discuss as part of this course
we can apply them to angular 2 and any
version after that once you have all
these required tools installed let's
unit a new angular project using the
angular CLI to generate a new project we
use this command ng which stands for
angular CLI itself new because we want
to generate a new angular project and
then we specify the name of the project
we want our project to be named angular
crud and then we don't want test files
to be generated for our components so
I'm going to set this option skip -
tests to true well discuss testing
components in a later video for now
let's not generate the test files for
our components and then once we plus the
Enter key there's going to create a new
angular project with this name and lock
rad I've already executed this command
so I'm not going to execute this again
after the project is successfully
created change into the directory that
contains your project by executing this
command here angular crud is the folder
which contains our project as you can
see I am already within the Anglican
folder I created this project directly
within C Drive so at the moment I am
already in the project folder while you
are in the project folder execute this
command code space dot this is going to
open our project using visual studio
code now if you look at this package dot
JSON file notice on the dependencies we
can see that we are using angular
version 5
the latest version as of this recording
if you look at our project folder
angular crud it contains several other
folders and all these files now if
you're new to the fullest structure what
these files are and what they contain we
already discussed all that in detail in
angular CLI tutorial so please check our
angular CLI tutorial I'll have the link
available for that course in the
description of this video
there is one more thing left to install
and that is bootstrap will be using
bootstrap four styles within our
application so let's go back to the
command prompt and execute this command
and BM install bootstrap at three dash
dash Save there we go
bootstrap is successfully installed it's
installed in the node modules folder for
us to be able to use bootstrap we'll
have to include a reference for the
bootstrap stylesheet within the angular
CLI configuration file now the angular
CLI configuration file is this one dot
angular - CL I dot Jason so navigate to
the styles section right here and
include the reference to the bootstrap
strategy this bootstrap style sheet is
in the node modules folder and that's
the path to the bootstrap dot men dot
CSS file so we have to include a
reference to that style sheet for us to
be able to use bootstrap so at this
point we have installed all the required
tools we have also created a brand new
angular project let's run this project
to make sure it actually works the
source code for this project is present
in this SRC folder inside that folder we
have the add folder and inside that
folder we have our fruit component if
everything works as expected we should
see this root components view template
in the browser to run our angular
project we need to execute this simple
command ng serve - oh this is going to
build and launch our application in the
default browser
there we go we have our application
launched in the browser as expected here
is what we want to do in our next video
we want to retrieve and display employee
details along with the photo as you can
see right here so within a panel in the
panel header we want to display the
employee name the photo right here and
then the rest of the employee details
like gender date of birth
contact preference etc so in our next
video we'll discuss how to perform the
read operation and in the videos after
that we'll discuss the rest of the crud
operations that is creating updating and
deleting employees so please stay tuned
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
