in this video we'll discuss how to call
a speeder and PvP a service using the
angular built-in HTTP service does this
example demonstrates calling an asp.net
web api service we can use the same
approach to call any web service belt
using any server-side technology along
the way we'll also briefly discuss what
observable pattern is all about and
finally issuing cross-domain service
calls this is the asp.net web api
service we built in our previous video
this web api service ladies data from
this employees database table at the
moment we have the employee's data
hard-coded within our angular employee
service as you can see right here now
instead of hard-coding employee's data
within the application like this we want
this service to call the web api service
the web api service in turn retrieves
data from the database table so let's
look at the steps involved for calling a
server-side web api service using the
angular built-in HTTP service this HTTP
service is present in a different
angular module and that module is HTTP
module so the first step is to import
this angular HTTP module from our root
application module which is add module
so within this file right here app dot
module dot TS we have our root
application module app module now here
let's import the HTTP module let's
include a required import statement and
just like how we have included browser
module and forms module as part of the
input sorry let's also include the HTTP
module so with this change we are now
able to use the built in angular HTTP
service to issue web service calls over
HTTP here are the two changes which we
just made our second step is to modify
the angular employee service to issue a
get request using the angular built-in
HTTP service our employee service is
present in this file employee dot
service dot TS now the first step here
is to
odhh HT DB from Angela HTTP here is the
HTTP service so we are going to make use
of this service to issue web service
calls over HTTP so we now need to inject
as HTTP service into our service class
for that we are going to make use of the
constructor to create a constructor in
typescript we use the constructor
keyword let's create a private field for
the class and I'm going to call it
underscore HTTP and the type for this is
HTTP remember this shorthand syntax that
we discussed earlier in this video
series basically this is going to create
a private field for this class with name
underscore HTTP it also create a
constructor parameter with the same name
and then it initializes the private
field with the constructor parameter to
reduce the amount of code that we have
to write to do something so common
typescript has provided us with this
shorthand syntax we can now use this
private field underscore HTTP to issue
web service calls over HTTP now notice
this employees service class has an
injected dependency it has a dependency
on this injected HTTP service so now
this at injectable decorator is
mandatory if we don't have a dependency
on this HTTP service then we don't have
an injected dependency in that case we
may omit this at injectable decorator
but angular recommends to always use
this at injectable decorator on a
service class for consistency and future
proof next we can use this private field
underscore HTTP to issue web service
calls so we can now get rid of this
hard-coded data this dot under screw
HTTP dot get now look at the
intelligence look at what this get
method returns it returns an observable
of response we'll discuss what an
observable is in just about but let's
first import ABS
sir verbal from rxjs next let's specify
the URL to which we want to issue the
get request be known this is the URL of
our asp.net Web API service that returns
us the list of employee objects so let's
specify this URL right here as part of
this get method now again if we look at
the intelligence of this method notice
it returns observable of response
observable of response is not that
useful to us we know this URL returns an
array of AI employee objects right so
I'm going to change the return type to
observable of AI employee like that now
if you look at the return type of this
get method it is observable of response
and silicate data - diaper for get
employees method we changed it to
observable of AI employee array so we
need to convert response to i employee
array to do that transformation we are
going to make use of an operator
provided by rxjs and that operator is
map operator so let's include the
required import statement for importing
the map operator from rxjs and then we
are going to change the map operator to
the get method like this and we are
going to pass the response that does get
method returns right look at the return
type of this get method it is observable
of response so let's pass this response
to this map operator basically the
argument for this map operator is an
arrow function we are going to use that
arrow function to transform the response
to i employee array so let's specify
first the parameter that you want to
pass I'm going to call the parameter
response again if you look at the return
type the return type of diskette method
is observable of response so first let's
import this response from angular HTTP
so along with HTTP let's also import
response and the type for this parameter
that we are passing to the arrow
function
said that to response because that's
what this get method is giving us the
get method is giving us absorb all of
response that response we are passing to
the map operator and this arrow function
right here is going to convert this
response to an array of PI employee
objects first let's get the JSON out of
the response and then let's use the type
testing operator and then we want to
type gasps the response to I employee
array so the map operator right here
taking in the response and transforming
it to I employee array which satisfies
observable of I employee the return type
that we have specified for our get
employees method so here is that same
code which issues a get request to our
removed web service and notice our
service returns an observable so let's
now understand what is in absorber and
observable is an asynchronous pattern in
this pattern we have an observable and
an observer this observable emits data
items or notifications over a period of
time and the observers also called as
subscribers can subscribe to the
observable when subscribing the
observers specifies a callback function
and that callback function of the
observer also called a subscriber is
notified whenever this observable emits
data items and within that function will
write code to handle the data items
emitted by the observer and as you can
see from this diagram an observer can
have multiple observers studies
subscribers anybody who is interested in
the data emitted by the observable can
observe the absorber meaning subscribe
to the observer when they subscribe they
specify a callback function within that
function we have code to handle the data
emitted by the observable it's as simple
as that
so if we relate this to our example in
allocate this employees service returns
an observable so it becomes an
SOPA and any component which needs this
employee data is going to be the
observer also call a subscriber and
let's say for example with another
application within our employee list
component we need employees data so that
is going to be the observer subscriber
and that component is going to subscribe
to the observer they turn by this
service and when we are subscribing from
our employee list component to this
service we are going to specify a
callback function and whenever this
function returns an observable of AI
employee objects the subscriber the
observer in our case employee list
component is going to consume that and
we have a callback function there which
is going to handle the data returned by
this observer so our next step naturally
is to subscribe to the absorb ultra turn
by our employee service from employee
list component so let's see how to
subscribe to an observer now let's open
our employee list component it is going
to be this observer that is the
subscriber notice within the ng on init
method we are issuing a request to the
employee service which returns the
observer and if you look at the
intelligence for the scat employees
method notice it returns observable of I
employee and forget this property it is
PI employee array so you can't bind
absorb of AI employee directly to this
property like this because this service
returns an observable we have to
subscribe to the absorber and to
subscribe to the observer we use the
SUBSCRIBE method like that notice we are
changing the SUBSCRIBE method to get
employees method which returns an
observer and remember when we subscribe
to the absorber we also specify a
callback function we specify that
callback function as a parameter to the
SUBSCRIBE method so we can specify that
as a arrow function or a regular
function I'm going to use an arrow
function so this error function is going
to receive employee data so I'm going to
name that parameter employee data you
can give it any meaningful name
you want and what do we want to do with
that employee data as in when the
observer you know returns employee data
I want to use that data to populate
employees property so I simply say this
dot employees equals employee data you
know whatever data they call back
function receives from the observable
and we don't need this assignment here
anymore because we are using the
callback function which is notified when
the observable emits an array of my
employee objects this parameter is going
to receive the data and we are using
that to bind to employee's property so
to subscribe to an observable we just
need one line use the SUBSCRIBE method
and then specify the callback function
as a parameter to that subscribe method
and that callback function receives data
from the observer and within this
callback function in our case we are
binding it to employee's property at the
moment we only specified one argument to
the SUBSCRIBE method if you look at the
SUBSCRIBE method it actually has three
parameters so let's look at that from
intelligence so if you look at the
SUBSCRIBE method notice the third
overloaded version it has got three
callback methods that we can specify
this first method is the method that is
called when an observable emits an item
and that's what we have specified at the
moment right here the second method is
called on error so as the name implies
this method is notified when there is an
error so this callback method is called
when there is an error processing of a
request and we have the third method
this is called uncompleted this method
is called when absorb elem it's the last
item remember an observable emits data
items sequence of items over a period of
time in our case however the observable
emits just one item that is an array of
I employee objects but if you have an
observable which emits data items that
is a sequence of items or a period of
time then
and when the observable emits the last
data item that's when this uncompleted
method is called in our case it emits
only one item that is an array of I
employee objects that's when this on
next method is called and because we
don't have any other items the
observable is emitting immediately
following that it also cause uncompleted
we haven't specified on error on
completed as arguments to the SUBSCRIBE
method in our upcoming videos we'll
discuss how to handle errors using on
error callback method so with all these
changes in place let's on our
application by pressing ctrl f5 notice
the webpage doesn't display any data
let's launch browser developer tools and
investigate what's going on now if you
look at this error right here look at
what it says cannot read properly length
of undefined and we have this error
within this method get total employees
count button or employee list component
so let's look at that method so we have
that method right here get total
employees count and we have just one
line between that method is trying to
conclude the length of employees array
and here with an NG on an EDD we are
assigning this property with the data
returned by the service so what's
happening here is by the time the
service has the opportunity to
initialize this property we are trying
to read length property of the employees
object so that's why we get this error
cannot read property length of undefined
so what do we want to do we want to
delay they call to this method get total
employees count until this ng on a net
had the opportunity to initialize this
property and the baby do that is by
using structural directive ng F and if
you look at baby are calling this method
you're calling this within our Employee
List component HTML so here we have the
employee count component we are binding
get total employees count to all
property the input property so we want
to delay the initialization of this
employee count component and to do that
we can use our structure
- ng F and we specify our employees
property so basically we are saying you
know until this property is not null or
it is not undefined
don't initialize this employee count
component so let's save these changes
and free load of webpage notice now we
see a different error rate this
carefully look at what it says xml
httprequest cannot load this URL no
access control allow origin header is
present on the requested resource origin
this URL is therefore not allowed access
we get this error because our angular
application and our baby a project they
are present in two different projects
this our angular project and this is our
Web API project because they are present
in two different projects they are
hosted at two different port numbers
so this is our Web API project look at
the port number 3 1 3 2 4 and this is
our angular application and look at the
port number for this 1 3 3 9 7 2 because
they are present across two different
port numbers they violate the browser
same origin policy and the browser
blocks this request for security reasons
so to make this work all we have to do
is include a setting within web config
file of our baby a service
let me peace that setting within the web
config file of our web api project so
under system dot web server let's
include the setting so let's look at
what the settings is so basically we are
including that header access control
Paulo origin and I'm setting it to star
and we basically want to set the headers
to content type and methods - all the
methods get post put etc now if you are
not clear on what these settings are we
discussed them in greedier and parts 14
and 15 of our web api tutorial in that
tutorial we are
so discuss the browser same-origin
policy and cross-origin resource sharing
please watch those two videos so I'm not
going to go into great details here and
when we said this access control other
origin to star then that basically means
any application can issue it
cross-domain requests to this web api
service but if you want to restrict to
only you our application so if you want
to allow only this angular application
to issue a cross-domain requests then
you can specify the port number at which
this application is running that is the
domain at which this application is
running in our case our Anglet
application domain is this one localhost
colon three three nine seven two so we
can specify that right here or you can
also use star so basically now we are
saying only allowed this angular
application cross-domain requests to
this web api service so let's save all
these changes and reload our web page
notice now this CD data as expected and
the application also works as before
while we are here let me also show you
another thing let's free build our
solution notice within the status bar
you can see rebuild all succeeded now
let's issue a request from our web page
now this is a first request after we
have rebuild solution and look at what
the message says it is no employees to
display but that's not true if you look
at our database table we have got
employees in there so this message right
here
is misleading we are actually waiting
here for the service to load data
because we have rebuilt the solution
it's taking some time to jet compile it
and we are actually waiting here to you
know for the service to produce data so
that message no employees to display is
misleading
while we are actually waiting for the
employees to load so a much better
message would have been loading
employees please wide so let's see how
to fix that with an Employee List
component I'm going to include another
and look at the message we have here
loading data please wait and notice this
ng F structural directive and D F not
employees so basically if employees
property is not true the meaning if it
is null or undefined that means we are
actually waiting for the service call to
return with data and initialize this
property so during that wait period we
want this message to be displayed
loading data please wait and when the
service called returns with data this TR
disappears and the employees data show
up and look at this TR right here this
displays this message no employees to
display and when do we want this TR to
show up when the employees property is
true the meaning when it is initialized
and when the length is zero meaning we
don't have any employee objects within
that array to display that means we
really don't have employees that's when
we want to display this message no
employees to display so with all these
changes let's give our solution another
rebuild within the status bar you can
see rebuilt all succeeded so let's
reissue a request from the browser
notice while we are waiting for the
service to load data it displays this
message loading data please wait so at
this moment the service is busy being
did compiled and when the service
returns with data that's going to
initialize this property employees and
when that happens this TR disappears and
the employees data show up we have still
waiting for the service to return with
data notice as in when the data is
available that message disappeared and
we have the employee's data displayed
now let's truncate this employee's table
and now we don't have any employees
within our employees table so now let's
reissue the request to the browser now
we expect the message to be no employees
to display there we go the application
is working as expected
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
