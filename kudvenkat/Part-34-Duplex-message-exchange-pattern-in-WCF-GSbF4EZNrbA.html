this video well disk is implementing
duplex message exchange pattern and WCR
duplex messaging pattern can be
implemented using request reply or
one-way operations we discuss request
reply operations in part 32 and one-way
operations in path 33 I strongly
recommend watching these two parts first
before proceeding with this session in
this video we'll first disk is
implementing duplex messaging pattern
using request reply operations and then
we'll modify this example to implement
duplex messaging pattern using one-way
operations let's look at an example
let's slip to visual studio and let's
create a new project we want to create a
class library project and let's call
this project report service and let's
delete this class one dot C s file that
sought to generate it and this project
let's add a WCF service and let's name
our WCF service report service and
within the service contract file let's
change the name of this operation
contract to process the report so what
is this method going to do it's going to
process a report and let's assume the
processing of report is a lengthy
operation so in this case if we use
request reply pattern you know the
client has to wait you know for the
report processing to complete and it
doesn't make sense okay because it's a
lengthy operation so there's no point in
keeping the client wait while the WCF
service is processing the report if we
use one-way operation here then what's
going to happen the client initiates a
you know a request for the report
processing and then after that the
client is immediately you know freed up
okay and then the client can continue
with whatever the client has been doing
okay but the problem with one-way
operations is that we will have no way
to send the status back to the client
let's say for example the clients
requirement is that he needs to know
about the percentage of report
processing that's complete okay so when
they click on process report
they want to see maybe in a text box the
percentage of report processing that's
complete so the service should be in a
position to send status back to the
client with one-way operations that's
not possible so let's see how to use
duplex messaging pattern to achieve this
so declined so the requirement is stays
the client should be able to you know
initiate a request for report processing
and as soon as the report processing
request is cued up the client should be
freed up so the client should not be
blocked while the WCF service is blocked
processing the report and at the same
time you know the client also wants to
know the status of the report processing
like the percentage that's completed
okay so let's see how to achieve this so
obviously if the WCF service has to send
message to a client then we need some
sort of listener or a callback method at
the client that the WCF service can call
and pump messages into and that callback
method will take the responsibility of
displaying that information in whatever
control that the client wants okay so
basically we need you know a callback
contract here okay which the WCF service
can call and send messages to so that
the client can consume so let's go ahead
and define a callback contract and the
callback contracts do they need to be
decorated with service contract
attribute not required we don't have to
do that and let's call this callback
contract as I report service callback
okay and let's also specify an operation
contract and let's call this progress
okay and what information do we want to
send back to the client
you know we want to send that the
percentage completed
okay so let's call it percentage
completed
so this is the callback contract that's
the WCF service is going to use sue to
send the status update to the client now
we need to associate this callback
contract with this service contract
because when a when somebody calls this
process report method you know the
Ribisi of service is going to start
processing the report as soon as it
starts processing the report and let's
say for example you know 10% is
completed we want to send that
percentage back to the client
so and we are going to use this callback
contract to do that so somehow we need
to link up this service contract with
this callback contract and the way we do
that is by using callback contract
parameter of the service contract
attribute so use type of keyword and
what is the type of callback contract I
report service callback so let's go
ahead and specify that here all right
and notice that at the moment both of
these operation contracts doesn't have
is one-way equals true meaning at the
moment these are request reply
operations okay so here we are going to
use request reply operations to
implement duplex messaging pattern and
then we'll modify the same example you
know to use one-way operations all right
so that's on the service side so we have
done everything that we need to do we
define a callback contract and then we
associated that callback contract where
the service contract now we need to
implement the process report method of
the service okay so let's go and do that
so within report service dot C s file we
need to implement a report service
interface so in reality in this method
will have the logic to process the
report but here you know let's have some
dummy logic so just to simulate some
artificial processing time let's make
the thread that's executing the request
sleep for maybe 50 milliseconds okay so
let's actually also bring in system dot
threading namespace
and then let's actually put this in a
loop so for end I is equal to 1 I less
than or equal to 100 I plus plus so what
do we want to do you know in reality in
this method we'll have logic to process
a report and then compute the percentage
completed but here we are just going to
have some dummy logic so we are making
the thread sleep every time it counts
from 1 200 maybe 450 milliseconds and
then you know what do we need to do so
the report is being processed when this
method is called at the same time this
method should also feed the status
information back to the client about how
much percentage has completed and to do
that you know we have specified that
there's going to be a callback contract
okay which is I report service callback
so now we need to pass the percentage
completed to that callback contract
method and how do we do that we use
something called operation context so
the context within which this operation
is being executed so the current
operation context and we have this
method here get a callback channel and
here we need to specify the type of our
callback contract what is the type of
callback contract I report service
callback and then this contract has got
this progress method which expects an
integer parameter so tell it how much
percentage has been completed so that's
contained in this variable I so let's go
ahead and pass that variable okay so at
this point we aren't done everything
that we have to do from the service and
ok so let's go and build this so build
succeeded now we need to host this WCF
service let's use a controller
application to do that so right click on
the solution add a new project and let's
add a console application
let's call this host click okay so a
host project is added now we don't need
any app core app that config file within
the WCF class library project so let's
actually delete that from there but
within the host project we need the
application configuration file so let's
go and add that and within the
configuration file we need to specify
the configuration for our WCF service to
speed things up I have already typed
that configuration here now we discuss
this configuration you know a lot of
times when we were hosting the WCF
service and in the initial videos in
this series as well so I'm not going to
get into the details of this one at the
moment and notice that at the moment
we're using net PCP binding that
supports dual communication that's
communication in both ways between the
client and the service ok there are some
bindings that doesn't support you know
dual communication so for example basic
HTTP binding alright so we have the
configuration here and we are using net
TCP binding where the service is
available ok and again within this
program dot CS file we need to write
code to make of a service available so
let's actually again copy this code and
paste it there again we discuss this
code several times in this video series
so I'm not going to go into the details
of this one so we have some compilation
errors here that's basically because we
need to bring in system dot service
model assembly so let's add a reference
to that so system dot service model and
then we also need a reference to the WCF
service itself so add a reference so
with the project tab and select report
service and let's bring in system dot
service model namespace alright ok and
let's add this host project as a starter
project and then let's run this by
pressing control f5 so our host is up
and running now let's quickly create a
client for the stubs
of service so let's flip to visual
studio so let's create a new project
here and let's actually create a Windows
forms application and let's call this
maybe duplex client you can give it any
meaningful name you want
so duplex client click OK and let's
first design this windows form so let's
drag and drop a button and the textbox
control so button and then a textbox
control all right and let's quickly
change the text on the button to
something like process report and let's
also change the name of the button to
maybe be TN process report
and let's fix the height and width of
this forum double click the button to
generate a click event handler all right
now we need to add a reference to our
WCF service so right click on the
references folder add a service
reference and if you look at the
configuration of our WCF service within
the app that config file notice that you
know the meta data is available at this
address so HTTP localhost colon 8080 so
let's copy that address and put it in
the address box click go so this should
discover our report service ok let's
specify the name space as a report
service and then click OK so this should
generate the required proxy classes all
right now so we are within the button
click event so this is where we need to
invoke the process report in all WCF
service method but before that keep in
mind you know the service contract is
associated with a callback contract the
client has to implement that callback
contract so that the service can send
messages to the client okay so let's
make this form actually implement that
callback contract now you can have any
custom class implemented to keep things
simple we are going to make this form 1
implement that callback contract and
what is the name of the callback
contract if you recollect it is I report
service callback and in which namespace
its present report service namespace and
since we have added a reference to the
WCF service you know the generated proxy
classes will have you know basically the
proxy classes are generated both for the
WCF service itself as well as the
callback contract ok
so we want to implement the callback
contract that is present in report
service namespace and the contract name
is a report service callback okay so
let's go ahead and implement that let's
select this option implement I report
sir
call back so we need to implement this
progress method so this parameter is
going to receive the percentage of
report processing that is completed from
the WCF service and what we want to do
with that percentage we want to display
that within the textbox control and so
the textbox control name is textbox one
the text equals percent completed let's
convert that to string and then let's
append you know some text here saying
that maybe percentage completed so here
we are going to get an integer like one
percent two percent whatever we are
going to display that percentage I mean
that number with this text so
straightforward there now within the
button click event here we need to
create an instance of our proxy class
and where is that present again that's
present in report service namespace and
report service client and let's call it
client equals new client and the
important thing to notice here is that
look at this the constructor of this
report service client now expects a
callback instance ok now the important
thing to keep in mind here is which type
or which Clause is implementing the
callback contract this form one class ok
so we need to pass the class instance
that implements the callback contract
here its form one so we need to send the
form one class instance to the
constructor of this class ok so how are
we going to create an instance of form
one I mean there is a wrapper class for
that purpose and it's called instance
context okay and that's present in
system dot service model namespace I
believe
so instance context and let's call the
variable instance context equals new
instance context and who is implementing
the callback interface this class that
is form one and if we need an instance
of this class we can simply say this so
this refers to an instance of this form
one and we are going to pass this
instance context to the client and all
we now need to do is invoke the process
report function okay all right so now
let's go and run our client and see if
everything works we are going to have a
problem here and we'll fix that in just
a bit okay so when we click process
report we are going to get an exception
and that is a deadlock exception look at
this the operation would deadlock
because the reply cannot be received
until the current message processing
completes okay so why is there a dead
log that is because if you look at our
WCF service look at the operation
contract here it's requests reply
meaning the client makes a request and
wait for the response to come back okay
so while the client is waiting for the
WCF service to complete the service
wants to send a status message back to
the client but the client is busy
waiting for the WCF service to complete
the you know processing of the report
okay so that that thread is busy there
okay and that's why we obviously have a
deadlock there and to solve this
deadlock issue we need to do two things
so this is where we implemented the
callback interface in the client
application and then we created an
instance of you know the type that
implements the callback contract and we
passed that to the proxy class here and
then we are invoking the process report
so to fix the deadlock ratio first we
need to set concurrency mode to Leanne
trend meaning you know the WT of servers
can send a status information back to
the client
okay so callbacks are allowed with
concurrency mode re-entrant okay so
let's go ahead and do that so first of
all let's stop the service host that's
running
let's also stop this line that is
running let's get to the WCF service and
within the service implementation file
use service behavior attribute and then
set concurrency mode to reentrant
okay and then within the client
application we need to set
synchronization to false so callback
behavior use synchronization context
equals false so that the UI can get
updated as and when the percentage
completed comes into the callback method
alright so with these service with these
changes let's go ahead and run our WCF
service and then let's go to the client
update the service reference so it's
still updating it let's go and run the
client now let's click process report so
we should get now the percentage that is
completed look at that you know as the
report is being processed the percentage
completed is being communicated back to
the client okay all right so we have
seen how to implement you know this
duplex messaging pattern using request
reply operations so if you look at the
service contract file both these
operations okay our request reply
because we haven't specified these
one-way equals true now how do we use
one-way operations to implement this
duplex messaging pattern it's very
simple now since we are using one-way
operations
you know the deadlock wouldn't be an
issue so within the report service
itself we can get rid of this
concurrency mode so let's actually
comment that that's not required
let's also stop the service host that's
running and within the client
application we don't require this
synchronization context as well so we
can comment that as well and within our
WCF service make these operation
contracts one-way and how do we do that
simply set is one-way equals true and do
the same thing with this callback method
all right so let's go and run the WCF
service let's slip to the client
application let's update the service
reference and then run the client
application process report as and when
the report is being processed you know
the percentage should be complete you
know communicate back to the client look
at that
alright so to implement duplex messaging
pattern using one-way operations we
don't require that concurrency mode we
don't require that synchronization
contract our contacts and all you need
to do is set is one-way equals true on
both the operations that's it for today
