this video well this is the purpose of
func delegate in c-sharp with an example
so what is func in c-sharp in simple
terms fun is just a generic delegate
notice the fun delegate right here it
has got two parameters T and T result
the first parameter that is T is an
input parameter that this delegate
expects the last parameter that is T
result is what this delegate is going to
return now notice that both of these
parameters are generic types meaning we
can replace them with the corresponding
type arguments depending on the
requirement if you look at the func
delegate right here it takes in employee
object as the input parameter and it
returns a string now in general what is
a delegate a delegate is a function
pointer meaning it is going to point to
a function so the delegate right here
represents a function that expects an
employee object as an input parameter
and is going to return a string let's
understand this func delegate with an
example so here I have got this employee
class with ID and name properties and
right here we have got list of employees
notice that at the moment this list has
three employee objects and we have
populated both the ID and name
properties now let's say using the func
delegate we want to you know print this
output so basically what we are doing
here is printing the name of each
employee within this list so let's see
how we have used the func delegate to
achieve that so here we have the func
delegate input parameter is employee
object and it's going to return a string
we called it selector and obviously this
is the trimeter so the type of this
parameter is going to be employee and we
have the lambda operator and to the
right of this lambda operator we are
forming the string that we want this
delegate to return so basically we want
the output like this name equals mark
John Mary etc so basically we have this
hard-coded string here
name equals and two that we are
concatenated the value that is present
within the name of property of the
employee or object okay so this delegate
right here is going to return a single
string now we have got the list
employees and on that you know we are
invoking the link function select and to
that select function we are passing the
delegate so what's going to happen
behind the scenes it's going to execute
this expression right here okay so
basically this is going to be executed
against each employee object that is
present within the list so this selector
now is going to return an ienumerable of
strings and we are storing the list of
names within this variable right here
and then we are using a for each loop to
print out the name of each employee I
have this exact same program already
typed so let's flip to visual studio so
make sure you have these three
namespaces we need collections or
generic namespace because we are using
the list class we also need system dot
linked namespace because we are using
one of the linked functions right here
that is the Select link function okay so
right here we've got the employee class
with both of the properties that is ID
and name and then within program class
we have the main method so basically we
are creating the list here with three
employee objects and then we have our
delegate so func the first parameter is
going to be the input parameter and this
is what this delegate is going to return
okay and we have named it selector
equals look at this when I hover the
mouse over this parameter employee look
at that from the intelligence that type
of this parameter is employee and that's
automatically inferred okay and then
this expression is going to form the
string that we want this delegate to
return okay and obviously we are
invoking the Select function on the list
and if you look at the Select function
it actually expects a func and this
selector is a func that we are passing
as an argument okay and when I hover the
mouse over this
select you know link function look at
what it is returning it is returning an
ienumerable of string okay so this names
is of type int wearable of strings and
then we are using the for each loop to
print the name okay so let's go ahead
and run this look at that in add output
that we expect all right now to achieve
this do I really have to first you know
create this delegate and then this is
the expression that this delegate is
going to execute meaning we are passing
in the employee object and it's going to
form the string and return it and then
we are passing this delegate as an
argument to this link function is that
all required not really I mean we can
directly pass this lambda expression as
well as an argument to the Select link
function so we are passing that lambda
expression now let's go and comment this
front here and let's run this and see if
we get the same output notice that we
get the same output okay so the obvious
next question is going to be then what
is the difference between the front
delegate and lambda expression they're
the same just two different ways to
write the same thing the lambda syntax
is newer more concise and easy to write
now if you look at the front delegate
right here at the moment this one
delegate has got one input parameter now
let's say I have a situation where I
want to pass two or more input
parameters then what to do in that case
now as of this writing you know there
are 17 overloaded versions of front
which enables us to pass variable number
and type of input parameters so if you
look at this fund here look at this when
we open that angular bracket there are
17 overloaded versions
you know this overloaded version right
here you pass in you know one input
parameter and you're going to get a
result back if you look at the next
overloaded version you can pass two
inputs you know if you go on clicking
and if you look at the eighth overloaded
version you can pass in seven input
parameters of different types and then
you going to get a result back again if
and specify the type of that result okay
so there are several overloaded versions
here which allow us to pass a variable
number and type of input parameters and
we'll get a specific example right here
this funk is expecting two input
parameters of type integer and it is
going to return a string okay
so we're calling it func delegate so the
two input parameters right here are the
first number and second number okay so
obviously the types of these two
parameters are going to be integers and
then what are we doing with them we are
basically forming the string the
hard-coded string sum equals we are
computing the sum of both the numbers
and then converting that to string okay
so basically it's going to return sum
equals whatever is the sum of first and
second number so here we are passing 10
and 20 so this delegate is going to
return sum equals 30 and that's you know
pending that string right there I have
this exact same program within the
notepad so let's copy that
flip to visual studio paste it right
there and if you look at this first
number look at this when I hover the
mouse over it's of type integer
similarly second number is of type
integer okay so let's go ahead and run
this and see if we get the output that
we expect look at that sum equals 30 all
right
so that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
