this video well discuss take very
element selector that is selecting
elements by tag name this is
continuation to part 4 so please watch
part 4 before proceeding to select the
elements by tag name we use the jQuery
element selector and here is the syntax
to the Dollar function that is to the
jQuery function we passed the element
tag name the first example is going to
return all the TD elements so to the
dollar function we are passing the TD
tag name within quotes and this is going
to return as all the TD elements this
second example is going to select all
the anchor elements that are descendants
of development so in this example div
element is the ancestor element and the
anchor element is the descendant element
so basically this selector is going to
tell give us all the anchor elements
that are nested inside the development
no matter how deep the nesting is as
long as if an anchor element is present
in a development
give me all such anchor elements that's
what this second selector is going to do
and the third example is going to return
us all the div span and anchor elements
let's look at a few examples now we'll
be using this HTML for this demo and
I'll have all this HTML available on my
blog in case you need it and this is how
the page will look like with that HTML
now what we want to do is find all the
TD elements on this page so at the
moment we've got only one HTML label and
in that table we've got 5 rows and each
row has got 3 TDs that means 5 into 3
equals 15 TDs so what we want to do is
display the count of TD elements on this
page using javascript alert so let's see
how to do that so within the script
section on this page we already have the
ready function so here I'm going to use
the JavaScript dollar function and to
this function we are going to pass our
selector so we want to find all the TD
elements so I am going to pass a TD tag
name within quotes so what is this going
to do this is going to find all the TD
elements
put them in a collection and return that
collection back and the collection
object that is returned has caught this
length property which is going to give
us the count of TD elements and we want
to display that using JavaScript alert
so let's save these changes reload this
page and we should get 15 as the count
now let's look at another example now
what we want to do is change the
background color of each of the TR that
is present in this table to red okay so
let's see how to do that so now we want
to find TR element so let's get rid of
this alert function first so to the
JavaScript dollar function we are going
to pass TR element and I'm going to use
CSS function JavaScript function what
property we want to change we want to
change background color property and we
want to change that to red so what is
this going to do this is going to find
all the TR elements and change the
background color to red so let's save
these changes and when we deal with this
page the background color of the TRS
should be changed to red now let's alert
the HTML content of this table so if you
look at this table we've got you know 5
TR s so the entire HTML content of this
table you know we want to display that
using a JavaScript alert so what do we
want to find we want to find table
element and we want to get the HTML of
that table so I'm using HTML Javascript
function and let's display that using
javascript alert save the changes and
when we reload this look at that we get
the entire HTML content of that table
element now instead of displaying the
entire table HTML content like this
let's actually alert each table dro HTML
content
so I want to find all TR elements that
are descendants of the table element so
basically we are saying give me all TR
elements that are nested inside the
table element let's get rid of this
alert function from here and what we
want to do is loop through each of the
TR elements so I'm going to use each
function and when we are looping through
each TR element we want to execute some
code on each of that row so I'm going to
use an anonymous function so what do we
want to do we want to alert the HTML of
each table draw so I'm going to use
dollar function and use this keyword so
what is this keyword going to do here
this actually references the current TR
element that we are looking through and
we want to get the HTML of the current
table row that we are iterating over and
we want to alert that using JavaScript
alert function okay so let's save these
changes and when we reload this we
should get the alert five times because
we have got five tables in this table so
look at that that's the first table drop
content so within the first table we've
got 3 TDs
c-sharp asp.net and sequel server that's
what it's written when I click OK we
should get the second TR HTML content
click OK third fourth and fifth
now let's select and change the
background color of all the div span and
anchor elements so if you look at this
page we've got one two and three divs
one span and two anchor elements now we
want to change the background color of
all these elements to ello so basically
the idea is to find all span elements
okay and then all anchor elements and
then all developments okay so what is
this going to do this is going to find
all the span anchor and developments put
them in a collection and return that
collection back and what we want to do
with those elements we want to change
the background color so I'm going to use
the CSS function and the property that
we want to change is background - color
and we want to change that to hello
so let's save that reload the page so
the notice that the background color for
all the span and anchor elements has
changed background color
now instead of changing all the anchor
elements background color to yellow like
this let's only change the background
color of the anchor element that is a
descendant of a development so basically
we want to change the background color
of the anchor element that is nested
inside a development so I'm going to get
rid of this and then use div anchor so
basically here we are using ancestor
descendant syntax so give me all anchor
elements that are descendants of
development and change its background
color to hello so let's save this and if
you look at the HTML here so notice
we've got two anchor elements prism Tech
and Google this plug-in tech anchor
element this is nested inside a
development but this anchor element
Google this is not nested inside any
development so when we Lilu this page we
expect only presume tag link to have its
background color change
- ello now so on this page we've got two
tables now what we want to do is change
the background color of even rows in the
table to gray and Ord rules - L oh look
at this
the rule set index position 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 the
background is gray whereas the rows at
odd positions that is 1 3 &amp;amp; 5 they're
actually alone and we want to do that
for both the tables okay so let's see
how to do that and here's the HTML to
get those two tables again I'll have
this HTML available on my blog so let's
copy this HTML and paste it within our
visual studio project so I'm going to
remove all this HTML content that is
present within the body section and
paste this here let's delete the script
that we have within the script section
so let's save the changes and let's
reload this page okay so we've got two
tables now we want to change the
background color of even rows to gray
and odd rows - ello okay so dollar now
what do we want to do we want to find TR
now this is going to return us all the
TR elements on the page so TR dot CSS
now when we use the background - color
property here and when we set that to
gray this is actually going to change
the background color of all the TRS in
both the tables look at that and that's
not what we want we want to change the
background color of only even rows okay
so I can use even selector like this TR
: even so now when we reload this look
at that
only the even rows in both the tables
have their background color change to
gray now we want to change the odd rows
background color - hello
and look at that the odd rows background
color has changed to hello now this is
going to change you know the background
color of each of the tables okay now we
don't want that let's say we want to
change the background color of only one
table like this and in order to do do
that we are going to combine the ID
selector along with the element selector
okay so we want to change only the
background color of the rows in the
first table but not in the second table
and if you look at this HTML notice the
tables have got IDs the first table IDs
table 1 and the second table ID is Table
two okay
so within the selector function here I'm
going to say you know find table with
the ID Table one and for all the tables
rules for all the even table rows within
that table change the background color
to gray and the second expression and I
will do the similar thing but for the
odd rows so let's save these changes
reload the page and look at that now
only the rows in table 1 are changed
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
