video we'll discuss why and how a
deadlock can occur in a multi-threaded
program with an example
let's look at a typical scenario when a
deadlock can occur let's say we have got
two threads thread 1 and thread 2 and 2
resources resource 1 and resource 2
thread 1 has already acquired an
exclusive log on resource 1 and wants to
acquire a lock on resource two at the
same time another threat that is thread
2 has already acquired lock on resource
- and wants to acquire a lock on
resource 1 so in this situation thread 1
is waiting to acquire a lock on resource
two because thread 2 has already locked
it
similarly thread 2 wants to acquire a
lock on resource 1 and waiting for
thread 1 to release it ok so basically
these two threads are not going to give
up the locks that they are already
holding on to they are waiting for each
other so there is a deadlock let's
understand this with an example so we
are going to make use of this account
class again this is straightforward
account last we have caught two
properties for this class that is the
balance within the account and the
account ID and a constructor to
initialize those fields and we have a
public property here the ID property
which is going to return the account ID
and then a method to withdraw money and
a method to deposit money here we are
detecting the amount from the balance
and here we are adding the amount to the
balance so straightforward bank account
class basically and then we have another
class here that's the account manager
class ok so this class is the one that
is responsible for transferring funds
between two accounts ok so we need to
have a from account and a to account and
notice the type of the from and to
account it's of type account the class
that we have seen on the previous slide
okay so we have caught a from account to
account and then the amount that we want
to transfer ok those are the fields that
are present within the account manager
class and then we have got a constructor
here basically to initialize the
glass wheels and the important thing is
the transfer method so this is the
method that is going to withdraw money
from the account I mean from the from
account and then deposit to the to
account okay now before we are doing
that we are actually locking both from
account and to account okay but then
look at this first we are acquiring a
lock on the same account and let's say
you know after we have acquired the lock
on from account we want to do some
processing there okay and then maybe
that processing let's say it takes it's
going to take at least a second after
that we are going to acquire a lock on
to account and just to simulate that
processing I have made the thread that
is executing this piece of code to sleep
4,000 milliseconds that's one second
okay and then it's going to acquire lock
on to account and then it's going to
withdraw money from the from account and
then deposit to the to account okay so
this sleep here is the potential cause
for the deadlock you know due to a car
okay so basically the resources here are
the from account and the to account okay
and the threads we are going to create
them in the main method so that's in our
next slide so within the main method
what we are doing first we are printing
this message main started and notice
that we are creating two instances of
our account class okay
so account a has got 5,000 within the
account that's the balance and account B
has got 3,000 those are the account IDs
1 0 1 1 0 2 all right and then we are
creating two account manager class
instances account manager a and Account
Manager B and so for account manager a
we are specifying account a as the from
account and account B as the to account
and we want to transfer thousand from
account a to account B ok so we are
creating a new thread here and we are
delegating the transfer
you know the execution of transfer
method to that thread and notice that
here we have given a name to the thread
as well in a bit we'll see how we are
going to make use of
name okay and then here we're creating
another Account Manager instance Account
Manager be and here notice that we have
specified the frame account as account B
and to account as account a so here for
account manager a from is a and to SB
for account manager be from is B account
and to account this account a ok so we
are reversing it and then we want to
transfer 2000 from account B to account
a and we are executing the transfer this
transfer method and Account Manager be
on a new thread and t2 is the name given
to the thread we are starting both of
the threads and we are you know making
the main thread wait until both of the
threads complete and then we are
printing this message main completed
okay now what is going to happen now
this program is going to deadlock why
look at this when we call the transfer
method what is going to happen okay
keep in mind for account manager a from
account is account a and to account the
second B and for account manager be from
account is account B and to account this
account a okay and these two two methods
are being executed on different threads
thread 1 and thread 2 so we have got two
threads here thread 1 and thread two and
two resources account a and account B
okay and then if you look at our account
manager class so when we call the
transfer method on thread 1 what's going
to happen it's going to first log
account a which has got the ID of 1 0 1
and then that thread is going to sleep
for you know one second at the same time
we have another thread running parallel
e so that thread you know for the second
thread that is account manager be you
know we have the from account as account
B and to account as account a so thread
2 is going to acquire a log on account B
okay and then that is going into the
sleep ok for one second so at the moment
the situation is thread one has caught
lock on account a and thread two has got
lock on account B both of them will go
into sleep and then once they wake up
you know
once they have tried to acquire a lock
on to account you know the first thread
you know it's trying to acquire lock on
account B but the lock on account B is
already held by thread - okay
and similarly you know threat to once a
lock on account a you know where thread
one is already holding a lock so
obviously there is a deadlock let's
actually look at that in action so I
have the exact same program here so
that's the account class and that is our
account manager class and then this is
our main method okay so let's go ahead
and run this one and see what output we
get so we should get this output main
started and after that we don't have any
console.writeline statements anywhere so
nothing else will be printed you know
this this code right here our main
completed will never be reached so let's
go ahead and run this and see what's
going to happen look at that it says
main started but then nothing happens
the program is deadlocked there let's
actually prove that you know it's indeed
getting locked right here okay and to
prove that let's actually you know write
some consult or trade line statements
here and to speed things up I have
already typed those consult or trade
line statements so let's copy that and
paste that right here so now if you
recollect within the main method we have
given names for the threads using the
name property on the thread instance so
what we are doing here we are saying
thread dot current thread dot name so
which will retrieve the name of the
current thread that is executing this
code so whether it is t1 or t2 we don't
know so t1 for example t1 trying to
acquire lock on so we are trying to
acquire lock on from account so now from
account object dot ID dot to string so
we are basically printing the ID of the
from account ok so after this statement
is executed obviously we
have you know one of the threads have
acquired lock on the from account okay
so let's just print a message stating so
so whatever thread acquired lock on from
account so here it is trying to acquire
once this statement is executed it
acquired lock on that thread and then we
are going to make the next statement
here is going to make the thread sleep
so let's actually print that message as
well so console dot readline you know
thread whatever thread suspended for one
second meaning that's going to sleep for
one second and then you know the thread
is back in action so it came back from
sleep and then it's trying to acquire
lock on to account okay so this
statement will try to acquire lock on
the to account okay and then we'll
actually have another consult or trade
line statement here so consoled up trade
line let's actually write you know this
code will not be executed okay why is
that that's because at this line will
have a deadlock so it will not proceed
to execute this piece of code right here
okay so let's go ahead and run this and
see if we get that output look at that
main started and then first thread one
came in so three T one thread T one
trying to acquire lock on one zero one
that's the frame account right so within
your main method if you actually look at
that so the account a you know for
account manager a from account is
account a so one zero one is the ID so
it's trying to acquire lock on one zero
one thread one it acquired lock on one
zero one T one suspended for one second
because it's going to sleep okay then
look at that
t two thread two trying to acquire lock
on one zero two and then t2 acquired
lock on one zero two and t2 is suspended
for one second and then both thread 1
and thread two are back in action
and they are trying to acquire lock on
these account IDs where the other
threats are actually holding the locks
so that's why there is a deadlock and
notice that this line is never printed
you know this code will not be executed
that line is not printed and main
complete this line is not printed as
well so this program is in a deadlock
okay so in our next video we'll discuss
you know options that are available to
resolve you know these dead locks
alright that's it for today thank you
for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
