frameworks available for dotnet I've
listed a few here we have MS tests from
Microsoft which is integrated with
Visual Studio we also have n unit MB
unit X unit dotnet each of these
frameworks have their own pros and cons
most of the organizations I've been
working with I've used MS test MS test
is integrated with Visual Studio this
means we don't have to install any
third-party tools I must also tell you
once you learn how to use one of these
unit testing frameworks it's not too
hard to learn the others the concepts
are still the same the way we implement
them may be slightly different depending
on the framework that we choose let's
focus on how to create our first unit
tests using MS test unit testing
framework that comes with Visual Studio
there are three simple steps
the first tab is to add a unit test
project to your solution the second step
is to decorate the class that contains
test methods with test class attribute
and the final step is to decorate the
test method with test method attribute
so let's look at all these three steps
in action let's flip to your studio so
we have a solution here the name of the
solution is calculator and the solution
at the moment contains two projects so
this project right here calculator dot
web this is an asp.net web application
project and calculate a dot library this
is a class library project and if you
look at this calculator dot web we have
a single aspx page here calculate a page
dot aspx if we view this page in the
browser this is how it looks like so it
provides us the option to enter a value
for numerator and denominator when we
click the divide button we get the
result that is the quotient displayed in
a variable now the way we have
implemented this is like this so when we
click the divide button on this page we
are calling the divide method that is
present within the calculator class and
look at this calculator class this is
pleasant in calculator dot library
namespace so if you look at the
references right here notice within the
web app project we have added a
reference to calculate a dot lie
every project which is have a class
library project that has the logic to
divide two numbers there's the same
function that we looked at in our
previous video session what we want to
do is unit test this divide method so
the first step to do that is to add a
unit test project to a solution so I'm
going to right click on our solution add
a new project and I have selected tests
under visual studio I mean under visual
C sharp and I selected unit test project
and I'm going to call this calculator
dot test click OK so this should add a
unit test project to a solution and look
at what it has done it has created a
class file unit test one dot CS and
that's the name of our class right here
now I am going to change this name to
calculate a test so this is going to
contain all calculated tests so I'm
going to change that to that name and
when I do that it's asking me if I want
to change the name of the class as well
so I'm going to click ask so it changes
the name of the class as well now look
at this the calculator test class is
decorated with test class which is going
to contain all our test methods and the
test method itself is decorated with
test method attribute now look at this
by default it has called it test method
one which is not a meaningful name now
we are going to use this method to test
the divide method right so for now I'm
going to call this test underscore
divide there are naming conventions that
people follow to name their unit tests
when developing real-world applications
we'll discuss those naming conventions
in a later video for now to keep things
simple I'm going to name it test
underscore divide now to create the unit
test itself we follow these three is
pattern arrange act and assert within
the arrange section we initialize
objects and set the values of data that
we want to pass to the method being
tested and
during the Act section we invoke the
method being tested and the a third
section verifies that the method being
tested behaves as expected so let's look
at these three sections in detail that's
flipped to visual studio so first
arrange section so this section
initializes the variables and objects
that we want to pass to the method that
is being tested so I'm going to create a
variable here I'm going to call it
expected and I'm going to expect a value
of 5 so I'm going to store that in this
variable I'm going to create two more
variables of type integer so the first
one is going to be numerator I'm going
to initialize that to 20 and the second
one is going to be denominator and I'm
going to initialize this to a value of 4
so that's our our in section and within
our act section we are going to invoke
the method that we want to test so the
method that we want to test is actually
present in this project calculator dot
library and our unit test is present in
calculated or test project so within
this unit test you know at the moment we
haven't added a reference to calculate a
dot library project that means the
divide method is not available so let's
go ahead and add a reference to
calculate a dot library project so I'm
going to right click on references add
reference and then I'm going to select
this project section and from there
select calculator or library so that's
going to add a reference to a calculator
dot library project now within the act
section I'm going to use calculator dot
library that's the namespace within that
namespace we have our calculator class
and within that class we have our static
method divide going to call that and it
expects values for two parameters
numerator and denominator which we have
in these two variables so I'm going to
pass those two variables numerator and
denominator so this method is going to
return an integer value and I'm going to
store that return value in another
variable and I'm going to call it actual
so we get the actual value when those
two numbers are divided in this variable
and we have the value that we are
expecting in this variable
okay so finally within our a third
section we are going to verify if the
method behaves as expected and to do
that I'm going to use the assert class
this class has got several static
methods for now I'm going to use our
equal method and check if the expected
value which is 5 is actually equal to
the actual value you know whatever we
get when that method completes execution
