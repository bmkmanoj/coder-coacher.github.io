banquette this is part 10 of asp.net
click view tutorial in this video we'll
discuss about design time and runtime
formatting of grid we can draw grid view
control provides several in Bill styles
to format different sections of the
control first let's understand what are
the different sections that are present
in a grid view control first let's
display some sample data in this view
control let's configure sequel data
source control so let me select the V
connection string that's present in web
config file we have a table called TBL
employee won't employee ID first name
annual salary and country columns
let's now associate the sequel data
source control with the grid view
control so we have some sample data
there now if you look at this grid view
control it has got a header which
displays you know the column headers
there and then the rules themselves so
these rules they are collectively called
as rows and then the rows that are
present at odd number positions are
called as alternating rows this is
because if we want to apply styles
differently you know two rows that are
present in even number positions and two
the rules that are present at odd number
positions then we can make use of rule
style and alternating row style
properties we'll talk more about them in
just a bit okay a grid we can also have
a footer by default the footer of the
grid view control is not displayed
because the grid view control has a
property called show footer which is set
to false by default but we can turn that
to true if you want to you know show the
footer of the grid we control now let's
see how to use these different styles to
set you know or to format different
sections of this grid we control
obviously if I set a style at the entire
control level you know obviously if I
use control style control level style
you know that's going to be applied for
the entire grid view control so if I go
to the properties window at at the grid
view level at the control level there's
a back color property so if I select
something like you know blue for the
back color so that's going to be applied
for the entire preview control and now
let's say for example I want to change
the for color of the entire grid view
control then there is a four color
property
okay so let me say I want a full color
of white maybe so that's applied at the
entire control level now let's say the
header I don't like it to be blue back
color instead I want a green color is it
possible to customize header absolutely
there is something called header style
so I can change that here so expand
header style and then let's say I want
to change the back color to something
green so that's my back color and you
know the rules here you know at the
moment all the rules are in blue
background but I want them to be maybe
red background so how do I set rule
style obviously there is a rose style
property and then I can change the back
color maybe to something red okay now
look at this when I set rule style it's
applied to all the rules in the grid
view control now let's say I want to
format the rules that are present in odd
number positions
differently is it possible absolutely we
can make use of something called
alternating row style property and if I
expand that you know we have back color
property there so let's say for example
I want that to be that color I can
select that so that's alternating row
style and if I want to you know tile or
format this footer differently again you
have footer style as well okay now we
have seen how to set these styles using
the properties window so obviously when
we change these properties behind the
scenes it's writing the HTML for us so
look at this there is an alternating row
style element for which we have a back
color attribute now if you want to you
know change the format you can do that
directly in the HTML source as well by
changing those properties I mean
attributes here all right so we have
seen how to format the grid view control
at design-time it's very easy to do you
know there's loads of properties to
customize this according to your
application needs now is it possible to
change these properties at a runtime
absolutely we can do that as well in
fact if we look in the page load look at
this we are setting the rutile property
of the grid view control you know within
the roost I'll I'm setting the back
color property to red okay
so it's also possible to change these
properties died
dynamically in fact let's look at a
simple real-time example of way we would
actually do this so by default the
footer of the grid we control is not
visible to show the footer set show for
the property of the grid we control so
we have seen control style drew style
alternating style header style footer
style but there is also something called
edit through style what is this whenever
we put a row of the grid we control in
edit mode then what Styles do you want
to apply to that row
now that's edit row style now this is
not a complete style properties that are
available for a grid view control there
are several other styles as well if you
want to see all of them just go into the
source and then within the grid view
control if you just open an angular
bracket you can see all the properties
for example there is page your style if
you have paging enable you know then you
can configure pager differently using
pages style okay so there are several
others ties styles as well for example
empty data row style edit row style okay
we'll talk about all these Styles you
know as we talked about those concepts
for example when we talk about paging we
will see how to use pager style you know
dynamically at runtime as well alright
alright now let's look at a simple real
time example of way we can use these
formatting dynamically but before that
look at this if you're not very good at
designing so if you look at this grid
view this is a horrible design okay so
if you're not good at designing if you
want to use some of the inbuilt color
schemes that are already provided by
grid view control click on the smart tag
button there's something called Auto
format once I click on that look at this
there are several formats that are
available for me for example I can
choose brown-sugar there look at this
it's nicely formatted but now I can
choose other formats as well so let's
choose brown sugar for example and once
I select that look at the you know the
grid view is properly formatted and then
you can change this from here if you
want to okay we don't want the footer so
or let's turn off the footer so show
footer is equal to false all right
okay so basically let's see a simple
example of way we apply these Styles
dynamically in code at runtime let's say
I have this employee's table which has
employee ID first name and you'll salary
country and culture you know that's the
table that I have now if the annual
salary of the employee is greater than
70,000 you know then I want that
employees row to have a red background
color and a white full color is that
possible absolutely now look at this can
we do this formatting at design-time no
we cannot because at design-time we
don't know what data we are going to
display ok so dynamically at runtime we
need to loop through each row and then
check the value for salary column and
then if it's greater than 70,000 that's
when we need to set the background color
of that row to red and for color to
white okay so we cannot do this at
design-time we will have to do it
only at run time and obviously to
achieve this very easily we can make use
of this row data bound event let's see
how to quickly do that so we already
have this data that is displayed in the
grid view control so when we run this
now all of the rules will be rendered
normally with no special formatting even
the row that has got 70,000 salary will
be displayed
you know normally and look at this why
do I have a red background color here
that's because in code we were actually
setting that to red dynamically for all
the rows at the control level so now if
we run this whatever formatting that we
have at design time should be displayed
so at design time this is how the
control looks like and that's how it
looks like at runtime but remember if
the salary is greater than 70,000 then
we want to set you know format that true
differently let's see how to do that
obviously we can make use of raw data
bound event right click on the grid view
control go to the properties and then
click on that lightning bolt symbol you
should see something called raw data
bound even so let's double click that
and then you know this event is raised
every time a row from the data source is
bound to a row in the grid view control
so we have an opportunity to loop
through
to row here so we will check what is the
kind of row that is being data-bound if
e dot Rho dot Rho type is equal to data
controlled row type dot data also if it
is data row then what we want to do we
want to find you know the value for
annual salary column so how do i
retrieve annual salary there are two
ways to do that so int salary is equal
to so I want to retrieve the salary from
this grid view control the value for
salary column and to do that I can use a
class called data binder class and this
class has caught this evil method look
at this what is this method does I mean
this method basically evaluates the data
binding expressions at runtime okay so I
can basically use a a dot data a dot Rho
dot data item so which data item in the
row I want a data item which has caught
annual salary column name so in my web
form look at this the column that's
displaying annual salary the data field
the name I mean basically the column
name is annual salary so from this
column retrieve the annual salary okay
and obviously eval method what is it
returning back it's returning an object
datatype back because the columns can
contain any type of data so it has that
you know super type which is object so
we need to typecast that to be of type
integer so I can make use of this
convert class convert dot to in 32 all
right so we have our annual salary back
now all we need to do is check what is
that salary if salary is greater than
70,000 then what we want to do we want
to set the back color of the row so how
do I get access to that row you can use
that grid-view
drew even talked events object which is
coming inside so he dot Rho dot back
color is equal to system dot drawing
dot color dot red and similarly I want
to set you know the full color of the
row so I simply say e dot Rho dot for
color and I want to set that to white so
it's as simple as that so obviously when
we run this now as you might expect any
rule that has got salary of more than
70,000 that's going to be formatted in
red I can look at the all the other
rules they are rendered normally only
this row has that special formatting
applied now as I told you we can either
use you know data binder de Ville which
is a good way of retrieving a column
value or another way to retrieve salary
is basically by doing something like
this so let's copy that and put it there
so in that row so in this row where its
annual salary column present its present
in you know the index of that column is
two because the index starts from zero
so employee ID is zero first name is one
annual salary is two so I can basically
say instead of using data binding dot
IVA I can say e dot Rho dot cells of two
that's the you know third cell I can
retrieve the text from that cell and
convert that now if I run this as you
might expect the behavior is absolutely
the same thing except that we are using
you know a cell index to retrieve the
salary value now using salary you know
cell index is actually dangerous because
tomorrow if somebody changes the order
of these columns let's say I somebody is
removing that annual salary from there
and then he is basically putting it here
you know as the fourth column in the
grid view control now look at this
annual salaries the last column and they
have changed the order now if I go ahead
and run cells of two is actually
something else so what is present in
cells of - we actually have country and
country is a text now where can I
convert you know string datatype into
integer no so we will get a format
exception at runtime just because
somebody changed the column order you
know we have an issue but whereas if I
am using this data binder Eva
cindex I will not have that problem okay
no matter where this annual salary
column is present in the grid we control
as long as that column exists it's going
to go to that column find the value and
then return that but this one
specifically looking at cells cell that
is present at index location too
okay so at this time we have country
which cannot be converted into integer
so we have this format exception input
string was not in a correct format
that's why it's always better to use
data binder dot eval to retrieve column
values rather than using cell index all
right on this slide you can find the
sources phase bit or net c-sharp and
sequence of interview questions that's
it for today thank you for listening
