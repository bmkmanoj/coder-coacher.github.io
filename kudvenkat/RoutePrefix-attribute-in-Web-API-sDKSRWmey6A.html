tutorial in this video we'll discuss the
use of route prefix attribute with an
example let's slip to visual studio this
is the same example that we worked with
in our previous video at the moment they
using both the loading mechanisms
attribute routing and convention based
routing this method has got the route
attribute so it's using attribute
routing whereas these two methods does
not have the wrote attribute so they're
using convention based routing let's
also make these two methods use
attribute routing by decorating them
with the route attribute we want this
method to be mapped to API slash
students and we want this method to be
mapped to API slash students slash the
ID of the student ID is the parameter
and the specific parameters in curly
braces so let's run our application by
pressing ctrl f5 now let's quickly test
all our routes so if we navigate to
slash API slash students we get the list
of all students if we provide a specific
student ID we get that specific student
details and along with the student ID if
we use this little string courses we get
that specific student courses so at the
moment all our action methods are using
attribute routing and if we look at the
route notice every route has got this
common route prefix API slash students
now instead of repeating that common
route prefix on every controller action
method we can specify that at the
controller level using their old prefix
attribute so let's do that now so add
the students controller level let's use
route prefix attribute and then we are
going to specify that common route
prefix right here now since we have
specified that common route prefix at
the controller level we don't have to
repeat that common prefix on every
controller action method so I can get
rid of this
completely from there and here we only
need to specify the ID parameter and
here along the diary we also need to
specify that literal string courses so
let's give our solution a build and
quickly test if all the routes still
work the same way as before so if we
issue a request to this URI we get stood
in two courses if they remove the
courses literal string we get student 2
and if they remove the ID we get all the
students so all the routes are working
as expected
now sometimes we may have to override
this route prefix let's understand that
with an example to the models folder I'm
going to add another model so let's add
another class let's name this class file
teacher this teacher class is going to
have two public properties first one is
ID and the second one is the name of the
teacher name of the teacher a string so
let's change the type to string and with
the new students controller let's create
a public method and this is going to
return I enumerable of DJ objects and
let's call this method get teachers and
inside the method let's create a list of
teacher objects and let's call the list
teachers equals new list of teacher
objects let's create three teacher
objects new teacher object and this
teacher object has got two properties ID
let's initialize this to one and let's
initialize name to rob simply left
create to move teacher objects in the
interest of time I have already typed
the code so let's copy that and specify
it right here
so we've got three teachers and all this
method is going to do is return that
list now what we want to do is when we
issue a request to slash API slash
teachers
then this method should be called and we
want the list of all teachers so to do
that we may be thinking okay let's
decorate the kept teachers method with
this route / Adi / teachers and let's
see if this works let's give our
solution a build and issue a request to
/ API / teachers notice we get an error
it says no HTTP resource was found that
matches the request URI / api / teachers
now if we issue a request to / api /
students / api / teachers then we get
the list of teachers as expected
that's because of this route prefix
attribute so at the controller level we
have api / students and to that route
prefix it's appending this uri / api /
teachers that's why when we issue a
request to this URI we get the list of
teachers so there is definitely a need
to over line this route prefix attribute
to override the road prefix attribute
all you have to do is use this tilde
symbol so till 4 / API for / teachers so
let's give our solution adult and issue
a request to API / teachers notice we
get the list of teachers as expected so
this URI / API / teachers is mapped to
this controller action method so here
they using the tilt symbol to override
the route prefix so what is the use of
Road prefix attribute the old prefix
attribute is used to specify the common
route prefix at the controller level to
eliminate the need to repeat that common
route prefix on every controller action
method and here is an example how to
override the route prefix you still
character to overwrite the route prefix
and here is an example for that thank
you for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
