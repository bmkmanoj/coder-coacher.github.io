venket this is about 51 of asp.net
preview tutorial in this video we'll
discuss about implementing default
paging in a grid view control that uses
object data source control will be using
table TBL employee for the stem
obviously to retrieve data from this
table we need to implement employee data
access layer so let's flip to visual
studio let's add a class file to this
project and let's call it employee data
access layer dot CS and to encapsulate
employee information that's present in
this table we need to implement employee
class and just to speed things up I have
this class already implemented so let me
copy and paste that within our employee
data access layer and this is a
straightforward class it's for auto
implemented properties now with an
employee data access layer class itself
we need a method to retrieve data from
this table TBL employee and to do that
we need to write ad or dotnet code so
let's go ahead and import the required
ad or nickname spaces systems or data
system dot data dot seatbelt line and
system dot configuration now let's copy
and paste the method itself to retrieve
the data and this a straightforward ad
or dotnet code so if you look at this
code all we are doing here is look at
the return type of the method list
employee it's going to return list of
employees and then the first thing that
we are doing here is creating a variable
of type list employee and then using the
configuration manager class we are
reading the connection string from
web.com file using the connection string
we are then creating sequel connection
object and notice the command select
star from TBL employee so we're going to
retrieve all the rows from table TBL
employee and then execute it the command
loop through each row and then convert
each row into an employee object this
employee object is then added to the
list and the list is finally returned
okay so now let's flip to waveform one
dot aspx let's drag-and-drop agreed we
control
let's auto format this let's choose
brown sugar scheme now let's drag and
drop a label control we need the label
control to display this message at the
bottom of the grid we control displaying
page 1 of 2 so let's drag and drop the
label control
and we need to drag and drop the object
data source control as well so let's do
that now before we configure the object
data source control we need to build our
solution once because we have just added
employee data access layer and that
needs to become compiled before we can
configure object data source control so
choose your business object which is
going to be a demo dot employee data
access layer demo is the namespace so
click Next
let's select our method get all
employees which is going to return list
of employees click finish now let's
associate the grid we control with the
object data source control and look at
this the moment I do that I get this
option enable paging and obviously after
I enable paging look at the page numbers
and there was by default the page size
is 10 and to change that you know in my
table I only have six rows so let's say
I want to change the page size to three
I get to the properties of the grid view
control and then we have a property page
size which is 10 by default let's set
that to true 3 and then the last thing
that we want to do is to basically
display this message within the label
control and in the previous session we
discussed that the write even handler
method in which we want to do that is
the pre-rendered event of the grid view
control okay so get to the properties of
the grid view control click on the even
Seiken double-click on pre-render event
which should generate the even handler
and let me copy and paste this man you
know code right here and if you look at
this within label 1 well you know we are
setting the text property of the label
control to you know the string
displaying page and how am I getting the
page that the user is currently looking
at I'm using the page index since that
is zero index space I am adding 1 to it
and then converting that to string and
then we are appending this hard-coded
word off and then the total page is how
am I getting the total pages using the
page count property and that's a string
I mean integer so we are converting that
to string all right so with that if I go
ahead and run you know we should have
paging enabled with
you know objected a source control but
remember here again we are using default
paging okay so I click on page two
displaying page 2 of 2 now every time I
page through I retrieve all the rows
from TBL employee table because at the
moment they using default paging and
default paging is bad for performance
because if there are 20,000 rows in your
table and if you are just displaying 10
to the user you are unnecessarily
retrieving all 20,000 from the database
server to your web server so there is
unnecessary traffic between web server
and database server in fact if you fire
up sequel profiler so from sequel server
management studio you know click on
sequel profiler that should bring up
this window you know connect by giving
you a server name so you should be able
to connect to the sequel server and then
in the even selection clear all the
events
I just want sequel batch completed even
there and then click run now look at
this when I click on page 1 for example
page 2 now look at the query that is
sent to the database in the sequel
profiler we can see that select star
from TBL employee so that query is
actually going to return all the rows
back and then similarly if I change it
back to page 1 you know the same query
will be sent select star from TBL
employee ok so obviously default paging
is pad for performance in our next video
we'll actually see how to implement
custom paging using object data source
control alright keep in mind object data
source control supports both default
paging and custom paging in this video
we discussed about default fading in our
next video we'll discuss about custom
paging on this slide you can find
resources for a speed or Nessie shop and
sequel server interview questions that's
it for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
