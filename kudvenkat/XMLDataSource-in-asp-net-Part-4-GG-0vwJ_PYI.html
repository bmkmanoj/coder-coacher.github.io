venket this is part 4 of asp.net
grid-view tutorial in this video we'll
discuss about XML data source control in
asp.net in part 3 of the asp.net
grid-view tutorial we discussed about
object data source control please watch
part 3 before proceeding with this video
now if you want to display XML data in a
grid view control without even writing a
single line of code then XML data source
control can be used let's understand
that with an example let's flip to
visual studio now let's say I have this
country's XML data and I want to display
this country's XML data in this grid
view control ok and I want to do that
without even writing a single line of
code so for that I can make use of XML
data source control so let's go ahead
drag-and-drop XML data source control
onto our web form ok now we have our XML
data source control but we don't have an
XML file within our application so let's
go ahead and add an XML file now let's
keep all data files you know in a folder
called data so let's go ahead and add a
folder with name data to this project so
right click on the project add new
folder I'm going to name this data and
then to this folder let's add an XML
file and to do that right click on the
folder select add new item and then from
the install the templates click on data
and select XML file and I'm going to
name my file as country's dot XML click
Add
so that should add an XML file to this
folder now let us copy this XML data
into that file ok so if you look at this
XML data it's pretty straightforward we
have countries route XML element which
has caught several country elements
within that and each country element has
called child elements you know ID name
and continent
ok now let's configure our XML data
source control that we have on this Web
form so click on the smart tag click on
configure data source link here and then
all we need to do is select the XML data
file so click the Browse button and then
select data folder and from there select
country start XML
click okay that's all so we have
configured our XML data source control
now we need to associate this XML data
source control with this grid we control
and to do that click on the smart tag on
the grid view control and from the
choose data source drop-down list select
XML data source one and look at this the
moment I select that I get an error so
there is an error saying you know the
there was an error rendering the control
the data source for the grid view with
grid with ID grid b1 do not have any
properties or attributes from which to
generate columns ensure that your data
source has content okay now this is
basically because XML data source
control only works with attributes not
change the XML elements so if you look
at our XML it has got these chain
ament's gel XML elements so XML data
source control you know basically
doesn't work nicely with these with this
kind of XML data okay so obviously to
solve this I mean there are three ways
to solve this problem okay so obviously
the first way is to rewrite countries
dot XML file using attributes instead of
XML nodes okay we'll be talking about
that in this video session and the other
options are we can use an XSLT
transformation file to convert xml nodes
to attributes dynamically and
automatically okay and then the other
way is obviously to load that country's
dot XML data into a data set and then
bind the data set to the grid view
control we'll talk about these two
options that is option two and three in
our next video session in this video
we'll discuss about rewriting countries
dot XML file using attributes instead of
XML nodes
you know manually and then associating
that to an XML data source control so
obviously if I have my XML data like
this you know it's not working as
expected so what I'm going to do now I'm
going to rewrite that you know XML using
attributes look at this Here I am using
attributes instead of child XML nodes
here I'm using
ID name and continent as attributes for
this XML element
okay so let's copy so it's the same data
I have represented this in a different
format okay so let's copy that and
instead of this XML I'm going to paste
it there okay so it's the same data all
right so let's save everything let's go
to webform let's get rid of this a grid
view control let's drag and drop another
grid view control and now let's click on
that smart tag option and let's choose
our XML data source now look at this the
moment I select you know the XML data
source one from that choose data sources
drop-down list the data is nicely
displayed so let's go ahead and run this
now as you might expect the data will be
displayed okay
so it's taking a bit of time to load
that XML data from the file so I can see
my data there as it stands in the XML
file so in our next video session we'll
talk about options 2 &amp;amp; 3 how to use an
XSLT transformation file to convert xml
nodes to attributes and then loading
this country's dot xml data into a data
set and then binding that to a grid view
control on this slide you can find
resources for asp.net c-sharp and
sequence of interview questions that's
it for today thank you for listening
