20 of the design patterns tutorial in
this session we will discuss what is
decorated is in pattern implementation
guidelines of decorator design pattern
and we'll take a look at a simple
example to implement this pattern please
refer to the previous parts of the
tutorial before proceeding as per the
Gang of Four definition decorator
pattern states that we need to attach
additional responsibilities to an object
dynamically decorator provides a
flexible alternative to sub classing for
extending the functionality this pattern
falls under the category of structural
design pattern and is also known as
wrapper pattern which means decorator
design pattern solves the problem of
adding additional functionality to
already existing object without altering
its existing structure a point to note
that this pattern aligns with solid
design principles also this pattern
creates a decorator class which wraps
the original class and adds new
behaviors or operations to an object
during runtime let's now take a look at
the implementation guidelines of this
design pattern we need to choose this
pattern then you need to add
responsibilities to individual objects
dynamically and transparently that is
without affecting other objects for
example changing legacy code can be a
tough thing to achieve in those
circumstances it is easier to modify
existing code with decorators we need to
choo-choos this pattern when the
extension by sub classing is impractical
which means sometimes a large number of
independent extensions are available and
are possible and would result in an
enormous sub classing which are not
desirable to support every combination
we need to choose this design pattern
when a class definition may be hidden or
otherwise unavailable first sub classing
for example using this pattern we have a
flexibility to change classes despite
there being sealed I'm sure that you
understand that inheriting subclasses is
not possible in those situations
decorate a design pattern comes handy so
that we can modify the existing CD class
structure using a decorator let's now
take a look at the representation
diagram of decorator design pattern the
client interacts with the component
which defines the interface for objects
that can have responsibilities added to
them dynamically the concrete
implementer defines an object to which
additional responsibilities can be
attached the decorator maintains are
referenced to the component object and
defines an interface that confirms two
components interface a concrete
decorator acts responsibilities to the
component now you might be wondering in
what situations we need to use decorator
instead of inheritance and other design
patterns imagine in some situations
where we want to add responsibilities to
individual objects when I mean
responsibilities not to an entire class
but to some properties of a class one
way to achieve that is to add
responsibilities with inheritance but
sometimes it's inflexible to apply the
same with respect to sealed classes
which doesn't allow you to implement the
inheritance in those scenarios the most
flexible approach is to enclose that
component in another object that adds
the properties the enclosing of object
is called a decorator
I hope this statement might clear
somewhere around what is decorator
design pattern now decorator design
pattern implementation can be seen as
part of our day-to-day experiences
whenever we visit an ice cream shop we
would be presented with multiple options
for purchasing an ice cream for example
if you are buying a normal ice cream
which causes hundred bucks and then if
you want to top that with a chocolate
then it would cost 50 bucks more than
the cost of the ice cream that means an
extra addition of properties are costing
us 50 more bucks now let's say we
the chocolate ice cream with some extra
nuts and one the ice cream in a bowl
then we would spend hundred more bucks
extra if you observe carefully the
decorator is helping us in achieving and
extending the base ice cream which comes
with a cost
hence we are able to decorate an ice
cream with extra chocolate property in
level one and further we are decorating
it with nuts and serving in a bowl as a
serving method I hope now you are able
to correlate this example with the
representation diagram which we
discussed earlier let's now see this in
action with a simple implementation
let's now switch to the visual studio
console application program and see how
we can implement this with a simple
example to save some time I have already
created a console application and
created an interface called icar this
interface has a method to retrieve the
price of the car the interface is the
component of the application and for a
representation purpose I have created a
folder called component and move this
interface under this folder again to
reiterate it's not mandatory to follow
this folder structure and we as we are
just doing this for representational
purpose let's say everyone is now
fascinated to buy a car and we get
different options when we choose a model
from a car manufacturer all those models
have predefined pricing based on cost
tax and other factors let's say we have
sue Suki and Hyundai cars with a
predefined pricing for this financial
year these cars Hyuna and Suzuki fall
under the concrete component as they are
implementing the I car component now
let's say the dealer want to provide a
discounted sales on these cars based on
the open closed principle we need to
ensure that the classes are open for
extension and close it for a
modification for more details on the
open closed principle please refer to
our session on solid design principles
now let's say that we need to enhance
the classes which are sealed so let's
this class - seemed and on top of the
same classes we need to apply the
discount to solve this situation
decorator pattern comes handy by
extending the classes to apply the
required features in terms of properties
or methods to handle that case let's
create a decorator class let's right
click on this decorator folder and new
class and name this class as vehicle or
let's say car decorator to make the
things faster let me copy the code from
my notepad notice that we have changed
this class to abstract class and we are
decorating the car interface by
enclosing the I car component in another
object to add the design methods or
properties we are achieving that by
enclosing the I car in the constructor
of this object also we are implementing
the properties and methods of the I car
and in this case we are retaining the
base values of make and get price now in
order to achieve additional discount
price we need to add an abstract method
called get discounted price in order to
make this abstract class extendable to
implement the abstract method let's
quickly do that let's create public
abstract double get discounted price and
this get discounted price will be
implemented in the inherited classes
after adding this method our decorated
class is ready to be extended to
implement the offer price I hope now the
implementation is clear for you where we
have enclosed the component to implement
the desired functionality without
violating the open closure principle
let's now create a concrete implementer
for this decorator and implement the get
discounted price let's create a new
class under this concrete decorator
right
and new item and let's name this as
offer price and let's inherit the
car decorator here let's resolve these
issues let's uh solve this issue as well
show potential fixes and implement the
abstract method get discounted price now
let's assume that the dealer is going to
provide a 20 percent discount
hence the overall call car value will be
80 percent of the base price let's say
return point 8 into base dot get price
let's create a constructor public offer
price and assign a car car to the base
of car decorator that's it we are done
with the concrete decorator
implementation let's now quickly switch
to the main program and use these
classes let's now switch to the main
program and see the decorator in action
notice that I have already created an
object called Suzuki car and have
includes the object in the car decorator
by creating an instance of offer price
which computes the discounted price for
the car after that we are printing the
details of the car type original price
and the discounted price for the car and
these details are getting generated
without affecting the main class details
let's now run this application and see
the output
notice that we are able to print the
expected output with this we have
successfully implemented the decorator
design pattern in the next session we
will discuss facade design pattern till
then thank you for listening and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
