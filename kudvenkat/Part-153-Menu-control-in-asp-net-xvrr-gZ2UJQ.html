this video we'll discuss menu control in
asp.net we'll be using the layout of the
master page that we discussed in part
147 so please watch but 1:47 from the
asp.net tutorial before proceeding with
this video as the name speaks for itself
menu control an asp.net is used to
display a menu in an asp.net web
application let's understand using this
menu control with an example first let's
copy the layout of the master page let's
flip to visual studio and instead of
this content placeholder let's actually
paste the copied HTML and if we flip
this to the design mode notice that
there's the same layout that we
discussed in part 147 I'm not going to
get into the details of this HTML we
discussed that in detail in part 147 now
if you notice solution Explorer here
we've got several content pages so how
did I get these content pages I have
simply right click on the master page
and select this option add content page
and once the content page is added I've
changed the names accordingly and if
you're wondering why do I have so many
content pages that's basically to
support a menu that looks like this so
for example when I click on employee
menu item we want to navigate the user
to employee dot aspx page that's the
reason I have so many pages here all
right now first let's design our menu
control so that it looks like this okay
so let's get rid of this text altogether
now if you notice this text this is
present inside an h3 tag so let's flip
this master page to the source mode and
get rid of this h3 tag from there and
now let's drag and drop menu control so
notice that the menu control is actually
present under the navigation tab let's
double click that so here we have the
menu control now a menu contain items
what items does it contain it contains
menu items
and this menu item has got several
attributes okay so we're going to use
text attribute so basically we want the
text to be home so first we want to
display this text home and value is also
going to be for now home and navigate
URL so obviously when we click on this
menu item home where do we want the user
to redirect to we want the user to go to
home dot aspx page okay so if we flip
this to the design one notice that we
have that home menu item in a similar
fashion we want employee menu item and
under employee we are going to have
these three menu items upload resume
editor is you main view resume so let's
include another menu item so here the
text is going to be employee and value
is also going to be employee and we want
the user to navigate to employee dot
aspx and under employee menu item we
want upload resume tourism a view resume
so let's copy this menu item once again
and paste that inside this menu item
look at this a menu item can contain
another main menu item and that's how we
get that hierarchy so under employee we
want you know uploads you may edit
resume and view resume
so here the text is going to be
something like upload place you may
value is also going to be upload a
resume and navigate URL is going to be
uploaded as you may dot aspx so let's
copy this and paste it here look at that
this menu item is also present inside
employee menu item which means next we
are going to have edit resume a menu
item so this edit resume a menu item is
going to be underneath employee menu
item so here it's going to be edit
resume a and navigate URLs
to be editrice you may so we have upload
resume and edit resume pages alright now
let's flip this to the design mode and
notice that we have employee and there's
a little arrow there so when we actually
navigate to homepage let's open up
homepage and run this by pressing ctrl
f5 so basically all the pages in the
application are using site dot master
master page look at that we have home
employee and as soon as I hover my mouse
or employee look at the menu items
underneath employee are automatically
popped out ok now when I hover my mouse
away they go away now if I click on
employee menu item look at that we are
redirected to employee dot aspx paid in
a similar fashion when we click Edit
resume look at that we are there on edit
resume dot aspx now let's go ahead and
actually get the menu items for employer
and admin as well and to speed things up
I have already typed that HTML so let's
copy this and paste it in our master
page basically this you know it's the
same HTML that we have just seen
so let's paste it right here and if you
flip this to the design we'll look at
that and home employee employer and
admin and let's actually run this once
more so that we can see all the menu
items in action look at that I have
employer I have admin so add user we go
to add user dot aspx all right now by
default if you look at this menu control
you know it's actually present in
vertical orientation but if you want it
in horizontal orientation so something
like this then how do we achieve that
simply set this orientation attribute
change that to horizontal if you don't
specify the orientation the default is
going to be vertical so if you look at
our menu control on the master page at
the moment we didn't specify any
properties for the menu control let's
actually format this HTML by selecting
the entire HTML and pressing control K
and
d so a menu control contains items let's
minimize the items look at this we only
have ID and run app attributes and we
didn't specify orientation so by default
it's going to be vertical orientation
but let's change the orientation to
horizontal and let's run this once more
so this is vertical orientation let's
see how horizontal because of you know
we don't have enough space that's why it
doesn't show properly here so let's do
this let's actually move that menu
control into the header so after the h1
tag here let's paste it right there and
let's run it we are on the master page
and we have run the project that's why
we are getting this page let's be on the
home page and then + ctrl f5 so that we
are redirected to home page now look at
that home employee employer and admin so
this is horizontal orientation all right
so let's actually put it back to where
it was
and let's reload this so it's present
here but let's change the orientation
let's get rid of that orientation
attribute all together so we should get
the default orientation which is
vertical
alright now by default static display
levels property is set to 1 this means
only the first level is statically
displayed so if you notice at the moment
this menu control that we are using you
know we have defined only two levels
that is you know this is the first level
root level and then once I select you
know how am i mouse over employee we
have another level that's it we don't
have any other level beyond that okay
and by default the static display levels
property is set to 1 meaning display
only the top level okay but for some
reason if you want the menu control to
appear like this you want to expand or
statically display all you know
basically both the levels of the menu
item then you would set that static
display levels to 2 so let's actually
set that and see it in action so static
display levels equals 2 and if we flip
this to the design mode you can see that
here itself
okay so let's save these changes and
let's refresh our vendor notice that we
have all the links there now since we
don't have another level we don't have
that little arrow but let's include
another level may be under uploads you
may and see if we get that little arrow
there so here we have upload resume menu
item and menu item can contain another
menu item
so let's actually copy the menu item
here and paste that inside upload a
resume a menu item and let's say this is
xxx
alright now let's flip this to the
design what Luther look at that upload
as you may has already got that little
arrow so let's save it and let's refresh
this and look at this when by mode might
you know how about my mouse over upload
is you maybe get that popped out and
obviously we don't have xxx dot aspx
page that's why we would we would get a
crash all right
so that's static display levels properly
and there's another interesting property
disappear after so to control the amount
of time it takes for the dynamically
displayed portion of the menu to
disappear then use disappear after so
basically if you look at let's actually
navigate to home dot aspx so at the
moment notice that when I move my mouse
over you know it stays for a little
little time that's basically the default
value for this property disappear after
is five hundred milliseconds if we don't
specify it but for some reason if you
want that menu item to be there for
let's say two seconds then you would
specify that as two thousand
milliseconds let's actually come here
and then specify let's actually get rid
of the static display levels and
specified disappear after two maybe two
thousand milliseconds meaning the menu
item the dynamically displayed portion
of the menu item is going to stay there
for two seconds once it is displayed and
after two seconds it's going to
disappear look at that it's there now I
move my mouse away look at that it's
there for two seconds and then it
disappears so depending on your project
requirement you can set that attribute
in our next video we'll discuss using
styles with this menu control so that it
is displayed properly alright that's it
for today thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
