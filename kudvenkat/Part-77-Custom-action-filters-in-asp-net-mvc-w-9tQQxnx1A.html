in this video well discuss creating
custom action filters let's take a step
back and understand what actions and
action filters are actions or public
methods in a controller action filters
are attributes that can be applied
either on a controller or on a
controller action method which allows us
to add pre and post-processing logic to
the action methods so in simple terms an
action filter allows us to execute some
custom code it adjusts before an action
method is executed or immediately after
an action method completes execution and
in the previous sessions of this video
series we have discussed about some of
the built-in action filters so as you
can see here we discussed about
authorized attribute and letter
attribute etcetera let's create a custom
action filter and the custom action
filter that we are going to build should
law the you know the information that
you can see here to a text file so for
example let's say when an action method
is executed then we want to log the name
of the controller in which that action
method is present and the name of the
action method itself and the execution
time and if at all if there is an
exception executing that action method
then we want to log the exception
message and the time of the exception so
the output has to be like this as you
can see here let's flip to visual studio
so here I have a blank a speed on an MVC
for application let's add a controller
and let's name it home controller now
before we actually build a custom action
filter let's understand the different
types of action filters that are
available in asp.net MVC
now the action filters in asp.net MVC
can be classified into four types
authorization filters so basically these
filters are used to implement
authentication and authorization
okay now the filters of this type
implement eye authorization filter so if
you remember we discussed about
authorized attribute so if I right-click
on this attribute and if we go to the
definition on that note is that it
implements I or
terrorization CELTA interface and if we
go to the definition on this interface
look at that this one method called
on authorization so you can tap into
this method and write your custom code
and keep in mind the authorization
filter runs before any other filter and
an example of you know the built-in
authorization filters or authorized
attribute require HTTP attribute which
we discussed in the previous sessions
and another type of action filters are
action filters which implement I action
filter now if you look at output cache
attribute now this output cache
attribute doesn't directly implement
this I action filter instead it
implements action filter attribute I
mean it derives from action filter
attribute abstract the class so this is
an abstract class and this class
implements I action filter okay and if
you look at this interface it has got
two methods on action executing and on
action executed so this method runs just
before an action method is executed and
this one runs immediately after an
action method is executed so we can tap
into these um you know we can override
these methods and then write plug in our
own custom code that we want to execute
in the different you know stages of the
processing pipeline okay so the next
filter types are result filter types
basically they implement a result filter
so if you look at this action filter
attribute it also implements a result
filter so this interface has got two
methods on result executing and on
result executed
so this own result executing method runs
before an action result is produced and
on result executed method runs
immediately after the action result is
produced again if you want to add some
logic before an action result is
produced then you can overwrite you know
this method
or if you want to you know execute some
custom logic immediately after the
action result is produced then we can
override this function and the final
type of filters are exception filters so
they implement I exception filter and an
example of this is handle error
attribute which we discussed in the
previous session so if you look at
handle error attribute so if we right
click on this one and go to the
definition so they implement the eye
exception filter so if I right click on
that and go to the definition look at
that there's one method called on
exception again we can tap into this
method and then find out what is the
exception that has occurred you know you
can get the exception message track
trace anything about that exception
basically so if you want to add any
custom logic when an exception occurs in
an application then probably you can
implement this interface all right so
now let's go ahead and create our custom
action filter because you know the
action filter that's that we are going
to create is going to track the
execution time and the exception details
let's call it track execution time you
know the name of the exception so let's
add a folder and let's name it common so
all our common code is going to go into
this folder and let's add a class file
and let's name it track execution time
dot CS
now first of all let's import the
required namespaces we need a system web
MVC so this class is going to inherit
just like you know of a output cache
attribute you know this class is
inheriting from this action filter
attribute class which is an abstract
class this class implements both I
action filter and I result filter so we
want to inherit from that abstract class
so action filter attribute class and
then since we also want to log you know
the exception details so we need to
override on exception method which is
basically present in I except ssin
filter interface so let's go and
implement that interface as well okay
now we want to log the exception details
to a text file so let's go ahead and add
a folder and let's call it maybe data
and then let's add a text file
click on general and then you should
have an option to add a text file let's
call this data okay so this is the text
file to which we will log the
information all right now first of all
let's include a private method in this
class and let's call it log execution
time and then we will give it some data
and all this method is going to do is
write the data to this text file and to
write you know to read and write from
files we need to import system dot IO
namespace so let's go ahead and import
that and then within system dot IO we
have a class called file class and then
there is a method called append all text
so I'm going to use that method and when
we use this method we have to specify
the file to which we want to append that
text so the file is present so we need
to use server dot map path function and
to get to that function I'm going to use
HTTP context dot current dot server dot
map path so within the root directory so
till indicates root directory within the
root directory we have a data folder and
within that we have a text file called
data dot txt so basically we want to
write the exception information to that
file and what is the not only the
exception information the execution time
as well and how are we going to get that
it's going to come into this function in
the form of a parameter so let's pass
this parameter to this method so this
method is going to take care of logging
the information to that text file now
since we are inheriting from this action
filter attribute abstract class if you
look at this class this class has
actually got this on action executing on
action executed on result executing and
on result executed all these methods and
if you remember you know these methods
gets invoked at different stages in the
processing pipeline okay so look at that
all of them are virtual methods meaning
they will have default implementation
but we can override that within our
class since we are inheriting from that
class okay so the moment I type override
and then when I press pace look at that
I get the option to override any of
these methods so on action executing
method which gets invoked just before an
action method is executed so what do I
want to do at this point I want to
retrieve the controller name they action
method name look at this we want the
output like this this home is the
controller name welcome is the action
method name and then this is the stage
in the processing pipeline so the action
method is about to be executed so on X
action executing and the date and time
okay
so first of all I need the controller
name and the action method name so how
do I get the controller name look at
this there is a parameter that's coming
into this
method so we can use that parameter and
if you look at that filter context so
you have you know action descriptor and
then you have action name which will
give us the name of the action method
that's about to be executed similarly if
you go to control there is a controller
descriptor then you have controller name
which will give us the name of the
controller so basically we can use these
properties and to speed things up I have
already typed that code so let me copy
this and paste it right here so if you
look at this it's a straightforward code
but just to speed things up you know I
have already typed this look at that
/n is basically 4 newline character okay
so start on a new line and then this
piece here gets the controller name
and then to that we are adding you know
the symbol force you know a dash and an
angle bracket because we want after the
controller name we want that symbol
there and then the action method name
and again they using this one to get the
action name and then again that symbol
there and then the stage within the
execution processing pipeline so we are
in action executing so that's what I am
printing their own action executing the
same the method name and then /t is for
a horizontal tab space so look at that
there's little you know tab space there
so that's achieved using that slash T
and then a dash and then to that we are
appending the current date and time and
then again we are using backslash n
which is like a newline character so
whatever we are going to write next will
be in its own line okay so so what do we
need to do now we need to pass you know
we are storing the string in this
variable message so we need to pass that
to log execution time method so let's go
ahead and pass it to log execution time
so that should lock the message to the
text file okay now similarly let's go
ahead and overwrite the rest of the
methods override so on action executed
this gets run immediately after the
action method is executed so all I'm
going to do is copy this one and paste
it right there okay since we already
have a newline character here I can get
rid of this one and here the stages on
action executed that is the action
method has just completed execution okay
let's go ahead and overwrite now on a
result executing so this is just before
action result is produced
let's copy this and paste it right here
now look at this here you know on result
executing so this is this a different
stage in the processing pipeline so this
filter context object that's coming here
look at the type of the object result
executing context so at this point we
will not have action descriptor property
you know there is no action descriptor
property on that class okay so how do I
get the controller name to get the
controller name we can use route data
here so filter context dot route data
dot values and from the road data you
can retrieve the controller name so what
is the key controller so that's going to
return the name of the controller okay
and similarly if I want the action
method name we use the same expression
but instead of controller we will pass
action and the stage here is on result
executing all right and the final method
that we need to override is on result
executed which will be fired immediately
after the action result is produced so
let's copy this and paste it right there
and the stage here is on result executed
so let's pass that there and then look
at this this class is also implementing
this I exception filter interface and if
you look at this interface it has got
one method on exception so we basically
need to provide the implementation for
that method so let's copy that and let's
go back to our class and then implement
that
so this is going to be a public method
and then when will this method be
executed in the processing pipeline
whenever there is an exception and if
you look at the filter context object
here you will get you know the exception
information so I have the exception
object there which is coming as a
property so I can retrieve the exception
message simply by saying message if you
want stacktrace
dot stack trace will give you that ok so
you have access to all kinds of
information all right so let's copy this
one
so again we are getting the controller
named action method name and then this
you know here the message is I want the
exception message to be logged okay
instead of the stage name so if there is
an exception I want the exception
message to be logged so how do I get
hold of the exception message use the
object that's coming into this one as a
parameter so filter context dot that's
because we are inside
so filter contacts dot exception dot
message should give us the message all
right and then the last thing that I
want to do is okay that we need a dotted
line as well so here to log execution
time method I'm going to pass the dotted
lines okay let's do the same thing if
there is an exception all right so now
let's go back to our home controller and
let's make this return a string and
let's say index action in loop that will
be returned back and then let's have
another action method and let's call it
maybe welcome and then here let's
actually throw an exception throw a new
exception and the exception message is
going to be maybe something like
exception occurred okay
now let's decorate these action methods
with our track execution time attribute
so the moment I open the bracket and
type TR look at that I don't get
intelligence that's basically because if
you look at this track execution time
custom action filter that we have built
it's present in a different namespace
and we see demo dot common so let's use
that within our home controller
so track execution time so let's copy
that and apply to a welcome method as
well so let's a build our solution okay
it says build fail let's see why it has
fair let's look at the error list
okay somewhere we are missing a comma
right there
alright let's build a solution and let's
navigate to localhost index so index
action method should be invoked and it
should log the information so it should
be successfully executed and then look
at that I get a message that data dot
txt file is modified when I click s2 all
and if we go back to the data file look
at that we see the information that we
expect okay
now let's try to invoke the Welcome
action and look at that there is an
exception of Islay on exception execute
it should be invoked look at that
there's an exception occurred so on
action executing on action executed they
completed I mean immediately after the
action is has completed execution there
was an exception and on action on except
on exception occurred on exception
method within our attribute gets called
and then it locks that information to
the text file okay and then if you want

of filters available in asp.net MVC then

have a lot of information about the
action filters
that's it for today thank you for
