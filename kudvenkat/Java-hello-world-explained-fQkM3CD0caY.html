last tutorial we created a simple hello
world program and also exhibited it from
the command prompt now that you would
also have created your own hello world
application and perhaps even compiled it
and run it you might be wondering how
does it work let's have a look at code
again now this was a simple hello world
program that had single main method with
a single statement that printed hello
world let's understand the nitty
gritties of this program in this hello
world program the first keyword which we
have written is public whenever a class
is public it means that the class is
visible to others or external
applications the class is keyword in
Java used to create a class here we have
created a class with the neat program
the main method is essentially an entry
point for the Java programs this method
here accepts a single argument which is
an array of strings so this is a way by
which runtime is able to pass some
information to the program these are
also called as command-line arguments
the single statement that we have
written in our hello world program is
system dot out dot println has a world
now system is a class from core library
what we are doing here is using the
method println from this code library
and passing it a message in a world so
that it prints it on the console window
now let's understand two more things
that are essential for Java programming
a lot of times you would like to
describe the program behavior in form of
comments Java allows you to specify
single line comment by typing slash
slash and the single line comment
similarly we also have a provision of
multi-line comments in Java let's try
this out
now this loss of a HelloWorld program
and let's create what's in the line
comment this is single line comment and
this is a multi-line comment
right a lot of times IDs will allow you
to create comments which will help in
generating a documentation those
comments are of this kind they will
learn how to create our documentation in
detail in our coming tutorials
let's compile this program so right now
I have a single program dot Java files
and I am using Java compiler Java C to
compile this program and as we have
discussed in our last tutorial this step
generates the dot class file which
contains the byte code and I can execute
this bytecode by typing our program so
the presence of command doesn't impact
the behavior of the java application the
compiler silently knows anything after
slash slash or anything between
multi-line comments I hope this is clear
in this tutorial we understood the
nitty-gritties of HelloWorld program we
also learnt how to add comments in our
java application next tutorial is going
to be extremely important because we are
going to understand the basic tenets of
classes and objects we will also learn
what are static and instance variables
something about attributes and methods
and also access modifiers so stay tuned
see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
