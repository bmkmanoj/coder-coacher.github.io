venket this is part one one two or phase
p.net video series in this video we'll
discuss about asp.net custom server
controls in the asp.net video series in
parts 104 to 111 we discussed about
building asp.net user controls if you
haven't watched those videos I would
strongly encourage you to do so before
continuing with the session at the link
that you can see here you can find all
the videos that are uploaded by me
arranged in a logical sequence into
YouTube playlist so if you want to find
parts 104 to one 11-foot asp.net video
series you can use the link that you can
see here so what's the type of control
that we're going to build today the
control looks something like this that
you can see in the image here it's going
to contain this text box image button
and the calendar when the composite
custom control that's when this calendar
control initially loads up on the page
the user should be able to see only the
text box and the image button the
calendar should be invisible on the
initial load and then when the user
clicks the image button that's when the
calendar should become visible and then
as soon as the user selects a date from
the calendar that selected date should
be populated into the text box and the
calendar should become invisible if you
remember in parts 104 to 111 we have
discussed about doing exactly the same
thing but as in user control as an
asp.net user control in this session
we'll discuss about rebuilding the same
control but as an asp.net composite
custom control and in later video
session we'll talk about the differences
between user controls and composite
custom controls in fact that's a very
important interview question let's see
how to build this control and another
important thing to keep in mind is that
when we are building the asp.net user
controls we had you know a graphical
designer to build the user interface of
that user control user control files
have the extension of dot asex
and then if we want to build this
interface graphically all we did was
drag and drop the text box button and
quell in the controls on to that asex
file but when we were building it when
we are building composite custom
controls you know you cannot build at
the user interface graphically like that
because
there is no designer associated with
composite custom controls so the user
interface of a composite custom control
has to be done completely in code okay
let's see how to actually do that let's
flip to visual studio the first thing
I'm going to do is to create a project
so file new project and then from the
install the templates section select web
and I'm going to choose asp.net server
control as the project type I'm going to
call this as custom controls and I'm
going to create that in C Drive so click
OK this should create an asp.net server
controller project and the first thing
that I'm going to do is rename the
server control one dot cs2 custom
calendar dot CS so I'm going to change
this to a meaningful file name so custom
calendar dot CS and that should give you
an alert message click S on that ok so
custom calendar dot CS and then I'm
going to get rid of all the code that I
have here the default code that's
generated by visual studio let's go
ahead and get rid of that and then I'm
going to delete this default property
attribute and then I'm going to retain
this toolbox data attribute now if you
don't understand the purpose of this
toolbox data attribute at the moment
don't worry we're going to talk about
this in our next video session when we
actually use this custom calendar
control in an asp.net web application
project ok but for now I'm going to make
a change to this toolbox data attribute
instead of having the server control one
I'm going to call this actually custom
calendar okay because our control is a
custom calendar control I'm going to do
the same thing for the closing okay now
this attribute is actually used to
render the default tag when we drag and
drop this custom composite custom
control from the toolbox onto a web form
as I told you if it's not clear at the
moment don't worry it will be much
clearer when we discuss about using this
composite custom control in an asp.net
web application project
a so that's the first change we have
done we have changed this tool box data
attribute to have a meaningful tag
custom calendar and then look at this
the custom calendar is actually a class
and the most important thing to keep in
mind here is that this custom calendar
is inheriting from web control but
remember we are going to build a
composite custom control so in asp.net
there is another class called composite
control class so I'm going to make my
custom calendar actually inherit from
composite control class so why are we
doing this because this base class the
composite control base class contains
all the functionality that is required
by any asp.net composite control so it
makes sense to make your rather than v3
implementing all those features again we
can actually inherit from that class and
we get all those functions okay for
example in a bit you will see what are
the different functions that we are
going to override to make this an
asp.net composite custom control okay so
that's the first step make your class
inherit from composite control base
class and then if you look at that the
calendar control the custom calendar
control it has three change controls the
textbox control the image button and the
calendar so we need all these controls
as change control so we need those
objects now if you remember if it was a
user control simply you drag and drop
the control from the tool blocks on to
the asex file but this is not a user
control this is a composite custom
control and these are created completely
in code so you can't really use a
graphical designer you have to do that
in code and we need these three change
controls text box image button and
calendar so let me go ahead and have a
declaration for those three chained the
controls so copy those and then within
my class I'm going to paste that so I
need a text box image button and
calendar okay now the next most
important thing to do is you know to
create the child controls itself so how
do I create change controls okay so this
custom calendar control is going to
contain all these three controls as
child controls we we have the
declarations for them but we need to
create these child control
okay so to create change controls we can
actually override a method that is
provided by this base class composite
control class okay so as soon as I type
override and then when I press space I
can see all the methods and properties
that we can override okay
so I want to override this method create
child controls method okay look at that
this create child controls is actually
coming from the control base class okay
so where is control base class our class
is actually inheriting from composite
control class it's not inheriting from
you know the control class but if you
look at this composite control class if
I right-click on that say go to
definition this composite control class
is inheriting from web control and web
control is actually inheriting from the
control base class so indirectly our
custom calendar class is inheriting from
the control base class and if you look
at the control base class it has got
this create child control so if I press
control left here and then type create
child controls and find next look at
that we have this create child controls
method defined as a virtual method in
that base control class now we need to
override that method in order to create
the child controls that that are going
to be part of our custom calendar okay
so type override and then space and then
create child controls now if you press
tab it's going to build the method
skeleton for us automatically okay so
what we are going to do here we are
going to create a child controls all we
need to do here is clear you know any
other controls that may exist using
control start clear proper method and
then I'll create an instance of the text
box image button assign IDs and then add
those controls to the controls
collection property of this custom
calendar control okay and that's what
this code is exactly doing here so let
me copy that just to save some time in
typing and paste that here so what's the
first line here the first line controls
start clear and if you look at the
intellisense what is it doing removes
all controls from the current server
controls control collection property so
remove any other controls and then what
we are doing we are creating an instance
of textbox giving it an ID and then
setting the width of the textbox to 80
pixels so that the textbox is not too
wide I am limiting the width of the
textbox so if you look at the width
property it's actually expecting a unit
so that's why we are passing in an unit
class and then pixel static method okay
so here the width of the textbox is 80
pixels and similarly image button we are
assigning an ID for that calendar
assigning an ID for that and finally
what we are doing we are actually adding
the child controls to custom calendar
control using you know the controls
collection property so to this instance
of this custom calendar add a textbox to
the controls collection property
similarly we are adding the image button
and the calendar so that's the second
step override create change the controls
method okay this one mode to do so all
we have done until now is created these
child controls in or declarations for
these children trolls you have we have
created them by overriding the clear
child controls method now the next step
is to actually render them to the client
and to do that we have to override
another method that is coming from this
base class okay so that's the render
method so again if we type override and
then press space visual studio should
show us all the methods that we can
override so render
okay so composite control class contains
this render method so I'm going to
override that press tab now it's going
to generate the you know these skeleton
for us automatically an important thing
to keep in mind here is that it takes in
HTML text writer object as an input
parameter which is actually going to
render these three controls for us all
we need to do right now is to render the
text box image put an end calendar
okay so let's copy-paste that piece of
code in that method and we are done okay
so very simple we are done actually
building the composite custom control
here three simple steps okay
create this project as an asp.net server
control project
give it give the file a meaningful name
in our case we call it custom calendar
dot CS and then within the tool box data
attribute give you a tag a meaningful
name and then make your class inherit
from the composite control base class
which contains all the functionality
required by any asp.net composite
control and then whatever are going to
be the child controls have declarations
for them
override create child controls method to
create those child controls and finally
overwrite the render method that's it
now in our next video session we'll
actually discuss about using on first
loading this composite custom control
into your tool box and then dragging and
dropping that custom control from the
tool box onto an asp.net web application
project and consuming it in that project
we'll discuss about that in our next
video session on this slide you can find
resources for asp.net c-sharp and sequel
server interview questions that's it for
today thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
