this video we'll discuss the jQuery
slide of each ad here is what we want to
achieve we want to increase and decrease
the font size using this jQuery slider
let's see how to achieve this so the
first thing to do here is to get that
slider widget on our page so I'm going
to include a div element let's give it
an ID let's set this to slider within
our jQuery ready function I'm going to
find the div element by ID so the idea
of the development is slider so we're
going to use the jQuery ID selector find
that and on that I'm going to call
slider function
let's save the changes and reload this
page so this should give us the jQuery
slider widget on this page now let's go
ahead and include an HTML break let's
include another development let's give
this an ID let's call this my dev I'm
also going to set this style attribute
I'm going to set the initial font size
to 20 pixels and let's include some text
here slider widget so let's save the
changes reload this page so as we keep
sliding the slider to the right we want
to increase the font size when we slide
it to the left we want to decrease the
font size now the slider widget has got
lots of options and events now I want to
enforce a minimum and a maximum value
for the slider by default the minimum
value of the slider is zero and the
maximum value is 100 for the purpose of
this demo we're going to set the minimum
value to 20 pixels because let's assume
the font size of this development cannot
go 20 pixels so let's set the minimum
value of the slider to 20 and to do that
I'm going to use a JavaScript object
passed our to the slider function and
the option that I'm going to use to set
the minimum value is min and the minimum
value is going to be 20 max value is
going to be 120 now when we slide
there's either to the right or the left
and even is triggered and that is slide
event so we want to handle that the
event so let's go ahead and specify that
so we want to handle the slide event so
let's associate a function with that
event so this is how I even handler
function this event handler function is
going to receive two parameters the
event itself is the first parameter and
the second parameter is going to be the
UI element that triggered the event in
this case we know that the dy element
that triggered this slide event is the
jQuery slider widget this object that is
the spirometer UI has got value property
which is going to give us the slider
value and we're going to use that value
said that as the font size for the
development so we need to find this
development this development has got an
ID so let's use the jQuery ID selector
find this development the idea of the
dev is my dev and on this I'm going to
call CSS function and let's specify the
CSS property that we want to set so the
CSS property that we want to set is font
- size and we want to set that to the
value you know that the slider has at
the moment and to get that value we can
use the second parameter UI so UI dot
value is going to give us the numerical
value of the slider but if you look at
the font size you know it's not just the
number we also need to append those two
characters px for pixels so I'm going to
append those two characters here px okay
so let's save the changes reload the
space and look at what's going to happen
when we move the slider to the right the
font size decreases and when we move it
to the left the font size decreases so
the slider widget has got loads of
options and events for the complete list
please visit this URL right here we've
already discussed this main option this
enforces the minimum value for the
slider the default if you don't specify
any is zero max specifies the maximum
value for the slider that
fault is 100 orientation this is going
to specify what type of slider do you
want do you want a horizontal slider or
a vertical slider the default is
horizontal if you don't specify one so
let's go ahead and specify orientation
as vertical so this should give us a
vertical slider let's save those changes
reload this page and we should get a
vertical slider and here we have the
events that the slider widget supports
start this event is triggered when the
user starts lighting stop trigger when
the user stops lighting slide triggered
on every Mouse move during slide let's
look at an example of handling these
three events start stop and slide so as
we slide this slider we want to display
the start/stop and slide values and for
that we need three developments so let's
go to and include those three
developments on the page so I'm going to
remove this development from here
include another death let's give it an
ID let's call this div start let's make
two more copies of this there and let's
call the second there they've stopped
and let's call the last dev dev slide so
we have caught those three developments
and as we slide what do we want to do we
want to find this development and
display the current slider value so the
idea of the developments is dev slide
and I'm going to use the HTML function
and let's up and the slack text slide
equals UI dot value okay so that should
give us the current slider value at that
point okay so I'm going to make two more
copies of this
so to handle start event they specified
an even name as the option here start
and we are associating a callback
function again this function receives
the same two parameters so here we want
to find div start development and it's
going to be start equals whatever is the
start value similarly we want to handle
this top event and in this case we want
to find a development with ID they've
stopped and the text is going to be
stopped equals whatever is the stop
value okay
so let's save the changes reload our
webpage so let's change the orientation
of the slider let's actually remove that
altogether by default we will get a
horizontal slider so let's reload this
page and look at this as we start
sliding we get start so we started at 20
that's the minimum value and we stopped
that 28 right and as we keep sliding
notice that the slight value keeps
increasing but not they start and stop
we started at 28 stopped at 50 and the
current slide value is 50 so we are
handing all the three events thank you
for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
