am thinking this is part 1 of a spirited
video series in this session we'll
understand what asp.net is what a web
application is alternative technologies
that can be used to build web
applications advantages of using web
applications and finally how asp.net web
applications actually work so what's
asp.net asp.net is a web application
framework developed by Microsoft to
build dynamic data-driven web
applications and web services what our
web services and how to actually build
web services we will worry about them in
a later session but for now understand
that asp.net is a framework you know
that's used to build web applications
and web services in fact asp.net is
actually a subset of the wider dotnet
framework now dotnet framework can be
used to do a variety of things for
example I can build different types of
applications using dotnet framework I
can build control applications web
applications Windows applications
Windows services etc so asp.net is the
subset of that wider dotnet framework
that can actually be used to build web
applications and web services now if
you're wondering what a framework is a
framework is nothing more than a
collection of pluses if we have to put
it in simple terms now we know that
asp.net is a subset of the dotnet
framework that can be used to build web
applications and web services now along
the same lines we have something else
called ad or dotnet now ad or dotnet is
that a different technology altogether
no again ad or dotnet is a subset of the
wider dotnet framework that can actually
be used to pull data from different
databases and then serve it up to a
console application or a web application
or a Bendel's application whatever so
any type of application that you build
if at all if you want to retrieve data
from data sources and then use the data
within your application
then you will use something called ad or
dotnet again ad or dotnet is not a
different technology altogether it is a
subset of the dotnet framework that can
be used to pull data
and then use that with your application
along the same lines asp.net is a subset
of the dotnet framework that can be used
to build web applications and web
services now
asp.net is introduced in the year 2002
with dotnet framework 1.0 now so we'll
be using any of the Microsoft technology
before the year 2002 to build web
applications absolutely so that
technology is called as classic ASP
active server pages now prior to dotnet
prior to asp.net we were using classic
ASP okay but then there are several
advantages of using asp.net over classic
ASP to build web applications which we
will be talking about in a later session
so what's a web application a web
application is an application that is
accessed by users using a web browser
for example you know to search something
on the internet I fire up a browser and
then I type in google.com so google.com
for example is a web application or I
want to do some internet banking and I
fire up a browser i type in berkeley
store co dot uk' meaning Barclays is a
web application there so any application
that is typically accessed by using a
web browser is called as a web
application and examples of browsers
include Internet Explorer from Microsoft
Chrome from Google Firefox from Mozilla
Safari from Apple Navigator from
Netscape so is asp.net the only
technology available to build web
applications no there are alternative
technologies as well which of you know
some of them include PHP Java CGI Ruby
on Rails Perl and there are many others
as well which we have not listed here so
what are the advantages of using web
applications over traditional desktop
applications now if you're looking for
examples of desktop applications
Microsoft Office is a classic example so
what are the advantages of using web
applications over these desktop
applications but the first advantage is
web applications just need to be
installed only
the web server whereas desktop
applications need to be installed on
every computer where you want to access
them okay let's take an example now
let's say in my organization I have
50,000 employees and I want every
employee to be able to access Microsoft
Office if that's the case then I will
have to have this Microsoft Office
installed on each and every computer so
50,000 computers just imagine how much
time and effort is it going to take to
install the software on 50,000 computers
but whereas if it's a web application
you don't have to install that on all
the 50,000 computers all you do is
install that on a web server and then
how will your users access that
application fire up the browser and then
type in the URL of the application and
you are able to access that application
there so similarly I mean if you want to
access Google web application you don't
have to literally install that
application on your machine on on a
client machine all you need is a browser
that can understand HTML as long as you
have the browser you can access that web
application okay and another advantage
obviously it's maintenance support and
patches are easier to provide for
example let's say there is a bug in the
application if it's a desktop
application so typically you fix that
bug and then if you want that bug to be
you know resolved on each and every
computer obviously that patch has to be
applied again on all the fifty thousand
computers just again imagine how much
time and effort is that going to take
whereas if it's a web application you
just apply that patch on the web server
and all your users who then fires up the
browser points the URL to the
application you know will now have that
upgraded or patched application so
maintenance support and patches are
easier to provide for web applications
than to desktop applications and on the
client machine you only require a
browser that can understand HTML you
don't need to install any other software
and web applications obviously they are
accessible from anywhere provided there
is an
it okay so I can access for example
google.com from my office
from my home wherever provided there has
to be internet obviously and another
greatest advantage is the cross-platform
meaning if I am developing Microsoft
Office on a Windows platform then I can
only run that Microsoft Office on a
Windows operating system if I try to run
it on any other operating system like
Mac OS or any other operating system it
fails to run but whereas web
applications as long as on that platform
you have a browser that can understand
HTML then you are able to access that so
it's accessible from cross-platform all
right now let us see you know what is
the architecture of a web application
and how actually web applications work
if you look at the diagram here we have
different clients users and then I have
a server here which has the web
application okay now if I want these
three users to be able to access that
web application I don't have to install
anything on these client machines on
these client machines all I need is a
browser that can understand HTML and I
install the web application on the web
server now if it's an asp.net web
application on the web server you
install something called IAS Internet
Information Services which we'll be
talking about in a later session so IAS
is basically used to host Microsoft
asp.net web applications so asp.net web
applications run under IaaS okay so
whenever I open a browser like this I
type in URL google.com and then when I
press Enter what's going to happen the
request goes via the Internet using a
protocol called HTTP HTTP standing for
hypertext Transfer Protocol so if you
look at this I actually use in the URL
HTTP colon forward slash forward slash
that's how the you know the full URL is
okay HTTP colon four slash four slash
world
right web www.mechkia.mccafferty.com
scam eunuch ate over the internet so we
are using the HTTP protocol to access
this application over the Internet and
then the request goes to the is okay is
will then you know process the request
it will do whatever it has to do if it
has to go and retrieve you know the data
from a database is will hand over that
request to the web application DLL if
you are not sure what a web application
DLL is don't worry about that they'll be
looking about you know into that in a
great detail in a later session and then
the web application goes to the web I
know database server retrieves the data
process the request and then generates
the HTML gives it back to the IAS is
will then return that back to the client
who actually requested that page okay so
basically if you look at this web
applications use a client-server
architecture on the client all you need
is a browser on the server you install
web application you know web
applications are hosted using iis okay
and then when you make a request you
make that using a browser using the
protocol HTTP that gets transmitted
across the Internet to the web server
which receives the request
hence the request over to the web
application which will process the
request generate the HTML and then gives
it back to the IAS is will then return
that HTML back to the client who
initially requested that and we know
that a browser can understand HTML the
browser will interpret that HTML you
know and shows that to the user keep in
mind we know that we can use different
technologies to build web applications
ok PHP Java CGI etc but
remember a browser that a user is using
to access the web application can only
understand HTML now I don't care what
your web application is doing or which
technology you have used to build that
web application at the end of the day
the web application has to emit HTML
that can be understood by the browser
okay so when that HTML is received by
the client browser
you know the browser can interpret that
HTML and displays that to the user on
the slide you can find resources for
asp.net c-sharp and sequel server
interview questions that's it for today
thank you for listening
