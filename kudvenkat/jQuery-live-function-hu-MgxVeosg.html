this video well discus jQuery live and
die functions we discussed how to
perform event delegation using on method
in part 36 and using delegate method in
part 37 another way to perform event
allegation is by using the live function
with on and delegate functions the even
gets bubbled up to the specified parent
element whereas with live function the
event gets bubbled up all the way to the
document object let's understand what we
mean by this statement with an example
let's flip to visual studio this is the
same example that we worked with in the
previous video session notice that at
the moment we using delegate function to
perform event delegation and if you look
at the HTML this unordered list element
is the parent of these two list items
and within the jQuery code notice that
we are attaching a single click event
listener to the parent element that is
to the unordered list element and look
at the selector Li so this is going to
match all the descendant list items so
if we trigger a click event on any of
these list items that even gets bubbled
up all the way to the parent element
that is to the unordered list element
and since we have added a click event
listener to the unordered list element
this unordered list element is going to
process that click event okay so with
delegate and on functions the even gets
bubbled up to the specified parent
element so here the specified parent
element is the unordered list element
whereas with live function the event
gets bubbled up all the way to the
document object in fact when we use live
function to perform event delegation we
don't specify the parent element let's
look at an example of using loop
function to perform even delegation so
instead of all this code we want to find
list items and we want to use live
function to perform event delegation
look at this the intelligence does not
show up live function why is that that's
because loop function is completely
removed in jQuery 1.9 and at the moment
we are using jQuery version 1.1 so live
function will not be available in that
version
so let's use a previous version of
jQuery let's use for example take 31.7
now previous versions of jQuery can be
found on Microsoft CDN here is the URL
for Microsoft CDN
I'll have this link available on my blog
in case you need it so let's click on
this link which says jQuery releases on
the CDN and here you can find jQuery 2
dot X versions and if you scroll down a
bit further you can find all jQuery one
dot X versions and if you scroll down
further let's say we want to use jQuery
version 1.7 here is the URL so let's
copy that
and within visual studio I'm going to
comment this script element which is
referencing in a jQuery 1.11 that's
present within our project instead of
that I'm going to use another script
element specify the source element and
we are going to use this version of
jQuery that's present on Microsoft CDN
all right now look at this when we press
dot we should play at intelligence and
we see the live function okay so the
event is click and when click event
occurs we want to call a function and
here is the function and what do we want
to do we want to slowly fade out the
list item so to refer to the element on
which the click event is triggered I am
going to use this keyword and let's call
fade-out function and the speed is going
to be 500 milliseconds okay so here we
are using Live function to perform event
delegation and to stop even delegation
at the moment we're using undelete
function instead of that we can use Die
function ok so again with Die function
we don't specify the parent of context
element so we don't require that
unordered list instead of that I'm going
to use Li and I'm going to use Die
function and then you know click event
is the one that we want to stop
delegating so we specify the name of the
event click
all right so let's save those changes
reload this page and see if this is
going to work in the same manner so I'm
going to add couple of new list items so
these two are dynamically added the
first two items are the ones that are
already present and look at this when I
click on the list item it slowly fades
out both the existing one and the
dynamically added one now let's go ahead
and stop even delegation so I'm going to
click this button under legate so now it
should have stopped the event delegation
so when I click on list item look at
that it doesn't fade out and even the
new list item doesn't fade out when we
click on that so here we are using live
and die functions live function to
perform even delegation and die function
to stop event delegation but keep in
mind you know whatever you can achieve
with live function you know you can
achieve with on function live function
is deprecated intake very 1.7 and
completely removed in jQuery 1.9
everything that can be achieved with any
of these three methods that is live bind
and delegate we could achieve using on
function so if you're using jQuery
version 1.7 or higher then jQuery
recommends to use on function instead of
using any of these three functions live
bind or delegate and here's the to our
URL for the Microsoft CDN thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
