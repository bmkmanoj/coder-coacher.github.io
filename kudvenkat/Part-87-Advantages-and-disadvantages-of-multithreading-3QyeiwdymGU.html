this video we'll discuss the advantages
and disadvantages of multi-threading
this is continuation to part 86 so
please watch what 86 before proceeding
advantages of multi-threading to
maintain a responsive user interface for
example let's say in our application we
have caught a function that takes a long
time to complete in that case we can
fire off another thread and make that
thread responsible for executing the
time-consuming function so that the main
thread that is the user interface thread
is free to maintain a responsive user
interface we discussed doing exactly the
same thing in the previous session of
our video series we can also use
multi-threading to make efficient use of
processor time while waiting for IO
operations to complete and to split
large CPU bound tasks to be processed
simultaneously on a machine that has
multiple processors or multiple cores
since a machine that has multiple
processors or multiple cores is capable
of executing multiple threads
simultaneously multi-threaded
applications can significantly improve
the performance there are also
disadvantages of multi-threading on a
single processor or single core machine
threading can affect performance
negatively as there is overhead involved
with something called context switching
now let's try and understand what we
mean by context switching for example
let's say we have a task and that task
takes 10 seconds to complete now in a
single threaded application you know the
processor let's say it it allocates all
of its time to that a single thread so
in 10 seconds that task is completed now
let's say instead of you know the single
threaded application we are creating a
multi-threaded application and let's say
we are creating 5 threads to complete
that task so what happens at this time
the processor has to allocate its time
equally among all those 5 threads so
let's say for example the processor
allocates 2 seconds you know initially
for the first thread and then after the
2 seconds has
labs you know the processor has to
switch from the first thread to the
second thread so that's called context
switching and there is little time
involved in switching between threads so
the total time to actually complete the
task is 10 seconds and there's little
time involved you know switching between
the threads okay so that adds up to the
total time to complete the task so on a
single processor or single Co machine
threading can actually take longer time
to accomplish the same task now
obviously we have to write more lines of
code to accomplish the same task with
multi-threading and multi-threading
applications in general are difficult to
write they're difficult to understand
debug and maintain that's why use
multi-threading only when the advantages
of doing so outweigh the disadvantages
that's it for today thank you for
listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
