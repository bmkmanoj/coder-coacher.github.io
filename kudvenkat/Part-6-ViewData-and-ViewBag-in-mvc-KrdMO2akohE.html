venket this is part 6 of asp.net MVC
tutorial in this video we'll discuss
view data and viewbag in MVC please
watch part 5 of this video series before
proceeding with this video because we'll
be working with the example that we
discussed in part 5 now both view data
and view bag I used to pass data from a
controller to a view in fact if you
remember in part 5 we actually use this
view bag object to store the list of
countries within this dynamic property
countries and we are doing that with
this controller action method and look
at what we are doing in the view we're
using the view bag objects countries
property to pull the countries that we
have stored and then print them so
basically we're using this view bag
object to pass data from this controller
to this view okay but remember this view
bag object uses the dynamic feature that
was introduced in c-sharp 4.0 so this
dynamic feature allows an object to have
properties dynamically added to it what
do we mean by that look at this property
here countries you know this is a
dynamic property meaning this property
is defined on the fly okay so you can
give any any property name that's
meaningful here okay I just happen to
choose countries but you can you can
give it something like countries list
you know something like that if you want
so this is a dynamic property and the
downside of these dynamic properties is
that they don't provide a compile time
error checking meaning let's say for
example if I specifies countries list
here then when I am retrieving them you
know I have to use the same property if
you misspell that for example here I am
using countries list but Here I am
saying just countries and if I run this
what's going to happen as you might
expect we get a null reference exception
and why is that because look at this we
are trying to retrieve you know
something out of this countries property
while there is nothing in that property
ok look at this when I actually build
this I don't get any compiler error look
at on the status bar it says
will succeeded so I will not know about
you know the compile time errors but
then when I actually run the application
look at what's going to happen in
countries property the dynamic property
of this viewbag object there is nothing
so that's why I get a null reference
exception when I try to convert that
into a string okay so this viewbag
object it doesn't provide any compile
time error checking what's about view
data now look at this this is how we use
view back object viewbag dot and then
you give a dynamic property name and
then to in that property you are saying
some data but whereas if you want to use
view data you don't use properties
dynamic properties like this instead you
use stringer keys okay so you use a
square bracket there and then you
specify you a key name now if you look
at the syntax it's very much similar to
that of a view state sessions data
application state we discussed about
view state session state application
state names p.net video tutorial so if
you're new to them please watch those
videos there but the syntax here of
using view data is very much similar to
them okay again I can use this view data
to actually pass data from a controller
to a view let's quickly look at an
example now let's say instead of using
view bag I want to use new data so view
data and then I can use the square
bracket there define our key so I'm
going to call this key country's you can
give it any meaningful key that you want
okay and then to retrieve the data out
of hat within the view you use the same
key there so view bag
I mean view data of countries but then
if you look at what is the return type
of this you know what you can store
anything into view data just like a view
state or session state or application
state you can store anything and
everything into this view data object so
that's why the return type is object but
we know what we are expecting back
we are expecting a list of string back
so that's what is the type I want to
cast it to by using this typecast
operator so if I run this now as you
might expect it's going to work in the
same way here instead of using view bag
we are actually using
you data okay so obviously when this web
when this form renders we should have
the list of countries printed okay so
both view data and view bag does not
provide compile time error checking for
example if you misspell kids are
property names so if in case of view
data if I misspell the key name look at
that
instead of using view data of countries
if I misspell it new data of countries
one what do you think is going to happen
you know we get again a null reference
exception okay so at compile time this
view data and view bag they don't report
any errors okay we only get to know
about those errors at run time it's
dangerous just imagine what's going to
happen if we didn't detect those errors
at testing during testing and then we
deploy our application to production
servers and users start using them and
then if we have these runtime errors and
it doesn't look that great okay so
that's why anytime we want to pass data
from a controller to a view it's always
a good practice to use strongly typed
view models we learn more about strongly
typed view models in a later video
session but understand you know it's
possible to pass data using I mean from
a controller to a view using new data
and view back but in reality we don't I
mean it's not a good practice to use
them for that purpose alright and you
know internally the view bag properties
are actually stored as name value pairs
in the view data dictionary okay so here
view data uses keys and view bag uses
properties but these properties
internally they're stored as name name
value pairs
alright on this slide you can find
resources for asp.net c-sharp and
sequence of interview questions that's
it for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
