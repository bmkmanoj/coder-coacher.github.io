questions and answers video series in
this video we'll discuss the difference
between ease and ask keywords so what's
the difference
ease operator returns true if an object
can be cast to a specific type otherwise
falls as operator attempts to cast an
object to a specific type and returns
null if it fails let's understand the
difference between these two with a few
examples all of our examples will be
based on these three classes so notice
that we've got employee permanent
employee and contract employee classes
permanent employee and contract employee
classes are deriving from the same base
class employee now if you look at the
code on the left hand side here we are
creating an instance of the employee
class and populating these two
properties ID and name and notice that
here we have caught an expression we are
checking if the employee object is
employee okay of type employee now
whether this expression is going to be
evaluated to a true or a false that
depends on whether if this employee
object can be typecast to type employee
now here employee object is already of
type employee so that caste can be done
so that expression is going to return
true but look at the expression right
here EMP is permanent employee we are
checking here if the employee object can
be cast to permanent employee now
permanent employee is the derived type
employee object is of type you know the
bass time can be typecast based types to
derive types that's not possible so this
expression right here is going to return
false okay
to speed things up I already have typed
this code within Visual Studio so let's
flip to Visual Studio so if you look at
another code right here we have those
three classes which we have seen on the
slides and then within our main method
we are creating an instance of that
employee class and notice that here we
are checking of the employee object is
employee so this expression is going to
be true
whereas this expression will be false
because we cannot typecast an object of
type employee to permanent employee same
is the case with this expression as well
okay so let's go ahead and run
this and see what output we get look at
that it says Marquis employee mark is
not permanent employee mark is not
contract employee okay so that's our
first example let's look at another
example of using the es operator so here
what are we doing we are creating and
new instance of the permanent employee
object okay
so let's actually look at this in action
so what we are going to do here is you
know the reference variable is going to
be you know base type but here I am
actually going to create an instance of
the derived class you know permanent
employee all right now
what do you think is this expression
going to return it's going to return
true why and now this is already of type
employee so this expression will be true
anywhere though we have you know the
actual object to which this reference
variable is pointing to is of type
derived is of derived type but the
reference variable is of parent type so
the object is anyway typecast it to the
no base type there now can this
reference variable be typecast to derive
type absolutely because the object that
it is pointing to is of derived type so
this casting can be done so this
expression is going to be true which
means it's going to print mark is
permanent employee because within the
name property we have mark so m dot name
will print mark is permanent employee on
the other hand can we do this type
casting no we can't we can't convert an
object of type permanent employee to
contract employee okay so that is going
to be false which means it will print
this line mark is not contract employee
so let's go and run this and see that's
what is the output we get so mark is
employee mark is permanent employee mark
is not contract employee so basically
this is operator is going to check
whether the typecasting can be done if
the typecasting can be done it's going
to return true otherwise it's going to
return false
all right so what is this as operator
the as operator attempts to cast an
object to a specific type and returns
null if it fails so let's look at a few
examples again and to speed things up I
have typed the code already within the
notepad that you can see on the slide so
let's copy that code first and then
paste it within the visual studio and
then we'll go over it so again these
examples will also be based on those
three classes employee permanent
employee and contract employee so notice
what we are doing here we're creating an
instance of type in our base type that's
employee class and then we are you know
look at this here we are trying to
convert that to permanent employee EMP
as permanent employee so what is the SAS
operator going to do it's going to try
to typecast this employee object to type
permanent employee can that be done no
we cannot we cannot typecast base type
to the derived type so the casting is
going to fail that means it's not going
to throw an exception this as operator
is going to return null meaning
permanent employee will be null so here
we're checking permanent employees now
then print permanent employees now
otherwise it's going to print permanent
employees not now
and similarly further down we are trying
to convert employee object to contract
employee again can this conversion be
done no why because employee object is
of type employee which is our base type
we cannot typecast base types to derive
the types because the actual object
there is of base type so that caste
cannot be done okay
so again here contract employee will be
you know this reference variable will be
null meaning this line will be printed
so let's look at this in action so
that's exactly the code that I have
right here so let's run this and it
should print permanent employee is now
contract employees now right now let's
change this program slightly so what we
are going to do is instead of on this
slide you have seen
this reference variable is pointing to
an object of type employee instead of
that we are going to change the actual
object to permanent employee so though
the reference variable here is of the
base type it's actually pointing to a
derived class object so let's see what's
going to be the behavior now so here we
are going to say permanent employee so
base class reference variable pointing
to derived class object now employee
object as permanent employee so here we
are trying to typecast this employee
object to permanent employee can we do
that absolutely why the actual object
that this reference variable is pointing
to is actually of derived a type so this
conversion can be done so here it is
going to print a permanent employees not
now okay and further down we are trying
to typecast the employee object to
contract employee can that be done no it
cannot there are different objects okay
so first of all you can't typecast you
know permanent employee to contract
employee you know the those are two
different types so here contract
employee will be null which means it's
going to print contract employee is now
so let's go ahead and look at this in
action so permanent employee is North
now contract employees nob alright and
this is a final example so again I have
this code here so let's copy and paste
this within visual studio and then we'll
quickly go over that so let's paste that
within the main method and let's review
what we have on the slide so basically
here we're creating two instances one of
type permanent employee the other of
type r contract employee so EMP one EMP
- and what are we doing here
look at this we are trying to convert
object employee one to the base type is
that possible absolutely derived types
can behave like your base types okay so
this conversion will be successful so
employee one
not be now so employee one is not null
will be printed and same is the case
with EMP to s bar
so EMP two we are trying to convert that
to the base type is that possible
absolutely you know derived types can be
converted to base type so both permanent
employee and contract employee classes
are inheriting from the employee base
class so we can convert the derived
types to the base type so in both of
these cases you know it's going to print
employee one is not now an employee two
is not now and I have the exact same
program right here so let's go ahead and
execute this and see if we get that
output so employee one is not an
employee - it's not now alright so to
cast you know an object of one type to
another time there are two ways we can
do that one we can use the as operator
the other one is to actually use the
typecast operator and what is a typecast
operator you know it's those parentheses
okay so notice that here we have got a
very simple example of creating an
instance of an employee class and then
we are trying to convert that employee
object to permanent employee using the
typecast operator now can this
conversion be done in the first place no
we cannot do that so what is going to
happen when we use the typecast operator
if the conversion cannot be done
the typecast operator is going to throw
an exception so it's going to throw that
invalid cast exception let's actually
look at that in action so here let's
actually create an instance of let's get
rid of this code from here so within the
main method let's simply create an
instance of an employee class let's call
it EMP equals new employee and let's set
ID equals 1 0 1 and name equals mark
okay and let's try to typecast this to
permanent employee so we are using the
typecast operator here and let's say
permanent employee and let's call it
permanent employee so now since this
conversion can be cannot be done notice
this when we run the set runtime we are
going to get that invalid cast exception
now if we try to use as operator still
you know we are trying to typecast the
employee object to permanent employee
which cannot be done so here this as
keyword is not going to throw an
exception instead it will simply return
null so if we run this we are not going
to get any exception but when you check
this reference variable this will be now
why because this conversion cannot be
done so that's the main difference
between cast operator and as operator
cast operator throws an exception if the
conversion cannot be done whereas the as
operator returns now if the conversion
cannot be done that's it for today thank
you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
