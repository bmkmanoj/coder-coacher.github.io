video we'll discuss implementing paging
using skip and take link operators let's
understand this with an example let's
flip to visual studio here I have a new
console application all I have done so
far is created the student class with
these three properties student ID name
and total marks in addition to these
three properties we also have the static
method get all students which returns
list of student objects and if we look
at the implementation within the method
we have created a variable of type list
of student and this list at the moment
contains 11 student objects and finally
the method returns that list back all
the students that are present within
this list are represented here notice
the student IDs they start from 1 0 1
and go all the way till 1 11 so there
are 11 students now what we want to do
is design a console application and then
display these students in pages for
example the program should prompt the
user to enter a page number now if you
look at the total number of records here
we have 11 records let's say we want to
display three students per page now
since we have 11 students there will be
a maximum of 4 pages on the fourth page
we will have just two students displayed
so the program should prompt the user to
enter a valid page number between 1 and
4 now if the end user enters a valid
page number then the program should
display the correct set of records now
here since we entered one on the first
page we are going to have records from 1
0 1 2 1 0 3 and notice that they are
displayed and then the program should
immediately again from the user to enter
page number between 1 to 4 now here I
notice that the end user has entered
number 10 now do we have 10 pages no we
don't so that's not a valid page number
so if that's the case the program should
display a message stating page number
must be an integer between 1 and 4 and
then again it should prompt the user to
enter the page number let's say for
example the end user has entered you
know
some input that is not an integer for
example ABC now that's not a valid page
number either so even in that case we
should display a message stating page
number must be an integer between 1 &amp;amp; 4
now here notice that end-user has
entered 3 so on the third page we are
displaying records from one zero seven
two one zero nine so let's see how to
achieve this using skip and take link
operators so let's select region studium
and within the main method the first
what we want to do is create a variable
of type I in numerous student and then
let's call this students and then we'll
make use of our student class and then
invoke this get all student static
method which is going to return us all
the students so this collection right
here should now have 11 students now
what we want to do is prompt the user to
enter a valid page number so console dot
write line we will print this message to
the console screen please enter page
number that's between one two three or
four and then what we are going to do
here is create a variable of type
integer let's call it page number and
let's initialize that to zero so now the
user is going to enter the page number
on the console screen so we need to read
that from the console so let's use
console dot readline now that will be
read as a string so we need to convert
that to an integer what I'm going to do
is actually use tryparse method so try
passing the string that we have read
from the console if the parsing is
successful then store the result in page
number variable so this parameter is
going to receive the integer that the
end user has entered and if you look at
what this method returns it returns true
or false so if the parsing is successful
that means the end user has entered a
valid integer in which case we should
display the correct set of student
records on the console else if it's not
a valid integer then what we want to do
is display
an error message to the end-user and
what we want to display is this message
page number must be between an integer
must be an integer between 1 and 4 all
right so here you know if it comes into
the f-block we know that the end user
has entered a valid integer but we need
to ensure that integer falls between 1
and 4
so if page number is greater than or
equal to 1 and page number less than or
equal to 4
if that condition is true then we should
display the correct set of student
records else again we should display the
same message so let's copy and paste it
right here all right now let's specify
our page size so let's set page size
first to 3 because we want to display 3
records per page so now we have page
number we have paid size so we should
retrieve the correct set of records from
this collection so how do we do that we
should do that by using skip and take
methods so students dot skip so now
let's say for example if the end user
has entered page 1 then we should
display the first set of 3 records right
1 2 3 1 0 1 2 1 0 3 now for that we we
shouldn't skip any records right any
rows so what we are going to do to
achieve that is take the page number
subtract minus 1 and then multiply that
with page size so that is the number of
rows that we want to skip right so page
number if the end user enters 1 1 minus
1 is 0 0 into 3 is going to return 0 so
if the page number is 1 then we want to
skip 0 items and then take how many
items we want to take 3 items which is
nothing but our page size that's it and
what is this method going to return and
it's going to return
enumerable of student so let's use a
variable of that type and store the
result in a variable called result now
all that is left is to print you know
whatever records or whatever objects we
have in this result variable so before
that let's actually print an empty line
and then we also want to print a message
you know stating which page we are
showing to the user currently so let's
say displaying page whatever is the page
number and then we are going to use a
for each loop so for each student let's
call it s n result collection what we
want to do is display student ID and
then let's display a tab space using
backslash t escape sequence and then
student name and then student total
marks all right
okay so when we actually run this let's
also plant another empty line here now
when we actually run this you know the
program prompts the user to enter a page
number now look at this when I enter
page number one we get the first set of
records from 1 0 1 2 1 0 3 and then the
program terminates right now let's
actually put this program in an infinite
loop so that we can enter as many page
numbers as we want so let's use a
do-while loop here so we want to do all
this whatever we have written so far
while 1 equals 1 this means this loop is
never going to end so the program will
be in an infinite loop so if we want to
end the program we have to close
you know the console vendor the program
is now in infinite loop because of this
condition because this condition is
never going to become false in reality
if you want to end another program you
may ask the user you know a question do
you want to stop the program yes or no
if he enters yes then you know you may
stop the program right now please enter
a page number let's enter for example 10
that's not a valid page number so it
says page number must be an integer
between 1 and 4 please enter a page
number let's enter ABC again we get the
same error now let's enter a valid page
number number 1 so you should display
the first set of records from 1 0 1 2 1
0 3 if I enter page number 3 then it
should display records from 1:07 to 1 0
9 if I enter the last page then on the
last page we only have 2 records right
if I enter 2nd page then it should
display records from 1 0 4 2 1 0 6 so we
have just implemented paging using skip
and take link operators that's it for
today thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
