video we'll discuss resolving a deadlock
in a multi-threaded program this is
continuation to about 95 so please watch
part 95 before proceeding there are
several techniques to avoid and resolve
with deadlocks
for example acquiring logs in a specific
defined order using mutex class or
monitored or try enter method in this
video we'll discuss acquiring locks in a
specific defined order to resolve a
deadlock we'll be working with the same
example that we worked with in the
previous session this is the program
that we worked with in the previous
session at the moment this program is
deadlocked first let's try and
understand why there is a deadlock
situation now for thread 1 the from
account is account a and to account is
account B and for thread 2 from account
is account B and to account is account a
and look at this code within the
transfer method we are first locking the
from account so when thread 1 comes in
thread 1 is going to lock the from
account and the from accounts our thread
1 is account a so thread 1 has locked
account a and then thread 1 goes in to
sleeping at the same time you know we
have thread 2 already started and for
thread 2 from account is account B so we
are locking account B for thread 2 so at
the moment thread 1 locked
account a threat to locked account B
then when thread 1 in or comes out of
sleep it tries to acquire lock on
account B which thread 1 has already
locked
similarly when thread 2 comes out of
sleep it tries to acquire a lock on
account a which thread 1 has already
locked so both of these threads are
waiting for each other to release their
respective locks but that would never
happen and that's why we have a deadlock
situation so how are we going to resolve
this deadlock by defining a specific
order in which the locks can be acquired
and that's what the code on the right
hand side is doing so the transfer
method is going to change to what we see
on the right hand side here so instead
of hard-coding the from account to
account like this what we are doing is
we are creating two reference variables
of
type object and then we are saying okay
if the prime account dot ID is less than
two account ID then lock one is going to
be from account lock two is going to be
to account if that condition is not true
then lock one is going to be true
account and block two is going to be
from account and then we have removed
that hard coding here notice that we are
saying lock lock one and lock lock two
so the account IDs are going to
determine you know in what order we
acquire locks so let's see how this is
going to resolve the deadlock so let's
flip to your studio and to speed things
up I have already typed the code that
you have seen on the slide so let's copy
this and then from these slides I have
removed the console dot write lines
statements to keep it simple so let's
paste that code right here okay it's the
same code that we have discussed on the
slide and we also need to remove the
hard coding here so instead of
explicitly saying from account let's
pass lock one there and let's pass lock
two here now since we have removed the
hard coding you know from here and here
we also need to remove it from here as
well otherwise we'll have inconsistent
output so we are now having lock so we
are you know whatever thread comes in
that thread is trying to acquire a lock
on the object that is being referenced
by this lock one so we know lock one is
of type account so let's type cast it of
type 2 type account and then retrieve
its ID so let's copy that piece of code
and here we are saying thread whatever
thread acquired lock on you know once
the code enters this block then it means
it has that particular thread has
acquired lock on the object being
referenced by this lock object okay and
here you know we are trying to acquire a
lock on an object that is being
referenced by this reference variable so
here instead of saying to account we
will say
you know lock to typecasted of to of
type account and then retrieve the ID
out of set and similarly once you know
the thread enters this block it means it
has acquired a lock on the object that
is being referenced by lock to reference
very well so let's get rid of this code
right here and then let's actually copy
this piece of code and paste it here so
console dot readline whatever thread
acquired lock on lock - okay and then
let's also have a controller tradeline
statement here so what is this going to
do this controller trade line statement
is going to tell us you know whatever
thread transferred the amount from the
from account to the to account okay
because we are withdrawing the money
from from account and depositing it
within the to account alright with this
change let's go to and run this okay
there are builders let's see what are
they ok unable to copy the file that
could possibly be because the program is
in a deadlock so let's close that and
let's run it once again okay look at
that main started thread one trying to
acquire lock on one zero one and thread
one acquired lock on one zero one thread
one is suspended for one second and at
the same time thread - look at that it
is also trying to acquire lock on one
zero one which thread one has already
acquired so thread two at the moment is
going to be blocked because thread one
has acquired lock on one zero one object
so let two can't acquire it at the same
time so thread one while thread two is
waiting to acquire a lock on one zero
one thread one you know came back from
sleep and then trying to acquire lock on
one zero two now thread two has not
acquired any lock on one zero two so
thread one is going to acquire lock on
one zero two and then thread one
transferred thousand from 1 0 1 2 1 0 2
so that's what we have
defiant so forth red one so the ten our
main method so thread one we are saying
transfer thousand from one zero one
account to one zero two account okay and
that's shown here and once that is done
what's going to happen thread one is
going to release locks on 1 0 1 and 1 0
2
as a result thread 2 will acquire so
thread 2 has been waiting to acquire
lock on 1 0 1 once thread 1 has released
the lock on one zero one object thread 2
is going to acquire the lock on 1 0 1
and it goes into sleep for a second and
it comes back into action tries to
acquire lock on 1 0 2 object it acquires
the lock and then transfers 2000 from 1
0 to 2 1 0 1 notice the order in which
the locks are acquired by these threads
thread 1 acquired lock first on 1 0 1
and then on 1 0 2 similarly thread to
first acquire look at that thread -
trying to acquire lock on 1 0 1 so
thread to also acquired locks in the
same order from 1 0 1 account first and
then on 1 0 to account next so when we
define a specific order to acquire locks
then you know the possibility of having
deadlocks is reduced alright that's it
for today thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
