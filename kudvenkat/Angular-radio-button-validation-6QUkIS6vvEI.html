in this video we'll discuss radio
buttons validation with an example here
is what we want to do we want to make
this gender field a required field if
none of the radio buttons are selected
we want to display this validation error
message gender is required as soon as we
select one of the radio buttons the
validation error message should
disappear notice on our create employee
form we have the gender radio buttons
right here
at the moment this field is not a
required field and to make it a required
field let's include a required attribute
on both these radio buttons so let's
flip over to visual studio code here is
the male radio button let's make it
required by including the required
attribute along the same lines let's
make the female radio button also
required next let's create a template
reference variable let's name it
gender let's do the same thing with our
female radio button as well next we are
going to use bootstrap to style the
validation error messages we are going
to use this agenda template reference
variable in our class binding so on this
development we are going to use a class
binding and this is how the class
binding looks like so if the gender
field is touched and if it is invalid
then we want to add this bootstrap CSS
class has error to this development that
has the form group class on this label
element that displays the static text
gender we are going to use another
bootstrap class and that is control
label class they using this class to
style the field text which is gender in
this case finally we have to display the
validation error message itself for that
they're going to use this span element
notice the ng if structural directly
right here if the gender field is
touched and if it is invalid then this
panel element that displays the
validation error message is added to the
Dom otherwise it is removed as you can
see validating radio buttons is very
similar to validating text boxes we
discussed validating text boxes you know
this video first we include the
validation attributes like required min
length pattern etc on the field that we
want to validate and then we create a
template reference variable by exporting
the ng model directive we then use that
template reference variable in the class
binding and then on this pan element
that actually displays the validation
error message so let's save our changes
and then take a look at the browser
notice we have our gender field right
here but we don't see the validation
error message that's because for the
validation error message to show up both
these conditions must be true that
gender field must be touched and it must
be invalid we know at the moment the
gender field is invalid because we made
both these radio buttons required and at
the moment none of the radio buttons are
selected and for the validation error
message to show up we also want to make
this touched property true and for that
to become true the field should receive
and lose focus without having any of the
radio button selected so let's click
within the phone number text box press
tab key notice at the moment the focus
is on contact preference now when I
press the tab key one more time the
focus is on the gender field when I
press the tab key again notice we see
the validation error message gender is
required and as soon as we select one of
the radio buttons the validation error
message disappears as expected
now let's validate the contact
preference radio buttons as well
notice now when the contact preference
radio buttons lose focus without having
one of them selected we get the
validation error message the same is the
case with gender as soon as we select
one of the radio buttons the validation
error messages disappear here is the
code that we just discussed in our next
video we'll discuss Crossfield
validation in angular thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
