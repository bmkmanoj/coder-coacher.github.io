unit test is a function that tests a
unit of let's understand what we mean by
the statement with an example right here
we have a very simple webpage that
accepts two numbers numerator and
denominator for numerator we have a
value of 50 and for denominator we have
a value of 2 at this point when we click
the divide button the page is going to
divide the numerator by denominator so
50 divided by 2 the result that is the
quotient value is 25 which is displayed
in the result textbox to achieve
something like this we might have a
divided function like this notice this
divided function has got two input
parameters both of them of type integer
numerator and denominator this function
is also returning an integer that is the
quotient value and if you look at the
implementation this is very straight
forward we are dividing the numerator by
denominator
whatever quotient value we get we are
storing that in this result variable and
finally the function is returning that
result so the unit of work right here is
to divide two numbers and return the
quotient so to test this unit of work I
have another function here I named it
test underscore divide in real-world
applications we follow different naming
conventions to name our unit test we'll
talk about those naming conventions in
detail in a later video so if you
compare this unit test function with
this function right here there is
another difference and that difference
is we have decorated this unit test
function with test method attribute so
the obvious question that comes to our
mind at this point is what is test
method attribute we'll discuss in detail
about this attribute in a later video
for now understand that if you decorate
a function with test method attribute
then that function is a test function
which is testing some unit of work in
your application now let's look at the
implementation the implementation is
straightforward so within the function
we have a variable of type integer we
named it expected there's a specific
reason for doing so we'll and
than that in just a bit and within that
variable we have a value of five and
then we are calling this divide method
so this divide method is this divide
method right here so this divided method
is present in this calculator class this
calculator class in turn its present in
calculate the dot library namespace so
we are calling the divide method and we
are passing 10 as the value for the
numerator 2 as the value for the
denominator so when we divide 10 by 2
what should this function do it should
return the quotient value which is 5 and
we are getting that 5 and storing that
in this variable actual so when this
function executes the actual value you
know what we get is stored in this
variable when we divide 10 by 2 what is
the expected value that's 5 so the
expected value is present in this
variable and the actual value is going
to be in this variable and then we are
using this 1/3 class this class has got
several static methods which we will
discuss in detail in a later video for
now we are using this method are equal
which is going to check whether the
expected value is equal to actual value
if that is true then you know this
divide function is doing what it is
supposed to do and this function is
checking that you know is this divide
function working the way it is supposed
to work when we divide 10 by 2 the
expected value is 5 if the actual value
is also 5 which is what we are asserting
right here then this unit test has
passed that means this function is doing
what it is supposed to do
