banquette this is part 22 of asp.net
click view tutorial in this video we'll
discuss about using validation controls
with asp.net grid-view when editing data
please watch by 21 of the asp.net view
tutorial before proceeding with this
video because this is continuation
Department you want now we want to make
this gender column within the screen
view control a required field and the
user is editing a row and if he selects
select gender instead of male or female
for gender and then when he tries to
update this row we want to present the
user with a validation error message
stating gender is a required field we
want that detailed error message to be
displayed beneath the grid view control
and then that little red asterisk next
to the drop down list where the error
has 1/3 now if you recollect from part
21 we actually converted this gender
column into a template field initially
it was bound fair but we wanted to have
this drop-down list as the editing
interface element that's the reason why
we converted this bound field into a
template field now since we are already
using a template field to display gender
within this grid we control
so obviously achieving these validation
error messages it's very straightforward
all we need to do is drag and drop a
required field validator control next to
the drop-down list control and then a
validation summary control beneath the
grid we control and configure them but
before we do that let's try to edit a
row within the grid we control now let
me actually select gender instead of
male or female and then let me try to
update this look at that I get a totally
unrelated error message that's because
if you notice the column length within
my date I mean within this table TBL
employee gender has got a column length
of 10 characters but then if you look at
the word select gender it has got more
than 10 characters so obviously when we
try to you know insert that word or
update you know this record with that
word that string data will be truncated
and that's what this runtime error
message obviously to you know avoid this
error we need to increase the column
length so let's go ahead and increase
the column length to 20 characters so
I'm using this alter table for that now
let's actually try to update that row
and see what happens look at that now it
gets updated as expected now I don't
want to I love this so if they select
select gender and if they try to click
this update we want to display this
validation error message as you can see
they should not be able to submit the
page okay so obviously to do this we
need to use validation controls so if
you recollect you know the column that
displays the gen gender is actually a
template field and template field here
it has edit item template and item
template so item template you know is
used when the row is rendered in non
editing mode but when I put the row in
edit mode look at that for gender we are
using a drop-down list control so with
an edit item template I have a drop-down
list control next to the drop-down list
control drag and drop a required field
validator okay and we need to configure
this required field value data so what's
the error message that I want to display
I want to say gender is a required field
okay so that's the error message I want
and then along with the error message we
need to configure other properties we
need to set the control that we want to
validate so what's the control we want
to validate drop-down list one and the
text is going to be read I mean a strict
symbol because I want a stricter to be
displayed next to the drop-down list so
I'm setting text to a straight and then
since we want that to be in red color
I'm going to set full color to red and
finally look at this you know within the
drop-down list we have three things
male/female and select gender so select
gender is the initial value if the user
selects that we should not be treating
that as a selected value that's why we
need to set initial value property as
well so which is select gender so let me
copy that and paste it here
all right so with that we should get
that red asterisk next to the drop down
list in case if we select the word
select gender instead of male or female
but then beneath the grid view control
we want that detailed error message also
to display that we can make use of
validation summary control so just after
the grid we control drag and drop a
validation summary control and all we
need to do here is set the for color to
red all right so let's run this now and
see if the validation works as expected
okay so let me edit that and let me try
to update look at that I immediately get
that validation error message gender is
required but as I select male and then I
try to update that look at that I am
able to do that now I want this name and
City columns also you know to be
required for us okay so if that's the
case we need to convert those columns
into template fields now look at this at
the moment name in City so here name is
actually a bound here so if we want to
use validation controls we need to
convert them into a template field okay
name and city city is also a bound field
at the moment so we need to convert them
into template fields and to do that
there are two ways you can you know
change the HTML in place here you can
convert this bound field into a template
field by changing the HTML or you can
use the designer to generate the HTML
for you and to do that from the grid
view tasks pane click on edit columns
and from the columns I want to convert
name into a template field so highlight
that and then click on that link and
word template field along that same
lines city convert that into template
field as soon as we do that look at that
bound fields are now converted into
template files so if you look at City
for example here it has got an edit item
template an item template edit item
template meaning when the row is in edit
mode you know we are using a text box
control okay so obviously here I need to
drag and drop another required field
value data and configure that and just
to speed things up I have that already
typed
so let me copy that and paste it there
so if you look at this required field
valid data
all we are doing is you know it has got
an idea of required field validator 3
run it is equal to server error message
city is a required fear and then for
color red text we have said to that red
Astra mean astray control to validate we
want to validate text box to control
along the same lines we want another
required field well data for a name so
next to the text box control with an
edit item template of name a template
real I'm going to paste it again
ok so let's give this a different ID may
be required field validated to let's say
name is a required field and control to
validate it's text box 1 that's it let's
go ahead and run this now and see if it
works as expected let's edit that
let me blank out name that my blank out
city look at that as soon as I tab out
of text boxes I can already see a red
asterisk symbol there and if I select
select gender and try to update that
look at that I get all those three
things name is required field gender is
required for your city is it quite fair
on the other hand let us fill some
details you know let's say name is Mike
gender male City London I should be able
to update that all right on this slide
