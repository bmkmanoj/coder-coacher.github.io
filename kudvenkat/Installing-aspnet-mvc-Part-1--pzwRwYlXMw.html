drink it this is part one of a speed or
net MVC tutorial in this video we'll
discuss about installing asp.net MVC
before we actually install MVC first
let's determine what versions are
already installed on my computer to do
that click on start go to control panel
and then click on programs and then
click on programs and features this
window should display all the programs
that are currently installed on your
computer click on the name column to
sort by that column and look for
Microsoft asp.net MVC look at this at
the moment I have Microsoft asp.net MVC
two three and four install as of this
recording the latest version is asp.net
MVC for these versions can run side by
side meaning you can install all the
three versions on the same computer just
like how I did since I have all these
three versions installed on my computer
I can either create MVC - or MVC 3 or
embracing 4 applications
ok now if you want to download and
install MVC 3 &amp;amp; 4 you know you can you
can find the downloads at the URLs that
you can see on the slide you know once
you download you know it's the wizard
will guide you on how to install it's a
pretty straightforward wizard you know
you can follow the instructions on the
wizard first try to install MVC 3 and
then MVC 4 and then once you have all
the versions installed and once you fire
up Visual Studio and then if you try to
create a new project so file new project
and then if you select web from the
install the template section look at
this I have an option to create and they
say 2 or 3 or 4 application here but
notice the dotnet framework version here
it's dotnet framework version 4 selected
now if I select dotnet framework 3.5
look at what's going to happen I don't
have the choice of creating MVC 3 and
MVC 4 applications if you want to create
MVC 3 or MVC 4 then make sure you select
dotnet framework 4 and then we can
create MVC 3 or MVC 4 applications
alright on this slide you can find
resources for asp.net c-sharp and
sequence of interview questions that's
it for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
