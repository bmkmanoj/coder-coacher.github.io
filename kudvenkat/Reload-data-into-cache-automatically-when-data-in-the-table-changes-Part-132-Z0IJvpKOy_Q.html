venket this is part 132 of asp.net video
tutorial in this video well discuss
about reloading data into cache
automatically when data in the
underlying database table has changed we
will be building upon the example that
we have discussed about in part 131 of
the asp.net video tutorial so please
watch part 131 before proceeding with
this video so if you remember in part 1
that you want and we click this button
CAD data we execute this command select
star from TBL products which is going to
retrieve all the products from this
table and then we are going to load the
products into this data set which is
then cached and this data set is going
to remain in cache as long as you know
the table data has not changed but the
moment somebody update updates this
table meaning you know if somebody
changes the data in this table at that
point the data set will be removed from
cache automatically and that's because
we have established this sequel cache
dependency on that table okay now when
the data set is removed from the cache
you know we don't have the data cached
anymore so next time when the first user
clicks you know get data what's going to
happen this command has to be reacts
accute 'add and then we get the data
again and then we are going to catch
that okay and again this data set is
going to stay in that cache as long as
the data in that table has not changed
okay now look at this command select
star from TBL products this command is a
pretty simple command and if you look at
the table he writes it's a very small
table with 4 rows obviously the query
execution itself doesn't take really
long time so you know the user who
connects to our application at the point
way we don't have that item in the cache
you know this query is going to take a
very less amount of time so the user
doesn't really notice any performance
difference but just imagine in real time
the tables may have huge volumes of data
and and the stored procedures that we
write which get data may be a little
complex because of which you know the
query processing time may be somewhere
between 5 to 10 seconds depending on the
complexity of the stored procedure ok
now let's say we have such a kind of a
stored procedure
which whose execution takes somewhere
around five seconds let's say we have
something like this as Poquette products
you know but then we have used this wait
for delay here to introduce some
artificial query processing time in
reality we won't do this but just assume
you know to execute this stored
procedure it's going to take five
seconds okay look at that that's because
we are using that wait for delay and
let's say I want to execute this stored
procedure retrieve the data and then
cache it so instead of the select star
from TBL products I'm going to say let's
use the stored procedure so since we are
using the stored procedure we have to
tell that man type is total seizure
so da dot select command dot command
type is equal to command type dot store
procedure okay now look at this when we
run this now you know obviously first
time when we click get data the stored
procedure has to be executed because the
data is not available in cache so it's
going to take five seconds look at that
it is still processing why because the
stored procedure is taking that long
time to execute that but then after that
when I click that you know since the
data is available in cache look at that
I get that within less than a second
because the query need not be
reprocessed every time we click this
button but then keep in mind when the
data in the table changes for some
reason at the moment if you look at the
name of the product it is laptops but
then I'm going to update that to laptops
one you know the moment we do that and
then when I click this button what's
going to happen that cached data would
have been removed and look at that it's
taking a long time to process now
because the stored procedure needs to be
executed and the stored procedure is
going to take five seconds okay
so the fact that when I click this
button you know the data will be loaded
pretty fast because we already have that
data set in the cache now the stored
procedure need not be executed ok so the
first time after the data set is removed
from cache the first time whoever
connects to the application clicks that
button the stored procedure needs to be
executed because we don't have data in
the cache now don't you think it would
be more beneficial even for that first
user who connects to our application if
we automatically load the data into
cache
that cache data set is removed yeah
absolutely
even that first user who who tries to
retrieve the data will not have will not
notice that performance difference so
obviously whenever a cached item is
removed from cache how do we detect that
and how do we load data automatically
back into that cache you know that's
basically using cache item removed
callback delegate we discussed about
this in part 130 of the asp.net video
tutorial now it's actually very similar
you know to to that video so if you
haven't watched that I would strongly
encourage you to do so before continuing
with the session so let's see how to
reload that data
so obviously to do that we to load data
automatically into cache
when cache the data is removed we need
to define a callback method and this
callback method will be invoked when the
respective cached item is removed so the
code to reload and free cache data can
be written in this method the but the
most important thing to keep in mind is
that the callback method signature
should match with the signature of the
cache item removed callback delegate
okay and the easiest way to do that is
basically so before I cache the data I
need to define the callback method and I
do that using cache item removed
callback delegate and if you look at the
signature of this delegate and it's
going to have a wide return type and it
has three parameters now I want to
define a method you know the callback
method and the signature of that
callback method should match with the
signature of this delegate so for that
reason I'm going to copy this and then
paste it in my code behind file and then
I'm going to get rid of that delegate
keyword and the semicolon there so now I
have a method here and I'm going to call
this cache item removed callback method
and in this method I will define my
logic to reload the data and recast a
data set and obviously that's pretty
simple to do all I need to do is
basically copy this piece of code which
retrieves the data and cache it okay so
I'm going to specify that here
okay obviously so we have this method
we'll come back to the implementation of
this method in just a battle for the
time being let me comment that so now I
need to create an instance of this
delegate because that's what I need to
pass you know as an argument to this
insert method of the cache object when
we cache the data set so let's go ahead
and create an instance of this cache
item removed callback delegate and I'm
going to call this cache item removed on
cache item removed is equal to new cache
item removed callback and to this
delegate when I'm into the constructor
of this delegate we need to pass in a
function name which is nothing but our
callback function name okay and then
finally what we need to do we need to
pass this instance of the delegate as an
argument to this insert method of the
cache object but however if you look at
the insert method right now they are
using an overloaded version that takes
three parameters but then if I want to
pass this instance of this cache item
removed callback delegate I need to use
an overloaded constructor that takes all
the parameters and we have you know a
you know a method which does that an
overloaded method which does that so if
you look at this one this takes seven
parameters here so let's go ahead and
define all of them so we have you know
until sequel dependency we have defined
so absolute expiration let's say I want
to cache this data set for 24 hours so
I'm going to say date time dot now dot
add hours 24 and then since we are using
absolute expiration I'm going to specify
for sliding expiration cache dot no
sliding expiration and then the next
parameter is the cache item priority so
I am going to specify cache item
priority dot default and cache item
removed callback delegate so we need to
pass an instance of this delegate so I
have that instance already there so
let's go ahead and pass that there so
now we hooked up everything that's
required so you know when we are caching
this data set okay we are passing this
instance of the delegate and if you look
at that delegate you know whenever this
cached item is removed whenever this
data set is removed from cache you know
this delegate is notified and this
delegate is actually pointing to this
function okay so that function will get
executed automatically whenever the
cached item is removed so what do we
need to do in that method here in this
method we are going to write the logic
to reload data and recache it so all I'm
going to do is copy this piece of code
and then paste it in that function
because this is the code that we want to
have executed you know when the cache
item is removed because that code is
going to reload and recache the data so
we are creating that connection string
connection objects equal data adapter
it's going to execute that stored
procedure and retrieve that data and
then it's going to be cache that once
again okay all right so let's build this
solution so those are the three things
that we need to do define your callback
method create an instance of the you
know cached item removed callback
delegate to the constructor pass the
name of that callback method and finally
when caching pass that you know instance
of that cache item remove callback
delegate okay so let's go ahead and run
this now so obviously the first time
when we click the skip that get data
button it's going to execute that stored
procedure so only at that point of time
it's going to take five seconds but
after that you know look at that I
retrieve data from cache now let's go
ahead and update this one look at them
at the moment it says laptops one and
look at the message data retrieved from
cache and then I'm going to update this
data from laptops one to laptops
okay so the data is changed now what
would have happened as the data is
changed sequel server will notify dotnet
application dotnet application will
remove that data set from cache now when
the data set is removed from cache
obviously what's going to happen this
delegate gets invoked because that
delegate will be notified when the data
set is removed and you know that
delegate is pointing to that function
and what is that function doing that
function is actually you know reloading
that data once again so this function
will automatically reload that data ok
execute the stored procedure which is
going to take 5 seconds and then after
it has completed execution it's going to
reload that data and now when the first
user connects to your application after
the you know cached item is removed and
then when he clicks this get data button
now the data would have been already
loaded into cache so I don't have to
wait for the stored procedure to be
executed look at that when I click this
button look at that at the moment we
have laptops one now when I click this
button it will be laptops and I still
get the data from cache ok so I don't
have to wait you know for that stored
procedure to be executed because the
callback method has already been invoked
when the initial data said that was
cache was removed because the data in
the database has changed ok so we use
that callback method to automatically
reload that data on this slide you can
