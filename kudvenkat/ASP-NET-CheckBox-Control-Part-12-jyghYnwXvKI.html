venket this is part 12 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll learn about
the properties methods and events of an
asp.net checkbox control before
continuing with the session I strongly
recommend to watch part 11 of this video
series where we have talked about radio
button control because the properties
methods and events of these both
controls are very much identical so when
do we actually use this checkbox control
a checkbox control is used when you want
the user to select more than one option
from the available choices for example
the education of a person a person can
have a graduate degree a postgraduate
degree and a doctorate degree in this
case the user selects all the three
checkboxes whereas a person may just
have a graduate degree in which case he
only selects the Graduate checkbox
another example would be when you want
the user to select the days of his
availability for an appointment ok if he
is available only on a Tuesday then he
only selects that whereas if he is
available on Monday and Tuesday and
Wednesday he will select all three of
those so in short we can see that if you
want to provide the user with more than
one option to select from then choose a
checkbox control in asp.net we can also
use checkbox list control for the same
purpose we will talk about checkbox list
control in a later video session now
this checkbox control exposes several
properties methods and events that we
need to be aware of as a developer let's
look at the properties first to check
the property this is very much similar
to radio button control so the stacked
property is a boolean property that is
used to check if the checkbox is checked
or not let's look at an example so here
I have three check box controls graduate
postgraduate and doctorate check box
controls wrapped inside an HTML field
set element so if you look at these
three check box controls they have the
ID and the text property text property
is what you see on the UI so we have set
the text to graduate postgraduate and
trait all right now let's run this now
what would happen is after we run and
then we select when we make our choices
we should you know print on the screen
what selections the user has made for
example if I select graduate and
postgraduate and when I click the button
you should show on the screen your
selections are graduate and postgraduate
if I select three we should show all
three of them obviously to get the
selections of the user we have to use
the checked property so let's see how to
do that so I double click the button to
generate the even handler for the button
control now to store these user
selections I can use a string variable
but I'm going to modify the string
variable that's why I'm going to use a
string builder object instead of string
a variable and stringbuilder object is
present in system dot text namespace so
let's import that so system dot text and
string builder so SP and let's call this
user choices so here we are using
camelcase notation SP standing for
string builder and this variable is used
to capture user choices all right so if
graduate checkbox dot checked so this
checked property will return true if
that checkbox is checked if it is
checked what do I want to do is be user
choices dot append so to this object I
want to append the text of this graduate
checkbox because if you remember
graduate checkbox text is graduate so
that text will be appended into the
string builder object
Graduate checkbox dot text so repeat
this code for all the three checkboxes
that we have that's for postgraduate and
this is for the doctorate so
postgraduate checkbox if that is checked
retrieve the text from that checkbox and
then append that to the stringbuilder
object similarly we have the doctorate
checkbox so doctorate copy that and
paste that there and finally all you
have to do is write that on to the
screen so to write that onto the screen
we can use response dot write your
selections so stringbuilder object dot
two string we have spoken about the
differences of why you use string
builder object over system dot string if
you're not sure please check the video
series on c-sharp where we have covered
the differences between string and
stringbuilder classes so now let's go
ahead and run this so obviously when we
make our choices and click the button so
I select graduated click the button so
your selections graduate if I select
doctorate and postgraduate as well look
at this we get the output but this
output is not so clear because you know
there are no spaces between them so
let's format this properly and to do
that obviously
let's append a space a comma and a space
just to indicate that this is another
selection so let's do the same thing for
the doctorate checkbox so now let's run
this and now it should be properly
formatted as expected so graduate post
graduates like that so your selections
graduate comma postgraduate and when you
select the doctorate you should see that
as well all right so we have used the
check to
property to get the selection of the
user and you use this text property to
get to get or set the text associated
with the checkbox control and text align
this is very much similar to radio
button control you can control how you
want to align this text do you want that
to be on the right hand side or on the
left hand side if you want that on the
left hand side then go to the properties
and change the text align to left which
is very simple and you see that the text
is aligned on the left hand side of that
control so let's put it back to right
side so that's the text align property
and the auto post back property it's
again similar to just like you know
radio button a textbox control if you
set this property to true you know it
will post the page back immediately when
the check the status of the checkbox
changes so now if you look at the
property it is set to false which means
when the when I double click this
checkbox obviously this checkbox has
select check that changed event so we
get the even handler generated so let's
say response tort right this is the
Graduate checkbox so let's say graduate
check box selection changed so whenever
the selection of this check box changes
I want to print that message now if I
run this and then when I change the
selection of that check box it won't
immediately post back to the server
because we have set the auto post back
to false so it's not posting back so
this even gets fired only when I post a
page back on button click look at that
that's only that's when only it's fired
but if you want this you know if you
want the page to be posted back
immediately on the selection on the
checked status change then set this
property to true so as soon as I said
that to true
run the page and when the selection
changes the page will be immediately
post back you know posted back to the
server
it doesn't wait for us to click the
button
all right so that's autopost back let's
put that back to false because we don't
want that to be posting back to the
server when the check the status changes
all right so that sort of post back and
focus method just like how we use the
focus method to set the input focus onto
a textbox control you know we use it for
the same purpose for a checkbox control
let's say when the page loads you know I
want the focus to be on the Graduate
checkbox is it possible to do that
absolutely we can use the focus method
so when the page loads on the page load
I can say Graduate checkbox dot focus
and I want to do this only if it's not a
postback because during the first
initial get request that's when I want
to do that so if not is postback called
the focus method on the Graduate
checkbox so now when we run this as soon
as the page loads I'm not sure if you
can see this but as soon as the page
loads look at that there is this little
you know dotted square around the
Graduate checkbox now I don't have to
take my mouse and click that if I press
spacebar at this minute it's already you
know that graduate checkbox has caught
the focus so it will be checked
automatically so if I if I click my
spacebar once it gets checked if I click
it if I press it another time it gets
unchecked so just to see that properly
let's shift the focus to postgraduate
checkbox and you should now see that
second check box receiving focus the
postgraduate checkbox I hope you can see
this in the video all right so that's
about the focus method and then we have
already seen the check that changed the
event okay
now you can also use this checked
property to specify a default setting
for example let's say as soon as the
webform loads I want this graduate
checkbox to be checked can we do that
absolutely all you have to do is so
graduate checkbox dot checked we know
that's a boolean property you can set
that to true
so what happens on page load it will be
checked automatically so we are doing
that in the code you can do that at the
design time as well so as soon as the
page is loaded it is checked ok we are
doing it in code here if you don't want
to do it in code you can do that in the
HTML as well so on the web form you can
go to the Graduate checkbox and then it
has got the checked property there so
checked is equal to true the moment you
do that what happens at the design time
it shows as if it is checked on this
