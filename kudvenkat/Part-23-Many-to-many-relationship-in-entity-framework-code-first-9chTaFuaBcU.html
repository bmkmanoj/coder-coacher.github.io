tutorial in this video we'll discuss
many-to-many relationship with code
first approach this is continuation to
part 22 in part 22 we discussed many to
many relationship with database first
approach in its video we will be
modifying the example that we started in
part 22 so please watch power 22 before
proceeding with code first we usually
write over classes first so here we have
got student and course classes notice
that within the student class along with
student ID and student name properties
we also have courses property that
returns collection of course objects a
student can enroll into multiple courses
so to get the list of all the courses
that a given student has enrolled into
this property is going to return that
list courses look at the return type
it's a collection of course objects in a
similar fashion a given course can have
multiple students enrolled so to get the
list of all students enrolled in a given
course we use the students property that
is returning a collection of student
objects so there is a many-to-many
relationship between these two classes
now based on these classes we want the
entity framework to be able to generate
these three database tables we want the
course ID column to be primary key
within a courses table student ID to be
D primary key within students table and
we want this bridge table also to be
generated and the name of the table
should be student courses and the names
of the columns within these our table
should be student ID and course ID
together these two columns should form
the primary key of this table and
student ID should be the foreign key
referencing students table and student
ID column similarly course ID should be
the foreign key referencing courses
table and course ID column let's see how
to achieve this let's flip to visual
studio this is the example that we
worked with in the previous session this
employee model was generated using the
database first approach so let's go
ahead and delete that first and then
from the web.config file let's delete
this connection string that's
auto-generated by the entity framework
so to this project let's add a class
file and let's call this
course dot CS and this course class is
going to contain course ID course name
and students properties so let's paste
them there and at the moment notice that
we have a compilation error that's
basically because we don't have the
student class yet so let's go ahead and
add another class file and let's call
this student dot CS and this class is
going to contain student ID student name
and courses properties let's add another
class file to this project and let's
call this one employee DB context dot CS
and we want this employee DV context
class to be inheriting from DB context
class which is present in system dot
data dot entity namespace so let's go
ahead and bring that in
and this employee dbcontext class is
going to contain two properties and one
of the property is going to return DB
set of course objects and let's call the
property courses in a similar fashion we
are going to have another property which
is going to return DB set of student
objects and let's call the property
students and within web config file
let's include the connection string so
within the connection string notice that
the name of the database is sample all
right at the moment we already have the
sample database so let's go and delete
that sample database now when we run
this web application you know it should
automatically create the sample database
and all the required tables now if you
notice we haven't changed webform one
dot aspx and it's code behind in anyway
from the previous session it's exactly
the same code that we have written in
the previous session let's save all
these changes let's go ahead and run
their form one dot aspx now we are going
to get a runtime error but in spite of
that runtime error sample database in
the required tables will automatically
be created in a bit we'll see how to
resolve this runtime error but first
let's go ahead and check if the sample
database is created notice that the
database is there and we also have the
tables courses students and student
courses okay that's how we want the
tables to be named and that's how they
are named and if you look at students
table and if you look at the columns we
have got student ID student ID is the
primary key there and student name
property is also there and if you look
at courses we have course ID and course
name course ID is the primary key now if
we look at student courses tables notice
that you know the columns are not named
like how we want them to be named so we
want the columns to be named the student
ID and course ID but if you look at the
columns here it says student underscore
student ID course
let's go course ID so that's not how we
want them to be we want them to be
student ID and course ID and another
thing notice that student ID and course
ID together they form the primary key
for this table student ID is the foreign
key and course ID is a foreign key okay
so the naming is not how we want it so
let's see how to customize it to
customize it we need to use fluent API
ok so we are going to overwrite on model
creating method and look at the code
right here it's very straightforward
now we are starting with student entity
we can also start with course entity but
I just chosen to start with student
entity and then we are saying student
can have many courses ok using this has
many methods so that is one and you know
of the relationship case student can
have many courses similarly a course can
have many students so that's the second
end of the relationship and we are
specifying that with many function okay
so courses can have many students
similarly student can have many courses
and then you know the bridge table that
is going to be generated you know should
be named at student courses and to
specify that we are using two table
method okay and look at this we're using
here map left key and map right key
methods now this is very important now
notice that we have started with student
table here I mean student entity here so
left key is going to be student ID okay
the primary key of that table so within
student courses student ID will be the
first column okay which is going to
reference student ID column from the
student table and the right key will be
course ID which will be referencing
courses table course ID column within
courses table okay so straightforward
code there so let's flip to visual
studio and let's get to this employee
dbcontext and we want to override on
model creating method and to speed
things up I have already typed the
required code so let's copy and paste it
right here and let's format this okay
so with these changes let's first delete
the sample database and we also need to
fix this runtime error this error is
basically because of this line right
here
okay now to fix this whatever result
this link query is going to return you
know we are going to convert that result
to a list and that's what the error says
you know we need to use that - list
method basically to resolve that error
okay so with these changes let's run the
bed form now we should not get that
runtime error and the sample database
and require table should be created with
the conventions that we have specified
so we don't have the runtime error now
let's go to the sequel server management
studio refresh databases so notice that
we have sample database there and we
also have the three tables now courses
if you look at that table we have course
ID porcelain columns and students have
got student ID and student name columns
and student courses have got student ID
and course ID look at the names again
student ID code cited together they form
the primary key of this table and their
foreign keys as well all right at the
moment the webform doesn't display any
data because we don't have any data
within the tables so let's go to and
execute this insert script will insert
some test data and let's reload this
waveform notice that Mike is enrolled in
c-sharp and asp.net courses John is
enrolled in c-sharp asp.net and sequel
server courses now at the moment Mike is
not in WCF course let's say we want to
assign him to the VFC core so when we
click this button that should happen
again the code has not changed in any
way on this platform one dot aspx but
when we click this button we are going
to get a runtime error look at the error
it says object reference not set when
it's
of an object and that is at line number
31 so let's see what's actually
happening there so let's go to line
number 31 as you notice what's happening
here is look at that first of all we
want to enroll Mike into WC of course so
we need to retrieve that WC of course
itself that's what we are doing here so
we have the WC of course and then we are
loading you know Mike student object
Mike student ID is 1 so we are
retrieving the student object and then
we are trying to you know load the
courses of Mike and then to that
collection we are going to add WC of
course but then here you know by default
the navigation property data is not
loaded we have to tell the entity
framework to load courses details as
well when we load in all the students
and the way we do that is by using
include method so we are saying along
with students include courses data as
well so we need to specify the name of
the navigation property so when the
student is loaded the respective courses
are loaded as well so that this property
will not be null and to that collection
we can add the WC of course which means
that particular student will have WC of
course assign in this case Mike will
have WC of course assign in a similar
fashion when we remove you know when we
click this button remove John from
sequel's of a course again we are going
to run in the same problem so to fix
that along with the students we want to
include the data for courses navigation
property as well right so these changes
let's run the web form
so there we have the data now when we
click assign WC of course to Mike so
let's reload the waveform notice that WC
of course is assigned to Mike and then
when we click remove John from sequence
of a course sequence of a course should
be removed so let's click the button
let's reload the bear farm what is that
it works exactly the same way as before
here by using the code first approach
that's it for today thank you for
listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
