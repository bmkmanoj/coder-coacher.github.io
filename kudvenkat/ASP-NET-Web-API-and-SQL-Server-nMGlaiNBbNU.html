tutorial in this video we'll discuss
retrieving data from sequel server using
asp.net Web API and entity framework so
here is what we want to do we are going
to have the sequence of a database table
and when we issued this URI localhost
four slash API four slash employees we
want to retrieve all these employees
from the sequence of an employee's table
and return them as you can see here in
case if we ask for a specific employee
notice in the URI right here we have
employee ID as well so in this case we
want to return that specific employee
details as you can see here let's see
how to achieve this using sequel server
entity framework and asp.net Web API so
let's flip to visual studio the first
thing that we want to do is create our
Web API project so I am going to click
on file new project and then let's
select web and asp.net web application
let's name our project employee service
and let's click OK now we want to create
a web api project so on the screen I'm
going to select Web API and now let's
click OK which is going to take a few
seconds to create the web API project
for us the project is now successfully
created the next thing that you want to
do is create an employee's table within
our sequel server database so let's flip
to sequel server management studio here
we have the script which creates the
database with named employee DB within
this database we're creating our
employees table and then finally we have
the script which is going to populate
employees table with test data
I have already executed this clip I'll
have the script available on my blog in
case you need it now let's flip to
visual studio we're going to add another
project or solution employee service
this is going to be a class library
project which is going to contain our
area dot and entity data model which
retrieves data for us from the sequence
of a database table so let's right click
on the solution
new project and the type of project that
we want to add is a class library
project let's name this employee data
access let's click OK this is going to
add the class library project to a
solution we don't need this class 1 dot
CS which is auto-generated so I'm going
to delete that from our project and to
this employee data access project I'm
going to add a do dotnet entity data
model it's present on the data so let's
select data and then I do dotted entity
data model let's name this data model
employee data model let's click Add now
we want to generate our entities from
the database so I'm going to select this
first option entity framework designer
from database and then let's click Next
we want to create a new connection so
I'm going to click this button new
connection and now here we need to
specify our server name we want to
connect to our local server so we can
either specify dot or local within
parentheses like this and we are going
to use Windows authentication to connect
to sequel server and from this drop-down
we are going to select our database in
our case the database is employee dB and
let's click this button to test the
connection so test connection succeeded
let's click OK and entity framework is
going to save a connection string with
his name employee DB entities with an
app config file within our employee data
access class library project so let's
click Next now and such thing us whether
we want to use entity framework 5 or 6
let's use entity framework 6 and let's
click Next and this is going to connect
to sequel server retrieve all tables
views and store procedures we only have
got one table within our database let's
select that table employees and the
model name space is going to be employee
DB more
let's leave that with the default and
let's click finish so this is going to
take a few seconds to generate the
entity data model for us the entity data
model is now successfully created notice
within our employee data access project
we have a configuration file apt or
conflict within which we have a
connection string with named employee DB
entities that points to our database
which contains the employees table we
want to use this employee data access
project within our Web API project so
let's right click on the references
folder add reference we want to add a
project reference so let's select the
projects tab within which we have our
employee data access project let's
select that and click OK notice it has
added a reference to our employee data
access project the next thing that we
want to do is add a controller to our
Web API project so let's right click on
the controller's folder and select add
controller notice here we have templates
for both adding MVC and Web API
controllers I'm going to select this
template Web API - controller MT which
is going to create an empty controller
for us and then we'll add the required
methods on an as-needed basis now it's
asking for a name for the controller
let's call this employee's controller
now all it's going to do is create an
empty controller for us that is a class
with named employees controller that
derives from the base API controller
class now the namespace for our employee
data access project is employee data
access so let's use that namespace here
and within our employees controller
class let's have get method which
responds to the get HTTP verb this
method is going to return I enumerable
of employee of
so where is this employee object coming
from we have not created that this is
the generated entity by the ATO dotnet
entity framework so area dot entity
framework has generated this entity
based on this employees table which has
got these columns so if you look at this
entity right here so when we right click
on that and select go to definition
notice we have properties that
correspond to these columns in this
employees table so we want to return an
i enumerable of employee objects from
our method so the name of the method is
going to be get which is going to
respond to the HTTP GET verb now we have
to create an instance of our dbcontext
class so within our employee data access
project let's expand the EDM X file here
and the notice here we have employee
data model context dot CS so within this
file we have employee DB entities class
which inherits from DB context class so
this is the class that manages
connections to the database retrieves
the entities for us so let's create an
instance of this class so let's go to
our employees controller class and here
let's use a using statement so using
employee DB entities let's call this
entities equals new employee DB entities
so let's use the entities object and
this has got the employees object you
know this is basically a collection
property which is going to return us the
list of all employees and on this let's
call to list which is going to convert
that to a list of employees now this is
going to respond to the HTTP GET verb
without an ID parameter now when we
request for a specific employee we want
to return just that employee so let's
have another get method
which is going to respond to the URI
which has got an ID in it so let's pass
ID parameter to it and we don't want to
return the entire employees list we just
want to return one employee so first of
all let's change the return type to
employee and from the collection we want
first or default and then here we are
going to use a lambda expression
employee such that employee dot PI D
equals the ID that we are passing to
this method alright so let's go ahead
and build our solution the build is
succeeded as you can see in the status
bar right here let's run our project by
pressing ctrl f5 we are on the start
page here now let's navigate to four
slash API four slash employees notice we
are getting an error message the error
message says no connection string named
employee DB entities could be found in
the application config file now if you
look at the app dot config file notice
we have a connection string with named
employee DB entities so why is it
complaining about that then that's
because entity framework is looking for
a connection string with this name in
web dot config file and if you look at
the web config file notice in this file
we don't have a connection string with
named employee DB entities and that's
the reason why we are getting this
message so to fix this all we have to do
is make a copy of this connection string
within our web config file so let's copy
and paste that in the connection strings
section of our web config file let's
save it and let's reissue this request
notice now we get all the employees from
the database table as expected now if we
request for a specific employee we get
that specific employee
in our next video we'll discuss a
concept called content negotiation in
asp.net Web API thank you for listening
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
