tutorial in this video well discuss how
to have a radio button checked by
default and how to disable a radio
button now within Visual Studio code
this is the HTML that displays the
gender radio buttons now what we want to
be able to do is when this form
initially loads we want this male radio
button to be checked by default and for
that we typically do something like this
on the male radio button which we want
to have checked by default we include
checked attribute let's save our changes
and then take a look at the browser
notice the male radio button is not
checked now let's remove this ng-model
directive from the male radio button
save our changes and then take another
look at the browser notice now it is
checked as expected but the moment we
put it back in place notice it's not
working again so this checked attribute
is not working as expected when we use
the ng model directive now to make it
work all we have to do is within our
component class we introduce the gender
property and then initialize it to a
value which you want to have as the
default now we want the male radio
button to be default so I set the gender
property to male save our changes and if
we take a look at the browser notice the
male radio button is checked as expected
now let's remove the checked attribute
altogether and see if it still works
notice we still have the male radio
button checked now if you want the
female radio button to be checked all
you have to do is set this gender
property to female save our changes and
if we take a look at the browser we
should have the female radio button
checked so if you want to have a radio
button checked by default include its
corresponding property within the
component class and initialize that
property to the value of the radio
button
that you want to have checked by default
in our case we want the male radio
button to be checked by default so we
have the gender property and be
initialized it to a value of this male
radio button notice the value attribute
right here so that is the value that we
have initialized this gender property
birth so when the page initially loads
the male radio button is checked as
expected for our form we don't want any
radio button to be checked by default so
I'm going to remove the gender property
and its corresponding value now let's
discuss how to disable a radio button to
disable a radio button all we have to do
is include the disabled attribute in
this case we have the disabled attribute
on the male radio button so if we take a
look at the browser notice male radio
button is disabled and if we hover the
mouse over it because the style changes
and I cannot select the male radio
button on the other hand this female
radio button is not disabled and I can
select fat but notice this angular
generated phone model here we don't have
the gender property value you know
within that and large generated for
model now if I select contact
preferences phone it is captured
similarly if I enter 1 2 3 4 5 as the
phone number that is captured email is
also captured because all these form
controls they are not disabled but since
this gender radio button is disabled its
corresponding property gender did not
make into the angle generated phone
model so the important point to keep in
mind is by default the disabled phone
controls are not included in the angular
auto generated form order now let's see
what happens when we click the Save
button but before that let's launch the
browser developer tools when we click
this here button now the form should be
logged to the console let's expand the
form scroll all the way down we should
have the value property and when we
expand at the value object again notice
within this object we don't have the
gender property care
turd for our form we don't want any
radio button to be disabled so let's
remove the disabled attribute if you
want to have a radio button disabled all
you have to do is include the disabled
attribute but the important point to
keep in mind is by default disabled form
controls are not included in the angular
auto-generated form model in our next
video well disc is working with checkbox
control and angle a template different
forms thank you for listening and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
