in this video we'll discuss transforming
xml to an HTML table in part 5 of this
video series we discussed transforming
XML to CSV we want to transform the
student XML data to an HTML table as you
can see here once we open this HTML with
a browser the student data should be
rendered in a tabular format as you can
see here so let's see how to achieve
this let's flip to visual studio here I
have a new console application to which
I have already added this data dot XML
file which contains our student XML data
so let's see now how to transform this
XML data to an HTML table using the link
to XML so the first step here is to
create an instance of X document and
let's call it result it's a new X
document so within the XML document the
first element that you want is table
element so we need to create that table
element so let's create a new instance
of X element class and the name of the
element is going to be table and this
table element should also have a border
attribute with value 1 so we need to
create this border attribute and to
create an attribute we use X attribute
class the name of the attribute is going
to be border and the value of that is
going to be 1 and within the table
element we also need to have this tea
head element that is table head element
so let's create another instance of X
element class and the name of the
element is going to be D head and within
t head element we want a TR element that
is the table row element so let's create
a new instance of X element again and
the name of the element is going to be
TR and within TR we should have you know
4p head elements for country name gender
and total marks okay
so let's create those for tea head
elements so new X element
name of the element is T head and the
value within that should be country
similarly now we need T head elements
for name gender and total marks so name
gender and total marks okay so here we
are closing the P head and we need to
close the TR and then T head okay now
after T hat we should have T body
element so let's create a new instance
of X element again and the name of the
element is going to be T body and within
table body we are going to have TR and
then you know T DS to store the actual
student data now this student data is
actually present in our XML document so
we need to read this XML data from the
XML document so here we are going to
write our linked vary from student in X
document dot load so we want to load the
XML data from this data or XML file
which is present in the project folder
so let's open the project folder in
Windows Explorer copy the path so at and
the name of the file is data dot XML so
this is going to load the XML data from
that file and from that XML we want all
descendant nodes so all student
descendant nodes so this one is going to
give us I enumerable of student elements
and then you know we have to populate
that data you know into this TD elements
so what we need to do here is select a
new
X element and the element is going to be
D R and within P R we are going to have
T DS you know for TD elements so first
we need to create an element for the
table row itself and within that we are
going to have an X element for TD so now
we need to retrieve the student data so
first we want the student country name
so country name is present in this
country attribute of the student element
so this variable here should have the
student element so student dot attribute
of what is the name of the attribute its
country and we want the value out of it
so that's going to retrieve the country
value now we want name element value now
name is a chained element within the
student element so from the student
element we need to get to the name
element and to do that instead of using
the attribute method we are going to use
element method and the name of the
element is name and value should return
the value of that element similarly we
need to get gender and total mark
element values so the gender and total
marks okay so at this point we should
have you know student country name
gender and total marks captured and D
require HTML will be generated for all
the students okay now we need to close
the brackets so here we are closing this
TD next we need to close the TR next we
need to close T body and we need to
close table and finally if we need to
close the document itself
okay so there are quite a few closing
brackets so once we are done with
constructing our X document all that is
left is to save this document with a dot
HTM extension so result dot save and we
need to specify the path so let's copy
this and let's change the name of the
file to resolve the dot HTM and if you
look at the solution Explorer at the
moment we don't have any file with name
result dot HTM so once we had run this
now let's click on this button and
notice that result dot HTM let's open
that and look at this we get table
element with border attribute and within
that we have got P head element and then
we have got table body and then there is
a row for each of the student that's
present in data or XML file now let's
actually open this full file in Windows
Explorer
notice that we have result of HTM let's
open this with a browser and look at
this the student data is now present in
a tabular format in our next video we'll
discuss transforming this XML to a
different XML format that's it for today
thank you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
