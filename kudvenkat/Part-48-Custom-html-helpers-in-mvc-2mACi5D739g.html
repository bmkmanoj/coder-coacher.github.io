this video well discuss creating custom
HTML helpers in MVC please watch about
47 before proceeding we'll be working
with the same example that we worked
with in part 47 notice that at the
moment when we navigate to the details
view along with the employees personal
details we can also view his photo and
render this photo if you remember in
part 47 we have used the image tag and
specified the source and alt attributes
okay but then this is a bit complicated
we don't want any sort of complicated
logic within our view we want to move
this logic into its own HTML helper so
we want to achieve something like this
we want to call you know a method like
image and then specify the source and
all parameters and then this method is
going to take care of rendering an image
tag but unfortunately at the moment we
don't have this image HTML helper so
let's see how to create this custom HTML
helper so to create a custom HTML helper
we need to add an extension method to a
class called HTML helper now you might
be wondering why should we add an
extension method to HTML helper class
that's because if you look at you know
for example to render a text box we use
at HTML dot text box similarly to render
a text or drop-down list we use at HTML
drop-down list so what is this HTML this
is the property of the view so if I
right click on that and then if we go to
the definition notice that this property
is actually returning an instance of
HTML helper ok so and within this class
you know we have these methods drop-down
list text box
all of these are implemented as
extension methods so if we want to have
something like at HTML dot image then we
need to implement that as an extension
method on this HTML helper class and
adding a method as an extension method
to a class is very straightforward
all we need to do is
have a static method inside static class
so our extension method name has to be
image so here the name of the method is
image and that method has to be a static
and it has to be inside a static class
and then the first parameter for that
extension method has to be the class for
which we are adding that extension
method so in this case we are adding
this extension method to the HTML helper
class so the first parameter is of type
HTML helper and then we need to precede
that with this keyword so this is what
will indicate that we are adding this
extension method to that class and then
you can have whatever parameters you
want since to generate an image tag we
need the source in the alt attributes
you know values for both of those
attributes so we have those two
parameters their source and art and then
to build the tags themselves so
obviously this function should build an
image tag specify the source attribute
and alt attribute and then return that
HTML string back ok so basically to
build the tags we are using tag builder
class ok and then we are adding an
attribute source attribute to that image
tag using you know TB dot attributes
that add function and the notice that
here we are using something called
virtual path utility and I'm invoking
this function to absolute here so what
are we actually doing with the help of
this function here now if you remember
the source attribute is actually
relative path ok so we need to convert
that relative path to a URL ok and to do
that you know this function is going to
help us ok so it's going to take that
relative path and convert that to a URL
for a resource ok and then we have the
alt attribute here and finally notice
that you know obviously tag builder by
converting that to the string and then
look at that we have something called
tag render mode or self-closing because
if you look at the image image is a self
closing tag ok so that's why we have
this um you know tag render mode dot
self closing
so this two string method is going to
return a strain okay but then why are we
returning an AI HTML string why can't we
simply return a string those two string
is going to convert that to a string and
then we are wrapping that inside an MVC
HTML string and and then return and get
now this is because if you return a
string back you know by default you know
all content is HTML encoded okay so if
this returns an image tag with source
and alt attributes so if it is HTML
encoded instead of rendering the image
it is simply going to display that
encoded HTML on the view okay that's why
we need to convert that to be of type I
HTML string okay so strings of type I
HTML string are excluded from HTML
encoding so that's why they will get
rendered as expected otherwise they will
be encoded and you will view the encoded
HTML string on the view instead of
rendering the image itself if that
doesn't make sense now don't worry
you'll actually understand that with the
example okay and to speed things up I
have this code already implemented so
let's copy this and then let's add a
custom folder actually and let's call
this folder custom HTML helper so all
our custom HTML help us we're going to
reside in this folder and then let's add
a class and let's also call this custom
HTML helper is dot CS so we have the
namespace MVC demo dot custom HTML
helpers and fitting that we have the
custom HTML helpers class and this is
the same class that we have I mean same
method that we have on the slide and the
stack builder class is present in system
dot web dot MVC namespace so let's go
ahead and import that
okay let's build a solution okay so this
class has to be a static method because
an extension method has to be a static
method and it has to reside in a static
class so let's make it static let's fill
the solution and then let's use this
image extension method within our view
so within the details view we want to
replace you know this image tag with at
HTML dot image HTML helper but then
notice that we can't see our image HTML
helper that's basically because we need
to include that namespace within our
view so at using MVC demo dot custom
HTML helpers so that's the namespace
within which we have our image extension
method so now when we say image notice
that we can see that and we get in
deletions as well so where is the source
coming from the source is going to come
from model dot photo and the alternate
text is going to come from model dot
alternate text property let's build the
solution and let's refresh this fear so
as far as the behavior is concerned
there shouldn't be any change it should
again display the photo as expected the
page is still refreshing so notice that
there's no change in the behavior the
photo is still displayed but now we're
using this image HTML helper now notice
that we are using this using directory
using MVC demo custom HTML helpers on
the view now let's say if you intend to
use this image helper on all your views
instead of having this using directive
on each and every view you can actually
move that into web config file again
notice that we have web config file you
know in the shared directory so if you
put that you know using that namespace
within this web config file within the
shared directory then it will be
available for all the views so within
web config notice that we have pages and
a
systems or webpages tort laser element
we have pages under that we have
namespaces so let's add a namespace and
then our namespace is and we say demo
dot custom HTML helpers so we can move
that right here and then within our view
we can get rid of that save everything
let's build a solution and you know we
should still get in the license and
everything should work as expected so at
HTML dot image now notice that it
doesn't still show the intelligence
doesn't show the image HTML helper
that's because you know sometimes Visual
Studio behaves weirdly so let me close
the solution and then reopen that once
again then that should fix that issue so
now let's go back and then try to add
HTML dot image notice that it shows the
intelligence shows the image extension
method after I have closed and opened
visual studio so at model dot photo and
at model dot alternate text okay
now notice that within the custom HTML
helper we are returning I HTML string
now instead of that I can simply return
a string and let's see what's going to
happen so if I return a string then I
don't have to wrap this inside an MVC
HTML string so I can simply return that
string so let's build the solution and
let's refresh this view ok so instead of
returning I HTML string we are simply
returning a string now it happens that
MVC HTML string implements that I HTML
string interface okay but then here the
change that we have done is we are
simply returning a string and notice
what happened
okay because of the fact that you know
all strings are encoded by default you
know we have that encoded text displayed
instead of right actually rendering that
image okay that's why from our HTML
helper we need to return you know
something that implements I HTML string
okay
all right on this slide you can find
resources for asp.net c-sharp and
sequels of interview questions that's it
for today thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
