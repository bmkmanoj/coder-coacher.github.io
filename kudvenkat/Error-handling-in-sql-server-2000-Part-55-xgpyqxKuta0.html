am venket this is part 55 of signal
server in this session we'll learn about
handling errors in signals over 2000 in
the next section we'll talk about how to
handle errors in sequence of a 2005 and
later versions before continuing with
the session I strongly recommend to
watch part 18 of this video series where
we have covered the basics of stored
procedures with the introduction of
try-catch blocks in sequence over 2005
error handling in sequel server similar
to programming languages like C sharp
and Java in sequel server 2000 to handle
errors we use a system function at add
error whereas in sequel server 2005 and
later versions we can make use of try
catch blocks which we will talk about in
the next session sometimes these system
functions that begin with @ at-sign
are called as global variables remember
they are not variables and do not have
the same behavior as variables instead
they are very similar to functions and
should be referred to as functions
rather than variables in this session
we'll be working with these two tables
TBL product and TBL product sales tables
TBL product table is like the inventory
table which holds information about the
products that we sell their unit price
and the quantity available product ID is
the primary key and thus TBL product
sales table is the table which contains
the transactions that we made for
example if I sell a product then it
holds information about what product did
we sell which is nothing but product ID
and what is the quantity which is
quantity sold and product sales ID is
the primary key for this table so
obviously when we sell a product there
are two things that needs to happen
first it needs to check the product that
we are trying to sell you know do we
have enough quantity available once we
determine that we need to deduct the
quantity that we are trying to sell from
the quantity available and then the next
step is to insert a row into the stabile
product sales table for example if you
are selling laptops product ID laptops
is one so one
and how many we want to sell let's say
10 for example 10 is the quantity so so
obviously when we sell a product there
are two things that's happening one is
updating this table updating the
quantity available for the product that
you are selling and the second step is
to insert a new row into this table TBL
product sales let's look at a stored
procedure that is capable of selling
products now if you look at this store
procedure it seems to be very big but
trust me it's very simple to understand
all this procedure does is update this
TBL product table the quantity available
column and insert a new row into this
table with some processing steps in
between let's look at this now this is
the stored procedure which is basically
selling products obviously you know if a
stool procedure has to you know sell
products it has to have two parameters
the product that we want to sell the
product ID that we want to sell and the
quantity that we want to sell both of
them of type integer and if you look at
this the first thing this new procedure
is doing check the stock available for
the product that we want to sell now let
us say for example I want to sell
laptops 10 if you look at the product ID
is 1 1 is nothing but laptops and what's
the quantity that we want to sell we
want to sell 10 of them so the first
thing when we want to sell 10 laptops
the first thing to do is to check do we
have enough laptops in this talk and to
do that we are declaring a variable of
type integer stock available and into
that variable we are selecting the
quantity available from TBL product
where product ID is equal to 1 1 is
nothing but laptops so this variable
will now contain the stock available for
laptops which in this case is 90 so
stock available will contain 90 now and
the amount that we want to sell is 10 so
if stock available is less than the
quantity that we want to sell stock
available is 90 the quantity that we
want to sell is 1090 less than
and false so it doesn't come into this
block but on the other hand let us say I
want to sell 100 laptops but then what
is the quantity available only 90 is the
quantity available so what happens it
comes into this F block and at this
throwing an error here
not enough stock available and to
through that error we are using this
function called raze error in c-sharp we
use through keyword to through an
exception
whereas in sequel server if you want to
through a custom error then we use this
raise error function and if you look at
the raised error function itself it has
got three parameters there are message
that we want to return back okay which
in our case is not enough stock
available and then there is an there are
another two parameters error severity
level and error state now the severity
level in most cases is 16 and 16
indicates general errors that can be
corrected by the user okay so most of
the time you know if you want to return
customers the severity level is 16 which
indicates that these are the errors
which can be corrected by user for
example how do we correct this error now
we know that the stock available is 90
so obviously we cannot tell we cannot
sell 100 laptops so just by reducing
that to 80 probably will fix my error
okay so severity level is 16 here and
the other parameter is this state now
error state is a number between 1 and 21
and 255 but raise arrow when you use
when we use free 0 to throw a custom
exception custom error the error state
can only be a value between 1 and 127
but in general we use 1 so lets the
error state is 1 here so this will throw
an exception if the stock available is
less than the quantity that we want to
sell on the other hand if it's not then
it comes to the else part so we have
determined when we when we are in this
else part we know that ok the there is
talk available so if there is enough
stock available what we need to do we
need to first update this TBL product
table the quantity now let's say I want
to sell
only ten laptops okay so let's say ten
is the quantity that I want to sell
product ID is 1 which is laptops so we
are in the L Spock the first thing that
we have to do is update that product
table quantity available column so
quantity available is equal to quantity
available minus the quantity that we
want to sell in this case we want to
sell 10 laptops so what happens from 90
we are subtracting 10 and updating this
quantity available column for laptops
row so that's what this update does and
then the next thing is after we update
the stable product table we need to
insert a new row into this table now to
insert a new row into TBL product sales
table you need values for 3 columns okay
products sales ID obviously that's the
primary key so you'll have to supply
that the product ID and quantity sold
the product ID and quantity sold are
coming in as parameters to this
procedure so we have those product ID
and quantity sale sold in a 1 and 10 but
the third thing is the primary key
itself we need to calculate the primary
key for this table that we need to
insert now already if you look at the
key values we have 1 &amp;amp; 2 so we need to
calculate you know the next primary key
which is 3 and to do that all we are
doing is we are using an aggregate
function max which returns the product
not the max of the product sales ID and
then look at this what we are doing here
basically is if there are new rules
let's say for example this table is
empty we are making our first
transaction for example okay when this
table is empty when you say you know
select max of product sales ID that will
be now so when that is null your max
product sales ID will also be now when
it is null instead of saying instead of
storing null in this we are storing 0
else whatever is the value and the
reason why we are doing this is because
look at the next step what we are doing
we are actually incrementing
at buy one so if there are rules
okay one and two there are two rows here
what happens it checks here it uses this
case statement when max of products
sales ID is null no it's not now if it
is not null then it comes here max of
products sales ID is two so our max of
products sales ad contains two and then
we are incrementing that by one so it
will become 3 here and the product ID is
one quantity to sell it is 10 but on the
other hand let's say when there when
there are no rows in this table in that
case what happens Max product max of
products sales ID will be null if that
is null then we are storing 0 in this
Max product sales ID so 0 plus 1 is 1 so
the first row will have a one of you
know 1 for this column so that's why we
are using this case statement and then
finally what we are doing we are
inserting into this table it's pretty
simple all you are doing I mean there
are two three steps here first check the
stock available if the stock available
is less than the quantity that we want
to sell through an exception otherwise
update the product table with the
quantity that we are selling and then
compute the next primary key that we
want to insert into TBL product sales
table and insert a row into that table
that's about it okay so let's create the
store procedure now
so command completed successfully the
stored procedure is now created let's
see what we have in these two tables now
so if you look at this you know the
quantity available there are 100 laptops
and there are 50 desktops laptops
product IDs 1 desktops product ID is 2
now let us say I want to sell you know
product with ID is equal to 110 is the
quantity so when we plus this what
should happen this quantity available
for laptop should become 90 and there
should be a new row into this table TBL
products sales table so execute that so
command completed successfully execute
this look at that
very good so 10 decreased from the
quantity available there is a new row
here in TBL product sales with product
ID is equal to 1 quantity sold is equal
to 10 which is as expected now let's try
to put introduce some error into the
stored procedure now intentionally I am
getting rid of this line I am actually
commenting this line so when we comment
this line look at what's going to happen
it gets the maximum of product sales ID
and then it tries to insert the same
proxy LCD which is the primary key in
TBL products sales table so obviously we
will get a primary key violation so at
the moment if you look at the rules that
we have in TBL product and TBL proxy
else tables the products sales ID is 1
and what happens when we try to insert
another row with the same ID we get a
primary key violation error and let's
see what's going to happen now so let's
alter the store procedure
okay so now let's try to sell you know
ten laptops again now remember what
happens when we try to execute the store
procedure it updates the table in the
sense it reduces the inventory from 90
to 80 but then it will not insert a new
row into this table let's see that so if
you look at the available stock now look
at this what's the available stock for
laptops 90 okay now when we sell 10
laptops now what should happen there
should be another row with product ID 1
and quantity sold at 10 and then this 90
should become 80 but then remember we
have intentionally introduced an error
here we are not calculating the product
you know the next primary key value
because of which we get a primary key
violation which means this statement
will be successful and this statement
will not be successful and this is
inside the transaction so what happens
this changes will be made and this
changes will not be made so these
statements are no longer being treated
as a transaction so your our data is now
going to become inconsistent because one
statement fail I mean succeeded and the
other statement fail but still those
changes are retained ok so let's see
what happens first execute look at this
one row affected and then there is a
violation of primary key constraint and
the statement has been terminated and if
you look at this the product the
quantity available see you have reduced
you know the quantity available but you
haven't recorded a sales transaction
which means your update didn't work as
expected okay so this update and insert
should be treated as a single
transaction either both of them should
succeed or none of them should work if
one of them fails the other statement
should also be rolled back ok and why
were we not able to properly do this
transaction because we didn't check for
errors
so in sequel server how can we check for
errors as I told you we use this system
function at at error let us see how to
use that error system function and then
you know roll back the transaction if
there are errors and if there are no
errors then we will commit the
transaction but then if you look at the
way the stored procedure is written now
it's committing the transaction
you know without even checking for any
errors okay so it's saying update this
calculate the Max product max product
sales ID and then insert the row and
finally commit the transaction okay but
then we will have to check okay when I
executed this did we encounter any
errors when I executed this did I
encounter any errors when I executed
this did I encounter any errors when
there are you know when there is an
error whenever you execute this
statement or this statement then you
know you will have to roll back the
entire transaction if there are no
errors then we commit the transaction so
let us see how to do that using this at
at error system function so to do that
what we are basically going to do is I
am going to check if that error is not
equal to zero so basically this system
function you know will contain a non
zero if there is an error if there is no
error if the statement has successfully
executed then it will contain zero so if
edit error is not equal to zero then
that means there was some error okay and
remember if there is an error we want to
roll back this entire transactions again
we haven't spoken about transactions yet
we'll be talking about transactions in a
great detail in the later sessions of
this video series so if there are errors
we want to say roll back transaction you
can either use the complete word or you
can just say roll back Tran just like
how we have done here begin Tran commit
Tran on the other hand if it's not equal
to if it's equal to zero then we know
there are no errors and we can commit
the transaction so all I am doing is a
simple modification to this
and and look at this one this line is
still commented which means we are going
to get that primary key violation but
then since we are checking here for the
error condition and then if there are
errors we are saying roll back the
transaction okay so let's say let's
alter this procedure once again so now
let's go ahead and try to sell ten of
laptops again now before we execute that
let's look at the state of the database
so laptops quantity available is 10 and
we are trying to sell 10 of them so what
should happen they should become 70 and
a row should be inserted here but we
know when it tries to insert a row into
TBL product sales table we'll get an
error when that happens we need to even
roll back the update that was done to
TBL product table let's see if that
happens and just so that we know whether
if a statement is committed or rolled
back what we will do is we will wrap
this inside a begin and end statement
and then we will also print a message
saying that transaction rolled back so
transaction rolled back and along the
same lines we'll wrap this inside a
begin and end and we'll say transaction
committed so let's alter this
so now let's try to execute the store
procedure plus F I'll look at this the
statement has been terminated and if you
look at the message transaction rolled
back which means you know we know that
this particular piece of code got
executed transaction rolled back which
means it has undone the update as well
so obviously if you check the quantity
available should still be 80 but on the
other hand if we try to you know
uncomment this line which removes that
error condition there and now what
happens it will it will be able to
successfully execute this insert into
statement and will be able to commit the
transaction so let's say command
completed successfully now look at the
quantity available 80 and when we sell
10 laptops what should happen this 80
should become 70 and a new row should be
inserted into TBL products sales table
so press f5 transaction committed which
means it has committed the transaction
if you look at this there's a new row
here and the quantity available is 70 so
to check errors we are basically using
this system function at at error but
there is a slight you know thing that
you have to keep in mind when you use
this method error function because look
at this this method error returns a
nonzero value if there is an error
otherwise 0 indicating that the previous
sequel statement encountered no errors
now keep in mind this netted error is
cleared and reset on each statement
execution now if you have to get the
exact value then you have to check it
immediately following the statement
that's being verified or you have to
save it to a local variable that can be
checked at a later point of time let's
understand what we mean by this with an
example
now if you look at the example here look
at this let's say TBL product table if
you take TBL product table here now we
already have a row with ID is equal to 2
and product ID is the primary key so
obviously when we try to insert into
that table another product with the same
primary key what we will get will get an
error primary key violation error and
then here you are checking see look at
this when we execute the sensor
statement we get an error and
immediately after that statement
execution we are checking the value of
this system function at it error if not
equal to zero then print error occurred
otherwise no errors now since we are
checking this system function
immediately after the statement that
cost the error then it retains the error
and it shows error occurred let's see
that okay so it's the same thing here so
let's copy this so obviously when we try
to execute this we'll get a primary key
violation when we execute that look at
that error occurred so it caught in here
but on the other hand let's look at this
statement so what we are doing here we
are inserting into this table the same
query so obviously we will get a primary
key violation error here but then I am
not checking the value within that
system function immediately after that
statement execution after that you know
after I execute this statement I have
another statement here select star from
TBL product so now this statement gets
successfully executed when this
statement is successfully executed what
happens is the value that is contained
in this edit error is now reset to zero
because this select statement
successfully executed so at this point
if you check if at at error not equal to
zero it will say it will be equal to 0
why because this statement successfully
executed so the value is reset so
obviously now when I run this code it
will say no errors and that doesn't make
sense right so that's why anytime you
use this edit variable at a terror you
will have to check the value of that
immediately look at this edit error
is cleared and reset on each statement
execution check it immediately following
the statement that's being verified or
the other option is save it to a local
variable that can be checked at a later
point of time so that's what is this one
so we are declaring a variable of type
integer at error this is a local
variable and then when you insert you
know when you execute that inside
statement which is gone or through that
primary key violation error and then
immediately after that you are storing
the value that's present in anti-terror
into this local variable and then you
are executing select star from TBL
product which will only reset this
global variable I'm in this global
system function but then this local
variable contains the value that was you
know returned by the set at error when
this statement when this insert into
statement was executed so at this point
of time you will get what you expect so
here we are saving the value to a little
local variable at error so obviously now
when we execute this is the same code
that we have seen it should print that
message saying error occurred so error
occurred all right in the next session
we will see how to use try-catch to
handle errors in sequence over 2005 and
2008 on this slide you can find
resources for asp.net c-sharp and
sequence of interview questions that's
it for today thank you for listening
