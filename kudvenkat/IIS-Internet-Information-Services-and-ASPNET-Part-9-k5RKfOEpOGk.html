venket this is part 9 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll learn about
what a web server is do you really need
is to develop and test asp.net web
applications how to check if is
installed on your machine if it's not
installed how to install that and
finally we'll look at configuring is
server to run asp.net web applications
so what's a web server in simple terms a
web server is just a piece of software
that can be used to deliver webpages to
clients using the hypertext Transfer
Protocol for example is is a web server
that can be used to run asp.net web
applications so do you really need I
asked to develop and test asp.net web
applications no because Visual Studio
ships with a built-in web server if you
want to just build and test web
applications on your local machine you
don't really need is on your machine ok
but then keep in mind the downside of
using built-in you know visual studio
development server is that this server
will not be able to serve request
another computer meaning if two
computers are on a network and you have
the web application running on one of
the computers using the visual studio
built-in development server and if you
try to access that web application from
the other computer you will not be able
to do that why because the built-in web
server will not be able to serve
requests to another computer it can be
only used to build and test web
applications on just that computer ok
but when you create new asp.net web
applications using visual studio by
default visual studio uses the built-in
web server let's look at that in action
now we are in visual studio where I have
this asp.net web application project
configuring is all I have here is a web
form and if you look at this web form it
doesn't have any code all all it has is
you know an h1 tag showing this message
welcome to asp.net training from presume
technologies and if you look at the code
behind there's no code whatsoever now to
run this application we can press
control f5 and the moment I do that look
at what's going to happen you know the
application
and runs and it renders this page and
then look at the URL here it says HTTP
colon four slash four slash localhost
meaning the local computer and there is
a port number one six four eight zero so
this is the port number at which the
asp.net development server is running
the Visual Studio built in development
server is running and to prove that if
you click in the notifications area on
the taskbar you know you see this little
one and you see the tooltip
asp.net development server if you double
click that you should see a vendor
popping up asp.net development server
which is used to run asp.net
applications locally alone okay so
that's one way to see it the built-in
Visual Studio development server another
way is if you actually go to the project
properties right click on that and
select properties you see on the web tab
if you scroll down into the server
section you see a radio button there you
know use Visual Studio development
server that's selected meaning Visual
Studio by default is using the built-in
Visual Studio development server and
ottawa's input is selected which means
Visual Studio will automatically select
any available port but if you want to
override that if you want to provide a
port that you know is available you can
make use of specific port and specify
the port number here all right so that's
about using the built-in Visual Studio
development server so if you want to
locally build and test applications this
development server is fine but if you
want to make this application available
to other users so they can access it
from their own computers then you will
need is to be deployed on a web server
and then point your eye as to your
application okay so how do you check if
IAS is actually installed I'm on my
machine it's very simple click on start
type run placenta which will show the
run window and to get to the run window
you can simply plus the windows button +
R and then type in inet MGR
Anette manager and click ok now after
you click ok if you get an error message
that means is is not installed on your
machine on the other hand if it shows
this is manager window then you know
that IAS is installed on your machine ok
so if is is not installed on my machine
how do I install is again to install is
it's it's very it's very simple click on
the start button and select control
panel and within the control panel click
on programs by the way I have Windows 7
installed on my machine so if you have
any other operating system apart from
windows 7 it might be slightly different
but you can google you know for example
if you have in those two thousand how to
install IAS on Windows 2000 there are
loads of articles on the web which will
tell you how to do that so within the
programs window if you click on turn
Windows Features on or off then it
should show you a pop-up showing all the
features all the windows features from
this list select IAS and then they
required you know services within IAS
for example if you want is 6
you know compatibility mode you select
that so you basically select is and
click ok after a few seconds I should be
installed on your machine and then when
you go to run window and type I in it
manager you know this is manager should
open up so let's type ionic manager so
that's how you install is so to
configure a virtual directory in I asked
to run a speed or net web applications
how do we do that by the way before we
configure virtual directly let's
understand what we mean by virtual
therapy actually let's configure virtual
directly and then we'll try and
understand what we mean by that virtual
directory okay so to configure a virtual
directory go to is and then this is the
name of the ISO I expand that and you
should see something called sites expand
that and you should see default website
so here you configure a virtual
directory and to do that right click on
the default website and select add
application
once you select an application it shows
this ad application dialog box here you
can give an early as for your virtual
directory so what is which will directly
don't worry we'll be talking about that
in just a bit but let's first create the
virtual directory so let me call this my
application okay and physical path
physical path meaning the path where you
have your web application project
remember it's the path for the web
application project and not the solution
path because when we created this
project we also got a solution with the
same name so if I right-click on the
solution and say open folder in Windows
Explorer look at that it got created in
C Drive configuring is and then within
that I have another folder so this
configuring is is the solution folder
within that solution folder I have this
project folder so this is what you will
have to select as the physical path
because this is what contains your web
application files so the physical path
for that is C Drive configuring iis and
within that you should see another
folder configuring is which is what is
your web application project directory
so I select that I click OK and look at
this this virtual directory is created
now now if you right click on that in is
let me expand this if you right click on
that and select switch to content view
this virtual directory which is pointing
to the physical directory where we have
our web application project will show
the contents of that physical directory
here and if you want to browse the you
know files within this virtual directory
right click and then select browse and
the moment you do that look at this look
at the URL now localhost my app webform
1 dot aspx now previously when I use to
visual studio look at this if I come to
visual studio and plus control if I look
at what's going to happen
let's get to webform 1 let's run that
look at this by default if you look at
the URL it's using the built-in
visual studio development server but
then since I have a virtual directory
configured in is I can also use this
virtual directory to access my
application instead of accessing my
application like this what I can
actually do okay so this one is what is
using our is what you will directly my
app if you remember that's the name of
this virtual directory okay now if you
remember if I right click on that and if
I go to manage for application and
Advanced Settings you see that the
physical path is actually this is a
virtual life tree meaning this directory
does not physically exist on my computer
it is pointing to this physical
directory that's why it's called as a
virtual directory and then if somebody
in the browser
you know localhost is T is my computer
and then within that computer there is a
virtual directory called my app ok and
we know this is knows this virtual
directory is actually pointing to this
physical directory okay and from that
virtual directory
I want web form 1 dot aspx so obviously
since this virtual directory is pointing
to that physical directory in
configuring I as obviously in that
physical directory you have web form 1
dot aspx which will be served through I
as to the client who has requested that
perform since this directly does not
physically exist in a computer it's
called as virtual directory and you use
that as part of your URL address to
actually point to a physical directory
because in URL you you don't really give
sequel and backslash whatever you give a
web address in the URL so you specify
the virtual directory there which in
turn is pointing to a physical directory
through iis
okay so we have just seen how to create
a virtual directory you know through iis
you know directly going to is and then
you right click on the default website
select add application and you specify
an malleus and then a physical path
where you actually have your project
okay rather than doing that you can also
do that directly from visual studio for
example when I press control f5 by
default that's using dividuals to do
your development server let's say we
don't want that I want in a visual
studio to use the iis server that I have
on my machine and to do that you can
actually select use local is web server
and look at this it will give you a
default this is the name of the virtual
directory which is going to be created
in the is if you don't want that you can
change it for example let's say my web
app so I'm going to call my virtual
address my web app and you have a button
here create virtual directory so the
moment you do that what's going to
happen Visual Studio is going to create
a virtual directory on your behalf in
the is automatically so the message the
virtual directory was created
successfully click OK
now if I go to IAS and then refresh this
I should see my web app created and
obviously if you right click on that
switch to content to you by the way
these are the features of is if you want
to browse the contents of the physical
folder to which this virtual directory
is pointing right click on that and
select switch to content view and it
should list the same contents ok and if
you want to browse that you can right
click and say browse and look at what's
going to happen it's going to show the
same waveform but look at this Here I am
referring to this application using my
web app which is nothing but that
virtual directory and previously we are
using my web which technically proves
that you can have as many virtual
directories as you want you know and
then point them to the same physical
directory but we don't do that in
reality alright so basically there are
two ways to create a virtual directory
you can either do that directly from is
or you can do that from visual studio
and to do that you select if you want to
do that from visual studio you use the
configuring is project properties vendor
so two to recap what we have seen
basically by default Visual Studio uses
the built-in web server to run your
asp.net web applications it's fine if
you want to just build and test your
applications but then if you want to
make your application available over the
network so that users can access that
from another computer then you need the
full-blown version of is and you need to
install is on your machine once is is
installed you need to configure is and
basically there are two ways to
configure that you can do that directly
from the is and to get to I as you can
simply click on Windows run and type in
INF manager and within the is which
opens up you can actually create a
virtual directory there or you can do
that from visual studio which will
create the virtual directory
