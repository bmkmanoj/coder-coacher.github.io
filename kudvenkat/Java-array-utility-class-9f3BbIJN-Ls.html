previous tutorial we learnt about erase
their basics declaration creation
initialization of aries in this tutorial
we are going to deep dive into Java
arrays utility class to begin with we
will start understanding how to process
array elements by processing area
elements we mean that how to process or
write rate over each of the array
elements so there are two ways to write
rate over array elements one is for loop
another is for each loop you will see
both of these examples in our code now
let's imagine that we have a array of
double values here I have a double list
with 4 values 1 dot 2 3 or 4 4.6 and 3.5
now let's say our task is to find the
largest element using the for loop so
what would we do so I would initialize
the maximum value with a first element
of an array that is what I have done
here by saying double max equal to
double lynched zeroth element that means
I am treating 1 for 1.2 as the maximum
value next I would use a for loop using
the for keyword and then I will say int
I which is the index I will start with 0
I will I trait till the length of the
arrays ceased and then I plus plus and
then as I might rating over each element
I am checking that if if the element at
the current index is greater than the
max value then max value is equal to the
current element and then finally when I
am out of this for loop I print that the
maximum
max let's execute it we see that the max
element is 4.6 so this is how we I trait
over an array and we find out which
element is belonging to our selection
criteria now also let's see how would we
do the printing of each of the elements
using another version of four which is
for each so I write the four and then
since this is an element of doubles so I
would write double then the variable
names say vas and then I write the
double list which is the name of an
array now this value of the current
element in iteration I can say this out
and then here I can simply print where
with a space following it so I see that
one dot 23.4 4.6 and 3.5 are printed so
this is how is understood how to iterate
over elements using for and for each
loop next we are going to learn about
how do we pass arrays to methods just as
you can pass primitive values to methods
you can also pass arrays to methods let
us understand this using an example let
us say I want to print the current list
whatever I have let's say I have an
array again of double double values and
I want to print this but in this
scenario I want to create a separate
method let's say public static void
print elements and here in this method
I expect let's say double array so I
have a rate here and what I would do is
I would use a for loop here and I would
just try to write the similar code that
we have written some time back where I
say that I want to I trade over this
double array where the input array
iterated and then I am trying to print
the value by followed by space so double
value followed by some space will be
printed here now this method which I can
call from here and all I have to do is I
have to pass it the array so here in
this program a head return method which
is a static method because I have to
access it inside a little static method
and then it returns nothing
it's name is print elements it takes
input parameter as a double array and
then I use that area a print each
element using the for loop this executes
this we see that the elements of the
array are printed by passing that array
in another method this is how we can
pass a array to a method we can also
return these arrays from methods let's
understand this let's say that I want to
declare another array and I want to say
that I need a copy of this list right
and I want to create a copy and then I
pass it a double list and I want this
method to take a array as input and
create a copy and send me back
so how do we do this what we can do is
we can create another method public
static but here it will return our array
as assets return value the name of the
method is create copy and it expects an
array of double type here what I can do
is here I can use let's say for loop
variant I can say int I is equal to 0 I
is less than array dot length I plus
plus and then what I can do is I can
create a copy and I can say that the
size of this array would be equal to
array dot length and then here I am
going to return the copy and in this
loop I am going to assign the values I
can say something like this I can say
that the element at index in the copy
array should be equal to the element at
eyes index in the original array and
then we return this back and then
finally I can use nap print elements
back and again prank my the double list
copy let's execute it
so when I execute it I see that I am
printing the double dish copy and its
values are similar or exactly same as
the original array this is what I mean
by returning array from methods now we
are going to dive into another aspect
which you should know while dealing with
arrays which is the array utility class
Java has provided the array utility
class the Java dot util dot arrays class
contains we use static methods for
sorting selecting arrays searching in a
rays comparison of arrays and maybe
filling array elements also these
methods are overloaded with all
primitive types now let's see this in
action we will use our new class arrays
demo here we are going to use a string
array which is initialized with some
values Abdul Rahim Mike J Kathy all the
elements and then in this in this the
first task which I would like to - is
let me create a copy of an array using
arrays remember how we created a copy of
a double array sometime back we had two
eye trait over original Eric's and
assigned the values one by one there is
a second method to copy a Java array
using arrays dot copy of method now let
us see how we would do that so I can say
that I want to create another array
which is a copy and then what I would do
is I can say arrays dot copy of an
inside copy of what I can write is the
first thing is source array which is the
string array and second thing we have to
provide how many elements we have to
copy so I can say you are to copy all
the elements and then we will use fall
loop I can use the for loop to print
this copy so I can say that when I
execute this I see that all the four all
the five elements have been copied using
arrays dot copy of we do not have to
write any code to iterate over original
array and create a copy so this was one
example which where we used a utility
function provided by arrays class second
thing is let's say we have an integer
array let us say I have an integer array
I will call this arrays original and I
will initialize it with values ten nine
eight seven six five four three two and
one
now these elements are in the reverse
order now we want to sort this array so
what we would do is I can write the
sorted array is equal to arrays dot sort
original arrays dot sort original now
let's see what it expects here it is
saying that it cannot convert from void
to integer array now this means that
arrays dot sort is returning a value
which is what
if you read the description it says that
sources specified array into ascending
numerical order and the implementation
says that it takes only one element as
the parameter which is arrayed to be
sorted and it does in place sorting this
means that if I print elements here that
says source in I I less than original
dot length I plus plus and I print the
elements here I print diet elements
followed by some spaces and I print a
new line after that and then when I copy
this thing
I want to use the same code afterwards
so after I assign the value to I then
the error would go so this one is before
I can write this is before and this one
is after I do the sorting so note that
here I am sorting using erase utility
method right and now I execute this
program so before it was ten nine eight
seven six five four three two one and
after sorting here I should write after
and after sorting I get the value as 1
to 10 in a sorted fashion I would also
like to show you that there are so many
other useful methods in erase utility
class to go to binary search you can see
the methods like binary search you can
you can fill the area with some default
values you can create a copy and so on I
would recommend you to use this erase
utility class and play around with it
create some sample SFL arrays and then
use the utility methods in Java dot util
dot arrays class and then write some
sample programs so in this tutorial we
learnt about how to process arrays using
foreign for each loop we also solve the
hound
can methods take and retain arrays we
also understood that we have a utility
class at our disposal which we can use
to process the arrays in very
interesting ways so stay tuned for our
next series of tutorials goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
