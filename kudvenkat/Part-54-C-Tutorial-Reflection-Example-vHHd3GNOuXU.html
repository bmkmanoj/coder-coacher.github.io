ranked eighth this is pat 50 for
reflection example in this session we'll
look at a practical example of using
reflection if you haven't watched part
53 where we have covered reflection
basics I would strongly encourage you to
watch that video fast before continuing
with the session now in this session
what I want to do is basically develop a
simple windows forms application you
know if you can see a form here the
users will enter the name of the type
for example system not strength or
system got in 32 or system don't console
class when they enter the name of the
class here you know they need to enter
the fluid by name once they do that and
when they click this button discover
type information now I want to list all
of the methods in that class and all of
the properties and constructors in the
respect to list boxes as shown here and
to do this it's pretty simple if you
have got what we have discussed in the
previous session it's very very simple
to do that and let's quickly see how to
do it if you look at this one I already
have a Windows forms application created
here and I have created a form which has
got a textbox label a button control and
then three list boxes and then when I
click this button that's when we need to
inspect the type information and
populate the respective list boxes let's
see how to do that okay we know that the
class is related to reflection are
present in system good reflection
namespace so let's improve that fast so
system dot reflection now what we want
to do is when users run this application
they enter the name of the type into
this text box and if you look at the ID
of that text box if we do the properties
it it is text type name okay
so we need to take the name of the type
from this text box and then find the
type information and populate these list
boxes so let's see how to do that so
string type name is equal to so users
will enter the type name in that text
box so let's get that from the text box
once we do that we can use the type
classes get type static method now we
have covered the basics of this in the
previous session so please watch the
previous session if you haven't already
done so so we get the type here and once
we have the type you know what Lu is
pretty simple from here so type T so we
got the type here and now what we need
to do we need to get methods properties
and constructors and it's pretty simple
so all you do is T dot get methods and
you know get methods will return method
info we have seen that in the previous
session again method in for array so
method n for array and we call those
let's say methods is equal to that and
what we need to do we need to use it for
each loop so for each method in for and
let's say method n
methods collection what we need to do in
this form we have this list methods or
list box so we need to add that method
information to that list box so LST
methods to the list box dot items
because it's the items collection dot
add what we need to add the name of the
method so I take the method object and
then say method dot name so now if we
just run it as ease so what's happening
here we need to enter the type name
let's say system dot console class
so we know the console class presented
system namespace when I say discover
type information we have an error here
let's see what is that error okay
continue let's see let's put a
breakpoint and see why are we getting
that error so when we run this now so
system not console class un Sol Li
console and we click the button discover
type information let's say that okay so
so type is null for some reason so let's
understand why is that type now because
we are saying type would get type and
this is why instead of passing the
variable name we hard-coded that as a
string okay so that's a mistake so stop
that it's a copy-paste error plus in the
type name instead of passing it as
strength within double quotes so now we
run that and enter system don't console
class so system Lord console class so
disco type information you see that we
get all the methods within the console
class for example we have right line now
right line is an overloaded function so
that's why you see it so many times
let's say I want the return type of the
function as well within this list all
you need to do is along with the method
name maybe I want the return type so
method dot return type dot name and then
you give a space and then all right so
now when we run this we should get the
return type of the method as well so
system console and discover type
information and you should see the
return type of every method and
obviously for console dot write line its
void so void right line and for read
line it would be string so you should
see a red line at a string okay
similarly if you want you know on the
second list box we want to show
properties and on the third one
constructors to do that it's a simple
copy-paste
except that
it will replace method I mean instead of
get methods what you will specify is get
what's the second one we want properties
so we'll say get properties so T dot get
properties and get properties will
return property info array so instead of
method info we will say property info
this is extremely easy once you know how
to get one specific in our set of
methods of properties it's extremely
easy for the other types it's just the
names are different property info and
this is going to be property and this
collection is properties and what we
need to do instead of populating the
list methods list box it will be list
properties list box so list properties
note items store to add what we want a
property will also have a return type so
property dot I think its property type
so if you're not sure just hit the dot
you know and you can daintily sense will
show you different properties and
methods and when you highlight here look
at that property type gets the type of
this property okay so I mean after you
get the basics of not net it's it's
mostly self learning you can learn it by
yourself with the help of it in trial
and intellisense so dot name and then
what else I want I want the name of the
property as well so property name that's
it so now if we run that we should get
properties is well let's do it for
constructors and then we will run it all
at once
so for constructors we use t dot get
constructors method and the constructor
is constructed in four
and we will give the variable s
constructors and for each constructor
info object let's call this constructor
in constructors collection what we want
to do and in the from the previous page
session if you remember a constructor
dot name you know we know that a
constructor will have the same name as
data for the class so constructed or
name will be of no use so instead of
that when we say constructed or to
string the to string method is over
again to give us and what are the
parameters that the constructor takes am
which is useful so instead of all this
for a constructor all we do is construct
ax dot to string okay so now if we run
this and by the way there's one more
thing it's not list properties the list
box is list constructors so list
constructors that items to add so now
when we run this and maybe we give let's
say system dot string string class
discover type information look at that
it's got two properties
you know this many constructors in these
many methods and similarly if you want
you know there is something called
system or text or string builder class
let's say discover type information look
at that it has got so many and I think
it's actually adding all this when we
have got a slight problem here which we
will clear it now system dot console
when I say this code type information
system console doesn't have an entity
tool properly I mean length property so
where is this coming from the previous
values are being retained in this list
box and to correct that all you do is
set them to empty whenever we start so
list item list methods dot items that
clear the items and do the same thing
with the other list
so we have list properties list
properties and list constructors just
clear them before you start adding
anything so now if we run it should do
so system dot may be text dot
stringbuilder disco type information we
get that on the other hand when we go
back to system console so disco type
information all right so it's working as
expected now so it's a pretty simple
example where we are able to discover
the type information at runtime and
populate these list boxes and remember
with this you know you can with
reflection it's not just that listing
methods of properties or constructors
there are variety of things that you can
do for example when you say t dot there
are several you know boolean properties
as well is the type abstract is it an
array
there are several properties and methods
that are really really useful for
variety of things ok now whenever you
have time just explore the system load
reflection namespace it's really useful
all right so on the slide you can find
some resources for asp.net and C happen
to be questions that's it for today
thank you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
