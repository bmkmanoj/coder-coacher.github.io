venket this is part 6 of dotnet Basics
in this session we'll understand the
problem of DLL hell now let's say on my
computer I have two applications
application a1 and a2 both of these
applications use the shade assembly
shade dot d allow now let's say I have a
latest version of application a2
available on the internet I downloaded
this latest version of a2 and installed
it on my computer
now let's say this new installation of
a2 has accidentally overwritten this
shade assembly with a new version that
came along with the download so what
happens a - works fine but when I try to
run a one you know it fails to run why
because this shared assembly is not
backward compatible and how can you make
an assembly not backward compatible you
know you can do a variety of things ok
maybe we have removed some of the
existing methods which were present
there before or we change the signature
of the methods okay so anything like
this could actually break the backward
compatibility nature of an assembly so
as a result of this the existing
applications stopped working but whereas
this new installation of a 2 works fine
ok
so in brief DLL hell is a problem where
one application will install a new
version of the shared component that's
not backward compatible with the version
that's already there on the machine
causing all the other existing
applications basically you know to fail
so with the dotnet strong named
assemblies we don't have this problem of
DLL hell anymore
we'll actually see how to solve this DLL
hell problem in the next session now
let's look at an example of how to you
know simulate this DLL health problem so
if we go back you know it's basically
there are two applications a1 and a2
which rely on one of the shade
assemblies so let's kind of create such
an example so let's create a new project
so file new
project let's say visual c-sharp console
application and let's call this a one so
I have a console application a one as
part of the solution let's create
another console application a two so we
have to console applications at the
moment and let's say both of these
applications rely on a class library
project so let's add a class library
project to the solution so this time
it's going to be class library project
and I'm going to call this class library
and let's click OK and all this class
library is going to contain is a very
simple class maybe we'll call the sample
class and let's say I have a static
method so public static string and let's
say maybe get message one
maybe that's the original version of the
method and all this method does is
return a string all right okay now let's
say this application a one wants to make
use of that assembly so in order to do
that we add a reference to that assembly
right click add reference and we browse
to that particular project which is
present in class library bin-debug and
class library assembly so we are making
use of that assembly in a one let's do
the same thing for a two as well because
both these applications you know use
that assembly so class library bin-debug
assembly and let's say in application a1
we want to make use of that class
library assembly so we import the
namespace using the using statement and
then in a main method
console dot write line within that class
library assembly we know that we have
got a sample class within which we have
get message 1 and consult or tree line
so let's basically do the same thing
even in a two application so if I come
to a two application in program dot CS
okay so let's use the class library
namespace okay so now if you look at the
setup here we have two applications a 1
and a 2 which rely on this class library
assembly so let's build a solution and
when I open a 1 application in Windows
Explorer go into the bin debug directory
I have a 1 executable and the class
library assembly let's copy this and
paste them to a separate folder let's
say I have my application folder let's
say you know when I downloaded this
application from the internet it got
copied into this folder and along the
same lines let's say I have downloaded a
to application as well from the internet
which also require the class library
assembly and a to dot exe so let's say
they also get copied over into my
application folder and when I paste that
so obviously it detects that ok sample
I'm in class library assembly it's
already there do you want to copy and
replace let's say s for that now if I
run a 1 dot exe look at that it works
fine so this is a 1 dot exe and if I run
a 2 dot axc
so both of the applications now are
running fine because why
both of these rely on this assembly
class library assembly and that version
is compatible with both of these two
applications now let's say over a period
of time you know
there were some improvements for a to
application as a result of which they
also have changed this class library
let's say they they improved this class
library method instead of saying
pledging the sudden regime technologies
and instead of calling it as get message
1 they call it as kept message 2 so
obviously now if I go to a - I will say
ok instead of kept message 1 it's going
to be get message 2 and when we build
this application now let's say
let's get rid of this one for some
reason it's giving an error
but let's build this project so we build
a class library and then let's riad the
reference and now sample that get
message two so now if we build the
solution and go into the debug directory
bin and debug so we have a 2 and class
library so now let's say this is like a
new version of the program that I have
downloaded from the internet and trying
to install it now and then when I'm
trying to install it you know let's say
it get copied into the same folder when
I do this obviously it detects that ok
there is a class library folder do you
want to copy and replace and obviously
if you remember when you are installing
a program you click Next Next Next and
finish and just say along the same lines
I just did that and then I copied and
replaced now when I then a to because I
install this is the new version of the
application
alright it's working fine without any
issues but then when I try to look at
this both of these applications rely on
this one a to works fine because it's a
new version of the application and I
downloaded this application it
accidentally over root this class
library assembly which is also used by
a1 dot exe but then a1 dot exe expects
you know the method name to be what's
that get message 1 but we have changed
that to get message 2 so now this
assembly is no longer backward
compatible so not only a one if there is
any other application that's actually
using get message one method from this
assembly all of them will basically fail
now so this is nothing but DLL hell so
if I run a one dot exe look at that it
has dot you know missing method
exception method not found which method
is not found get message one method is
not found so this is nothing but DLL
hell in the next session we will
actually learn how to solve this DLL
hell
on this slide you can find resources for
a Swede or Nathan c-sharp interview
questions that's it for today thank you
for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
