this video well disk is using buttons in
input groups in our previous video we
have discussed using text and icons in
input groups to use text and icons in
input groups we have used input group
add-on class in this video we'll discuss
using buttons in input groups to use a
button in an input group use input group
BTN class instead of input group add-on
class let's look at a few examples now
so here is what we want to do we want to
append this search pattern to the input
element on the right-hand side as you
can see here let's see how to do this
let's flip to visual studio at the
moment we are using a radio button with
an input group so if we view this page
in the browser this is how it looks like
now to use this radio button with the
input group we have placed that radio
button inside a span element with class
input group add-on now we want to use a
button with this input group to use a
button with the input group we will use
input group BTN class instead of input
group add-on class so the first change
that I'm going to do is change this
class to input group BTN and then inside
this plan element let's include a button
element type is going to be button class
let's use the button classes BTN and BTN
default and the text for this button is
going to be search let's save our
changes and when we reload this page
notice we have a button appended to the
input element but we want this button to
be on the right-hand side so let's place
the span element after the input element
let's save our changes reload the page
notice we get the button appended to the
input element on the right hand side as
expected let's now discuss using drop
down button with an input group the drop
down button should have three actions
action 1 2 action 3 as you can
let's see how to achieve this let's flip
to visual studio at the moment we're
using a button with the input group we
want to convert this button to a button
drop down to convert the button to a
button drop down the first change that
I'm going to do is in addition to these
two classes BTN and BTN default I'm
going to use another class and that is
drop down toggle this class is required
on the trigger element that is the
element which shows or hides the drop
down menu in our example the trigger
element is the button itself so this
class drop down toggle is required on
the button in addition to this class we
also need data - toggle attribute and
the value for this is going to be drop
down this attribute is required on the
trigger element to show or hide the drop
down menu and look at what the drop down
button says the text is drop down so
let's change this text right here from
search to drop down and we also want
this little downward pointing arrow to
get that little downward pointing arrow
we are going to use a span element with
class set to carat finally we need to
build the drop down menu items to do
that we are going to use an unordered
list and the class of this element is
going to be drop down menu because
that's what we are essentially building
here so the drop down menu items are
going to be list items with anchor
elements nested the href attribute at
the moment is pointing to a hash symbol
but it can point to any valid URL or
page within your application and the
text is going to be action 1 let's make
two more copies of this and change the
text accordingly action - and action 3
now notice there is a little green
squiggly under unordered list and if I
hover the mouse over it look at what
message we get element ul cannot be
nested inside element span so we are
spanning this element ul inside
the span element and we cannot do that
that's why we are getting that warning
so let's convert the span element to a
development let's see what changes and
when we reload this page notice now we
get a button drop down with the input
group and when we click on the button
drop down we see the three actions that
we expect now let's convert this button
to a segmented button first let's
understand what's a segmented button
with a segmented button we have a
primary action on the left as you can
see here and the other actions are
available as part of the drop-down
button on the right so let's see how to
convert this drop-down button to a
segmented button as you can see here
that slipped to visual studio so we
already have a drop-down button as part
of this input group in addition to this
drop-down button we want another button
so let's include a button element type
is going to be button class BTN and BTN
default and the text on the button is
going to be action so let's save our
changes and reload this page notice we
get a segmented button action and then
we have this drop down button here we
don't want this text on this drop down
button so let's go ahead and delete the
text save our changes reload the page
notice now we get a segmented button on
the Left we have the primary action and
on the right we have the drop down
button when I click on that we get the
other actions let's now discuss using
multiple buttons with the input element
so here is what we want to do we want to
open these three buttons cut copy paste
on the right-hand side of the input
element as you can see here let's see
how to achieve this let's flip to visual
studio at the moment as part of this
input group we have a button and a
button drop down we don't need this
button drop down anymore so I'm going to
delete that and I'm going to make two
more copies of this button the text on
the first button is going to be cut on
the second one copy
the final one paste let's save our
changes and when they reload this page
notice we get multiple buttons appended
to the input element on the right-hand
side
as expected but look at the width of
this textbox
it's very less to increase the width of
this textbox I'm going to change the
grid class here from call X s3 to call X
is 5 save our changes reload the page
notice the width increases accordingly
as expected
finally let's see how to use icons with
the multiple buttons that are appended
to the input element so here is what we
want to do we want to use icons with the
buttons that are part of this input
group as you can see here these icons
are glyph icons and you can find these
icons right here here is the URL and
here are those three icons glyph I can
align left' glyph I can align Center and
cliff I can align try to use these icons
with the buttons that we have all we
have to do is replace the text with this
pan element and the class of this pan
element is going to be the name of the
icon so the name of the icon is glyph
item glyph icon - align left' and let's
do the same thing with the other two
buttons we have so this is going to be
cliff icon align Center and finally this
is going to be glyph I can align right
let's save our changes and when we
reload our page notice we get icons with
the buttons as expected
