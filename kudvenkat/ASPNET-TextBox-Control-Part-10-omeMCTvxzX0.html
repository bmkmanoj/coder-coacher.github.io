venket this is part 10 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll learn about
the properties events and methods that
an asp.net textbox control supports we
all know that the textbox control is
used to get the input from the user of
the web application an asp.net text box
control has several properties that we
need to be aware of as a developer the
most widely used property is the text
mode property depending on how you
configure this property the look and
feel and the behavior of the textbox is
going to change for instance if you set
the text mode property of the textbox to
single line then the end user can only
enter a single line of text into the
textbox control whereas if you want the
end user to enter multiple lines of text
into the textbox control then set the
text mode to multi-line on the other
hand if you want to capture the password
from the user then set the text mode to
password so that whatever the user types
into the textbox is masked let's look at
that in action I have an asp.net web
application here which has got a text
box and the button control on the
webform now if you want to get to the
properties of the text box control right
click that and select properties now
let's set the text mode to single line
and when you set the text mode property
of the textbox to single line and when
you run the application you know a text
box is displayed where the end-user can
only enter one line of text into the
textbox control on the other hand if you
want to give the capability of entering
multiple lines into the text box control
then set the text mode property to
multi-line and look at this the moment I
change this to multi-line you know look
at what's happening it's it changes into
a multi-line text box and then you can
actually control how many lines of you
know text can be entered into this text
box using the ROS property so there is
this flows property for example let's
say I want to enter I want to allow the
end user to enter only you know five
lines of text I can set that to five and
then when I run this you know this
multi-line text box is displayed and
when
use the stats typing and if he exceeds
five lines of text look at this I
automatically get a scrollbar using
which I can scroll up and down on the
other hand if I want to capture the
password from the user I can set the
text mode to property to password and
then obviously when we run this and when
we try to enter anything into that text
box it will be masked and not be and it
will not be revealed all right now let's
set this text mode to single line now
there is this text property which can be
used to set or get the text box from
text from the text box control so this
is one of the you know very commonly
used password say I enter something into
this text book text box and I want to
append hello word along with whatever
text that we have entered into the text
box and display that how do I do that
obviously double the button control you
get the click event handler and I want
to write something on to the response
stream so response dot right hello and
to this I want to append whatever the
user types into the text box and if you
look at this the moment I say text box
one dot text look at the intelligence it
shows what this property is used for it
used to get or set the text content of
the text box control so now when we run
the application and when you type
anything into the text box and click the
button control it will display hello and
then that word for example let's type
regime and then when I click the button
control look at this hello praveen how
is this being displayed we are using the
text property route to retrieve what the
user has typed and then appending that
with this hallo word on the button click
event so we can use the text property
and look at this we use this text
property in the code to retrieve now you
can also use that in the designer if you
want let's say if I want to set it to
some deep
alt-text when the page loads up you can
set that text property here let's say
type in now the moment you do that look
at this you see that message so all
these properties of the textbox control
that you see here can be set either the
design time or at the run time using
code and we have just seen how to
retrieve the text from the textbox
control at runtime and you can also use
this max length property to limit the
number of you characters that the end
user can type so let's say let's remove
this default text now if you set the max
length property let's say for example to
5 the end user can only type 5
characters into the textbox
you know when the webform actually
renders so when I type when I try to
type more than 5 characters look at this
I'm trying to type but it doesn't allow
you to enter those things so max length
property can be used to limit the number
of characters that the user can enter
and read-only property as the name
States you know if you want you know the
text not to be editable in this in the
text box control then set this property
to true so let's set the read-only
property to true so f4 to get to the
properties and then if I select
read-only by default its false and if
you change that to true and when you run
the application you wouldn't be able to
type anything into that text box look at
this I'm trying to type but you cannot
do that because that's a read-only text
box tool tip this is interesting
property the tooltip is actually
displayed when the mouse is over the
control so if you set the tooltip for
example here let's say the tooltip is
please enter your name
and then when you actually run the
application and when you hover the mouse
over that control it's going to display
that tooltip so look at this as I hover
my mouse please enter your name
so the tooltip is displayed when the
mouse is over the control and we have
seen how to use the ROS property to
limit the number of lines to display for
a multi-line text box whereas there is
another property called columns we use
this property to specify the width of
the textbox control in characters now if
you look at this we have height and
width properties which we can use to
control the height and width of a text
box but that one you can specify in
pixels but whereas if you want to
specify the width of the text box and
characters then we then we can make use
of this columns property so for example
if I want to limit the number of
characters to ten then you can specify
columns Stan in which case the end user
will be able to type only ten characters
and this Auto postback property you know
we have already spoken about this when
we discussed about control level events
we know that there are several asp.net
controls which has got cached events for
example text box is one of them you know
if you want to check the events that the
text box control supports what you can
basically do is select the control and
go to it properties window and within
the properties window look at this
Lightning bulb symbol so when you click
that this page will show you all the
events that are supported by this
textbox control now look at this this
text change event is the one that we
commonly use and when when does this
even get fired
this gets fired whenever the text in the
textbox changes and by default this
event is a cached event meaning let's
see what actually happens now when I run
this page but then we don't have the
event handler so let's generate the
event handler to generate the event
handler we double click the control upon
double clicking the control look at this
I have this event handler generated
textbox one underscore tax change
now you might be wondering how how is
this event handler hooked to the text
change the event of the textbox control
if you actually look at the HTML this is
the textbox control and if you look at
this there is you know the properties
tooltip read-only whatever we have said
but there is also this event on text
changed on text change we are calling a
method with this name textbox one
underscore text changed so we are using
this on text change you know even
basically and we are hooking up this
event handler to that event of the text
box note exchanged event of the textbox
control so this is how the textbox
control knows it has to call this event
handler when the text in the textbox is
changed so obviously let's simply say
let's spawn start right and we want to
just say text to changed so now when we
run this application and when we change
the text in the textbox it's not going
to immediately post back okay we have
said that to read-only so that's why I'm
not able to type in anything let's
remove that read-only flag so let's
delete that again you can do that either
in the HTML or through the designer
using the properties window so I am
doing that in the HTML remove that
read-only property so now when we run
this and and type something into the
textbox and look at this when I lose the
focus of the textbox I don't have the
event fired but when I click the button
look at this text changed event it's
cached until the page is posted back and
then upon post back when I click the
button that's when this event is fired
but let's say we want this text changed
even to be fired immediately then you
set the auto post back property to true
so again you can do that either in the
HTML directly or you can do that through
the designer so let's do that in the
HTML so auto post back is
12:2 you can set that to true and the
moment we do that and when we run this
and when the text in the text box
changes it will automatically post back
let's say I am typing this text and you
know clicking away so that the text box
loses focus look at that they even get
immediately fired so that's about the
auto post back property and we have we
already seen that text changed even this
is one of the events supported by the
text box control and this is fired
whenever the text is changed and this is
one of the very interesting methods
focus method and as you can see this
method can be used you know to set the
input focus on to that control let's say
if I have a large forum where we are
capturing information from the employee
or a customer and we want a specific
text box control to receive the focus
when the webform is loaded then you can
use this focus method let's see how to
actually use that so if you look at this
I have this text box control now if I
can I go to the code-behind and the page
load I'm saying text box one dot focus
and look at this the intellisense shows
this method is used to set input focus
to a control so when you do that and
when I run this look at what happens
let's cancel that and rerun that so when
the page loads look at that the text box
will receive the focus and look at that
curse it's automatically blinking there
now you wouldn't know the difference if
let's say I have more than one text box
let's copy that so one two and then
three text boxes we have three text
boxes but then we are only saying that
set the focus to the first text box and
if you look at the HTML the first text
box is this one text box one and since
we copied the text box all these
properties also got copied but that's
fine let's run this
look at this out of these three text
boxes the first text box will receive
the focus when the webform eventually
loads okay
now what actually happens if I said if I
call the focus method on two or more
text boxes because if you look at the
code right now we are only calling focus
on one text box let's say I call this
focus on more than one text box I will
set this to text box to dot focus now we
are saying okay set the focus to text
box one as well as text box - is it
possible for the cursor to blink in two
text boxes at the same time you can
imagine what actually happens here you
know whatever is the last text box that
that has this focused method called that
will receive the focus so even if you
say if you call the focus method on
multiple text boxes only one of them is
going to receive the focus so here the
text box on which the last text box on
which we are calling the focus method is
text box - so in the when the page
renders you can see that text box -
receives the focus all right and we have
already seen to view the properties of
the text box control you can right click
on the control and select properties in
the properties window you can also find
the events you know which will be shown
using that lightening bulb symbol all
these properties can be set at the
design time or at runtime using code on
this slide you can find resources for
asp.net c-sharp and sequel server
