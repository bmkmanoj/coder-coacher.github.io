many of you have posted these questions
about per session WCF services so I
thought I'll record this video to
clarify these questions
this is continuation to path 38 so
please watch 438 before proceeding let's
look at these questions one by one do
all bindings support sessions the answer
is no not all binding support sessions
for example basic HTTP binding does not
support session if the binding does not
support session then the service behaves
as a pair called service let's look at
this with an example let's flip to
visual studio we'll be working with the
same example that we worked with in the
previous session so notice that at the
moment we're using net TCP binding the
service host is already running so let's
go ahead and run the Windows client that
we have built and when we click in work
service okay number is 1 and when we
click again number is 2 so you know net
TCP binding support sessions and so this
is behaving as a pair session WCF
service because we configure this
service as a pair session service now
let's change the binding to basic HTTP
binding within the WCF service so here
we are using net TCP binding let's
change it to basic HTTP binding save the
changes
let's close the client and the service
hosts that are running and then let's
rerun the service host ok so the service
host is started let's go to the client
application let's actually delete the
service reference
and let's add a reference to a service
so this should discover our simple
service so let's specify the namespace a
simple service click OK so now if you
look at the clients application
configuration file it should be using
basic HTTP binding alright let's go
ahead and run our client and then click
this button and see if it remembers
state between calls look at that no
matter how many times we click you know
the number is always 1 so it's not
remembering this state so in spite of
configuring our WCF service as a per
session service since the binding you
know doesn't support session you know
the service is going to behave as a per
call service not as per session service
so the straight answer to this question
does all binding support sessions no not
all binding support sessions if the
binding does not support a session then
the service behaves as per call service
inspite of having it configured as per
session WCF service alright now how to
control the WCF service session timeout
so this is another question posted by
our YouTube subscribers we know that the
default session timeout is 10 minutes
but if we want to increase or decrease
the default timeout value then how do we
do that basically all we need to do is
set the receive timeout attribute you
know of the respective binding element
let's actually flip to our simple
service and let's change this back to
net tcp binding now we want to control
the session timer let's actually you
know specify the session time mode as
let's say 10 seconds and in order to do
that directly under the system dot
service model element you know use the
bindings element and what binding is
this this is net PCP binding so let's
specify the binding is net TCP
binding and then here we specify receive
timeout and we specify that in hours
minutes and seconds so we want 10
seconds as they receive timeout and
let's give this binding configuration a
name so that we can associate that with
an endpoint so let's call this net TCP
and then associate this with this
endpoint and how do we do that using
binding configuration attribute so we
specify that name right here okay so at
this point you know the receive timeout
is 10 seconds so the service instance
object will be remained remaining on the
server memory only for 10 seconds after
10 seconds it will be you know removed
from the memory okay
let's actually close the client and the
WCF service that are running let's go
ahead and run our WCF service so the
host has started and since we have
changed the binding that's actually
delete this and add a service reference
so now we are using TCP binding which
support sessions and we have set the
session timeout to 10 seconds so simple
service is the namespace let's click OK
all right let's go ahead and run the
client now when we click invoke service
so number is 1 click it again
number is 2 now if we wait you know for
10 seconds what's going to happen you
know the session is going to timeout and
then when the client makes a request we
no longer have the service instance
object on the WC of server memory ok so
obviously there will be an exception
thrown so I think it's you know 10
seconds now let's actually click this
button and see what happens look at that
it says that connect the socket
connection was aborted this could be
caused by an error processing your
message or receive timeout being
exceeded by the remote host so obviously
we have set the receive timeout as 10
seconds and we have exceeded that and
that's why we have this exception so how
to control the WCF service session
timeout you know we use the receive
timeout attribute on the respective
binding element so what happens when the
session timeout is reached when the
session timeout is reached the
connection to the WCF service is closed
as a result the communication channel
between the client and the WCF service
gets faulted ok and the client can no
longer use the same process proxy
instance to communicate with the service
this also means that you know along with
the session any data that is stored
within the service object is also lost
ok so this client basically lost you
know the number which was stored you
know within the service instance object
on the server memory along with you know
the session right so obviously after the
session has timed out on the first
attempt you have noticed that we got
this error the socket connection was
aborted now if I click the button once
again look at that I get a different
error so now it says the communication
object system dot service model
in our channels that service channel
cannot be used for communication because
it's in faulted State okay so obviously
the next question is how to fix the
communication channel is in a faulted
State exception you know all we need to
do is put the line that calls the
service method within a try block and if
at all if there is an exception you know
we know that there's going to be a
communication exception so if you look
at the first exception this is a
communication exception so we are
handling that exception and then we
check the client state okay is it
faulted if it is faulted then we know
you know the session has timed out
existing session object will be lost and
a new session you know they're going to
create a new session by creating and new
instance look at this here we are
creating a new instance of the proxy
class now here I'm using a string
variable basically to construct this
message because I was not able to fit
that on the screen but you know you know
in an actual implementation we can
directly pass that entire string to this
show method as a parameter okay so we
display that message and then
immediately we create a new instance of
you know the proxy class which is going
to establish a new session with the WCF
service okay so let's actually look at
this in action and to speed things up I
have already typed this so let's copy
and paste that within our client
application so here we have the form so
double-click on the form to get to the
event handler and here let's paste that
code okay so straightforward code is the
same that we have discussed on the
slides okay so let's go and run this now
so invoke service so number equals one
number equals two let's wait for 10
seconds so that the session gets timed
out on you know once the session is
timed out you know it will throw a
communication exception and why is that
because the channel is faulted and we
try to use the same proxy instance
we get an exception because we can no
longer use it for communication
you know when the channel is faulted so
once I click this look at this session
timed out your existing session data
will be lost and a new session will be
created once I click OK you know this
piece of code gets executed which will
create a new instance of the proxy class
a new session is established so now it
works as expected again it's going to
work for the next ten seconds you know
if you keep on making requests within 10
seconds it's going to work but then if
you wait for 10 seconds what's going to
happen you know you will get an
exception and the sketch block is going
to handle that and then create a new
proxy okay but keep in mind your
existing session data will be lost
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
