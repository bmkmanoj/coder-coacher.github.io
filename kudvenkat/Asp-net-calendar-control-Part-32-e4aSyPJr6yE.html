venket this is part 32 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll learn about
using the asp.net calendar control let's
flip to visual studio in this session
we'll look at a simple real time example
of capturing date from the end user in
the next session we'll see how to
customize you know the properties and
events to suit our application
development needs let's drag and drop a
text box control on to the webform which
is going to store the date that we
select from the calendar let's reduce
the size of the textbox and then I'm
going to have an image button and let's
have the calendar control okay now the
calendar control is a very rich control
lets auto format this calendar all right
so now what we basically want to do
let's associate this image button to an
image I already have an image here let's
copy that create an images folder within
our web application project add new
folder let's call this images and copy
the image into that folder okay now we
want to associate this image with this
image button so go to the properties of
the image button and use the image URL
property to associate the image click on
the properties icon image URL select the
images folder select calendar dot jpg so
now what we basically want to do is when
we run the application you know any
shell even the page loads the calendar
will not be visible to the user when
they click the image but we want this
calendar to be visible and then once the
user picks the date we want to populate
this text box with that selected date
and then hide the calendar okay
so when the page first loads if it's the
initial get request meaning if it's not
a post back then we want to hide the
calendar so calendar one dot visible is
equal to false all right
but then when I click this button the
image button we want to show the
calendar to the user so calendar one dot
visible is equal to true okay let's run
this as the application stands right now
when the form first loads the calendar
will be invisible and then when I click
this image button the calendar becomes
visible and I when I click on any of
these dates here you know that date
should be populated within this text box
and then the calendar should become
invisible now this is the most common
technique that we use today to actually
select the date from the end user in
fact we also can use JavaScript calendar
without posting back to the web server
we can actually select the date from the
user we'll look at that in a later
example but this asp.net calendar when
you selected it it post back to the
server and then on this server we can
actually write server-side code to
populate the text box okay now let's see
what actually happens when the user
selects the date when the user selects
the date the calendar
the control raises an email and what is
that
event let's flip to the webform let's
select the calendar control go to the
events of the calendar control and if
you look at this there is an event
called a selection change event whenever
you select the date on the calendar this
event gets fired so double click there
they even handler for the calendar
control selection change the event is
generated so what happen when when a
selection is changed we want to retrieve
the selected date from the calendar and
populate that into the text box so text
box one dot text is equal to quell in
the one dot select date okay now
selected date returns a date time but we
want to convert that to string so that
that can be set as the text for the text
box control and what else we want to do
we want to hide the calendar so calendar
one dot physical is equal to false okay
so let's run this now the waveform
initially loads the calendar will be
invisible I click the image but in the
calendar becomes available and when I
select the date look at that I get the
date there and if you look at the date I
also have time there we'll solve that in
a bit but there is another problem here
when I click on the calendar look at
that the calendar is shown but now let's
say I don't want to select any date is
there a way to close the calendar no you
have to select the date to close the
calendar so I have to select another
date now how can we close the calendar
without having to select the date okay
let's do that using this image button so
if the calendar is visible then I
actually want to hide it else meaning if
the calendar is not visible then we want
to show the calendar so turn on the
visibility
okay so we're using the same button to
do that so when we run the project now
you know when I click the image button
once if the calendar is not visible that
will be shown if I click that again it
kept
closed okay now the other problem is
when I select the data I am getting the
time as well which I don't want I just
want the selected date from the user
okay so is there a way to knock off that
time part of it yes and there are
several ways in fact you can also
customize the format of that date and
time in a variety of different ways and
let's actually look at them you know
there are several methods actually on
this date/time object if you look at
that when I say dot you know there are a
load of methods I can use to short date
string that's going to return just the
date part of it too short a time string
that's going to return just the time in
fact if you look at the slide here you
know - string is giving us this output
the date and the time to long date
string gives us this one with the fully
expanded month name and too short a date
string just gives us the two part date
month and year and two long time string
gives us hours minutes and seconds -
short time string gives us this you know
and similarly you don't have to use this
method every time instead you can also
use the date-time format strings okay
when I say datum now dot - string to the
two string method if I pass in a small D
then short date time is shown if I pass
in a capital D L you know the long date
time is shown okay so there are a
variety of date-time format strings and
methods that we can use to actually
format and customize these dates to suit
our development needs in fact if you are
thinking do I have to remember all these
you know method names and you know those
format strings you don't really have to
if you type in search Google MSD and
date-time format strings you get an MSD
n article which which lists all of them
you know small D what it does capital D
what it does etc alright so let's flip
to Visual Studio so not right now I just
want the short date so I can use small D
there and now if we actually run this
and selected it what's going to happen I
just get
you know the date part of that so only
the date okay cool
now another issue with this calendar is
that I'm able to select every date that
I see
within this calendar okay so I'm able to
select you know these dates 29 30 31
they actually belong to the month of
October and these 1 2 9 these dates
belong to the month of December okay and
then I'm also able to select the
Saturdays and Sundays now let's say I
want to disable the selection of dates
that doesn't belong to the current month
and weekends as well Saturdays and
Sundays is there a way to do that
absolutely now if you think for a minute
how can we actually do that you have to
disable the selection for each cell
within this calendar control so there
has to be an event that you can tap into
to do that so is there a even like that
for the calendar control absolutely
let's look at the events of the calendar
control so let me go to the webform and
then select the calendar control go to
the properties of that if you look at
the even there is an event called day
render and this even gets fired for each
day within the calendar control okay so
there are seven rows and columns here 7
into 7 49 times this even gets fired
when this calendar is actually rendered
so let's actually double click that
there and then just to examine this
events I'm saying response dot right and
you have here day lender eventargs
object coming into this even handler and
this has a property called day dot day
number text now let's select that and
let's put an HTML break here so plus now
let me run this and see what's going to
happen when the page loads the calendar
is not visible so obviously this event
will not be fired but then when I click
this button the calendar becomes visible
so that's when this day render even gets
provided and let's see what is going to
happen look at that it's it's actually
printing out you know the day number
text from 29th of the previous month 1
to 30 of the current month and then the
rest of the days that get shown in
calendar until 9:00 so for each day
within this calendar this event is
raised so we can tap into the cement to
actually achieve what we want to achieve
so what we want to achieve is that we
want to disable the selection of any
days that doesn't belong to the current
month so is there a way to identify you
know if the day doesn't belong to a
calendar absolutely and how do we do
that
you can use the same object that is
coming into this event handler so if a
dot and there is a stay property day is
there is a property called each other
month if the day belong to other month
then this property returns true so if
the day is belonging to other month or a
dot day dot is weekend if it's weekend
then I want to disable that as well and
similarly if you want to disable the
current day you know or any day before
the current day you you have a lot of
flexibility to do that okay so what I
want to basically do here ye dot is
selectable erode a dot is selectable and
I am setting that to false that's all
you have to do so now if we go ahead and
run this now the user will not actually
be able to select any weekend days or
the other dates look at that you cannot
actually click on them in fact if you
want you can change the color you look
at this even Saturday Sundays I am NOT
able to select them but I can select any
other date now let's say I want to
change the back color of these weekends
and the days that belong to other month
I can just say e dot the cell that
displays that day I want to change the
back color maybe to red which indicates
that you shouldn't select them so now
when we run this and when the calendar
actually renders you can see the
background color of the calendar
actually for those days chains you can't
select those days but any other day you
can select them and there are a lot of
other customizations that we can
actually do for this calendar which we
will you know investigate in the next
video session
on this slide you can find resources for
asp.net c-sharp and sequel server
interview questions that's it for today
thank you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
