am Frank it this is part seven of
asp.net grid-view tutorial in this video
we'll discuss about formatting asp.net
grid view control now in sequel server I
have this table TBL employee I want to
retrieve the data that's available in
this table and then display that in a
grid view control in my asp.net web
application project so obviously we need
a grid view control for that so let's
drag and drop a grid view control onto
the waveform and we want to retrieve
data from the table using sequel data
source control so let's drag and drop
that as well click on the small deck
button click on configure data source
now in my web config file I have a
connection string which points to the
sequel server that's installed on my
machine so let's click Next now and then
within the sequel server we have a table
called TBL employee and I want to
display all the columns from that table
so I'm selecting you know all columns
which is indicated by star so select
star from TBL employee click Next test
to your query so we can see all the rows
there click finish
we are done configuring the sequel data
source control now let's associate that
with this grid view control using
datasource ID property so select sequel
datasource one control and that's it we
are done so let's run this application
by pressing ctrl f5 now we should see on
this waveform the data that we retrieve
from TBL employees table now if you look
at this on the waveform look at this all
the columns that are available in the
table are displayed here now let's say
for example I don't want to display
employee ID column in the grid view
control so how can we achieve that there
are three different ways we can do it
now obviously the straightforward way is
to modify the Select query of the sequel
data source control so if you remember
when we were configuring sequel data
source control we specified the query
basically we said select all columns
instead of that we can specify the
columns that we want and exclude that we
don't need and then finish that so when
I finished that you know the grid view
needs to be refreshed to include only
those columns now if we run this as you
may as you might expect we only get the
columns that we have specified we don't
get employee ID column
so that's the first way what's the
second way we can remove the bound
filled column from the grid view control
that displays employee ID now let's say
for example the sequel data source
control itself I want to retrieve all
the columns from the database maybe
because I am using this sequel data
source control with another data bound
control maybe on that page so I want all
the columns to be present in the sequel
data source control but in the grid view
control I don't want to display employee
ID is that possible absolutely all we
need to do so let's test our query look
at that we get our employee ID as well
so let's refresh the grid view now look
at this we have a column for employee ID
as well so obviously when we run this
employee ID will be displayed but then
we don't want that to be displayed in
the grid view control and to achieve
that all we need to do is get rid of the
columns look at this these are all the
columns that are being displayed in the
grid view control okay now we don't want
employee ID column all you need to do is
get rid of that bound column there we'll
talk about what a bound column means in
a later video session in a in a great
detail but at the moment understand that
this column that you see in the grid
view control here is used to display
employee ID column that is present in
the database table so if you look at
this the column data field you know that
is actually pointing to employee ID
column from TBL employees table okay so
we don't want this column in the grid
view control so if we delete that run
this now obviously our grid view control
will not have employee ID column but the
datasource will have it okay that's one
way and another way is to simply instead
of deleting the column what you
basically can do is set the visible
property to false so visible is equal to
false now again when we run this
obviously the column will not be present
in the grid we control all right so
that's the first thing we want to do now
another thing notice that the headers in
the grid view control if you look at the
headers in a first name last name date
of birth annual salary all these column
headers in the grid view control are
same as that of in the table now I don't
you know these column names doesn't make
to the make sense to the end-user
because first name there's no space
between first and name date of birth
there is most between between date off
and birth so basically I want these
column headers to have spaces in them so
how do I achieve that that's very
straightforward to achieve if you look
at the columns that are displaying these
you know these are the bound fields and
if you look at each bound feel it has
got a property called header text all
you need to do is let's say for example
you know and a space between first name
just put a space in the header text
property so last name and date of birth
similarly annual salary and department
name save that and obviously when we
refresh this now we should see spaces in
the headers of the gridview control so
to achieve that simply change the header
text property now look at the date of
birth column now if you look at date of
birth column it's a date/time column in
the database table so since it is a
date/time column and since the select
star from TBL employee returns you know
date and time the gridview simply
displays that date and time
now date of birth I don't really need to
display time here to the end user so is
it possible just to display the date
part of it absolutely all we need to do
is we need to use something called data
format strings so now I actually need to
format the data that's present in this
crib view control and to do that I can
make use of data format string so here
the column is date of birth okay
so within the grid we control I have
this date of birth column and all I need
to do is there is a property called date
data format string okay so I'm setting
this data format string to 0 colon day
okay which indicates that we want a
short date pattern okay
so which is going to display just the
time now you can notice the difference
immediately in the grid we can to look
at this it's it displays 0 colon D
that's because when we use data format
string you need to specify that in you
know a flower bracket like this
okay now if you flip to the design mode
look at that it displays only the date
part of it so obviously now if I come
here and refresh this now it should show
only the date part and not the time part
and look at this this is the short date
you know pattern if I want a long date
pattern for example January 1st 1982
something like that then I can use a
long date pattern I mean a long date
data format string so instead of smaller
D if I put capital Day and then if i
refresh this page you should see a long
date pattern there 10th August 1982 you
know full month names expand it there
okay now obviously what are these data
format strings now you can find a
complete list of data you know data
format strings on MSDN at this link that
you can see ok it explains you know
basically there are several date format
strings here because this date of birth
is a date/time datatype you know there
are several date format strings from MST
and which tells us how to you know
depending on the format string that we
apply this date time you know datatype
will be changed and you can find that
complete list at this URL there alright
now if you look at the annual salary
column here now obviously this is a
salary column so I want to display a
currency symbol as well now for example
if I am paying the employees in u.s.
dollars then I want to display a dollar
symbol or or great British pound
depending on what is the currency that I
am paying for those employees okay so to
do that again we use you know currency
format strings okay
so obviously I can use 0 : C for that on
that annual salary column so if I you
know go to the grid view control so we
have this annual salary column here now
again we need to specify data format
strings so I'm going to copy that and
paste it on annual salary and look at
this I'm going to specify 0 : C now the
moment I do that it's going to display
look at this it's displaying pound
symbol now let me go ahead and refresh
this and we should see on the page
just wah so it shows a pound symbol
there and that's basically you know on
my machine I have the current culture
you know the default culture set to you
know United Kingdom that's why it shows
a great British prompt pound symbol
there now how do I find out what is the
default culture on my machine it's very
easy all you need to do is response dot
write system dot threading dot thread
dot current thread dot culture you know
current culture now this is a string
property
I mean basically this object the current
cultural object convert that to string
and then that's going to tell us what
culture is the you know is the default
culture on my machine so look at this
it's English - GB so Great Britain so
that's why it's displaying a pound
symbol now let's say I don't want to
display a pound symbol instead maybe I
want to display United States dollar is
that possible absolutely you can
override this default culture setting
you know in web config file for example
so how do we do it in web config file
here under system dot web so system dot
web specify globalization setting so
globalisation you know culture is equal
to English - us so the moment I do that
I have changed a you know setting in web
config file let's go ahead and refresh
this it should say I mean it should show
United States dollar symbol there on the
other on the other hand let's say for
example you know in web config file I
have set my culture to English - us so
this is applicable to all pages in my
web application now is it possible to
override this culture setting on a
page-by-page basis absolutely let's say
for example now instead of United States
dollar I want to display Indian rupee is
that possible absolutely and that - just
on this waveform one let's say my
waveform my application may have ten
different waveforms but you know on this
way
from one dot s PX I want to display
Indian rupee is that possible absolutely
all you do need to do is overwrite the
setting that you have specified in
web.config file on a page-by-page basis
using the culture attribute of the page
directive so I'm going to set culture to
maybe English - I n for India so now
let's go and run this now as you might
expect it's going to display a rupee
symbol Indian rupee symbol for annual
salary there alright again you can find
at this URL all the standard numeric
format strings
okay so currency symbols you know are
determined by the culture setting we can
change the culture setting you know
globally for all the pages within web
config file it is also possible to
change it on a page-by-page basis using
culture attribute of the page directive
now if you want to do it
programmatically then you can use you
know the current culture property of
current thread object okay so if I don't
want to do it here
you know declaratively in the HTML of
the page I can do it programmatically as
well all I need to need to do is set the
system threading dot current culture
property so that's going to take a new
culture info object and to that
constructor we need to specify let's say
for example I want English - Indian
culture okay so let's go ahead and run
this now we are changing the culture
programmatically on the page level so
the same output alright on this slide
