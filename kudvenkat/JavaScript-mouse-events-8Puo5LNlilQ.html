in this video we'll discuss the commonly
used JavaScript Mouse events most
browsers support these events mouse over
event occurs when the mouse pointer is
moved over an element Mouse out event
occurs when the mouse pointer is moved
out of an element mousemove event occurs
when the mouse pointer is moving while
it's over an element mouse up occurs
when the mouse button is released over
an element Mouse down occurs when the
mouse button is pressed over an element
click occurs when the mouse button is
clicked keep in mind when the mouse
button is clicked these three events are
triggered in that order
Mouse down mouse up and finally click
double click this event occurs when the
mouse button is double clicked when the
mouse button is double clicked
these seven events get automatically
triggered in that sequence Mouse down
mouse up click Mouse down mouse up click
and then finally double click context
menu this event occurs when the mouse
button is right click so when the mouse
button is right click these three events
are automatically triggered Mouse down
mouse up and then finally context menu
let's actually look at them in action
let's design a page that looks like this
with two buttons and a text area element
as these Mouse events occur we want to
lock them to this text area element so
that we can see the order in which they
are triggered so we need two button
controls input type equals button value
equals single double or right click
and we need another button and the value
on that is going to be clear and let's
include to break elements and then a
text area element let's give it an ID
and let's set rows to 10 and columns to
20 all right now let's write a function
which is going to log the event to the
text area element so let's call this
function log event and to this function
we are going to pass the event object
event object equal to even to object or
vendo dot event document dot get element
by ID we want to get the text area
element because that's where we want to
log the events as they occur so the
value of this text area element equal to
even to object dot the type of property
of the event object is going to give us
the event that has occurred and then to
that lets append a newline character
backslash R and backslash and so this
function is going to log the events as
they occur to this text area element now
let's write another function to clear
the contents of the text area element so
let's call this clear text and all this
function is going to do is set the value
property of the text area element to an
empty string all right so we want to
call this function when we click the
Clear button so on click off player
button let's call this function all
right now here we have the function
which is going to log the event to the
text area element now we want to call
this
you know when the respective events
occur so for example on Mouse down so
when does
mousedown event occurs whenever we press
the mouse button down over an element so
mouse down equals we want to call this
log event function so log event
similarly on Mouse up we want to call
you know log even function now similarly
there are several other events like
mouse over Mouse out click double click
context menu etc now to speed things up
I have already typed all those events so
let's copy and paste them right here so
on click we're calling log event on
mouse over we are calling log event on
Mouse out on double click and on context
menu right so with these changes let's
go ahead and run the page so now as
these events occur they should be logged
to this text area element now let's move
the mouse over the button look at that
when we move the mouse over mouse over
event is triggered when I move the mouse
out Mouse out event is triggered now
when I you know perform a single click
notice that Mouse down mouse up and
click events you know are automatically
triggered in that sequence let's
actually remove this mouse over and
mouse out events so the output will be a
little clearer so mouse over and mouse
out right now let's reload this page so
now mouse over and mouse out events will
not be locked to this text area element
so when I do a single click notice that
Mouse down mouse up and click all three
events are triggered in that sequence
let's clear that now let me double click
notice when I double click Mouse down
mouse up click Mouse down mouse up flick
and then the double click event occurs
now let's right click notice when I
right click Mouse down mouse up and then
the finally context menu event occurs
so let's remove all these events and
then include chest mousemove event so
onmousemove you know we want to call
this function log event all right so
let's reload the page now as we move the
mouse you know the even gets triggered
and it should be automatically log that
to this text area look at this as I move
the mouse look at you know how many
times this event is raised so for every
mouse move you know it gets
automatically locked to this so those
are some of the commonly used Mouse
events thank you for listening and have
a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
