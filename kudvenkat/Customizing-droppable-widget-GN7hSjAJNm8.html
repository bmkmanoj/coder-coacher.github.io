this video we'll discuss customizing
droppable widget
this is continuation to part 94 so
please watch part 94 before proceeding
here's the example that we worked with
in the previous video session we can
drag and drop the country names onto the
contents box and the cities on Two
Cities box we discussed of achieving
that in the previous video session we
want to customize this a bit more now
when I drag a country name and when it's
over its drop destination that is in
this case over this countries box we
want to change the background color of
that countries box to green indicating
that it's the right drop destination for
the country that we are dragging at the
moment okay so let's see how to achieve
that now when an item is over its a drop
destination and even it is raised and
that is over event so let's go ahead and
handle that event first I'm going to
create a style class with no style
section let's call it highlight and
we're actually going to change the
background color to green and font color
to white and I am also going to change
border to 3 pixel solid black or solid
gray okay alright so whenever an
acceptable draggable is oh it's drop
destination we know that over event is
triggered so here within the beer in the
context of that div countries element so
I'm going to handle the over element
event so let's associate a function so
this is the function that gets called
when that event is triggered and this
function is going to have two parameters
the event that occurred and the UI
element that trigger that event so what
do we want to do when over event is
triggered we want to set this highlight
class as the class for this development
so I'm going to use this keyword to
refer to the development
because we are within the context of
that development and I'm going to call
add class function and I'm going to
specify our highlight class which we
have just created all right so when an
acceptable draggable is always dropped
destination then this style class will
be applied to country's development
let's do the same thing with cities okay
so when a city is dragged over cities
box we want to change its background
color also to green okay so let's go and
save our changes reload this page look
at this when I drag a country on to the
cities box nothing happens but when I
drag it over countries look at that the
background color is changed to green
when it's out look at that you know the
background color is not changed to its
original color we'll look at that in
just a bit similarly if I drag its City
on to the cities box look at that
you know the background color changes
and when his city is out of that
droppable we want to bring it back to
its original color so when an acceptable
draggable is out of its drop destination
out event is triggered so let's go ahead
and handle that as well so just like
over we also have out event and we want
to handle that event as well so there's
the even handler function and what we
want to do now is remove that highlight
class so I'm going to use remove class
function and let's do the same thing
with cities droppable so let's associate
out here let's save our changes reload
this page and look at this when an
acceptable draggable is oh it's drop
destination background color is green
when it's out it's back to what it was
okay and if I try to do the same thing
with cities here look at that this is
not the right draggable for cities drop
destination that's where nothing happens
so let's go to and drag a city look
background color changes and it reverts
back all right so to achieve this we are
making of making use of two events over
and out
instead of these two events we can
actually use an option there is an
option called hover plus so we can make
use of that option instead of hooking up
to even handlers so let's actually
common these two and let's do the same
thing with say days and what we can do
is instead of that I can specify have a
class option so the class that we are
going to specify here will be applied
when an acceptable draggable is over its
drop destination and out of its drop
destination so basically how the class
is going to be our highlight class that
we have just specified so it's going to
add that class when the item is it's
over its droppable destination and as
soon as it's out of droppable you know
the class will be removed so let's do
the same thing with the cities box let's
save the changes reload this page and
look at this and let's try with the city
and it works the same way now let's look
at activate and deactivate events now
what we want to do is at the moment when
the draggable is always dropped
destination that's when we are changing
the background color and let's say for
some reason immediately when I start to
drag an item that's when I want to
change it's appropriate drop
destinations background color to green
so if you want to achieve that then you
can make use of activate and deactivate
events activate event is raised as soon
as you start to drag an acceptable
draggable and deactivate event is raised
as soon as you stop dragging okay so
let's make use of those two events so
I'm going to actually comment this have
a class of
as well and let's associate activate so
let's activate event and we want to
handle that so function again it's going
to receive event and the UI element that
triggered the event and what we want to
do here is add that highlight class and
when deactivate event is raised we want
to do a similar thing let's actually
copy this code and paste it right here
so basically we want to remove the class
when the activate event is raised so
let's copy this code and paste it within
cities development so let's comment this
hover class all right so let's save our
changes reload this page and look at
this as soon as we start to drag a
country name look at that the background
color of the countries has changed to
green and if I stop dragging look at
that it changes back to its original
color similarly when we start to drag a
city name the background color of cities
box is changed stop the dragging and
look at that it's back to what it is now
again instead of using activate and
deactivate events you can make use of
active class option okay so let's go and
do that so instead of these two events
I'm going to use active class option and
let's specify the class the class is
highlight so when we are dragging the
acceptable drag draggable this class
will be applied as soon as we stop
dragging another class will be removed
that's what this active class option is
going to do let's apply this to
country's diverse well
all right so let's say what changes
reload this page and look at this when
we start to drag country we have the
same behavior when we stop it it changes
back similarly when we drag and drag a
city see these background colors changed
as soon as we stop it's back to what it
was all right now let's look at this
helper option in the previous video
session we discussed this option of the
draggable widget
in a previous session we have set help
option to a string clone so what is this
going to do this is actually going to
clone the item that we want to drag and
make that item draggable look at that we
are dragging the clone of the original
item now at the moment the value it is
accepting is a string the value can also
be a function okay so I can specify a
function here instead of clone and here
you can specify the Dom element that you
want as a helper as a dragging helper
now let's say for some reason instead of
a clone what I want is I want the text
of the item that I am dragging and that
text should be bolded and underlined
okay so how to achieve that we can
return that element from here so I'm
going to return a bold element and I
also want an underline and the text that
I want is dollar this so here this is
going to reference the item that we are
dragging the item that we are dragging
is a list item and let's use the text
function to retrieve its text and let's
close the underlined and bold elements
on line and bold so we are closing both
of them all right so let's save the
changes and let's reload this page and
look at this now the drag helper will be
changed you know to the element that we
have specified in our function so the
list item text that is bolded and
underlined when I drop it we are
actually add the original list item to
the drop destination the same with city
names thank you for listening and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
