this is wankered this is part three
built-in types and c-sharp in this
session we will learn about different
building types that are available in
c-sharp escape sequences in c-sharp and
random literal so first let's look at
the different types in c-sharp and all
these are built-in data types so the
first data type that we will talk about
is the boolean data type for example in
your application if there is a need to
store a value of true or false then we
make use of boolean data type for
example if there is a question you know
are you a major true or false okay so if
you want to store values like this we
make use boolean data type now to create
a boolean variable we use the moon
keyword and maybe you give it a name B
equals true okay so this boolean data
type can only hold true or false
if you try to assign any other value to
this variable apart from true or false
then you will get a compiler error
because B is a variable of type boolean
which can own only true or false so for
example if I try to assign an integer
that and number two that immediately we
will get an error
look at that red squiggly line and it
shows you know obviously constant value
1 2 3 cannot be converted to MU yet so
that's an error okay so but whereas if
you look at C or C++ a boolean data type
usually contains 0 or any other number
zero means false and any other number
means true but in c-sharp strictly a
boolean variable can hold either true or
false
the next
time that we talk about our the integral
data types that are available in c-sharp
now there are similarly integral data
types as shown in the slide
you know byte short integer long etc now
all these data types are capable of
holding some number okay if you look at
byte it's a single byte which means
eight bits okay
and eight bits can hold you know one
byte a variable of type byte can hold
the number between 0 and 255 ok so which
means 0 to 255 or 256 different values
ok
actually if you look at how these sizes
are calculated there is a formula behind
that for example one bit okay
can represent two different values
either 0 or 1 and 8 bits together they
can represent 2 to the power of 8
distinct values 2 to the power of 8 is
256 and 0 from starting from 0 to 255 is
256 values so a single byte can hold 0
to 255 so so by it
there is another counterpart s by des
standing for find meaning it can hold
negative values as well minus 128 to 127
so minus 128 to you know minus 128 to 0
or 128 and 0 to 157 is 128 so 128 128
again 256 so if it's assigned byte minus
128 to 127 byte is 0 to 255
similarly for short integer long all of
them have their counterparts unsigned
unsigned them okay so an integer can
hold both negative and positive values
whereas you know an unsigned can only
have positive values it's not fine
there's no plus or minus it's it's only
positive values okay
now so what's the difference between
these different data types they're from
smallest to biggest for example by it is
one byte integer is 32 bits 32 bits is 4
bytes where as long is 64 bits okay
which is 8 bytes so in your application
for example if you're storing the age of
the person age of a person you know most
likely couldn't be more than 130 or
maximum is 110 20 okay so age of the
person is relatively small number so to
store something like that probably byte
is more than enough ok but whereas if
you're storing the population of the
country then probably in that case you
may choose integer datatype because
that's a little bigger number and
population of your country is always a
positive number so probably you want to
use unsigned integer or if it's much
bigger you know then probably you can
move along okay
so depending on the requirement of your
application you can choose the type that
is appropriate okay now is it mandatory
to remember all these ranges I don't
think it's practical okay even if you
forget the range even if you don't have
MSD and accessible using visual studio
you can calculate what is the biggest
and smallest number that variable of
that type can hold for example if I have
an integer variable of type I I want to
find out what is the minimum value that
it can store and what is the maximum
value that it can store it's very easy
to figure out because this integer type
has a property again we will be talking
about properties later in detail so this
integer type so int dot there's a
property called min value and if you
look at the property this will represent
the smallest possible value this will
show what's the smallest possible value
that any variable of type integer can
hold so maybe
if you want the minimum value you can
just say console.writeline maybe
something like this min equals whatever
so now if we go ahead and run this
obviously it will show what's the
minimum value and if you compare this
that watch there and MSDN it is exactly
similar okay so that's how you can
compute the minimum and maximum
similarly if you want the maximum value
it's pretty simple
use the other property which is maybe
max value they want to rename this to
give it a meaningful name so you run
that min minimum is that and maximum is
that right so those are the different
integral data types available in c-sharp
the next data type that we'll talk about
is the fluting data type flute you know
integrals integral data types they
basically can hold a whole number if you
want you know a decimal precision then
that's not available in this integral
data types so if you want you know to
store some precision values then you can
choose these floating types you know
floating-point types we have flute and
double and they are much bigger as well
if you look at the flute data type it is
basically 32-bit and the double is
64-bit so they can hold relatively big
numbers and if you look at the precision
they are like seven digits you know
after decimal you know together with the
decimal and you know the integral part
they can be seven digits whereas this
one is fifteen to sixteen digits so
that's about float I mean basically if
you want precision value
and we can make use of that for example
double D equals maybe one two three some
decimal places I want and I can do that
and if you just print that number so but
whereas if you do that with it with a
variable of type integer it won't be
able to hold that decimal part there so
for example if I make this integer into
I obviously you get straight away an
error look at this
cannot implicitly convert type double
into n again in a later module we'll
talk about implicit and explicit
conversion
alright so that's double similarly if
you want float you know if you want a
lesser precision then probably you can
google load and the next data type that
we have it's a decimal data type
now decimal data type has much bigger
precision okay it has a 29 to 28 to 29
significant digits and the data type is
a huge 128-bit data type and similarly
if you want to store any decimal value
you can do so the type of that is
decimal decimals D equals level is the
decimal value that you store so these
are different data types that are
available in c-sharp depending on the
requirement of your application you
choose the data type that is most
appropriate
all right you know we will talk about
the string data type escape sequences
and we're bad literal in our next video
in part 4 thank you for listening have a
