this video well discuss jQuery draggable
widget draggable widget allow elements
to be moved using the mouse this widget
belonged to interactions category so on
the jQuery UI website notice draggable
widget belong to interactions category
we also have other widgets this category
will discuss these in our upcoming
videos let's understand this draggable
widget with an example here we have a
div element with an ID we also have
applied a CSS class and here is that
class we have set the height to 200
pixels width also to 200 pixels
background color red font color white we
want this development to be rendered as
a table cell vertical-align:middle
text-align:center so if we apply this
tile class to this development this
development will be rendered like this
and we have this one line of jQuery code
so here we are finding this development
using its ID and on that we are calling
the draggable jQuery UI function so this
is going to make this development
draggable meaning we can move this
development around the screen using our
mouse I have this exact same code
already typed so if we view this page in
the browser this is how the page will be
rendered and notice now I can move this
development around the screen using my
mouse this draggable widget is extremely
customizable and there are loads of
options available I have included some
of the useful options here now if you
look at this development we can drag it
in any direction let's say for some
reason we want to limit the direction in
which we can drag it to x-axis to
achieve that we can use this axis option
so this option constrains dragging to
either X or Y axis so let's go and
specify that option so I'm going to use
a JavaScript object and specify axis
option so I'm going to limit it to x
axis if you want to limit it to y axis
just specify the value as Y so let's
reload this page and look at this now I
can only drag it along the x-axis
containment this option constraints
dragging to within the bounds of the
specified element or region so let's
understand this option with an example I
have another div element here so let's
copy that and paste it on our web page
and I'm going to move this draggable div
into this container dev okay and if you
look at this container there we have set
the height to 300 pixels width to 300
pixels and we have set a 3 pixel solid
black border and this candy draggable
div is a child of container death
okay so let's save our changes reload
this page and look at this this
draggable div is pleasant now inside
that development and I can drag it look
at this actually let's go ahead and
remove the axis option from here so we
can drag it in any direction we want
look at this when I drag this it's not
going to stay within the bounds of this
development with that thick black border
now let's say for some reason when I
drag it I want that element to stay
within the bounds of that outer
development we can achieve that using
this containment option so let's go
ahead and specify containment and we can
set this option to a string or a
selector so I'm going to set it to a
string and I will set that to parent so
basically we are saying here you know
when we drag this draggable div make
sure it stays within the bounds of its
parent element and what is the parent of
that draggable do nothing but contain it
there so now when we reload this page
and when we try to drag it look at that
the div element stays within the bounds
of its parent so we can set the value
to a string or you can also set it to a
selector okay so to any jQuery selector
now if you look at the parent element it
has got an ID so I'm going to use jQuery
ID selector so I'm actually going to set
it to hash container death even now it's
going to work the same way it's going to
stay within the bounds of the element
with that def cursor this option changes
the CSS style of the cursor during the
drag operation and if you want to know
what are the possible values for cursor
option it's a CSS style property so if I
type cursor here notice I can actually
see all the possible values for this
property so let's say we want to set it
to move so let's go ahead and do that so
I want to set cursor option to move
let's save our changes reload this page
and look at this as we drag the mouse
look at the cursor it changes to a move
handle opacity this option changes the
opacity during the drag operation by
default the opacity is 1 but you can
change it to any value that you want
let's say for example you want to change
it to 0.3 let's say what changes reload
this page and look at this as we are
dragging look at that the opacity of the
development that's being dragged is
changed as soon as we leave the mouse
pointer it's back to 1 revert this is a
boolean option that specifies that the
element should revert to its start
position when dragging stops now at the
moment when dragging stops the element
will be placed where we stopped
dragging now when you stop dragging that
is when you leave the mouse pointer if
you want that element to go back to its
starting position then set that revert
option to true so I'm going to set
revert
- true let's see what changes reload
this page and look at this it goes back
to its starting position River duration
this option goes in hand in hand with
revert option so this option specifies
the duration of the revert animation in
milliseconds the default value is 500
milliseconds if you want to increase it
for some reason you can use this option
let's understand these three options
snap-snap tolerance and cancel with an
example so I'm actually going to copy
this HTML that I have here and let's
paste it within the body section and
let's actually save the changes and I'm
going to change the selector here I'm
going to change that to dev and I'm
going to remove this river top option
let's save the changes reload this page
and look at the UI here we've got four
colored divs and a div with a thick
black border let's look at the HTML
first so the HTML is straightforward so
here we have a div class we can actually
remove this style from there the
background color style because we are
hard coding that style here so basically
we are applying this class to all the
colored there's okay and then this red
they're green div blue div and brown
there and we are setting the background
color in line to that development okay
so pretty straightforward and then we
have to break elements and then another
development and the ID of this one is
snap there and we this if set high to
found it and with 200 pixels and we have
a 5 pixel solid black border so this
HTML produces this UI now look at this I
can actually drag the developments look
at that it doesn't snap to the
development I mean to this development
with that thick black border that's
actually
let's reload this page once again look
at that when I drag the red div it
doesn't get snapped to the development
with a thick black border now let's say
when I drag this element and you know
when it comes closer let's say for
example when it comes to 50 pixels
you know when the distance between the
element that I'm dragging and this
development with that thick black border
when it becomes like 50 pixels then I
want that to be automatically snapped to
this development like that okay to do
that we can use these two options snap
and snap tolerance so let's go ahead and
specify those options here so I'm going
to set snap to the ID of the element to
which we want to snap the element that
we are dragging so we want to snap these
colored divs to this development so I'm
going to use this high D so we are
specifying a selector here and I'm going
to specify snap tolerance option and I'm
going to set that to 50 pixels so what
does these two options mean they mean
when we drag these elements when they
come like 50 pixels closer to any of the
borders we want that the element to be
snapped automatically to this
development let's look at that look at
this I'm I'm you know moving this red
there as soon as it comes 50 pixels
closer look at that it automatically
gets snapped the same is the case with
green there and look at that as soon as
it comes 50 pixels closer it gets
snapped and the brown there look at that
okay and you know all these are
developments and if you look at our
selector here we are saying div
draggable so even this element with that
thick black border is also a development
that means now I can drag that
development with that thick black border
right let's
for some reason you don't want that
element with the thick black border to
be draggable then yet you can use this
cancel option so basically this option
prevents dragging from starting on
specified elements so let's go then set
cancel option and I'm going to set that
to a selector so Dave draggable this is
going to make all developments on this
page draggable but out of those
developments I don't want this
development but ID snap div to be
draggable so I'm going to set that
cancel option to the ID selector of that
development okay so let's save our
changes reload this page and look at
this now I can't drag you know this
development so now when we snap them I
can't drag any of the divs now because
they are present within the bounds of
this development with a thick black
border so that is preventing them from
being dragged thank you for listening
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
