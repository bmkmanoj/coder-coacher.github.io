questions and answers video series in
this video we'll discuss writing a
program in C sharp to subtract the
largest even number and smallest odd
number in the given array elements one
of our YouTube channel subscribers faced
this question in a c-sharp
return test we have to achieve this
without using lengths because when we
use lengths it's straightforward to find
the largest even number and smallest odd
number using the linked Max and min
functions we'll discuss that as well in
just a bit let's flip to visual studio
so here I have a new console application
first let's go ahead and create an
integer array and I'm going to make this
in nullable integer array we'll
understand the reasons for that in just
a bit and let's initialize this array to
you know some even and odd numbers let's
say two three seven one one thousand and
222 now if you look at this array that
we have here right now the smallest odd
number here is one and largest even
number is 1000 so this program should be
able to subtract one from 1000 and then
display the result and obviously the
first step here is to actually find out
that largest even number and smallest
odd number for that purpose I'm creating
another variable of nullable integer
type and let's call this largest even
number and let's initialize this to null
and if you're under increasing for
making this a nullable integer that's
because if the array does not contain
any even number at all then you know
largest even number variable will be now
okay similarly let's create another
variable to hold smallest odd number
all right now we need to identify that
largest even number and smallest odd
number and for that purpose we are going
to make use of for each loop and loop
through each element that we have caught
within the collection that is numbers
array and then we are going to check if
I mod two equals zero so if you divide
in number by zero and if the reminder is
zero then that is for sure an even
number okay
so if it comes into this F block then we
know it's an even number in it in which
case we will again check okay the this
largest even number variable it has got
any value okay so this has value
property is going to return true or
false if it if that variable has got a
value within it then it's going to
return true otherwise it's going to
return false so if the largest you know
even number variable does not have any
value within it okay or if the value of
I you know whatever number you know we
are checking and if that's an even
number if the value of I is greater than
largest even number so if any of these
conditions is true then what we want to
do is store that value of Phi within
this variable so I think this should be
straightforward now if this variable
does not have any value within it then
we know that we have not initialized
that in the first place in which case go
ahead and populate that value or if the
even number that we are checking at the
moment if it is already greater than
what we have within a largest even
number even in that case you know store
the value of five within this variable
okay so if I want to is not equal to
zero then we know it's an odd number in
which case come to the else part and do
the same thing so here we are going to
say if
smallest odd number variable if it
doesn't have a value or if I value is
less than smallest odd number then store
the value of I within that variable so
straight forward so this for each loop
it's basically finding out the largest
even number and smallest odd number and
then all that is left is to take this
largest even number subtracted from
smallest odd number and this lady this
out and to speed things up I have you
know type the required if and else
statements these should be
straightforward so I don't want to you
know spend too much time typing this so
basically what we are doing here we are
checking if largest even number if it's
if it is equal to now that means the
array does not contain any even number
so that's what we are going to print
else we are saying largest even number
is whatever is the value that is stored
there and the same is true for smallest
odd number so check if it is now if it
is null then array does not contain any
odd number else smallest odd number
equals whatever value present in that
and then this final if block is going to
check if both of them are not equal to
now and if that's the case go ahead and
subtract largest even number from the
smallest odd number and then this lady
output and notice that here we have
three placeholders within the first
placeholder we will display largest even
number with in the second place holder
smallest odd number and then within the
final placeholder the difference between
the two numbers okay
so straightforward function now let's
actually remove these two these two
numbers from there and if you look at
the array at the moment it does not
contain any even numbers okay so when we
run this it should print a message
saying array does not contain any even
numbers and the smallest odd number is
one okay so obviously we are not going
to do that subtraction because we don't
have any even number
okay and let's go ahead and undo the
changes that we have done so now it
contains even numbers and odd numbers
the smallest odd number is one and the
largest even number is one thousand so
the program should be able to subtract
one from 1,000 and display the
difference which is 999 so let's run
this look at the output largest even
number is 1000 smallest odd number is 1
and thousand minus 1 equals 999
so very simple straightforward program
to subtract the largest even number from
the smallest odd number now let's go
ahead and see how to rewrite this
program using link so since we are not
using link here and now we have to write
this for each loop
but if we use link it's going to you
know replace this entire for each loop
with a two lines let's look at that in
action first of all we need to bring in
system dot link namespace and then what
we can do here is get rid of this entire
for each loop and then say largest even
numbers equals so we have this numbers
are a and then I'm going to use this
where link function so here we are going
to specify a lambda expression so we're
going to say there X such that X mod 2
equals 0 so what is this lambda
expression going to do it's going to
loop through each element within the
array divide that by 2 and it's the
result equal to 0 then it's going to
select that element okay and then we are
going to get all such even numbers using
this where link function so once we have
the list of all even numbers then we are
going to apply this max link function
which is going to return the max a
maximum even number within that
collection and another thing to keep in
mind here is notice what this max
function is returning it's returning a
nullable integer okay now if we don't
make
this array you know an alibi integer a
then this max function look at what it
is returning it is returning an integer
okay now if we make it a non nullable
integer array and if the sequence I mean
if that array does not contain any even
number for example what's going to
happen we are going to get an exception
let's actually prove that so so now
let's actually comment this you know
initialize this to one for just the time
being and then let's actually get rid of
all the even numbers so now notice that
we don't have any even number within
this array so when we run this function
you know we are going to get an error
here because we don't have any even
number within the array and then when we
try to invoke the max link function it
doesn't find any elements within that
sequence so we are going to get an
exception in valid operation exception
that is the reason for making this our a
a nullable integer array okay so when we
make it a nullable integer array if the
sequence does not contain alien any
elements you know this is not going to
throw an exception it's simply going to
return now okay so to cater for that
requirement we have made this another
bill integer array and just find out the
smallest odd number we use the min
function it's as simple as that
so number is dot where X such that X mod
2 not equal to 0 so we are going to get
all the odd numbers and apply the min
function which is going to return the
minimum of those odd numbers and that's
it we are done let's go ahead and run
this now and notice that smallest odd
number is one digest even number is one
thousand one thousand minus one equals
nine nine nine the output that we expect
that's it for today thank you for
listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
