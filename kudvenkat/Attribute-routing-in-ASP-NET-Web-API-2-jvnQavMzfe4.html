Web API tutorial in this video we'll
discuss attribute routing introduced in
asp.net Web API - let's understand
attribute outing with an example let's
flip to visual studio what I have done
so far is created a new web API project
I named it Web API the first thing that
we are going to do is add a student
class so let's right click on the models
folder add a class file
let's name or class file student the
student class is going to have two
properties the first property type is
integer and it's going to be ID
the second property is name and its type
is going to be string so that's our
student class the next thing that we are
going to do is add students controller
to our controllers folder so let's right
click on the controllers folder add and
we want to add a controller and the type
of controller that we are going to add
is Web API to empty controller
let's name or controller students
controller and within the students
controller the first thing that we are
going to do is create a static list of
students so let's create a static
variable of type list of student
remember the student class is present in
a different namespace Web API dot models
so let's bring that namespace in let's
call the variable students now let's
build a list here let's create a new
student object and remember the student
object has got two properties ID and
name
let's create a couple of more students
in the interest of time I have already
typed the required code so let's copy
and paste it right here so at the moment
we've got three students now let's
include a public method here which is
going to return I enumerable of student
objects let's call this method get' and
all it's going to do is return whatever
students list that we have within the
static variable students let's include
another get method now this method is
going to return as a single student
object so this method will get student
by ID so from the students list
give me the first a default student
where student ID matches with the ID
that we are passing into this get method
let's have one more public method here
and this method is going to return I
enumerable of string objects and let's
call this method get student courses now
each student can be enrolled into a list
of courses and we want this method to
return the list of courses by student ID
so it's going to have a parameter ID and
what we want to do is hard code that
list here so if ID equals 1 so whatever
ID we are passing if that is 1 then we
want to return a new list of string
objects and let's build our list of
courses here so let's say student with
ID 1 is enrolled in c-sharp asp.net and
secret server
and let's do the same thing for student
ID 2 &amp;amp; 3 in the interest of time I have
already typed the code so let's copy and
paste that right here so student ID 2 is
enrolled in these courses and student ID
3 is enrolled in these courses now if we
look at the students and students
courses we have hard-coded them within
our application in a real world
application we would be getting the
students and student courses from a
database table to keep this example
simple i have hard-coded them here so at
the moment we've got three methods
within our students controller this ket
method is going to return us the list of
all students this method is going to
return as a student by ID and this
method is going to return as student
courses by ID let's run our application
by pressing ctrl f5 and navigate to /
API slash students notice we get the
list of students as expected so this URL
right here / API slash students it's
mapped to this controller action method
within our students controller so this
mapping is done by the default route
that we already have in place so we have
the default route within our Web API
config dot CSV file we have that default
route here this routing mechanism is
called as convention based routing and
this route is created by the Web API
project template for us automatically
when we created this new project so with
this convention based routing and that
the students controller in place this
URL right here / API slash students is
mapped to the scape controller action
method now let's also pass student ID in
the URI so we have now / API slash
student slash 1 so we extract this URI
to be mapped to this action method which
is taking student ID and then return us
that specific student but look at what
happens when we issue this request we
get an error and look at what the error
says it says multiple actions were found
that match the request so basically it's
saying between students controller has
got the sket method and we also have got
get student courses within that same
students controller and to this URI does
not know between these two methods which
method to use
so both the methods start the divert get
and both of them have got the ID
parameter so the framework is confused
for this URI which action method to use
now we can very easily resolve this by
using attribute routing and here is what
we want to do we want this URI slash API
slash student slash one this one to be
mapped to this controller action method
and then written as that specific
student but on the other hand along with
the student ID if I also specify courses
in the URI like this then we want all
courses to which that student ID one has
subscribed to okay so this should be
mapped to this controller action method
and then obviously it's going to return
us the student courses into which that
specific student has enrolled enter so
to achieve this all we have to do is
decorate this method with the route
attribute so let's use the route
attribute and we want this action method
to be mapped to API slash students slash
and we are going to pass an ID parameter
and then followed by that we are going
to have this little string courses so if
we pass one as the ID then we want that
specific student courses
okay so let's give our solution a build
and issue a request to this URI slash
API slash students / 1 / courses notice
we get student 1 courses as expected so
this URI is mapped to this controller
action method get student courses notice
this method is decorated with route
attribute so that URI is mapped
action method using attribute routing
and now if you issue a Request 2/1
without that little string courses
notice we get student 1 details so this
URI slash API slash student slash 1 this
is map to this controller action method
and notice on this method they're not
using the road attribute but still the
mapping is working because behind the
scenes it's using convention based
routing so what is attribute loading
using the route attribute to define
routes is called attribute routing what
are the advantages of using attribute
routing attribute routing gives us more
control over the you our eyes then
convention based routing creating your
eye patterns like hierarchies of
resources for example students have
courses departments have employees
creating patterns like this is very
difficult with convention based routing
whereas with attribute routing all you
have to do is use the route attribute as
shown right here
so here we're creating a pattern
students have courses it start easy
whereas with convention based routing
it's a bit difficult and does not scale
very well so how to enable attribute
routing in web api to attribute routing
is enabled by default so this line right
here config dot map HTTP attribute
routes this enables attribute routing so
if you look at our baby pea convict dot
CSV file notice we have that line right
here which enables attribute routing if
you remove this line or comment this
line then attribute routing is not going
to work it can be used both attribute
routing and convention based routing in
a single web API project yes both of
them can be used in a single web API
project the controller action methods
that have this alt attribute
use this attribute routing and the
others without the route attribute uses
convention based routing thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
