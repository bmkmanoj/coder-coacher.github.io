part 10 of this tutorial series on Java
programming language in our last
tutorial we learned about if statement
let us recall what was if statement if
statement was a statement that used to
check a condition and depending upon the
evaluation of that condition to be true
or false we use to execute block of code
this was a conditional statement in this
tutorial we are going to learn about
switch statement switch statement is
very similar to if statement in its use
case and in most cases we could use if
as when I switch for same so let's see
an example let's say I want to take an
input from user and that is a month
number if I take month number from the
user I would like to tell him that that
number belongs to Quarter one or water
two or water three so how would we
proceed it something if statement I
would start with writing an if statement
whose condition would be something like
if month number is equal to one then the
month belongs to water one now if month
number is 1 then that month belongs to
Quarter 1 and same way we will proceed
with other statement if as condition so
what we would do is we would say that if
month number is number one then month
belongs to Quarter one if month number
is equal to 2 then month again belongs
to water to Quarter 1 sorry now you
would like to write similar statements
for all the months and if one doesn't
match
any of these then we would like to say
that the month is unknown let's execute
this code let's say if I put month
number sy it is okay
you mean quarter to now this is the
expected output
you would also understand that you could
increase the readability of this code by
combining multiple conditions since the
output or code block belonging to first
second third condition is same
they could have returners if month
number is one or once number is two or
month number is equal to three and then
we could have eliminated these two
statements same way we could have done
for water two three and four another
ways to use the range conditions if
month number is greater than 1 and if
month number is less than equal to 3
then the quarter is 1 let us understand
the execution of this one here you will
see that we have made the code more
readable and more concise by using this
condition that if month is greater than
equal to 1 and month the number is less
than equal to 3 then the quarter is
quarter one is quarter to 3 and 4
respectively
and if month number does not belong to
any of these ranges then the month is
unknown let's execute this program let's
say month number is 11 then it prints
out quarter 4 it is the expected output
now let's understand how do we use
switch in this use case which is very
similar statement what we do wind
switches
we start with a switch keyword and then
we have something called expression and
then here we have some case statements
and here we put the values the value
here belongs to the value of this
expression and then here we have the
block of code and then we have next case
where we compare value to and then we
have again a block of code and so on
let's see the formal definition of
switch statement switch statement
provides a way to select one of the many
different actions so the switch
statement starts with switch keyboard
and then expression in the parenthesis
this expression should be evaluated into
integer or a character or string and
then the block of switch starts with
braces and then we have multiple key
statements each case statement starts
with a case keyword and then a value
this value is something which will be
compared to the value of the expression
during the evaluation of switch each
case block has multiple switch
statements and then we also have a
default statement which gets executed
when none of the case matches note that
every case block is terminating with a
break you must use a break statement
after each case block this is extremely
important let's see this syntax in
action in our program the expression is
essentially month number this month
number evaluates to an integer so if the
value of month number is 1 then I need
to do something and that something is
assigned the month to Quarter 1
and then as I said we need to write the
break statement same way every month is
let's say for then the month belongs to
water too and then we have a break
statement same way we would write others
and then finally we had a default one
where we say that the month is unknown
now let's understand the full use case
here and then try to execute this code
you will see that in this code what we
have done is if cases one if month
number is one then assigned month to
quarter one if case is to assign one to
quarter one again simple three four four
five and six we are assigning month as
quarter two four seven eight and nine we
are assigning quarter three and four ten
eleven and twelve we are assigning
quarter four let's execute this program
and let's say your favorite number is
five and we save the month belongs to
quarter two this is how we write a
switch statement you would wonder that
just like the optimize the readability
and the condition evaluation of each if
statement here also the case block of
one two and three are very similar and
therefore this could be combined you are
right we can do that but before getting
into that let's understand one more
thing if I remove break statements what
would happen let's say I remove this big
statements now this would be an
interesting observation because when we
remove this break statement
you could guess what should be the
overall behavior
let's say every room is removing all the
vague statements and then someone is
entering one number as five
can you guess what should happen the
switch statement will evaluate the value
of month number is 5 then it will match
with one two three four it won't match
then it would evaluate case 5 because
cases are evaluated in a sequence when
it reaches the case wife the condition
would be valuated to true and therefore
the month should be quartered - right
but let's see the output if I put 5 the
output is unknown the reason of this
output is as soon as case 5 matches
month is assigned the value water - and
after that switch does not find a break
statement because which does not find a
break statement then in that scenario it
just falls off to other cases it doesn't
check these conditions but it will
evaluate all these statements and
therefore the last statement what is
equal to unknown gets assigned and
therefore we get the output here
therefore break statements are
compulsory although you can remove the
break statement from the last case
because anyways that last case or
default case would be the last one
therefore break might not be required
there however for sake of readability
and there are no confusions being arised
always use a break statement next you
are also thinking about how do we
optimize this what if I want to merge
this case one case two case three blocks
yes I can do that I can say that case
one or case two or k3 use this block
same way for caves for case five K 6 use
this block so forecast case 7 K 8 uses
this
log and then 40 is 10 11 and 12 use
other blocks so the way it gets
evaluated is the Mach number matches
case one since case one matches it will
find the next block that is to be
executed it will fall off to case freeze
block and then this will get executed on
break command this will just get out of
this switch statement let's execute it
and show you if we gave the month let's
say seven it gave the quarter three
which is the expected output so what did
we learn we learned that the use of
break statement after each case block is
necessary because we want to prevent the
execution from failing through from
falling through the remaining test cases
let's take up one more example let's say
I have a variable called index which is
assigned the value of marks averaged out
on 10 bases now if we switch on this
index we would like to say that if the
student has got 10 9 or 8 index then he
should be treated as honors student if
he have got 7 and 6 he should be treated
as first division student if it is 5 he
second division if he is for his third
division less than that you should be
treated as field thus we saw that how
multiple cases that want to have the
same action can be stacked together in a
switch statement solids recalls and
revives all the switch statement routes
we saw that a switch statement can have
multiple case labels but only single
default label default label gets
executed when no matching value is found
they see this in action if I give a
number let's say 15 then output is you
mean unknown that means the default
block is executed when none of the case
matches
we need to use break statement to exit
the switch-case without break means or
that it will just fall through next
important thing to understand is that
the expression within the switch
statement needs to evaluate to a in
Peter or a enumeration or a enum or a
string now let's say that I am having a
string as let's say two and I convert
this switch to month and then I just
make it compare it with these strings
now this is the expectation that I want
to do I want to compare the strings that
if string is four five and six
then do something a 7 is 8 6 9 is 10 is
11 and case 12 so what I'm trying to do
is that if month is having a value 1
then I find water 1 to it and so on but
you will see that Eclipse is trying to
show me an error let's see what is the
error it says that cannot switch on a
value of type string on source level
below C 1.7 only convertible in values
or enumeration values are permitted what
does this mean let me tell you a brief
history about Java
prior to Java 7 switch statement could
take only a teachers and enumerations
but post Java 7 even strings are allowed
so you can go to project you can right
click go to properties you can go to
compiler and you will see that the
compiler level centers
six we can set the compiler level sjd8
and we can click on apply it will ask to
build the project now we can click yes
and then we can click OK you will see
that that error is just gone so prior to
Java seven switch control expressions
could be integer and characters only but
now string objects are also allowed
there are more switch statement rules
chain statements are executed in
sequential order we observe this fact
when we remove the break statement all
the blocks were executed one by one
finally let's understand that when we
should use if statement versus switch
statement I would suggest you to use if
statement whenever you are test
expressions or something like ranges if
your month number is greater than equal
to 1 and less than equal to 3 this is a
raincheck
and for the checks if statements are
more suitable for other cases where you
want to exactly match a condition to an
integer all enumeration enums we are
going to load in later chapters but even
in case of comparing the emails or
string object literals we should use
switch statement so in this tutorial we
learnt about switch statement and its
details you can also try some switch
statements I would recommend you to
write a program in Java to take a month
number and try to find out the number of
days in it you would like to keep the
number as 1 to 12 if if the number is 1
then the number of days is say 31 and if
it is 2 the number of days will be
calculated based on the leap year mass
etc you can take two inputs one month
and one year depending upon these two
you could define or find out the number
of days in that month using the switch
statement this could be a good exercise
for you
testing this switch statement logic so
stay tuned we will cover more in our
coming tutorials
