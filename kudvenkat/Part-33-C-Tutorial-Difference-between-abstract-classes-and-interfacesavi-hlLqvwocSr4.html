am venket this is part 33 abstract
classes versus interfaces in this
session we'll learn the differences
between abstract classes and interfaces
in fact there are several similarities
between abstract classes and interfaces
both of them are incomplete you cannot
create an instance in abstract class or
a bit or an interface both of them can
only act as base times however there are
several differences between abstract
classes and interfaces in fact this is
one of the very most in two important
interview question okay let's look at
the differences so the first and
foremost important difference is that an
abstract class can have implementation
for some of its members but the
interface can't have implementation for
any of its members you know if I create
an abstract class abstract class let's
say customer when I say this is an
abstract class and if I'm going to have
let's say print method public wide print
now I need not mark this as abstract I
still can go ahead and have an
implementation for this method it's
perfectly legal in an abstract class so
if we go ahead and build that it builds
successfully but whereas on the other
hand if I'm going to have an interface
so instead of abstract class we will say
interface and let's call this I customer
okay since this is an interface it
cannot have implementation for any of
its members but if you look at here we
have an implementation print method and
if I try to go ahead and build that we
get a compiler warning another modifier
public is not valid for this item
obviously that's another important
difference to keep in mind you know
between after classes and interfaces and
interface members are public by default
and they can't have
access modifier whereas abstract class
members can have access modifiers okay
and in fact an apps an abstract class
member is private by default okay so
keep that in mind all right so now if we
go ahead and build that we will get a
compiler one in saving that I customer
dot print interface members cannot have
definition cannot have implementation
okay so we have seen that no abstract
classes can have implementation for some
of its members but the interface can't
have implementation for any of its
members and interfaces cannot have
fields whereas an abstract class can
have fields ok so if you look at this
interface so we know that we cannot have
an implementation so let's get rid of
that and if you look at this if I try to
have a field let's say for example int
ID and if I try to build that we get a
compiler error interfaces cannot contain
fields but whereas on the other hand an
abstract class can have a field
so for in tidy and if I go ahead and do
that it will be successful okay bill
succeeded so an abstract class can have
fields where as an interface cannot have
fields at all and inherit an interface
can inherit from another interface only
and cannot inherit from an abstract
class whereas an abstract class can
inherit from another abstract class or
another interface so if I have an
interface that can inherit from another
interface only it cannot inherit from an
abstract class or a non abstract class
but whereas an abstract class can
inherit from another abstract class or
from another interface ok that's another
important difference between abstract
classes and interfaces
a class can inherit from multiple
interfaces at the same time whereas a
class cannot inherit from multiple
classes at the same time we understood
that we understood this an inheritance
session ok we know that classes does not
support multiple class inheritance but
they do support multiple interface
inheritance so it's possible for a class
to inherit from multiple interfaces at
the same time but it cannot inherit from
multiple abstract classes at the same
time ok and there is a reason why you
know we don't support multiple class
inheritance in dotnet ok and we will
actually talk about the problems of
multiple class inheritance in a later
session ok so this chapter is to focus
the differences on interfaces and
abstract classes so let's concentrate on
that and we have also seen that abstract
class members can have access modifiers
whereas interface members cannot have
access modifiers on this slide you can
see some resources for asp.net and C
sharp interview questions that's it for
today thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
