this video we'll discuss what's
javascript minification javascript
minification is the process of reducing
the size of javascript file by removing
comments extra white spaces newline
characters and by using shorter variable
names let's understand the process of
javascript minification with an example
here I have an asp.net MVC for
application let's add a controller and
let's call it home controller and now
let's add index view this view is going
to be very straightforward this view is
going to ask the user to enter a number
and then this view with the help of
JavaScript is going to check whether if
that entered and number is even or odd
so for the user to enter a number we
need a text box so input type equals
text and let's give this textbox an ID
so txt number and then let's include a
button so input type equals button and
let's give it an ID let's call the speed
en submit and the value on the button is
going to be submit okay so let's run
this so at this point we should have an
interface to enter in number okay so
user enters a number and then once he
clicks the submit button we need to
check whether if that entered number is
even or odd and we're going to do that
you see jQuery so we need to reference
jQuery file on this view so within the
scripts I have this jQuery file let me
drag and drop that and let's fix the
source attribute to use tilled in the
path okay so we're going to write some
JavaScript code here script type equals
text slash JavaScript
so dollar function okay so the first
thing is we need to find this button
control because when we click that
button that's when we need to check
whether you know if the enter number is
even or odd so and what is the ID of the
button BTN submit so let's copy that and
let's use jQuery ID selector jQuery ID
selector is pound sign so pound find the
control with ID BTW and submit and then
when somebody clicks that execute a
function okay so what do we need to do
when we click that button we need to
first retrieve the value that is entered
within the textbox
okay so let's use some a comment here to
make our JavaScript code more readable
so retrieve the number from the textbox
okay
so let's use this ID selector once again
so variable number equals so what is the
ID of our textbox
txt number so from the txt number
retrieve the value so we are retrieving
the value that user has entered using
this Val and then let's check if the
number is divisible by two so check if
the number is divisible by two so
variable result equals number mod two
okay so if
if the result is zero then we know for
sure the number is even at which point
we are going to alert the message so
alert number is even LS alert number is
odd okay so I mean very straightforward
JavaScript code but instead of having
this JavaScript within the page let's
actually move it to an external file so
let me right click on the scripts folder
add a new item and we want to add a
jscript file and let's call this custom
javascript dot j s and click add and
let's copy this piece of javascript code
into that external file
and let's get rid of the script tag from
the view and then now since the custom
javascript is present in the next in our
file we need to reference that within
our view and let's fix the source
attribute to use the till symbol alright
let's go ahead and run this and see if
it actually works so let's enter four
click Submit look at that number is even
let's enter 5 like submit number it so
on so it's working now look at this we
have this custom javascript file within
the scripts folder let's actually open
this scripts folder in Windows Explorer
and look at the size of this custom
javascript file look at the size of the
custom javascript file
it's 396 bytes as you can see here okay
now if you look at this piece of
JavaScript code that we have within this
custom JavaScript file within this piece
of code we have look at this extra white
spaces there we have newline characters
here and we have comments and look at
the variable names there are several
characters within the variable lines
now let's minify this javascript code
and to minify this javascript code there
are several tools available on the web
let's actually go to google and search
using minify javascript search term and
look at this there are several of them
I'm going to get to this J's compressor
calm and all we need to do is paste our
JavaScript code here and then click this
button so let's copy our JavaScript code
okay let's compress that and look at
this you know it has removed the newline
characters it has removed the valuable
names I mean it has shortened the
variable names instead of using look at
that
instead of using number as the variable
name here it says just E and then look
at the result variable instead of you
know using result it is just using T and
look at the comments they're gone okay
so basically it removed the comments it
removed the extra white spaces it
removed the newline characters and
reduced shorter variable names so now
let's actually add another JavaScript
file and let's call this custom
JavaScript
dot min dot J s let's actually paste
this piece of JavaScript code within
this file and look at this now the
entire JavaScript code is present in a
single line okay
now within our index view instead of
using the non minified version this is
the non minified version okay let's
actually open the scripts folder in
Windows Explorer and look at this custom
JavaScript that is not minified is 396
bytes whereas the custom JavaScript
which is minified is 178 bytes so the
size is drastically reduced just by
removing you know comments and extra
white spaces newline characters and by
using shorter variable names so this is
what is called as javascript
minification now on our index view
instead of using this a non minified
version let's use this minified version
so let's copy the name of this file and
use that version here and let's run this
and see if we get the same functionality
as before so the functionality of this
javascript code shouldn't be compromised
in any way so if I enter for click
submit' number is even 500 5 click
Submit number is odd so it's working the
same way as it did before okay but then
the minified javascript file size is
greatly reduced okay let's look at some
of the questions around javascript
minification so what are the advantages
of javascript minification as a minified
javascript files are very small they
will be downloaded much faster and
consumes you know less bandwidth search
engines like Google considers page
loading time as one of the parameters to
rank pages okay so obviously the lesser
the page loading time the better the
rank you know in search engines and
obviously you know if somebody requests
us index view you know the JavaScript
file that needs to be downloaded onto
that client machine from
the webserver it needs to be transmitted
to the client and obviously the minified
javascript files are much smaller in
size so they download much faster and at
the same time they also consumes much
less bandwidth if any of the
functionality lost because of
minification none and we have seen that
in action you know we are at the moment
using the minified version but the
functionality is exactly similar are
there any tools available to minify
javascript there are loads of them in
the Internet what is the difference
between jQuery GS and jQuery dot means
GS now if you create a new MVC
application in the scripts folder you
will see several jQuery files look at
this jQuery there is a version number
1.7.1 and then dot j s and then we have
dot min dot j s so this min dot J s is
the minified version whereas the one
without the word min is the non minified
version so if you look at this file you
have several comments here there are
newline characters and variable names
are lengthy etc so obviously if you look
at the size of the jQuery file that is
not minified so if you look at this
jQuery file this is 252 kilobytes
whereas the minified one is just 92
kilobytes ok and if you look at the
minified version again look at that they
were there I mean the white spaces are
removed the newline characters are
removed they have used much shorter
variable names etc as a result the file
size is drastically reduced okay
similarly we have unobtrusive Ajax and
the MIDI file version of that you know
jQuery UI and the minified version of
that so jQuery dot min dot J's is the
minified version whereas jQuery dot J's
is the non minified version in your
production websites always use minified
files as the download faster and
consumes less span
and what is the downside of javascript
minification obviously they are harder
to read and debug so if you look at this
jquery file look at the code dates it's
definitely difficult to read and
difficult to debug okay
however for development and debugging we
can use non minified versions and just
before deployment minify and use the
minified versions on the production
environment again when it comes to
debugging let's say they're using the
minified version within our index file
and let's assume there is some problem
with the JavaScript code and then we
need to debug what we can do is on our
development machine we can reference the
non minified version debug your
application and then obviously you will
find a problem and then fix that within
that script file and then minify that
once again using the minification tools
and then before you deploy the
application reference the minified
version within your view ok so that's it
for today thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
