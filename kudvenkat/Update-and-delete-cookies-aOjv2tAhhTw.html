in this video well disk is updating a
key deleting a cookie and cookie
limitations first let's look at an
example of updating a cookie to update a
cookie set a cookie with the same name
again let's look at this in action let's
flip to visual studio at the moment on
this page we have caught two buttons set
cookie get cookie
when we click set cookie button by
calling set cookie JavaScript function
similarly when we click get cookie
button by calling get cookie JavaScript
function within the set cookie
JavaScript function this piece of code
is going to create a cookie with the
name equals color value across screen
and this code is going to create a
persistent cookie that's going to be
stored on the client computer for the
next one hour because we have set a max
age attribute to 3,600 seconds and
within the get cookie function we are
checking the length of the cookie if the
land of the cookie is not equal to zero
then we know that a cookie exists and in
that case we are retrieving the name and
value that's present within the cookie
and displaying them to the user using
javascript alert if the length of the
cookie is equal to zero then we know
that no cookies exist in that case it's
going to fall to this else block and
here we are displaying a message the
user stating no cookie is found so at
the moment we don't have any cookies so
when we click this cat cookie button
it's going to display a message saying
no cookie is found now let's click this
set cookie button and when we click this
button this piece of code will be
executed so it's going to create a
cookie with name equals color and value
equals green so let's click this set
cookie button now let's click get cookie
look at that we get name equals color
value equals green and what we want to
do is update this cookie so we want to
change the color value to red from green
so we want to update that cookie now to
update a cookie we use the same name but
a different value so let's change the
value to red save the changes let's
reload
the Spade now when they click get cookie
we should still get the old value which
is green now when we click the set
cookie button it's going to execute this
piece of code which means it's going to
update this color cookie from green to
red so let's click that button now let's
click get cookie look at that
the color value is now updated to red so
to update a cookie all you need to do is
set a cookie with the same name but with
your new value now let's look at an
example of deleting a cookie
to delete a cookie set a cookie with
Max's attribute set to a negative value
so the moment if you look at this
example have set max age attribute to
3600 seconds that means we are telling
to create a cookie that's going to be
stored on the client computer for the
next one hour but if you said that this
max age attribute 2-1 then you're
telling to basically delete that cookie
right away so now let's reload this page
and when we click get cookie we should
still have that cookie around the color
cookie now when we click the set cookie
button this piece of code will be
executed which is setting Max's
attribute to a negative value and this
is going to tell the browser to delete
that cookie immediately so when we click
set cookie now when we click get cookie
look at that it says no cookies found so
if you are using a browser that supports
max age attribute and set that attribute
to a negative value if you want to
delete the cookie but there are browsers
which doesn't support max age attribute
for example Internet Explorer doesn't
support max age it supports expires
attribute so if you're using a browser
like that then said expires attribute to
a date in the past so in this example if
set expires attribute to first of
January 1900 that has a date in the past
so this piece of code is going to
execute I mean it's going to delete that
color cookie right away also keep in
mind and users can use the browser
interface to delete the cookies any time
they've
and so at the moment we don't have any
cookies let's go ahead and create this
color cookie let's actually change the
max age attribute to 3600 seconds reload
the page set cookie and now at the
moment we have you know the color cookie
created now one way to delete the
cookies is programmatically using
javascript the other way is the end
users can delete the cookie by using the
browser interface so at the moment I'm
using Google Chrome so when I click on
this menu button and then once we go to
history there we have this button clear
browsing data when we click this button
on this page notice that this cookies
checkbox is selected and when we scroll
down and click this clear browsing data
we are basically telling it to delete
all the cookies as well so when we click
this button it's going to delete the
cookies now when we click get cookie
that color cookie is deleted so keep in
mind users can use their browser to
delete cookies anytime they want now
let's look at cookie limitations you
might often hear these questions what is
the maximum allowed cookie size per
cookie how many cookies are allowed per
domain the answer to these questions
really depend on the browser you using
and this website right here can be used
to perform some series of tests and find
out what the limits are so I have the
URL right here
I'll have this link available on my blog
in case you need it now let's navigate
to that URL in Google Chrome and once we
navigate to that page look at that there
is a button run test for current browser
let's click that so now it's performing
some series of tears let's fire up
Internet Explorer and let's navigate the
same page in Internet Explorer as well
and let's click this button run run test
for current browser so IE is also
performing the test Google Chrome has
just finished those tests now if you
look at Google Chrome look at that Mac's
cookie count per domain is 180 and
maximum cookie size per cookie is 4096
bytes so Google Chrome allows 180
cookies per domain and the maximum
cookie size is 4096 bytes and if you
look at Internet Explorer maximum
cookies per domain is only 50 and the
maximum cookie size per cookie is five
thousand one hundred and seventeen
characters and if you want to know what
those limits are for Firefox
navigate to the same website in Firefox
and perform those tests and you will
come to know what those limits are for
Firefox thank you for listening and have
a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
