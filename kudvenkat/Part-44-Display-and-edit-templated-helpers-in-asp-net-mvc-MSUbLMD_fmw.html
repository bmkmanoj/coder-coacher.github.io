in this video we'll discuss display and
edit templated helpers in MVC please
watch but 43 before proceeding template
helpers are introduced in MVC to these
built-in templated helpers can be
broadly classified into two categories
display templates editor templates there
are three display templated helpers at
HTML dot display display 4 and display
for model before we try and use these
templated helpers
first of all let's generate details and
edit views without using these templated
helpers let's flip to visual studio this
is the employee class that we have been
working with in the previous sessions of
this video series and then the metadata
of this employee class is present in
this class employee metadata and the
previous sessions we have discussed in a
very great detail about these attributes
hidden input read-only data type
scaffold column etc and then within our
home controller we already have details
and edit action methods implemented and
if you notice this details method we are
passing the ID of the employee whose
details we want to view we are creating
an instance over sample dbcontext class
and then we are using this employee's
property to retrieve the list of all
employees from the database out of which
we are getting the single employee where
the ID matches with the ID that is
coming into this details action method
and then we are passing that employee
object to this view and notice that we
also already have details and edit views
but for now I am going to delete them
and then I'm going to riad the details
view so the name is going to be details
and we are going to create a strongly
typed view against employee model class
and then the scaffold template is going
to be details let's click Add this
should add details view and notice the
amount of HTML that's generated for us
so there's lot of HTML right here and
then at the bottom you have some action
links but for now let's delete them save
everything and run the project
and then let's navigate to details
action and pass employee ID of one so
now we see the employee full details but
then within our view that's a lot of
HTML now instead of this we can use one
of the template and pers
display for model templated helper okay
so if you look at this view at the
moment this has got a model object
associated with this view so the model
object is employee okay so this view is
a strongly typed view so we are going to
use display for model HTML helper with
this view so instead of all this HTML
I'm going to get rid of all that HTML
and then simply use at HTML dot display
for model so this templated helper is
going to walk through each property
within the employee object and inspect
that properties metadata remember within
our employee class we have decorated a
few of the properties with the
attributes okay so these attributes are
going to specify what type of data they
have and and how we want these
properties to be displayed on the view
so the templated helpers are going to
inspect that model metadata and then
render the UI for us depending on those
attributes so let's save everything
build the solution and then let's
refresh the view the output is going to
be exactly the same thing except that we
are using display for model HTML helper
so this display for model templated
helper we use that with strongly typed
views and this template the helper is
going to walk through each property in
the model to display that you know uy
for us so when do we use display HTML
I mean templated HTML helper now we use
this when we are working with views that
are not strongly typed let's actually
understand that with an example if you
look at what we are doing we are passing
this employee object to the view but now
I'm not going to do that instead I am
going to store that employee object
view data and I'm going to use this key
for that employee data and let's store
the object in view data using that
employee data key and then within our
details view I'm going to get rid of
this model there so now this view is not
a strongly typed view okay where is our
employee object present its present in
view data object and what is the key
that's holding it employee data is the
key
so within details view now since this is
not a strongly typed view I can't use
display model so I'm going to use
display HTML helper and then pass you
know the expression which is going to be
the key that was used in order to store
this employee object within view data so
I'm going to pass that employee data kay
let's copy and paste it there to get it
right
let's build this and let's refresh this
view the output should be exactly the
same except that now we are working with
a view that is not strongly typed and we
have the employee data within view data
okay so the output as you can see here
it's exactly the same thing alright so
when do we use display for HTML helper
now again this templated helper is used
with strongly typed views if your model
has properties that return complex
objects that's when this HD I mean this
template helper is very useful so for
example if our employee class has got
you know ed department property which is
going to return a department object back
that's when we can use this display for
templated helper now just like how we
have three displayed templated helpers
we also have three edit templated
helpers editor editor for an editor for
model okay let's let's quickly look at
using one of the templated helpers edit
templated helpers so within our home
controller we have this edit action
method again we are passing the ID of
the employee that we want to edit
retrieving the employee object and then
passing it to the view so let's go ahead
and add a view the name of the view is
going to be edit we are going to make
use of raiser view engine and the model
class is going to be employee but I'm
going to choose empty as the scaffold
template so it's not going to generate
all that HTML for us and here I'm going
to use the using statement and then we
need a form tag so I'm going to use
begin form HTML helper and then within
this I am going to use display for model
HTML helper so again this helper method
is going to walk through each property
inspect its metadata and then it's going
to render the UI for us so let's build
the solution and then let's navigate to
a detection and pass employee ID of one
so again at this point we should get an
editor interface up we used to display
four model HTML helper we want to use
editor for model for an editor interface
so let's build the solution and let's
refresh this so there we have the
editing interface all right now to
associate metadata with model class
properties we use attributes in the
previous sessions of this video series
we have discussed about using various
data annotation attributes these
templated helpers use metadata
associated with the model to render the
user interface and we have seen that
practically just now the built-in
display and edit templated helpers can
be customized according to our needs
we'll discuss this in our next video
session on this slide you can find the
sources face be dotnet c-sharp and
sequels of interview questions that's it
for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
