venket this is part 67 of c-sharp
tutorial in this video we'll discuss
different ways that are available to
make method parameters optional in fact
this is a very common interview question
as well there are four ways that can be
used to make method parameter is
optional we can use parameter arrays
method overloading specifying parameter
defaults and using optional attribute
that's present in system law run time
dot interrupt service namespace in this
video we'll discuss using parameter
arrays let's say for example I want to
implement a method that's capable of
adding two or more numbers for example
if the end user wants to add 15 numbers
your method should be capable of doing
that on the other hand if I want to add
just two numbers still your method
should be capable of doing that let's
see how to implement such kind of a
method let's flip to visual studio now
let's make this method public and it's
going to be static as well so public
static that's not going to return
anything so why then let's call our
method add numbers and the first
parameter is going to be of type integer
and let's call it first number second
parameter is of type integer again and
this is going to be second number so the
first and second numbers that we want to
add will be these two parameters now if
I want to add more than two parameters
then I'm going to use you know a
parameter array here so how do we
specify you know a parameter array using
params keywords so params
and then it's going to be of type object
array and let's call this rest of
numbers okay so the rest of the numbers
that you want to add you will pass them
you know as an object array as a
parameter array all right so let's
declare a variable of type integer and
let's call it result which is going to
be the sum of first and second numbers
so first number plus second number now
if the end user wants to add you know
three or more numbers you know more than
two numbers then he's going to include
the rest of the numbers within this
object array
okay so if the rest of numbers is not
now meaning they have initialized that
and passed the you know third fourth and
fifth numbers how many ever he wants to
add okay so I'm going to check if this
is null so if rest of numbers is not
equal to null then we know for sure he
has you know more numbers to add in
which case we want to add all the
integers that that's present in this
array into this result so let's see how
to do that so result you know plus
equals whatever is present in this rest
of numbers so which means I have to loop
through that array there so let's go
ahead and use a for each loop there so
for each int I n rest of numbers so what
we are going to do result plus equals I
okay and finally we want to display the
sum to the end user and to do that let's
go ahead and use console dot write line
method console dot readline sum is equal
to whatever is present in this variable
result okay now let's say for example I
want to add just two numbers you know
since this is a static method I can just
invoke it with the name add numbers and
let's go ahead and pass ten and twenty
now the important thing to notice here
is that we get the method declaration
here it has got three parameters but how
many parameters are we passing I mean
how many arguments are we passing to
this method only two for the first and
second number I am NOT passing an
argument for the third parameter and
look at this when I go ahead and try to
build the solution let's say this gets
compiled to get the status power bill
succeeded so in spite of this method
having a three formal parameters
I am only passing values for two of them
which means the third parameter is
optional here so how is this optional
because I'm using this params keyword
you know this is a parameter array okay
so by using parameter array you know
it's one of the ways to make your method
parameters optional so now obviously if
I run the sum
should be printed as 30 and that's what
we see here on the other hand let's say
for example the end-user wants to add
five numbers 10 20 30 40 and 50 how does
he do that so I have 10 and 20 and the
parameter array I can simply pass 30 40
and 50 like this so 30 40 and 50 are the
arguments for this third parameter so if
I run this now as you might expect we
should get the sum of those five numbers
which is 150 okay
so I can do it this way or since this is
just an object array I can create a new
object that I initialize that with these
three numbers and pass it as an argument
so I can do it like this as well so new
object and we are initializing that with
30 40 and 50 so now if I go ahead and
run this we should get the same output
which is 150 all right and another
important thing to keep in mind is that
a parameter array must be the last
parameter in a formal parameter list so
if you look at this method at the moment
it has got three parameters and then
within these three parameters this is
the last parameter it has to be your
parameter array has to be the last
parameter otherwise you will get a
compliation error so let's say for
example I remove this from the last
position and then if I make it this
second parameter look at what's going to
happen if I try to build this obviously
we will get a compliation error
look at that a parameter array must be
the last parameter in a formal parameter
list all right now next video will
discuss using method overloading as an
option to you know to make method
parameters optional on this slide you
can find resources for asp.net c-sharp
and sequence of interview questions
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
