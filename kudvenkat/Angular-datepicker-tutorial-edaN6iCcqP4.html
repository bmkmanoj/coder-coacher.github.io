in this video we'll discuss why is it
not a good practice to use the browser
built in date picker control installing
an TX bootstrap and finally using the
NZXT bootstrap date picker component in
our angular application first let's
understand why is it not a good practice
to use the browser built in date picker
component this is because the
implementation of date picker component
is different from browser vendor to
vendor this means our end-users may have
different experience depending on the
browser they use let's understand this
with an example so here is what we want
to do we want to capture the date of
birth of an employee that we could
control is very useful when capturing
dates from users now when we use html5
input type date the browser
automatically displays its built in date
picker control let's look at this in
action let's flip out visual studio code
notice right here we have the phone
number HTML so this is the HTML that
displays this phone number field on our
create employee form now let's copy this
HTML and let's paste it after the
department drop-down list and then we've
changed the bits that are required now
we want this field to capture date of
birth so first of all I'm going to
change the label here to date of birth
and let's change the for attribute to
date of birth and a set date of birth as
the value for ID name and
ng-model and at the moment the type
attribute is set to text I'm going to
change that to date notice we have the
date of birth field that displayed as
expected now since we have said input
type to date the browser in this case
Google Chrome is going to display its
built in date picker control so when I
click on this I can write here we have
the Google Chrome built in date picker
control and this is how it looks like to
go to the previous month click on this
button and to go to the next month click
on this button when I click on the month
name right here we see all the months in
here
v18 to go to the years before 2018
scroll ah and to go to years after 2018
scroll down and whenever we select a
date from the calendar the respective
date is populated within the date of
birth input field now let's take a look
at the same date of birth field in
Firefox notice within Firefox we don't
have that little icon right here and
whenever I click on this text box the
date picker control pops up and notice
the state picker control is very
different from the date picker control
that we have on Google Chrome so this
means our end users have different
experience depending on the browser they
use what we want here is consistency
there are many third-party data picker
controls that we can use to provide
consistent experience to our end users
in the exports trap date picker control
is one of them to see the list of all
third-party UI components that we can
use in an angular application navigate
to this URL angler dot IO for /resources
as we scroll down on this page we will
see a section called UI components it's
right here and at this section we see
all the third-party UI components that
we can use in an angular application as
you can see in the X bootstrap is one of
them when I click on this it's going to
take us to their website this website
has got all the documentation for
installing configuring and using their
UI components when I click this get
started button we have the installation
and configuration instructions on this
page and on the Left right here we see
all the UI components that this
framework provides and datepicker
component is one of them to use the NZXT
bootstrap they'd be the control you'll
have to first install and configure the
framework itself and here are the three
steps to do that the first tab is to
install the NZXT bootstrap framework and
here is the npm command for that we
execute this command from the command
prompt i've already executed this
command so I am NOT going to execute it
again when you execute this command it's
going to install ngx bootstrap into the
node modules folder the second step is
to install the
strap itself we can use ADA bootstrap 3
or bootstrap for with ndx bootstrap we
have already installed bootstrap 3 in
part 1 of this video series so I'm not
going to execute this command either and
the final step is to reference the
bootstrap stylesheet within the angular
CLI Jason file again we have already
done the step in part 1 of this video
series so if we take a look at the
anglers Eli JSON file it has got the
Styles property within that and within
these Styles property notice we are
referencing the bootstrap style sheet
and this is coming from the node modules
folder so these are the three steps to
install and configure and the X
bootstrap framework now let's look at
the steps required to use the NZXT
bootstrap datepicker control first
within our app module let's import the
date picker module from ngx bootstrap
slash date picker package and we also
need to include this module within the
inputs array of our attendee module
decorator so right here let's include
the bsd picker module and on this we
need to call for root method so this is
how we import the bootstrap date picker
module and then within our create
employee component let's change the type
from date to text when we have the type
as date the browser is going to display
it's a built in they pick a control and
that's not what we want
so I'm going to change the type to tags
and to use the bootstrap they'd be the
control I'm going to use the directive
vs date picker notice at this point when
we click within the date of birth field
we have the date picker control
displayed but these styles are not being
pulled through that's because we forgot
to reference the date picker style sheet
so we do that within the angular CLI
jacent file so within the Style section
we need to reference the date picker
style sheet notice this is coming from
the ndx bootstrap folder within the node
modules folder
at the moment our server is running in
watch mode so let's stop and start it
again for the changes to take effect we
are on the list page at the moment let's
navigate to the create page and let's
scroll down when we click within the
state of birth field we get the NZXT
bootstrap date picker control when I
click on the month name right here we
see all the months in the year 2018 when
I click on the year we see the e
arranged we can move backwards and
forwards and when we select a date the
selected date is populated within the
date of birth field also notice it's
automatically captured by the angle I
generated for model against this
property date of birth
now let's see how it behaves in Firefox
first let's reload the page notice when
we click within the date of birth field
we get the same date picker control even
in Firefox and hence we have the same
experience now if we take a look at our
create employee component notice on this
date of birth input field by using this
directive be a state picker with this
directive in place when we click within
the date of birth field we get the date
picker control and this is great for
capturing a single date like date of
birth how about capturing a date range
for example let's say you have an open
job role and you want to capture a date
range for accepting series we can very
easily do this using ngx bootstrap date
picker all we have to do is instead of
using vs date pick a directive we use a
different directive for that and that is
BS date range picker notice now when we
click within the field we have a
different interface using this interface
we can capture a range let's say we want
to except see this between January 1st
2018 and February 28th 2018 notice the
selected range is automatically
populated with in the input field we
also have it captured by the angler
auto-generated phone model by the moment
the date picker is using the default
green theme now we want to change this
to dark blue the
so it matches with the rest of the form
also notice the default date format is
month date and then yeah we want to
change it to date month and yeah at the
moment we don't have a default date we
also want to set a default date and
finally this input field is panning
across the entire width of the form we
want to limit its width so the point
that I'm trying to make is this date
picker component is highly configurable
in our next video well discuss how to
customize this date picker component to
meet our requirements now if you're
wondering how do I know the names of
these directives that is vs date picker
vs date range because and what they do
well that's from the documentation so if
you look at the NZXT bootstrap website
on the left you have the different UI
components when you click on date picker
you have all the documentation that you
need on this slide we have our first
example if you want to capture a single
date like date of birth all you have to
do is on an input field use this
directive vs date picker if you want to
capture a date range instead use this
directive Bs date range picker thank you
for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
