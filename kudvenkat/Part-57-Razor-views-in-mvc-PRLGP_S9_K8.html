in this video we'll discuss rays view
syntax we know that any race of you both
c-sharp code and HTML can coexist
to switch between HTML and see Shep code
we use at symbol that's a for example I
want to print numbers from 1 to 10 we
can very easily achieve that using a for
loop ok so this for loop here is C sharp
code so we are proceeding that with an @
symbol okay so this for loop opening
bracket closing bracket this is C sharp
code and we want each number to be in
bold ok so we are wrapping that with a
bold tag so here from C sharp we are you
know switching to HTML mode the moment
rays of you you know detects this bold
that I get knows that ok it's an HTML
tag so it is smart enough to switch to
HTML mode but then after that we want to
print number you know whatever value
this I variable is carrying okay so we
need to switch from HTML to c-sharp mode
and to do that we are proceeding that
variable I which is C sharp variable
with an @ symbol so we are switching
from HTML to c-sharp
using that @ symbol and then we are
closing the bold tag so we are again
switching from c-sharp to HTML mode okay
basically to switch between c-sharp code
and HTML we use at symbol in race views
let's look at this program in action so
this is the index view so we want a for
loop so we are proceeding that with an @
symbol for int I is equal to 1 I less
than or equal to 10 I plus plus okay so
all this is C sharp code now I want to
print you know whatever value that is
there and I I can simply say at I okay
let's save that and let's refresh this
index view so we should have 1 to 10 so
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 okay now let's say
I want you know each number to be bolded
then we can wrap that inside a bold tag
okay now let's go ahead and refresh that
every number should be bolded okay there
we go now what happens if I don't use
that ad symbol if we don't use that @
symbol then razor you treats that as you
know literal text as I and it simply
prints I ten times so if you want to
pull out you know the value from the C
sharp variable then you have to switch
to C sharp mode and you do that by using
the @ symbol all right and there may be
scenarios where we have to define some
variables and perform some calculations
and that's a perfect scenario for
defining a code block okay and to define
a code block we use you know @ symbol
opening bracket closing bracket and
within that block whatever code that you
write is going to be c-sharp code so
here notice that we are defining two
variables you know which are going to
hold the sum of even numbers and odd
numbers and then we have a for each loop
and we are checking if that number is
divisible by two we know that if it's
divisible by two it's an even number so
in which case we are adding all the even
numbers if it is not divisible by two in
the sense if the reminder is not zero
then we know it's an odd number in which
case we are you know computing the sum
of all odd numbers so basically this
little bit of scene shop code that we
have here is computing the sum of even
and odd numbers you know from one to ten
okay so to compute that we have to
define two variables which are going to
hold that sum and then we have to write
bit of logic so here everything is going
to be c-sharp code okay so this is a
perfect scenario to use a code block
okay and how do we define a code block
using at symbol opening bracket and
closing bracket okay let's look at this
in action so we use an ADD symbol
opening bracket and a closing bracket
let's define the variables that we need
so we want an integer variable and let's
call it sum of even
numbers and we want to initialize that
to zero and we want another variable and
let's call it sum of odd numbers and
let's initialize that to zero as well
now let's use a for loop and notice that
I don't have to use an @ symbol now
every time I have to write c-sharp code
because we are inside a code block so
everything that you're going to write
the ice is will be treated as c-sharp
code so let's create a variable I for
int I is equal to 1 I less than or equal
to 10 I plus plus so we are going to
loop through 1 to 10 and if I mod 2 is 0
so if the reminder is 0 then we know
that it is an even number else we know
that it is an odd number if it's an even
number then we have to sum you know even
numbers you know we have to total them
so sum of even numbers is equal to sum
of even numbers plus I
similarly if it's going to be an odd
number then it's going to be sum of odd
numbers is equal to sum of odd numbers
plus I okay so we have defined two
variables here and we have performed
whatever calculations that we have to
perform and now it is time to print the
values that we have stored in these
variables so I want to plant the sum of
even numbers and our odd numbers and
let's print them using maybe an h3 tag
so sum of even numbers is equal to so we
have to pull the value out of this
variable so we have to flip now to
c-sharp mode and to do that we can use
the @ symbol so add some of even numbers
similarly we want to print the sum of
odd numbers and let's use sum of odd
numbers variable that's it let's save
everything and let's refresh this view
so now we should see some of even
numbers and some of odd numbers so we
to change that text right here it has to
be some of odd numbers save it
refresh your view and we should get some
of our numbers there all right now there
may be scenarios where we have to switch
between code and literal text let's
actually understand that with an example
let's say we are printing numbers 1 to
10 but at the same time you know while
we are printing those numbers we also
want to print this literal text
specifying whether it's an even number
or an odd number so 1 is an odd number
so we have to print it like this 1 is
odd two even three odd so we want to
print it like this so basically to
achieve that we are using a for loop
here so we are looping through from 1 to
10 okay and then we want to print that
number first
okay whatever a number that we have in
that variable in that c-sharp variable
so we are printing that and we want that
to be both let so we are wrapping that
inside a bold tag okay and then if the
number is divisible by 2 okay then we
know it's an even number okay and then
you see that there I am using you know
text element what happens if I don't use
text element if I don't use text element
then whatever I'm going to type within
this opening and closing bracket it's
going to treat that as C sharp cord
okay so I have to tell somehow to the
raise of you okay now I simply want to
print this literal text here okay
so that's why we're using this text
element there similarly here we are
again using text element for specific
that as an odd number now we can either
achieve that using this text element or
we can use the syntax at : okay so
basically to switch between c-sharp code
and literal text we can use a the text
element or ad colon syntax let's
actually look at that in action
so add four into I is equal to 1 I less
than or equal to 10 I plus plus okay so
we want to print the value that is in I
but we want to pull that so let's go
ahead and use the pole tag so from HTML
we want to you know switch to c-sharp so
we use the @ symbol and we print
whatever value that's present in I and
now we are going to do a bit of
computation here so if I mod 2 is equal
to 0 so if it's equal to 0 then we know
that it's an even number in which case
we want to print a - and then whether if
it is odd number or even number now look
at this if I simply say ok output
- and then print this text even look at
that look at the shade you know it's
it's shaded you know with light gray
color so it is actually treating that as
c-sharp code and not as literal text but
our intention here is to treat that as
literal text so if that's our intention
we have to use you know the text element
and then obviously we have to close that
text element ok similarly else we know
that it's going to be an odd number so
again we use the text element and
specify that it's an odd number
let's save everything and let's go ahead
and refresh this okay all of them are
coming in the same line so let's include
an HTML break and let's refresh that so
we should now get the output that we
expect ok so we can either use that text
element or we can use at : syntax and
then get rid of that
so ad : and let's refresh this view we
should get the same output it's just
that we are using a different syntax now
alright on this slide you can find
resources for asp.net c-sharp and
sequence of interview questions that's
it for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
