this video we'll discuss caste and off
type operators difference between the
two and when to use one or the other
all these standard query operators
belong to conversion operators category
in our previous video session we
discussed to list two array two
dictionary and to lookup this video will
discuss caste and off type operators
caste operator attempts to convert all
of the items within an existing
collection to another type and return
them in a new collection if an item
fails conversion an exception will be
thrown this caste operator uses deferred
execution let's look at an example here
we have a variable of type ArrayList at
the moment this array list contains
three numbers that is 1 2 3 and
ArrayList operate on object type which
means we can add any data type to this
list and what we want to do is convert
the items that are present within this
list to integer and for that purpose we
are using cast operator and notice that
we are calling that cast operator on the
list and we want the items within the
list to be cast to integer so what we
are going to get back is ienumerable of
integer and then we are using a for each
loop looping through each item within
the result sequence and then printing
its value on to the console screen so
let's look at this in action let's flip
to visual studio so here I have a new
console application and here I have the
code that we have seen on the slide so
let's paste it within our console
application now first of all notice that
the add method is operating on object
datatype so which means you can add
anything to this ArrayList now when we
run this as you might expect values 1 2
3 will be printed on the console now
what do you think is going to happen if
we add an item of type string
something like ABC an exception will be
thrown why because this cast operator
will let him to convert all of the items
within this list to integer and is it
possible to cast ABC to an integer no
it's not
that's why it will throw an exception
but another important thing that we need
to understand here is will the exception
be thrown on this line where we are
calling the cast operator or within the
for each loop since cast operator uses
deferred execution the exception will be
thrown when we actually iterate through
the items in the result sequence right
so let's run this notice that it prints
one two three and then when it is
actually trying to loop through ABC
that's when you know it realizes that it
cannot cast ABC to integer and then it
throws this invalid cast exception so
that's cast operator now let's look at
off type operator of type operator we'll
written only elements of the specified
type the other type elements are simply
ignored and excluded from the result set
so let's look at an example again here
we have an ArrayList and this time we
got three integers and two strings
though here you know number four looks
like an integer it's not because it's
enclosed within double quotes so it's
treated as a string so we got two
strings and three integers and notice
that they're using off type operator and
we are saying we want items of type
integer so what's going to happen this
operator is going to retrieve only items
of type integer from this list and then
you know filter out the rest of them so
which means they'll only get one two
three
within the output now this method will
not throw an exception it will simply
ignore items of other type in this case
it will simply ignore four and ABCB char
of string type all right so let's look
at this in action so let's say we got
you know this item as well number four
represented in a string format and ABC
and instead of cast we want to use of
type so now when we run this notice that
we don't get an exception and elements
of type integer are only retrieved
so what is the difference between caste
and off type operators off type operator
returns only the elements of the
specified type and the rest of the items
in the collection will be ignored and
excluded from the result cast operator
on the other hand will try to cast all
the items in the collection into the
specified type if some of the items
failed conversion invalid cast exception
will be thrown so when to use cast over
off type and vice versa we would
generally use cast when these two
conditions are met when we want to cast
all the items in the collection to the
specified type and when we know for sure
the collection contains only items of
the specified type otherwise you know if
you try to use cast you would get an
exception so on the other hand if we
want to filter the items and return only
the ones of the specified type then we
would use off type that's it for today
thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
