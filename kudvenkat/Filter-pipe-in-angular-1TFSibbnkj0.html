in this video we will discuss
implementing a filter pipe in angular
now one important point to keep in mind
is angular team recommends not to use
pipes to filter and sort data this is
because a filtering and sorting pipe can
significantly impact the performance of
the application if not implemented
carefully to better understand the
performance implications let's implement
a custom pipe to filter data we
discussed creating a custom pipe in
detail in part 19 of angular 2 tutorial
so if you are new to creating custom
pipes please check out part 19 of
angular 2 playlists now here is what we
want to do on our Employee List
component we want to include this search
by name textbox as soon as we start to
type the name of an employee we want to
filter the employee a list and display
only those employees whose name contains
the characters that we have typed in
this search by name textbox so within
the view template of our list employees
component let's include the required
HTML markup for the search text box just
above this employee list here let's
include another development and I'm
going to use bootstrap form group class
for styling inside this development
let's include a text box so input type
equals text and I'm going to use another
bootstrap class form control again this
is for styling let's also include
placeholder text we warned the
placeholder text to be searched by name
now let's limit the width of this
textbox to 300 pixels now whatever name
that we type in the search text box we
want to keep track of that within our
component class so let's create a
property for that I'm going to name it
search term and this is of type string
now to keep the value in this property
and in this textbox in sync let's make
use of angular to a data binding so
let's use the banana in a box syntax
ngmodel and the property name is search
term so this completes the markup
required for our search text box next we
want to create a custom pipe to filter
the list of employees we have in this
employee's property so we want to flow
this list through our custom pipe so
let's use the pipe character and we're
going to name our custom filter pipe
employee filter and to this pipe we want
to parse whatever search term that we
type in the search text box and we have
a property which is keeping track of the
value that we have in the search text
box and that property is search term so
let's pass that as a parameter to our
employee filter pipe so all that is left
now to do is create this custom filter
pipe let's place this custom pipe file
in employees folder let's name the file
employee - filter since this is a pipe
let's use dot pipe as well and this a
typescript file so dot TS extension so
let's create our pipe lungs the class
name is employee filter pipe since we
are creating a pipe this class has to
implement an interface and that
interface name is pipe transform now we
need to import this pipe transform
interface from angular core and let's
use single quotes instead of double
quotes here
now this pipe transform interface has
got one method for which our class has
to provide implementation and that
method is transform this method is going
to receive two parameters the first
parameter is the list of employees that
we want to filter let's call this
parameter employees this is going to be
an employee array the second parameter
is the search term itself so let's name
it search term and this is of type
string now if you look at this filter
we're actually using it on our Employee
List component the list of employees we
have in this property will be passed as
a first parameter and the search term
itself will be passed as the second
parameter now the logic to filter the
list of employees will be in this
transform method now the first thing
that I'm going to do is if either this
employees parameter or if the search
parameter is not true they then we want
to return the original list of employees
so if employees property is not Rudy or
search term parameter is not true thee
then we want to return the original list
of employees we have in the employees
parameter on the other hand if both the
parameters are true thee then we want to
filter our list so return employees dot
you can use the array filter method to
filter the list of employees employee
such that employee dot name dot to
lowercase you want to convert this to
lowercase so the comparison can be case
insensitive let's actually move this
code to the next line so we can see it
better since we have an extra space here
the linting tool is reporting that as an
error so let's get rid of that extra
space once we have this name converted
to lowercase let's use index
of method and to this let's parse of a
search term as a parameter and let's
also convert this search term to
lowercase so this index of method is
going to return -1 if the search term is
not found in the employee name if the
search term is found then it's going to
return a number other than minus 1 so
this comparison is going to give us the
list of all those employees whose name
contains the search term now notice on
line number 13 we have a red squiggly
and if I hover the mouse over it says
file should end with a newline
that's another landing error so let's
fix that by including a newline now we
know this transform method is returning
a filtered list of employees so let's
specify the return type as an array of
employees finally since we are creating
a pipe we need to decorate this class
with add pipe decorator now we need to
give our pipe a name so for that let's
use the name property and I'm going to
name it employee filter and if you look
at our list employees component where we
are using this pipe they using the same
name employee filter finally we need to
register our custom pipe let's do that
in the root module file let's include
our custom pipe in the declarations
array we don't have it imported yet
let's import it let's save all our
changes notice when I type J in search
by name textbox we only see John now as
you can see we implemented filtering
using a pipe and everything seems to be
working fine so the question that comes
to our mind is why did the angular team
recommend not use pipes to filter and
saw data
well that's because a filtering and
sorting pipe can significantly impact
the performance of the application we
will discuss these
implications and the recommended
approach to filter and saw data in our
next video here is a custom pipe code
that's it in this video thank you for
watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
