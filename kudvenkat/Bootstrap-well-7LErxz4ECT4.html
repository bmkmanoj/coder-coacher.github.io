this video we'll discuss the bootstrap
Val component this component gives the
content inside it the sunken effect this
component is generally used when we want
a section of content on the page to
stand out from the rest of the content
let's look at an example now at the
moment what we have got here is a line
of text so if we view this page in the
browser this is how that content is
rendered by default now let's place this
content inside a well so for that first
we need to create a well to create a
well all we need to do is create a
development with class well now let's
move this content inside the Val let's
save our changes and when we load our
page notice the content is now present
inside a well here is the HTML for that
now let's see how to create Wells with
different sizes to create wells with
different sizes we have got two
different classes we have well LG and
well sm l d stands for large and SM
stands for small let's create Wells with
different sizes I'm going to make two
more copies of this well and on this
first well
let's also use well LG class and I'm not
going to use any sizing class on the
second well and on the third Val let's
use well SM class let's save our changes
now when we reload the page notice we
get wells with different sizes now with
these classes what happens is it's going
to control the amount of padding between
the text content and the border and it
also controls the radius of the well so
with Val LG class we've got you know
larger padding and the radius of the
rounded corners is also a bit more
whereas with Val SM it's reduced and
this well has got the default sizing
because we are not using any of the
sizing classes on this second well
and here is the HTML for that now let's
discuss placing form controls inside the
Val let's flip to visual studio let's
replace this HTML with another piece of
HTML so what we have here is an HTML
that's going to give us a horizontal
form we discussed forms in detail and
part 20 of this video series so I'm not
going to go over this HTML let's save
our changes when we reload this page we
should get a horizontal login form at
the moment these form controls are not
inside of L let's place them inside of L
for that first let's create a
development I am going to cut this HTML
create a div element with class well and
then place the HTML of the form inside
this well let's save our changes now
when we reload our page notice the form
controls are in the valve as expected
finally let's discuss changing the well
background color at the moment the
default background color is this now we
want to change the background color to
this color as you can see here now we
know that the class that is applied is
well class so let's find that class
width in bootstrap dot CSS so here we
have the well class and notice we have
the background color style here at the
moment this is the style that is being
applied so let's make a copy of this
class within our custom styles dot CSS
and then change only the background
color style let's get rid of the other
styles that we have and I'm going to
change the background color style to D D
D F and 7c that's going to give us the
color that we have seen on the slide
let's reload our page notice we get the
color that we expect thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
