this video we'll discuss the difference
between window height and document
height and how to detect if the user has
crawled to the bottom of the page to get
the window height use window dot height
and to get document height use document
dot height so what is the difference
between window height and document
height the window height is what you see
so the visible area within the browser
window that's called as window height
this is often called as browser viewport
whereas document height includes
everything below or above the visible
area within the browser window so if you
have a large HTML document you know
obviously you will have a scroll bar now
when you scroll up or down you know the
document height includes everything
below or above that visible area so
window height is the visible area it's
often called as browser viewport
whereas document height includes
everything below or above the visible
area to understand the difference
between window height and document
height we will be using the same example
that we worked with in part 52 in part
52 we discussed how to create a floating
bear using jQuery and here is that
example I'm not going to go into the
details of this example we discuss that
in detail and part 52 so if we view this
page in the browser this is how it looks
like so here we have a floating there so
if we have lot of content within the
main page content section we will have a
scrollbar
as we scroll up and down this floating
there will be always visible okay
now to create those crawl bars I have
already typed some content in you know
for the HTML document so let's copy this
content and then paste it within this
main page content section so we get
scroll bar so within the main page
content section right here I'm going to
paste that HTML that we have copied from
the notepad so we have a development
here within that development we have all
that HTML all right so let's go and save
this and reload this page now since we
have a lot of content notice that we
have got a scroll bar and look at this
there this
Stev is floating on the right hand side
now what we want to do is actually
retrieve the window height and document
height in addition to those two I also
want to retrieve the vertical I mean the
scroll bar current vertical position
okay
and to get the current vertical position
of the scroll bar we can use scroll top
function okay so let's get all these
three values and display them within
this floating development okay so
floating development is present in this
variable so we are finding that floating
development by ID and you know as we
scroll up and down you know window dot
scroll event is raised so within the
event handler let's go ahead and append
the height of the window the height of
the document and the scroll bar vertical
position okay so floating div dot I'm
going to use the HTML function and what
we want to do is first let's find the
event of height so window height equals
and how do we get the window height
dollar window and on that use the height
function okay and to that let's go ahead
and append an HTML break and to that so
let's copy this so now we want document
height so document height equals
document dot height and finally we want
the scroll bar position so vertical
scroll bar position equals and how to
get the vertical scroll bar position
window dot scroll top
all right so that's what we want to
display within that floating development
so let's go and save those changes let's
reload this page and look at this as we
scrape scrolling down look at that vendo
height is 667 whereas document height is
a 1964 and look at the vertical scroll
opposition as we keep scrolling down you
know the scroll bar position keeps
increasing look at that and when we hit
the bottom look at that that's what is
the vertical scrollbar position at this
point the vertical scroll bar position
is 1297 document height is 1964 and
window height is 16 667 so now if we
subtract let's open calculator so if we
subtract document height document height
is 1964 - window height window height is
667 equals look at what we get 12 97 the
vertical scrollbar position okay so how
to detect if the user has crawled to the
bottom of the page so here we have the
formula so scrollbar position that is
the current vertical position of the
scrollbar if that is equal to document
height - window height then that
indicates if this condition becomes true
then we have scroll to the bottom of the
page let's actually include this
condition and see what we get so here
what I'm going to do is include that
condition if scroll position so scroll
position is actually present you know in
this variable you know we can either use
that variable or we can use this
actually replay let's replace this with
this variable because we are already
calling that scroll top function there
so let's use this variable here so f
scroll position is equal to window
height actually document height - window
height so document height -
vendo height so if that condition is
true then what does that mean we have
reached the bottom of the page so let's
say floating there dot HTML equals you
have scrawled to the bottom of the page
right so let's go ahead and save the
changes reload this page and look at
this as we keep scrolling down and when
we hit the bottom of the page look at
what is going to happen so I'm about to
hit the bottom of the page look at that
it says you have scroll to the bottom of
the page and when we keep scrolling up
we get again the window height and
document height and the current vertical
position of the scrollbar okay so a very
simple formula to detect if we have
scrolled to the bottom of the page now
sometimes you know in Google Chrome
window height and document height will
be same and that's because if you don't
have this doctype tag so let me remove
that doctype tab tag and see what's
going to happen save the changes let's
go ahead and reload this and look at
this as we scroll down look at that it
reports the same value for both window
height and document height this is a
problem with google chrome but not in
Internet Explorer so if you want to fix
it all you have to do is include the
doctype tag so let's save the changes
and now it reports the correct values
for window height and document height so
in our next video we'll discuss how to
load data like facebook as you scroll
down the page thank you for listening
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
