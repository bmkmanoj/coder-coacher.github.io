venket this is part 38 Delegates usage
in c-sharp part 2 in the previous
session we have seen a very simple
program a very simple employee class
where we have created a promote employee
method and if you look at this promote
employee method you know the problem
with this method is that we have
hard-coded the logic of promoting
employees okay
the logic based on which promote we
promote employees is basically
hard-coded and we know that these
delegates are extensively used by
framework developers now if you are a
framework developer and you're
developing class and methods for a
framework then you want your classes and
methods to be reusable and you don't
want to be hard coding logic like this
so if you hard code logic like this you
are you are preventing your class from
being reused so now let's go ahead and
see how to make this method reusable
with the help of a delegate okay in part
35 we have seen how to use you know the
basic syntax of a delegate and to create
a delegate we use the delegate keyword
so delegate and we know that a delegate
syntax looks much like that of a method
okay a delegate will have a return type
it will have a name and then parameters
are obviously optional okay so now what
we are going to do is all we have to do
in this method is we want to replace
this logic based on I mean instead of
hard-coding this we want to be in a
position to be able to pass in maybe a
method as a parameter here okay we will
understand that in a bit so let's say so
I want if you look at this condition
what is this condition doing okay this
condition will either return a true or a
false
okay employee dot experience greater
than or equal to 5 you know if that is
true then the employee is promoted
otherwise it doesn't get into the if
block so this expression basically
returns a boolean true or false so our
delegate also should return a boolean
true or false and then let's call this
is promotable
that's the name of the delegate and if
you look at this expression it's
actually making use of an employee
object so for our delegate we need to
pass in an employee object so let's say
empl okay that's it so we have created
our simple delegate so what will this
delegate it's going to return a true or
false for the past and employee if the
employee is eligible for promotion then
it returns true otherwise it it should
return false ok so now what we will do
we need to replace this expression with
that delegate and the way we have I mean
to do it it's like this so 2 into this
method I'm going to pass in another
parameter and that parameter is going to
be my delegate so I'm passing in a
delegate as a parameter to this function
okay so I am passing in this delegate so
let's call this is le cheaper to promote
just a meaningful name ok now look at
this we we are passing in a delegate as
a parameter to this remote employees
method now we know that a delegate is a
function pointer in the sense this
delegate will be pointing to a function
ok so at runtime what happens instead of
this delegate you know when you invoke
this delegate it is going to invoke that
method to which this delegate is
pointing ok
so effectively this this function is
taking in another function as a
parameter okay so so anytime if you want
to pass in a function as a parameter
then think of delegates all right so now
we passed and this delegate as a
parameter so how are we going to replace
this logic here is get rid of that logic
there and then simply say ok if the
employee is eligible to promote and
obviously this will take an employee
object so let's go ahead and pass that
so now there is no logic whatsoever here
it's just a delegate you know the frame
you know we know that this delegate is
going to return true or false if it
returns true then that employee gets
promoted otherwise he will not
so where is that logic of how to promote
an employee's based on that will be
decided by the end user who is going to
make use of your class now if you look
at your class it's very clean it doesn't
have any hard-coded logic within that so
let's go ahead and see how to use this
class okay so the person who is going to
use your class now to you know call the
promote employees method when he calls
the promote employees method initially
it was just Employee List but now it's
going to be a delegate as well so you
have to pass in a delegate as well now
we know that a delegate is like a class
when you create an instance of the
delegate the constructor will actually
take in the name of the function and we
know that that function signature has to
match the signature the delegate so
let's go ahead and see that so now this
employee promote employee method is also
taking another parameter you know is
promotable which is nothing but a
delegate okay so if you look at this
it's the same example that we have seen
in the previous session we have an
employee list and to that employee list
we have four employees okay now let's
see how to invoke the method first we
need to create the delegate what is the
delegate is promotable so I'm creating
an instance of this delegate is
promotable so from more trouble
maybe just give it a meaningful name is
promotable that's the name of the
delegate so we are creating an instance
and we know that to the constructor of
this delegate we have to pass in a
function which has got a boolean that
written type and which takes an employee
object as a parameter so we first need
to create that function and it is that
function where we define our logic on
how we want to fire our employees I mean
promote our employees so let's go ahead
and let's say public boolean let's say
promote and this method should take an
employee object and let's say EMP and
now here you will provide your logic if
let's say EMP dot may be experience is
greater than or equal to 5 years then
return true
else return false okay so if you look at
this method it returns a boolean and it
takes an an employee object and we have
to pass that method to this constructor
of the delegate so we are going to pass
in that promote method so we have a
delegate created now and let's make mark
the static so that we don't need the
instance the class to invoke that all
right so we have the delegate now what
we do is we pass in that delegate as a
parameter this function that's it so if
you look at this function now I mean if
you look at this code we haven't
hard-coded any logic in our framework
method you know our employee class is
going to go into some kind of a
framework and if we don't want any kind
of hard-coded logic there so we move
that out you know with the help of this
delegate okay so this delegate at
runtime is promotable delegate is
actually pointing to this particular
function and this function will return a
true or false if it returns true then we
know that that employee is eligible for
promotion and he will be promoted okay
this way actually you can decouple the
logic from your framework class and
method you know which makes your class
and methods a little more flexible so if
we go ahead and run this now you know as
far as the output is concerned it
doesn't change in any way except that we
have three structured our program using
delegates which makes it more flexible
and you might be wondering alright you
know just to do this simple thing you
know initially it was console.writeline
you know you have your condition
hard-coded here and it was very easy but
now you know just because you you are
using a delegate okay first you have to
create that delegate and then
you have to create this method which you
know this method signature should match
the signature of this is promotable
delegate and then you need to create an
instance of this delegate and and to
that instance I mean to the constructor
of the delegate you have to pass in the
name of the function so a lot of steps
to do these simple things actually do we
have to do all this not necessarily you
know if you are aware of lambda
expressions these del lambda expressions
are actually based on Delegates so
instead of creating this public I mean
this method and then creating your
delegate and then to the delegate
passing in this method what you can do
is actually you can get rid of this
function altogether you don't require
that anymore and you don't even require
this delegate you get rid of that as
well now in inside this method you can
actually pass in a lambda expression
okay so instead of this delegate what
you can do is now whatever goes in here
it should it will operate on an employee
object and it is going to return a true
or false okay so what we can actually do
is so you can say now just to give it a
meaningful name employee such that EMP
dot let's say experience greater than or
equal to five okay so you can use this
in-line lambda expression here instead
of creating a delegate a function and
then making the delegate point to that
solution okay
so you can do that this way so if I go
ahead and run this now you know it's
just going to be very simple I mean the
same output except that we are now using
lambda expressions instead of creating
an instance it delegates the same you
know behind the scenes what happens is
the runtime actually creates a delegate
creates a function and then passes it to
this particular framework method which
does its job okay so I hope you have
understood that you know the the fact
that using delegates will make your
programs more reusable
all right that's it in this session and
on this slide you can actually see some
s we don't let C sharp interview
questions thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
