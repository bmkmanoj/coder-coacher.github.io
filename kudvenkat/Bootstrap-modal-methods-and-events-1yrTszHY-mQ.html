in this video we'll discuss some of the
useful methods and events provided by
the bootstrap model plug-in in our
previous video we have used the data -
attributes to show and hide the model
when we click the login button that's
when the login model shows up to make
that happen on the login button notice
we are using two data - attributes data
- toggle and data - target when we click
the close button that's when the model
is closed and to make that happen
on the close button using data - dismiss
attribute we can also manually show and
hide the model to manually show and hide
the model use the methods provided by
the bootstrap model plugin to show the
model use model show method to hide the
model use model hide let's look at these
two methods in action let's flip to
visual studio the first thing that I'm
going to do here is remove these two
data - attributes let's save our changes
reload this page and at this point when
we click the login button notice the
login model is not launched let's see
how to manually launch it using model
show method let's give this login button
an ID let's call it BTN
show model let scroll all the way down
and with no a jQuery ready function
let's find that button using the jQuery
ID selector which is hash and on this
lets wire up the click event handler so
when we click this button that's when we
want to show the login model login model
div also has got an ID and the ID of
that div is login model so let's copy
that
and within the click event handler let's
use the jQuery ID selector again find
the login model and then on that let's
call the model function and pass it a
value of show let's save our changes
reload this page and at this point when
we click the login button notice the
login model is launched and at the
moment we are still using data - dismiss
attribute with a close button so when we
click close the model is dismissed
let's remove this data - dismiss
attribute let's see what changes reload
this page and at this point when we
click close button look at that the
model is not closed let's see how to
manually close it using model hide
method first let's make a copy of this
code and let's give this close button an
ID let's call this BTN hide model we
want to wire up click even handle it to
this button so let's change the ID here
when we click the close button that's
when we want to close the model so to
this model function I'm going to pass
hide let's save our changes reload this
page and click login button the model is
launched click close button the model is
closed now let's look at the events show
dot B s dot model this event is fired
immediately after model show method is
called shown dot B s dot model this
event is fired after the model is made
completely visible to the user hide dot
B s truck model fired immediately after
model hide method is called hidden dot B
s dot model fired after the model is
completely hidden from the user let's
handle all these events let's flip to
visual studio let's use the jQuery ID
selector find the login model and let's
use the jQuery own function and handle
show dot B s dot model event this event
is raised
immediately after show method is called
let's alert a message the message is
going to be model is about to be
displayed let's make a copy of this
event handler let's also handle shown
dot B a stock model this event is raised
after the model is made completely
visible to the user so model is
displayed is going to be the message
let's make a copy of these two even
handlers and let's handle hide dot be a
stock model this event is raised
immediately after model hide method is
called so the message here is going to
be model is about to be hidden and let's
also handle hidden dot be a stock model
this event is raised after the model is
made completely hidden from the user so
the message is going to be model is
hidden let's see what changes reload
this page and look at this when we click
the login button
even before the login model appears we
have this message model is about to be
displayed when we click OK
we have the login model and then when
the login model is made completely
visible to the user we have this message
model is displayed let's click OK now
when we click the close button notice
first we get the message model is about
to be hidden when we click OK the model
closes and then we get the message model
is hidden thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
