this is part 54 of a speedor template
view tutorial in this video we'll
discuss about implementing custom paging
in a grid we control that does not use
any data source controls will be using
table TBL employee for this demo now if
we have to implement custom paging
negative we control the first step is to
implement a stored procedure that can
return us the required data for example
when I am on page one of grid view
control and if the page size is set to
three then I need the first set of three
records from the underlying database
table when I am on the second page then
I need the second set of three records
so if we have to have a stored procedure
that can do this then we need to provide
the stored procedure at least with two
input parameters okay
the page that you are on that's the page
index and how many rows do you need to
display on that page that's the page
size I have the stored procedure already
implemented okay now if you look at the
stored procedure SP get employees PI
page index and page size so you give it
the page index and page size the stored
procedure is going to return the correct
set of records so here you know we have
the tween parameters page index and page
size now there is also another parameter
total rows which is an output parameter
so what is this true parameter for it's
going to return me the total number of
rows that are present in TBL employee
now you might be wondering why do we
need the total number of rows in the
table that's because if the grid we
control has to compute the number of
page numbers that it has to display
within this paging area which the users
can use to page through the grid we
control then the grid we control need to
know how many total rules are there for
example if there are a total of 8
records if you look at this table employ
a table it has got 8 records so if I
have 8 records within the database table
then we need to display three page
numbers here so how can I tell that you
know unless and until I don't have this
total number of rows you know the grid
view control cannot determine that
that's the reason why we have a third
parameter which is an output parameter
which is going to return the total
number of rows in this
table TBL employee first let's actually
test the stored procedure and then we'll
go the code now the stored procedure has
an output parameter and it's of type
integer so we need a variable of type
integer
so first let's declare a variable of
type integer declare and let's call this
row count and this is going to be of
type integer now we want to execute the
stored procedure so execute what is the
name of the studio seizure SP get
employees by page index and page size
and then obviously the stored procedure
has three parameters the first one is
the page index now the page index is
going to be 0 because remember
grid-view is 0 grid-view page index is 0
based meaning when I am on the first
page of the grid we control the page
index is actually 0 and I am on the
second page it's 1 so it's 0 index based
so page index is 0 and the page size is
3 so the second parameter is going to be
3 and the third parameter is the output
parameter which is going to receive the
total number of rows and I have a
variable to receive that value so I'm
going to pass that here and since it's
an output parameter use the out keyword
and then finally select the value that's
present in that you know variable all
right let's execute this so obviously
when I am the first page I should get
the first set of 3 records look at that
I get 1 2 3 and then the total number of
rows are 8 now when I'm on the second
page the page index is going to be 1 so
at this point I should get 4 5 6 records
so 4 5 6 total rows is 8 and then when
I'm on the third page another page index
is going to be 2 and then when we
execute this remember this table has got
only 8 employees so the third page will
only return to records and again the
total rows is 8 okay so we have the
stored procedure now let's look at the
implementation of the stored procedure
we'll come back to these four lines in
just a bit but then look at you know
this inner query that I have here let me
actually execute this query and look at
the output first so look at the output
what am I getting here I'm getting the
employee ID name gender and city columns
you know these are the columns that are
present n table TBL employee I am
getting them as it
along with them I'm getting another
additional column row number okay and
this is a sequential row number from 1
to 8 you might be wondering you know why
I have this row number because I'm going
to use this to filter the correct rules
that I need okay we can't use employee
ID because if I delete an employee
record you know there may be gaps in
employee ID that's why we are using this
row number so this inner query is going
to return the set of data and we are
giving it an alias name here employees
so this you know entire thing is going
to act as a derived table and from this
table look at what we are retrieving
we're just retrieving employee ID name
gender and city columns from the stable
employees that's the derive table and
then we are using the filter you know
you row number here so we're rule number
is greater than or equal to it's going
to be actually at start row index and
row number is less than or equal to at
end row index okay
now let's understand what are these
start row index and end row index is
okay so basically when I'm on the first
page the start row index should be
because if you look at this output and
I'm on the first page the start row
index should be one and row index will
be should be three but I am on the
second page start row index should
before and row index should be six when
I'm at the third page start row index
should be seven and row index should be
nine but since I only have eight records
I will get seven and eight now let's see
how we are computing the start and end
row indexes okay now these are the two
declarations for those variables start
row index and end Roy index of type
integer and look at stat row index how
we are computing it start row index is
equal to page index into page size so
when I am on the page of one of the grid
we control what is page index at 0 so 0
into 3 is going to be 0 0 plus 1 is 1 so
start row index is going to be 1 and how
are we computing and row index page
index plus 1 0 plus 1 is 1 into 3 is 3
so end ruined
X is going to be three obviously now
when we execute this we should get
records one two three okay similarly if
you pass the right page index and the
page size you're going to get you know
the correct set of records so very
simple straight forward query here and
then the final statement here is to
compute the total number of rows
remember this is an output parameter and
we are retrieving the total number of
rows from TBL employee and storing that
in that parameter and that parameter
will be returned to whoever is going to
call that stored procedure so we have
the required stored procedure now let's
flip to visual studio let's add employee
data access layer class file and let's
call this employee data access layer dot
CS now they encapsulate the employee
information that's present in the stable
TBL employee we need an employee class I
have that already implemented here it's
a very straightforward class with four
Auto implemented properties employee ID
name gender and city as you can see here
all right now within the employee act
data access layer class itself we need a
method which can execute the stored
procedure that we have just written and
obviously retrieve the data and to do
that we need to write a do dotnet code
so I have to import some required ATO
dotnet namespaces system data system
data dot sickle client and system dot
configuration now let me copy and paste
this method and then we'll go over the
code now again this is going to be a
straightforward ad or dotnet code
remember that the stored procedure has
got an output parameter as well okay so
now the stored procedure has got an
output parameter so at total rows and
then two input parameters page index and
page size so if you look at my method
you know get employees it also has got
those two input parameters page index
and page size and you know the output
parameter total rows we will pass these
method parameters as values to the
respective sequel parameters and look at
the return type of the method it's going
to return a list of employee objects and
this output
of this method is going to return the
total number of rows and the grid we
control can do its job okay so we have
here a variable of type list employee
and then using the configuration manager
class we are reading the connection
string from web config file we are
building the sequel connection object
using the connection string and notice
the sequel command it's nothing but the
stored procedure as we get employees by
page index and page size and then since
it's a stored procedure we are
specifying the command type a stored
procedure and then notice this we are
creating a sequel parameter object here
and the parameter name is at page index
that's the first parameter of the stored
procedure and the parameter value is
going to be the input parameter that's
coming into this method page index and
then we are adding the parameter object
to the parameters collection property of
the command object and we are doing the
same thing for paid size parameter and
look at this the third parameter that
the stood procedure expects is an output
parameter so obviously here we are
creating a sequel parameter object and
then we are specifying the parameter
name and since it's an output parameter
we need to specify the direction as
output and the data type you know this
output parameter is of type integer and
then obviously we are adding that output
parameter to the parameters collection
property of this command object and then
we are opening the command
I mean connection executing the command
and then obviously it is going to return
some rows so we are looping through each
row and converting that into an employee
object populating the employee object
properties and then we are adding that
employee object to the list and then
look at this after we've done looping
through each row when we get out of this
while loop we are closing that reader
now it's very important to close this
reader before we actually retrieve the
output parameter value so what is the
set total rows this is nothing but the
output parameter name so from the
command object parameters collection
property we are passing in the name of
the parameter and then we are retrieving
the value out of it okay now when you
retrieve the value before you close the
reader you know the output parameter
value will be now
so that's why it's very important you
close the reader before you actually try
to retrieve the output parameter value
and then obviously we are returning the
list back okay so that's our employee
data access layer pretty straightforward
so far we have implemented the stored
procedure and we have implemented this
employee data access layer which is
going to invoke that stored procedure
now let's flip to webform and let's drag
and drop a grid view control and let's
auto format this let's choose Brown to
the screen let's enable paging by
setting allow paging property to true
and then let's set the page size to
three okay so we have the grid view
control here now for the grid view
control now if we have to implement
custom paging in a grid we control in
order to display these page numbers okay
we have to use a repeater control I mean
there are several ways to implement
custom paging in a grid we control the
easiest way I can think office using a
repeater control basically to display
those page numbers because remember you
know this employee data access layer is
going to return just three records okay
to this grid view control because we
only get the required number of rows and
then we are going to use a repeater
control to display in other page numbers
so let me drag and drop a repeater
control and then within the repeater
control I'm going to use an item
template and then I'm going to specify a
link button as the interface that can be
used for paging so let me drag and drop
a link button okay we'll configure the
properties of the links this link button
in just a bit
but now let's flip to the design mode so
this repeater is going to act as the
paging bar for the grid view control so
that the user can click on them and page
through the delivery control all right
now within the code-behind
of this waveform one the first thing
that I'm going to do is to implement a
private method first let me copy and
paste this private method and then we'll
go over the code
so what is this private method doing now
first thing let's get rid of this
compliation
error here now when we dragged and drop
the repeater on the webform the ID is
repeater 1 let me change that ID to
something called repeater paging all
right so that should get rid of that
error now basically why are we using
this repeater this repeater is going to
display the page numbers beneath the
grid we control now how many pages can
it discipline I mean how many page page
numbers does this repeater need to
display how will it know that okay so to
compute that we need to specify the page
size and the page number and that's what
we are passing into this repeater so I
have the page size and the total number
of rows that are available in the table
so if I have a total of 8 rows and if
the page size is 3 then we know we need
3 pages you know for the grid view
control okay so that's why we have these
two parameters here and there is a third
parameter page index in a bit we'll
understand why we need this input
parameter for this method okay so
basically here we are computing the
total pages that are required and how
are we doing that total rows divided by
the page says so total rows for example
if it's 8 and the page size is 3 8 by 3
the quotient is going to be 2 so total
pages is 2 but then there are two more
records left out 2 into 3 is 6 records
but where should I display that the rest
of the two records if my page size is 2
that's why what am I doing here I am
using this mod operator so total rows
nor the page size if that is not equal
to 0 in our case it's not equal to 0 its
to the remainder is 2 which means to the
total pages we need to add 1 so we need
a total of 3 pages so we are
incrementing total pages by 1 and then
what are we doing here we are creating
an object of type list of list item so a
list of list item objects and remember
what is a list item object a list item
you know basically contains three
properties it contains a
texts value and enabled property which
is actually very useful to us because
we're going to use those properties and
modify this link button control as we
need it okay so basically we are
creating an object here of type list of
list item and then if total pages is
greater than one so the total pages is
greater than one only then we need to
show these paging buttons if if you know
I only have three records in my database
table TBL employee then we don't have to
show any paging buttons here because all
the records are shown so if the total
pages is greater than one then what we
are doing we are using this for loop
here for into I is equal to 1 I less
than or equal to total pages so in our
case the total pages is going to be 3 so
I is equal to 1 I less than or equal to
3 I plus plus so we're incrementing the
I value and then what we are doing to
the pages object here we are adding a
new list item object because what is
pages it's a list of list item object so
we are adding a new list item object and
look at this list item object
constructor we are using a constructor
that is taking in three parameters you
know the text value and enabled you know
parameters so text is string I mean
value is string so I is here an integer
so first time I will be one so one you
know the text will be one and value will
also be one but they are the string
representations because we are
converting it to a string and then
finally here I look at this the third
parameter for this constructor is a
boolean parameter and it's true or false
okay so we are saying I not equal to
page index plus one now why do we need
this property because they're going to
use this boolean property of this list
item object to determine whether if the
link button should be enabled or
disabled in the paging bar for example
when I'm on the first page of the grid
we control this link button should not
be clickable I should not enable that
because I'm already on the page on the
first page so there should be no reason
why the user should click and post the
waveform once again okay so to determine
that I am going to use this boolean
property okay look at this when I am
the first page you know page index
remember grid-view page index is zero
based so page index is going to be zero
if it's going to be zero you know I am
actually on on page one and then look at
this the page numbers start from one so
that's why I'm saying increment page
index by one so 0 plus 1 is 1 1 not
equal to 1 ok that's going to be false
and then we will use this property I
mean the parameter basically to
initialize the enabled property of the
link button which we will use within you
know the repeater control for paging
okay if that does not make sense at this
time don't worry it will be much clearer
when we actually use this method in a
bit okay so we are populating this list
item object with three you know
parameters the text value and whether if
it's enabled or not okay and then what
we are doing look at this this is very
important we are setting the pages which
is nothing but a list of list item
objects as the data source for our
repeater control usually you know for
example if I want to bind customers to a
grid we control we will say grid v1 dot
data source is equal to list of customer
objects here we are giving the data
source as list of list item objects and
if you look at this list item object it
has got text value and enabled
properties which we are going to use to
customize the link button that we
display within the repeater control for
paging purpose okay so that's our
private method okay
now let's actually configure the link
button and I'll set all the required
properties of this link button so the ID
for this one I will just call this link
button okay then it is equal to server
and I am going to get rid of this text
right here and then I'm going to set the
text property and just to speed things
up I have that already typed as well so
let me copy and paste these properties
right here so what are we doing let me
format this by pressing ctrl K and D so
we are setting the text property so we
are setting the text
property of the link button to the text
property of the list item object because
what is the data source for this
repeater pages and what is pages it's a
list of list item objects so the list
item object has got a property called
text which we are setting as the text
property of this link button so number 1
2 &amp;amp; 3 will be displayed within that link
button and command argument we are
setting that to value property you can
either also use text here because if you
remember within this function both text
and value are set to the value of Phi I
is what 1 2 or 3 the number so the
command argument is tied with value
property again it's going to be 1 2 or 3
in a bit you will see how we are going
to use this command argument property
and look at this this is what is
important enabled is set to the enabled
property of the list item object and
remember this enabled when I am on the
first page this enabled property you
know this expression is going to return
false because I is 1 and 1 not equal to
when I am on the first page page index
will be 0 0 plus 1 is 1 so 1 not equal
to 1 what does this expression return
it's going to return false so and then
we are setting that as the value for
this enabled property of the link button
so when I am on page 1 enabled is false
meaning that link button will be
disabled and the users will not be able
to click on that when I am on first page
ok all right so that's it we are done
with this you know repeater configuring
the buttons that we need for paging and
then the next thing is obviously within
the page load event if it's not a
postback we need to invoke the employee
data access layers get employees method
and then look at that
first of all I am creating a variable of
type integer called total rows because
why this get employees method notice
this what are the parameters of this
method the page index so how do I get to
know on which page you know we are there
we are basically using grid view page
index but remem
if it is the initial get request of the
wave form you know we are loading the
wave form for the first time in which
case the page index will be zero I can
simply pass in zero there if I want and
then the next parameter for this method
is the page size so what is the page
size you know that's configured at the
grid view level so instead of
hard-coding it to three I'm using the
page size property of the grid view
control so if I set it to five then it's
going to display five rows so we are
using the page size property of the grid
we control and then finally the output
parameter total rows so I have created a
variable here total rows which is going
to receive the total number of rows
remember within the employee data access
layer this total rows is going to return
the total number of rows that are
present in TBL employee table okay and
then we are setting whatever what is
this method returning it's returning
list of employees which is set as the
data source for the grid we control and
we are invoking the data bind and then
look at this we are invoking this
private method data bind repeater okay
and obviously this repeater also
requires the page index the page size
and total rows okay so the page index
you know you can hard code that to zero
all right so that's done now and the
last thing that is basically left is
when I click this link button look at
this at this point of time let let's
actually run this and see if it's going
to work you know obviously when the grid
view controller first renders it should
only display the first set of three
records and look at this I have the page
numbers here
now when I click on page and see I'm on
page one and this page now is not
clickable now when I click on page two
look at this basically nothing happens
why because we have not written code to
respond to the click event of these link
buttons that are displayed within the
repeater so now let's go ahead and add a
click event handler for that link
buttons so on
click so we need to define an even
handler method within the code-behind
file so the name of the button is link
button so let me copy that go to the
behind file and then let's add a even
handler method so it's going to be
protected it's not going to return
anything link button underscore you know
click that's going to be the name of the
method and first parameter is going to
be object sender and then the second
parameter is going to be even to
argument see now if it is difficult for
you to remember the syntax of the even
handler method the easiest way is
obviously you know you have link button
you know with ID so if you look at the
idea of the link button it's link button
so if it's hard for you to remember the
syntax of the event handler method you
can simply say link button actually
let's do it somewhere inside otherwise
we won't get intelligence or link button
dot click let's actually now since that
link button is within the repeater
control we don't get intelligence so the
easiest way is obviously I can create an
object of type link button and then we
can say lb dot click plus equals look at
that when I press you know tab here it's
automatically going to generate the even
handler method for me with the
parameters name of the method and the
return type so you can either do this as
well if it's hard for you to remember
the syntax of the even handler method
for a click event of your button I'm
going to call this you know link button
let's give us a meaningful name all
right now I'm going to specify this as
the method to invoke on click of this
link button ok let's go to the web forum
and let's actually get rid of this code
here because we don't need this all
right so now all that is left out is to
implement this link button so what
should happen when we click on that link
button you know we should change the
page index of the grid we control and
then repo
be controlled with required data and
then also bind the repeater and that's
what exactly we are doing here so that's
the method so let's copy that and paste
it within our even handler method so
basically again we are creating a
variable of type integer called total
rows and initializing that to 0 and look
at this we are retrieving the command
argument you remember when we were
configuring this link button we have set
the command argument to the value
property of the list item object ok so
which is going to be 1 2 or 3 and
remember you know within that private
method the page numbers start at 1 okay
so the command argument we are
retrieving the command argument of that
link button so our sender who raised
this event the link button that's
present within the repeater control so
we know that sender is a link button so
we are typecasting that to be of type
link button and we are retrieving the
command argument property which is going
to be 1 2 or 3 depending on the link
button that you have clicked and we are
converting that command argument to
integer and storing it in this variable
and remember the the page number is
start at 1 whereas the page index of the
gridview control is 0 okay so if I am on
page 1 then the page index is actually 0
so here we have to decrement the page
index by 1 otherwise we won't get the
correct page number so page index is
equal to page index minus 1 and then
what we are doing we are setting the
page index of this would be control and
then we are passing that page index page
size and the output parameter total rows
to arkett employees method of data
access layer setting that as the data
source in working the data bind and then
invoking data bind repeater method as
well passing in the required parameters
that's it so let's run this now and see
if it's going to work as expected
so we are on page one it's showing the
first set of three records I click on
page two look at that four five six are
displayed and look at this two is
disabled but one and three are enabled
click on page number three we have only
two records all right on this slide you
