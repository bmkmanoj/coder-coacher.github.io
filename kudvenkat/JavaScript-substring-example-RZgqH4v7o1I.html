in this video we'll discuss a few simple
real-time examples of way we can use
index of last index of and substring
methods
this is continuation to part 11 so
please watch part 11 before proceeding
first let's look at an example of using
index of and substring methods this is
what we want to achieve in the email
address textbox the end user is going to
enter his email address for example here
we entered banker K at presumed calm and
if you look at this email address it has
got two parts with an ED the first part
is the email itself that is wankered K
and the second part is the domain name
that is presumed techcom and we have
this 8 character separating the email
from the domain name so when we click
this get email in domain parts button
what we want to do is get that email
part that is Venkat K and display that
in the email part textbox and the domain
part that is present ENCOM should be
displayed in domain part textbox so
let's see how to achieve this very
easily using index of and substring
methods let's flip to uShip studio i've
already typed the required HTML to get
this user interface and here is that
HTML this HTML is very straightforward
so i'm not going to go into the HTML I
will have this HTML available on my blog
in case you need it so let's go ahead
and write our JavaScript function so
within the script section let's create a
function let's call this get email and
domain parts the first thing that we
need to do is retrieve the email address
that the user has typed into the textbox
so let's create a variable let's call
this email address equals we are going
to use the document object dot get
element by ID method and we need to pass
the ID of the text box into which the
end user is going to type their full
email address and the ID is txt email
address so let's pass that to this
function
and then once we have the reference of
that textbox dot value should give us
the value that is present within the
textbox so we now have the email address
so let's create a variable to get the
email part from the email address so
here we have the variable which is going
to store that now we have the email
address within this variable and email
address is a string so we can use dot
substring method and now to get a sub
strain we need to specify from which
character do we want to start the
extraction we want to start the
extraction from 0 8 character okay and
then we want the extraction to end just
before the @ symbol that's where you
know we have the complete email part
okay so how do we get to know the
position of the @ character within that
string we can use the index of method so
again we use the string email address
dot index off and we want the index of
the @ symbol okay so start at this
position which is at index position 0
that is from the first character and
retrieve all the characters until this @
symbol so that's going to give us the
email part similarly now let's go ahead
and retrieve the domain part so where
domain part equals so to retrieve the
domain part we have to start you know
wherever we have the @ character you
know we have to start 1 character after
wherever we have that @ symbol so again
we are going to use this substring
method so email address dot substring
off now we don't want to start at 0 at
character we want to start wherever we
have this @ symbol and then go all the
way till the end of the string okay so
we have the email path domain parts now
all that is left is to display those
within the respective text boxes so if
you look at the ID of the text box where
we want to display the email part it is
txt email part so let's copy that and
then let's use the document object or
get element by ID and then we are going
to pass the email path text box dot
value equals email part and similarly
let's display the domain part and domain
part should be displayed in txt domain
part text box so let's paste it there
and let's call this JavaScript function
when we click the button on the web form
so here we have the HTML button and on
click we want to call this JavaScript
function get email and domain parts all
right so with this change let's go ahead
and run this and we are going to have a
small problem here we'll fix that in
just a bit first let's look at the
problem so email address let's enter
venket dot k at regime techcom and when
we click this look at that it gives the
email part venkat k as expected now the
domain name should actually be presume
techcom I don't want the @ symbol okay
and the reason we are getting that @
symbol is because you know we are
starting wherever you know we have the
set character okay using that index but
we don't want to do that we want to
start one character after way we have
the set symbol so just use +1 there and
now we should get the behavior that we
expect so wintered dot
enter that K add presumed techcom look
at that wanker that K is the email part
presume techcom is the domain part now
in part 11 we just discuss about last
index of method so first let's look at
what is this last index of method this
method returns the position of the last
occurrence of a specified value in a
string if you look at the index off
method it is going to return the index
position of the first occurrence of a
specified string but this method is
going to return as the last occurrence
of a specified value in a given string
so since this methods job is to return
the last index of the specified value
from a performance standpoint you know
to improve the performance of this
function what it is going to do is it's
going to search the given strain from
the end to the beginning and then it
returns the index of the first match it
finds because there is no point in
starting at the first character and then
going through the entire string because
if you start at the end of the string
and then the first time you find the
specified value then you know that is
going to be the last index of that
character and the method is simply going
to return that without actually scanning
the rest of the string that means it's
going to improve the performance of that
method now this method just like index
off method is going to return minus 1 if
it does not find the specified value in
the given string so here is a simple
example we have my blog URL there and if
you look at that URL it has got this dot
character present three times within
that string so once after WWI and second
time here at third time here now when we
say we want the last index of that dot
character within that URL variable then
it's going to return the index of this
dot symbol and the index of that dot
symbol is 42 and that's what we can
let's look at another exam
of using this last index of method and
substring method so within the website
URL we can type any URL that we want and
when we click this get top-level domain
button we want to retrieve the domain
name that is for this website the domain
is com
you know you may have dotnet websites
dot edu websites etc so whatever is the
top-level domain name we want to
retrieve that and display that within
the top-level domain
text box so let's see how to achieve
this using last index of and substring
methods first of all we need to get that
user interface and again to speed things
up I already have the HTML here so I'm
just going to copy this and paste it
within our web form so instead of this
table I'm going to paste the table that
we have just copied and we don't need
this JavaScript function anymore
so let's actually get rid of this one
and let's rename this method to get
domain name and if you look at the
design of this waveform you know in this
text box we are going to enter the
website URL and we want to retrieve the
domain name and display that within this
text box when we click this button so
first we need a variable to retrieve the
URL that the user has typed so variable
URL equals document dot get element by
ID and we need to pass the textbox of
the I mean the ID of the first text box
which is txt URL
dot value so that should give us
whatever URL the user has typed into the
textbox and we have that within this
variable all that is left now is to use
another variable let's call this maybe
domain name equals URL dot we are going
to use substring method and what we want
to do is retrieve the last index of the
dot character within the URL because a
URL may contain you know multiple
characters within that for example
multiple dot characters within it for
example if you look at this you know we
have dot here we have dot here and we
have dot here so once we get the last
index of the dot character from that
position you know get all the characters
that are present within that string till
the end of the string okay so it's as
simple as that
so we are going to use the URL dot last
index off and then we want the last
index off dot character so what we are
saying with this line here is start at
that index position and retrieve all the
characters that are present after that
ok and then obviously this variable is
going to contain our domain name and all
that is left now is to display the value
that is present in that variable within
the domain name textbox so document dot
get element by ID and this is the target
text box where we want to display the
domain name
dot value equals whatever value that's
present in that variable so let's run
this we need to specify the on-click
attribute for the button control so
let's copy the function name go all the
way down and then set the onclick
attribute
and let's enter for example
www.gymnu.com and one we click on get
low a top-level domain notice that com
now let's say for example we we have the
prism tech URL like this presume tech
dot blog dotnet for example now when I
click get top-level domain we should get
dotnet notice that thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
