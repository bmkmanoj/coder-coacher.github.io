tutorial in this video we'll discuss how
to create a new angular project from
scratch using angular CLI run the
project that we have created run unit
and end-to-end test in this course we'll
use Visual Studio code as the editor
Visual Studio code is free and you can
use it on any platform Windows Mac or
Linux if you have not installed Visual
Studio code already you may download and
install it from this URL right here to
create a new angular project fire up
command prompt as an administrator and
then type this command ng new my first
tab here and G is the angular CLI itself
new for creating a new project and my
first app is the name of the angular
project that we want to create this
command creates all the required files
and also installs all the required
packages depending on your computer and
internet connection speed this command
may take a few minutes to complete there
are several options that we can use with
this engine new command will discuss
what all these options are in our next
video let's press the Enter key so what
all is this ng new command going to do
it creates a new folder with name my
first tab all the required configuration
and source files will be created all the
NPM dependencies will be installed in
node underscore modules folder unit and
end-to-end tests will also be created
unit tests Rana karma is configured
end-to-end test framework protractor is
also configured out-of-the-box we will
discuss unit has end-to-end tests
therma and protractor in our upcoming
videos another important point to keep
in mind is that the angular CLI creates
all the project code and configuration
files out-of-the-box while still
following the angular team's best
practices and conventions as you can see
angular CLI is installing all the
required packages using NPM this is the
most time-consuming task and creating a
new angular project there we go
the project
they successfully created let's clear
the screen now we named our project my
first tab and that project folder is
present in C Drive so let's change the
directory to my first app and then we
want to open this project folder using
visual studio code to do that I'm going
to type code short for visual studio
code and then dot and now when we press
Enter key it's going to open the project
folder in visual studio code there we go
and notice here we have the node modules
folder which contains all the packages
that we have installed using NPM and we
also have several other code and
configuration files we'll discuss what
these files are and their purpose in our
upcoming videos now to run the project
using angular CLI we use this command ng
serve - - open and then we press the
Enter key
ng stands for angular CLI itself serve
we want to serve the application and
it's flag - - open is going to launch
our default browser and it's going to
run our application within that now by
default the application is going to run
at port number for a two hundred as you
can see right here we can change this
default port number if required we'll
discuss how to do that in our upcoming
videos notice it has automatically
launched our default browser and look at
the port number right here that's 42
hundred at the moment it's still
building our application is going to
take a few seconds to complete this
there we go
compiled successfully now if we look at
the browser we have our application
running here now let's arrange this
browser window the command prompt window
maybe we have our development server
running and visual studio code
side-by-side at the moment angular
development server is running in watch
mode as you can see right here meaning
whenever the files within our angular
project changes those changes are
automatically detected compiled and a
browser reloads to reflect the changes
this is called live reload we can turn
this live reload functionality off if
required
discuss how to do that in our upcoming
videos now let's look at this live
reload functionality in action look at
the message right here welcome to app
this word app is coming from our root
component our root component is right
here after component or tiers and within
this component we have this property
title and at the moment this property is
set to this value and that's what is
displayed right here and look at what's
going to happen when I change this I'm
going to change it from app to pragya
and then when I save these changes the
web server in the middle which is
running in watch mode is going to pick
up those changes automatically build
them and look at the browser it is true
loaded and we see the message welcome to
presume now still this server is running
in watch mode to stop the server we use
ctrl C and then Y to confirm and then
when we hit the enter key the server is
stopped now we can also run unit tests
using angular CLI and run all the unit
tests we use ng and then test when I
press ENTER it's going to again build
the application run all the unit tests
look at the message right here executed
three of three so we have three unit
tests in total and all the three unit
tests are executed out of which two
failed angular CLI also launched the
browser window with a graphical report
notice we have three specs that is three
unit tests out of which we have two
failures and here is our first failure
app component should have title AB if
remember we have changed the title
property within our app component from
app to presume does the reason we have
these two failures to fix these two unit
tests all we have to do is change this
title back to AB but before we do that
look at the development server right
here it's running in watch mode meaning
if we make any changes to a project
those changes will be automatically
detected the application will be rebuilt
and these unit tests will be Reax acute
'add so let's change the title from
presume to app save our changes
and notice the development server is
automatically going to detect those
changes it's going to build the
application one more time and then re
execute those unit tests look at the
message right here executed three of
three and all the unit tests succeeded
and if you look at the browser window it
has reloaded the browser window and we
have three specs and zero failures and
our development server is still running
in watch mode to stop the server we
press ctrl C and then Y to confirm to
execute end-to-end tests we use ng e to
e and then plus enter this is going to
build the application and execute our
end-to-end test look at the message
right here executed one of once pack
within our application at the moment we
have one end-to-end test which is
executed and that succeeded now let's
quickly recap the commands that we have
used so far ng new we use this command
to create a brand new working angular
project out-of-the-box
ng serve - - open this command billster
application starts the server opens your
default browser and runs the application
with a net ng test runs all the unit
tests ng e - e runs all the end-to-end
tests in our upcoming videos we'll
discuss unit as end-to-end test and all
the different options that we can use
with angular CLI when executing unit and
end-to-end tests thank you for listening
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
