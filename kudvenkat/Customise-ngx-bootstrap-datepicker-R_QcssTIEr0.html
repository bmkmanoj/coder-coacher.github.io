tutorial in this video well discuss
customizing the anti x bootstrap
datepicker component this is
continuation to part 11 so please watch
part 11 before proceeding if we take a
look at the project that we've been
working with notice the state of birth
input field on this input field we're
using this directive vs date range
picker so when we click within the date
of birth input field we get a user
interface where we can capture a date
range but this is date of birth so it's
enough if we are able to capture a
single date so instead of using PS date
range pick a directive let's use vs date
picker directive notice now we have a
different interface where we can select
a single date at the moment this date
picker component is using the default
the green theme and that doesn't match
with the rest of our form because our
form is using the dark blue theme so
let's see how to change the theme of
this date picker component so here's
what we want to do we want to customize
our date picker component so it looks
like this with the dark blue theme I am
on the NZXT bootstrap website as you can
see as of this recording there are six
color schemes out of these six we want
to use this color scheme theme dark blue
I will have this link available on my
blog in case you need to refer this
website later to change the color scheme
we have to first import a type and that
type is BS date picker config this is
the configuration object for date picker
using this configuration object we can
set min date max state date format
control whether to show or hide week
numbers change color scheme and several
other things next within our create
employee component class I'm going to
create a property I'm going to call it
date picker config and this is going to
be of type partial vs they'd pick a
config
we'll discuss what this partial does in
just a bit now if we go to the
definition on this BS datepicker config
type we see all the properties it has
and the property that we are interested
in at the moment is this container class
property we want to set this container
class property to our theme dark blue so
within our create employee component
class constructor let's initialize this
date picker config property so this dot
date picker config equals let's actually
collapse the Explorer notice here we are
using the object assign method this
method is very useful for copying
property values from one or more source
of X to a destination object the first
parameter right here is the destination
object and it can have many sources in
our case we only have one source and we
want to copy this property container
class and its value to this destination
object and we want to assign that as the
value for this date picker conflict
property which is defined right here and
notice it is defined as partial BS date
picker config so if we look at this BS
date picker config
it has got several properties but we
don't want to set all these properties
we only want to set contain a class
property because we want to change the
color scheme and that's what we are
doing here we want to change the color
scheme to team dark blue since we don't
want to set all the properties of this
BS date picker conflict type we have
defined it as partial now if you want to
learn more about this partial type in
typescript visit this URL right here
I'll have this link available on my blog
in case you need it finally we need to
bind to this date picker convict
property this property has the
configuration for our date picker
component so let's copy the property
name and then within the view template
let's use BS config since we are
property binding we use square brackets
and we want to bind to our date bit of
conflict property notice now the date
picker component is using the dark blue
team
and this matches with the rest of the
form using the date picker configuration
object we can control several things for
example we can show or hide week numbers
now if you look at the date picker
config object notice it has got this
property show week numbers it's a
boolean property meaning we set it to
true or false and by default it is set
to true so if we take a look at the
calendar notice the vehicle numbers are
displayed now if you don't want them to
be displayed all you have to do is set
this property to false within the
configuration object so let's do that
within the typescript file so here along
with the container class property let's
also set show week numbers and let's set
that to false because we don't want the
week numbers to be shown notice now we
don't have week numbers displayed on the
left at the moment we don't have min or
max dates we can also set them using the
configuration object first let's format
this code so it is easy to read now we
want to set min date so let's use min
date property and this is a date type so
I'm going to use the date constructor
and it has got several alerted
constructors I'm going to use this
overloaded version where we can specify
year month and date so let's set min
date to January 1st 2018
now month numbers start at 0 and not 1
so for January it is 0 for February it's
1 so on and so forth and let's start at
January 1st that so a min date and let's
set max date to December 31st let's save
our changes and take a look at the
browser now we should not be able to
select a date before January 1st 2018
notice right here we have 31st of
December 2017 when I click on that I'm
not able to select that and notice when
I try to go to before January 2018 look
at the cursor style it's disabled I
can't move to the previous month because
we have said the minimum date to be
January 1st 2018 and similarly I can go
to February March but if I try to go
beyond December notice here again this
right side arrow is disabled and I can't
go beyond December 2018 because we have
said the max date as December 31st 2018
using this date picker configuration
object we can also configure the date
format at the moment the date format is
month date and then here what we want is
first date then month and then yeah so
to configure the date format we use date
input format and then we specify the
format we want we want first date then
month and then the year so if we save
our changes and take a look at the
browser notice now when we select a date
we have date first then month and then
year as expected at the moment we don't
have a default date meaning when we
reload the page and when the form
initially loads we don't have a default
date what we want to do is set a default
date to set a default date all we have
to do is within our component class
create a property with the name date of
birth and assign add a value which you
want to be the default date notice now
we have January 30 at 2018 as the
default date at the moment this date of
birth input field is panning across the
entire width of the form if you want to
limit it's where you can use the
bootstrap trick classes the first thing
that I'm going to do is wrap this date
of birth dev in another div with the
class row because we want that dev to be
in its own row but we don't want the
stair to span across the entire width of
this row so I'm going to use the
bootstrap grid classes call - MD - 5 so
we want this dev to be only 5 units wide
in this row so if we save our changes
and take a look at the browser we should
have the date of birth input field only
5 units wide right here if you want it
slightly longer then use probably call
MD 6 or empty 7 if
you want to reduce its width probably
use call m.d. for md80 but discussed
these bootstrap grid classes in detail
in our bootstrap tutorial so if you're
new to bootstrap please check out our
bootstrap tutorial by default the date
picker control is placed below the date
of birth input field now if you want to
control the placement we use the
placement property so for example let's
say we want the date picker control on
the right hand side we set the placement
property to right if you want it on the
left hand side you set it to left so
let's save our changes notice now the
date picker is placed on the right hand
side so on the slide we have the code
that we have just discussed so using the
date picker config object we can
configure several things like min late
max date date format etc and on this URL
right here we can see all the config
object properties
I'll have this link available on my blog
