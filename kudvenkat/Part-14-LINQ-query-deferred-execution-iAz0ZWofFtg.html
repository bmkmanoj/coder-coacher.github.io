this video we'll discuss the concepts of
deferred and immediate execution in
length as far as the link standard query
operators are concerned based on their
execution behavior we can broadly divide
them into two categories deferred or
lazy operatives immediate or greedy
operators deferred operators use
deferred execution immediate operators
use immediate execution examples of
deferred operators include select where
take skip etc examples of immediate
operators include count average min max
to list etc let's now look at a few
examples let's flip to visual studio so
here I have a new console application
all I have done so far is created the
student class with these three
properties and within the main method we
are creating a student list this student
list at the moment contains two students
who have got total marks of 800 now what
we want to do is retrieve all those
students who have got total marks of 800
and then print them on the console
screen so I enumerable of student let's
call the variable results so this
variable is going to hold the result so
let's write over link Varina so from
student n our list of students where
student dot total marks equals 800 we
want to select such student all right
next let's use it for each loop so for
each student let's say s in our result
and let's actually print out a start
student ID and then a tab space and then
student name and then again a tab space
and then student total marks
all right so let's go ahead and run this
and see if we get the output the PX back
so notice that we have caught the two
students I've got total marks of 800 now
where do you think this query is
actually executed so we are defining the
query right here and then right here we
are iterating through the result right
so is the query executed here where it
is defined or here where we are actually
iterating through the result right the
query actually gets executed here when
we iterate through the sequence right
let's actually prove that to prove that
after the fact that we have defined our
query let's go ahead and add a new
student object to the list so new
student and let's give a student ID of
1:04 and then let's set his name to 10
and then let's give him total marks of
800 all right now if the query is
executed right here where it is defined
then Tim should not be included in the
result let's actually run this and see
what's going to happen look at that now
we also have Tim's record there which
means this query this link query is
actually executed when we are actually
iterating through the sequence right
it's not executed where it is defined so
this is called as deferred execution and
recollect from the slide you know
examples of deferred operators include
select where etc so here select and
where they are deferred operators so
this query which is using you know all
deferred operators is going to make use
of deferred execution which means the
query will not be executed the place
where it is defined
instead when we actually iterate through
the result sequence that's when the
query is executed now let's see how to
act
we force this query to execute
immediately and that is called as
immediate execution and if you look at
one of the operators which caused our
query to be executed immediately is to
list so let's try to convert you know
whatever result that we are going to get
into a list so we are using two lists
here which is a greedy operator or
immediate operator this will force this
query to execute at the place where it
is defined so when we actually run this
now it should not include Tim's record
because this query is actually executed
and then after that we are adding a new
student with total marks of 800 to the
source that's why this result is not
going to include Tim's record so let's
run this and notice that we only have
Tom and Pam we don't have a Tim record
so here we are using immediate execution
because this operator to list is an
immediate operator now another example
is count now if we want to get the total
elements then we use the count operator
which is another example of a greedy or
immediate operator and this count is
going to return as an integer that is
the total number of elements within that
sequence and all we want to do is print
total number of students so let's go
ahead and print that to the console so
total equals result now again this is an
immediate operator which is going to
force this link query to execute right
away
which means though Tim has got word
marks of 800 he will not be included in
the count so when we run this now we
should see the count as two so that's
the example for different execution
which we have just discussed this is the
first example for immediate execution
way we have used to list operator and
this is the other example where we have
used the count operator
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
