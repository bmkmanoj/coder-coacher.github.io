tricks in this video we'll discuss how
to remove unused usings well performance
be an issue if there are unused usings
and the benefits of removing unused
musings let's understand removing unused
usings with an example here I've got a
simple console application within the
main method notice that we are making
use of two types that is string builder
and console class string builder is
present in system dot text namespace
console class is present in system
namespace but if you look at using
declarations right here we have lot more
than we actually need we only need two
namespaces on this code file one is
system namespace and the other one is
system dot text namespace all the other
using declarations are not used on this
page so how to get rid of these unused
using declarations the obvious choice
that comes to our mind is to manually
delete them now deleting these unused
namespaces manually is it possible in a
real-time application maybe not why
because there could be hundreds of lines
of code within a given CS file and it
may not be practically possible and
feasible in terms of time to go through
each type and then determine which
namespace that I belong to and then make
a decision of whether to leave that
namespace there or to remove it ok so
that's why Visual Studio provides us
with an option to remove these unused
namespaces so simply right-click
anywhere on the code file you have this
choice organized usings within the
context menu once you have the mouse
over notice that you get three choices
here when you select remove unused
usings it's going to remove all those
unused usings look at that it only left
these two system and system text
namespaces which we are actually using
on this code file let's press ctrl Z to
undo those changes and then inspect the
other choices that we have so the other
choice is to simply sort the using
statements so when we select this choice
look at that the using declarations are
sorted in ascending order and the final
choice is obviously to remove the N
used using statements and then sort the
rest of them okay so that's how we
remove the unused using declarations if
you prefer to use keyboard shortcut to
bring up the context menu it is shift
f10 that's actually undo the changes so
now when you press shift f10 that's
going to bring up the context menu and
notice that the organized using option
within this context menu within that
letter o is underlined meaning the
keyboard shortcut to select that menu
item is letter O so when I type letter O
that choice gets highlighted and then if
you want to select remove unused usings
then its letter R so when I press letter
R look at that it gets removed so the
keyboard shortcut is shift f10 or R now
we'll performance be an issue if there
are unused using snow there won't be any
impact on the actual application
performance the unused usings will
simply be ignored but what are the
benefits of removing and used using
staff view now the obvious one is
cleaner code so now we have a few
namespaces here that we are actually
using within our code file which means
your code is easy to read and maintain
intellisense runs faster as there are
less items to look through let's
actually undo these changes so we have
you know several namespaces here and now
look at this for example when i type str
there are you know a lot of items loaded
which starts with str for example stream
reader stream writer so stream reader if
you look at the name space it belongs to
system dot io why is intelligent loading
that here because we have that using
declaration right here okay and then
string class is present in system
namespace so we have system namespace
here that's why it's also loaded string
builder is present in system dot text
namespace so we have that using
declaration here that's why it's loaded
as well let's actually comment this
using system dot io now if we bring up
intellisense by pressing control space
notice that stream reader and
streamwriter are not loaded now okay so
removing unused usings will make
intellisense run faster because there
are only you know there are less items
to look through and load them this also
means the developer has few options to
select from and obviously will also get
faster compilation because the compiler
has fewer namespaces to look look up
types to resolve and it's it also avoids
name collision in the future when new
types are added to the unused namespaces
that have the same name as some type in
the used namespace so what do we mean by
that let's say for example at the moment
we are using system dot text namespace
and we are using string builder clause
from that namespace now if you look at
system dot security for example you know
they're not using any class that belong
to system got security namespace now
let's say in the future
Microsoft decides it wants to use a
class within system dot security you
know with the same name as string
builder now since this namespace and
this namespace is present within this
code file and system dot security also
now has a class with the same name that
is string bilder okay now when you build
this in the future after you have
upgraded to the latest version of the
dotnet framework in which they have
introduced string builder within session
or security namespace when you build the
solution obviously you are going to get
a compilation error and why is that
because there is an ambiguity on this
type so to which namespace this type
actually belong to do you intend to use
the string builder class that's present
in system or text namespace or system
got security namespace okay so if you
don't have this using statement here you
will not have that name collision okay
so removing unused namespaces may avoid
name collisions in the future as well
okay so those are the benefits of
removing unused usings
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
