this video we'll discuss how to make a
get request using jQuery AJAX get
function and the difference between
jQuery ket and load functions this is
continuation to part 55 so please watch
part 55 before proceeding this video
this is the same example that we worked
with in the previous video session when
any of these fields receives focus the
help text associated with that field is
displayed in the development at the
moment to achieve this by using the
jQuery load function notice this
function has got two parameters at the
moment the first parameter specifies the
URL to which we want to send the request
and the second parameter specifies the
data that we want to send to the server
now let's see how to rewrite this using
jQuery yet function let's flip to chat
studio so this is the same code that we
worked with in the previous video
session to keep things simple I'm going
to remove this callback function for the
time bein so notice at the moment we're
using load function here and this load
function is being called on a selector
so with load function we first specify a
selector and on that we call the load
function whenever we get a response from
the server that response is then
inserted into the elements that match
this selector in this case this selector
is matching you know the development
that's displayed next to the field that
receives the focus so whatever response
we get back the development is updated
with that response automatically with
get function we don't specify any
selector first right so here load is
being called on a selector but with GATT
we don't specify any selector so I'm
going to actually make a copy of that so
let's copy that selector from there and
I'm going to delete that and instead of
load I'm going to use get and if you
look at this gate function notice that
it has got four parameters the first
three parameters are similar to load
function URL specifies the URL to which
we want to send the request data
parameter specifies the data that we
want to send to the server
callback parameter specifies a function
that gets executed of the request
completes and the type parameter
specifies the type of data that we are
expecting from the server we'll talk
about this type parameter in our next
video session in detail for now let's
use just the first three parameters so
at the moment here we are specifying the
URL specifying the data that we want to
send to the server and now I am going to
specify the callback function so this is
the function that gets called when the
request completes now when the request
completes we are expecting some data
from the server and this parameter is
going to receive that data so once we
have that data we want to update the
develoment
right so we need a selector to find the
development so I'm going to paste the
selector that we had before so this will
find the development that is present
next to the element that has received
focus and then I'm going to use the HTML
function and then pass the response to
that function all right so here we using
the get function instead of a load
function so let's save the changes let's
go ahead and reload this page and see if
this continues to work in the same way
look at this when any of these fields
receive focus we still get the help text
associated with that feel alright so
they've used get function to achieve the
same thing so what is the difference
between jQuery load and get functions
jQuery load function can be used to load
only the HTML data from the server
whereas jQuery get function can be used
to load any type of data be it XML JSON
script or HTML in fact in our next video
we'll look at an example of retrieving
JSON data from the server jQuery load
function may issue a get a post request
depending on whether the data parameter
is specified or not so if we look at
this code snippet right here we are
specifying the data parameter the data
that we want to send to the server so in
this case this load function is going to
use post method if we don't specify the
data parameter then it is going to use
ket method but if you look at this get
function as the name implies this
function is always going to issue a get
request with the load function we
specify a selector first we have seen
that just now the HTML content retrieved
from the server is automatically
inserted into the Dom element that
matches the selector we have specified
with get function we do not specify any
selector first instead we will make use
of this callback function to insert the
data received from the server
into the Dom element right and to call
the get function we use the jQuery
object thank you for listening and have
a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
