venket this is part 93 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll discuss
about locking user accounts I strongly
suggest to watch parts 1991 and 92
before proceeding with the session in
this video we'll discuss about locking
or disabling user accounts after
repeated in valley that hints to login
for example if a user enters wrong
username and password
he will be given another three chances
to enter the correct password after the
three chances are elapsed the account
will be locked after the account is
locked the user will not be able to
login even if he provides the correct
username and password in fact most of
the banking applications does this for
security reasons let's look at that in
action let's flip to visual studio
actually to support this functionality
we need to change the structure of TBL
users table now if you look at this
table at the moment it has got username
password and email columns only but then
if we want to support the functionality
then we need to have additional columns
like retry at MCS locked and locked it
in time so if you look at retry attempts
this is of type integer so we want to
track the number of attempts the user
has you know made to log into the system
and then each lock whether the account
is locked or not this is a bit data type
which is basically going to store 0 or 1
it will stew 1 if the account is locked
otherwise it will be either 0 or now and
if the account is locked what is the
date and time that the account is locked
so we need to store these 3 pieces of
information as well so I need these
three columns ok but at the moment the
table has these three columns so the
best way is to drop this table and
recreate it so I'm going to drop this
table so refresh that I have TBL users
there to drop it select delete click ok
so we got rid of that TBL user's table
that may go ahead and recreate this
table using the script here so command
completed successfully refresh the table
so we have the table there select star
from TBL users ok so we got the new
columns now since we have changed the
structure of the table registration page
will break so if I try to register any
and a new user for example test let me
fill in all the required details and
then when I click the register button I
get a runtime error look at that column
name a number of supplied values does
not match table definition so what that
means is the stevia user table has got
so many columns now but the number of
values that you have supplied does not
match you know with the number of
columns that we have that's the error
that we see here so to correct this you
know this page actually calls SP
register users to a procedure
okay so let's correct that stored
procedure and to get the definition of
the stored procedure the easiest way is
to use the system stored procedure SP
underscore help text drag-and-drop the
name of this stored procedure get rid of
that DB or dot select everything press
f5 that should give you the text of the
stored procedure so let's paste it here
and the line that causes the problem is
this line so this table now TBL users
has got more than three columns okay so
but if you look at this table these
retry attempts is locked and lock the
date and time all these are nullable
columns okay so it's okay if you don't
supply values for them when you insert a
new row at that point the value will be
now okay but then if you're only you
know inserting values for specific
number of columns then in your insert
statement you need to specify the column
list so let's go ahead and specify the
column list so these values that we are
passing in here are the values for
username column password column and
email column so let's alter the stored
procedure okay so that should fake fix
the registration page so let me enter
the details again and click register so
I am able to register now let's go back
close this window and select the records
from TBL users table so I have this
record here but look at retry Adams is
locked and locked it in time those are
not because we haven't supplied the
values for them when we are registering
the user and it doesn't make sense to
supply values at the time of
registration
okay cool so to support our
functionality the next thing that we
have to do is we have to write a stored
procedure which will authenticate the
user if they supply the correct username
and password but then if they enter an
invalid username or wrong password then
we need to increment retie it attempts
if he enters the wrong password for more
than three times we want to lock the
account along with the date and time
that the account is locked so we need to
write a stored procedure to do that now
I already have a stored procedure to do
that and if you look at that it's a
little lengthy stored procedure but it's
not really difficult to understand that
if you have followed the sequence of a
video series that we have discussed we
have discussed about how to use you know
how to basically write stored procedures
and and things like that so please refer
to sequel server video tutorial if
you're new to stored procedures okay so
here already we have authenticate users
stored procedure that we have created in
the previous session of this video
series now we need to change that
because we want some additional
functionality now okay so obviously
authenticate user if we want to
authenticate user we need to pass it two
pieces of information the username and
password which are which are being
passed in as input parameters to the
stored procedure and then within the
body of the stored procedure there's
quite a bit of code but it's very easy
to understand so here we have three
local variables that we have declared
within the stored procedure to keep
track of some of the things that we are
going to calculate okay so this account
lock to variable look at that the first
thing that I have to do whenever
somebody passes a username and password
to this stored procedure if the account
is already locked we will not even
bother you know compare you know
checking if there is a match for that
username and password because if the
account is locked the account is locked
he cannot do anything the only thing
that he can do is get his account unlock
how to get the account unlock we'll
discuss about that in the next video
session so the first thing I am checking
here is into this variable I am getting
the value of each lock for the given
username okay so if the account is
locked if the value is one that's a bit
data type so if the account is law
then that will be equal to one if that's
the case I am selecting one as look at
that every time we return something that
goes to the dotnet application or the
caller in this format is the account
locked is the user authenticated
how many retry attempts has he elapsed
okay
so these three columns will be sent back
to the application and then the
application will compute what to do
depending on the values of these columns
okay so if it comes inside this if the
account is locked we will give that
output that's it the stored procedure
ends there okay on the other hand if the
account is not locked that's when it
comes to this else block okay so if the
account is not locked then we need to
take that username and password and see
if there is a match and how are we doing
that we are getting the count of the
username from TBL users you know where
username is equal to whatever username
we are passing in and whatever password
we are passing and we are comparing that
with the username and password list that
we have in TBL users okay if there is a
match this variable will be one so if
that variable is one we know that a
match is found so if we have found the
match then what we need to do let's say
you know look at the update statement
here we are resetting the retry attempts
to zero now let's say I entered the
wrong password the first time but next
time the second time if I enter the
correct password then I reset that retry
attempt to zero okay and then next what
we do so I entered a correct username
and password now I I return this output
back to the user the account is not
locked the user is authenticated retry
Adams obviously zero okay but on the
other hand look at that if the match is
not found then what we have to do here a
bit of work that we have to do okay we
need to get the retry count okay so here
we are using is null function again
where do we use is null function we have
discussed about this in the sequel
server video series use null function if
that column value is null then it
returns a zero okay so
so we are getting the value of three try
atoms okay and then we are incrementing
that by one why because the user has
entered an invalid username and password
so if the user is entering the invalid
username and password for the first time
look at that
first time retry attempts will be null
in the table right so it will be null in
the table if it is null and if the user
has entered the I mean if the user has
entered invalid or wrong password for
the first time then it will return 0 the
seasonal function will return 0 and to 0
we are adding 1 ok and then if the retry
count is less than or equal to 3 then
what we are doing we are updating this
user table with that value and retry
count okay and then what we are doing we
are returning this message back to the
user so if it is the first time he is he
entered the wrong password retry count
will be 1 if it's the second time look
it will be 2 but look at the account
locked it is 0 the count is not locked
yet the user is not authenticated yet
it's zero but the retry count will be 1
2 or 3 depending on you know which of
the atoms here I'm making use of okay on
the other hand look at that here the
match is not found okay and then if the
retry count is is less than or equal to
3 we keep on updating the table and then
we return the retry count limit to the
caller okay but on the other hand if the
retry count is greater than 3 then what
we want to do we want to lock the
account immediately so we are setting
each locked is equal to 1 on that TBL
user table and not only that we are also
updating the retry attempts and we are
also updating the locked date and time
variable to the current date and time we
are using get date sequence of a
function to do that and finally what we
are doing we are selecting 1 as account
locked and retry atoms doesn't really
make any sense because we are just
locking that count so we don't I mean we
don't really want to make you
free try atoms in the dotnet application
so it's a pretty simple stored procedure
it's just the logic that makes it a
little complex
I'll have this stored procedure you know
paste it on my blog and I'll have the
link to my blog in the description of
this video if you want to refer to that
a little while later okay so that's the
stored procedure that we want to you
know change the ESP authenticate users
stored procedures should be change it to
this so let me go ahead and alter that
so press f5 so that root procedure
should have been updated now what what
is left out we need to invoke the stored
procedure within the dotnet application
so within the dotnet replication if you
have been following along this video
series in the login button click we are
invoking this authenticate user method
so this function now needs to support
you know needs to invoke that stored
procedure and then depending on what the
stored procedure is returning back we
need to display the appropriate error
message to the end user ok so again I
have you know typed this method just to
save some time again most of it here is
going to be the ad or net code now the
first thing to notice here is I have
changed the return type of this method
from boolean to void so now this method
is going to do everything redirecting
from the redirecting the user from the
login page and displaying appropriate
error messages so obviously the first
line here is reading the connection
string from web block convey power
creating the signal connection object
creating the sequel command specifying
the command type is stored procedure
obviously we want to encrypt and then
send the password to the database for
comparison and we are using sha-1 that's
the hashing algorithm and then we are
creating the to sequel parameter objects
adding the parameters to the command
object open the connection executing the
reader ok now why are we using execute
reader here because we are going to get
a row of data it's not a scalar value
it's going to be a row of data so I'm
using execute scalar and obviously while
RDL dot read now
all this is basic simple straightforward
ad or dotnet code if you haven't watch
the video series on ad or dotnet I would
strongly encourage you to do so before
you know continuing with the session
all right so we are looping through the
reader object and look at that I'm
getting the retry attempts from the
reader object okay so if you look at
what we are getting back we are getting
three columns back and those three
columns appear like this account locked
authenticated retry items those are the
column names so what are we doing here
retry attempts we are converting that to
integer and then look at this if the
first thing that we need to check is if
the account is locked there's nothing we
can do
we just display that message in the
label control so label message door text
is equal to account lock please contact
administrator okay on the other hand if
that's not the case if the account is
not locked if it is not true then we are
coming to retry attempts okay and we are
already retrieving retry items if retry
Adams is greater than zero then what we
are doing let's say we want to allow
four chances including the first time so
from four we are subtracting the retry
attempts okay so that will give us the
attempts left and in the message we are
displaying them in the label we are
displaying a message invalid username
and a password and to that we are
concatenated attempts left you know if
it's 1 it will be 1 if it's 2 it will be
2 and then we you know this string is
being appended to that number there and
displaying that in the label control ok
on the other hand if if retry attempts
count is 0 that means there is no impact
on retry attempts so we come and check
whether if the user is authenticated if
the user is authenticated you know if
that value is true then we are
redirecting the user from the login page
okay and this is again the same as we
have done in the previous session
finally if that's not true then we are
just displaying this message invalid
username and password okay actually that
covers this you know this is just just
in case if nothing matches up you know
just as a safe blocker ok so let's go
ahead and run this with this change but
before that we need to change the call
in the login button click so within the
login button click now it's not an if
condition
I don't even have to have this I can
just call this method there that's it
actually in this okay we need to pass
the values where are the username and
password coming from those are coming
from the respect to text boxes so dxd
password okay so that should solve that
actually in this authenticate user
method we don't really require the cells
block because we are already comparing
you know if we try Adams is greater than
zero we're actually specifying that
message here invalid and username
password so I can get rid of this else
block here and now let's go ahead and
run this so we already have a test user
with um you know test test password
let's try and enter test as the user
name and I'm entering an invalid
password intentionally a click login
look at that invalid username and
password three attempts left let's look
at the database table that should have
been updated as well so select star from
TBL users so now retry Adams look at
that I I collapsed one of my attempt
okay let me try that again an invalid
password I click login look at that two
atoms left and now I select that so
retry attempts I have used two of the
atoms to login and look at the East
locked and locked date and time they are
still now now let's say I enter the
correct username and password I click
login so I am redirected to the login
page so after two atoms if I enter the
correct username and password the retry
attempt should come back to zero so let
me execute that so retry Adams to zero
he's locked in lock date and time are
the same so let's go back and try you
know maybe three times so test I enter
the correct password let me enter the
wrong password click in login look at
that three attempts left and another
wrong password and another wrong
password another wrong password look at
that
count locked please contact
administrator so now I come here select
star from TBL user I used my four
attempts the account is locked
that's the date and time the account is
loved in the next video session we'll
discuss about what are the options that
are available to unlock the locked user
account on this slide you can find
