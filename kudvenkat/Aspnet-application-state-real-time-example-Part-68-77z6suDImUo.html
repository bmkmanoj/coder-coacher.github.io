venket this is part 68 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll discuss
about a real time example where we can
use application state variables before
continuing with the session I strongly
recommend to watch about 65 66 and 67 of
this video series
now application state variables are
global and all sessions have access to
them so these variables can be used to
track the number of users online you
might have seen many applications where
you know when you log in they show a
message is showing you know stating
number of users online at this time is
so many you know let's see how to
exactly do the same thing using
application state variables okay let's
flip to visual studio now the first
thing that we have to know is you know
whenever a new session starts in the
sense whenever a new user locks into our
application or connects to to our
application we have to detect that and
how do we detect that in global dot a si
X file
we have application level events and
then among those events you know we have
something called session underscore
start so this is the event handler for
session start whenever a new user
connects to your application and new
session ID is assigned to that user so
that's when the session start event is
fired and we have the event handler here
so this event handler can be used to tap
into that event so every time this event
happens we increase the number of users
on line by one okay and then similarly
whenever the session expires you know we
have session underscore end event this
gets fired ok the user session can end
for two reasons one they might have
logged out or number two you know
basically they have their session has
expired they might be inactive for the
session timeout we know that we have we
can specify the time mode for the
session in web dot config file the
default is 20 minutes so when this time
is read and you know the if the user is
inactive for that duration the session
will be automatically timed out so
that's when a session can end and when
the session ends this event is going to
be fired and in this event handler will
decrement the number of users online by
one and application we are going to use
application state variable so obviously
every session can modify those variables
okay and then you can use that
application variable in any of the
waveforms within your application let's
say for example whenever you know them
perform one loads I want to retrieve
find out how many users are online I can
just retrieve that variable value from
application state okay so let's see how
to do that so let's go to global dot ASX
within global dot ASX the first thing I
have to do is I have to initialize the
application state variable so where do I
do that we can do that in application
start event so when this application
start even gets fired now if your
application is not already running
obviously your applications will not
have any users so when the first request
comes you know that's when the
applications assembly will be loaded
into the memory you know and then the
application starts up that's when the
application starting vent is fired so
when the application starts up I want to
create an application level variable so
application I'm going to call this users
online okay and I'm going to initialize
that to zero okay so this will be
executed only once the first time your
application starts and this variable is
going to stay in the web server memory
until the worker process restarts the
process that's hosting the application
restarts okay
now whenever a session starts I want to
increment this value by one okay and to
do that you can simply increment that
value by one so application of users
online is equal to applications of users
online plus one but then application of
users online you can store anything into
an application variable so when you try
to retrieve you know a value out of it
it's going to return that as an object
we need to convert that to an integer we
know that application of users online
will have an integer in that and number
in that so it's safe to typecast a to
integer okay but then the important
thing to keep in mind here is you have
to synchronize you know thread access
because asp.net web applications work in
a multi-threaded environment which means
you know multiple threads can try to
modify this variable at a given point of
time so we want to ensure only one
thread can change this value at any
point of time and how do we do that
application level application object
I know exposes a method called log so
when when I when a thread calls this
method on that object then only one
thread can enter this piece of code here
and modify this variable if there are
multiple requests coming in at the same
time you know this method is going to
ensure that only one thread can enter
change this value and then once that
thread calls the unlock method that's
when you know another thread can get
inside and change the value there so to
synchronize thread access make sure we
call application dot lock and
application on log in between the code
you know goes where only one thread can
modify that piece of code ok and along
the same lines let's copy that and
whenever the session ends ok we want to
decrement the value by one so
application that log users online is
equal to int of users on line and I'm
going to decrement that by one that's it
we are done so every time a user
connects this piece of code gets
executed so that Inc that gets
incremented by one and whenever it is
decremented whenever the session ends it
gets decremented by one and now I can
retrieve this variable anywhere within
my application let's say for example
when web form one dot aspx loads I want
to you know display a message let's say
response dot right number of users on
line is equal to' and then we can say
application of users on line and I can
convert that to string that's it ok now
let's go ahead and run this so when I
first run this application underscore
start events get fired in which case you
know the application of users on line
that variable will be initialized to
zero
and then the session start even gets
fired value increment by one and in
webform we are trying to retrieve that
value and display it so that's one now
if I copy that open another browser
window and paste that here now look at
this it still says number of users
online is equal to one and this is a
different browser vendor you know no
matter how many browser vendors you open
here what's going to happen is since the
browser the multiple browser instances
share the session ID we have the session
cookie so the session cookie is now
shared by these browser windows and the
same session ID is sent to the server so
the server thinks okay it says it's part
of the same session that's why it's not
incrementing the value by one okay so
just to make the web server think we are
coming from a different session what we
basically can do is in web config file
let's set the cookie less mode to true
so we are telling it to use cookie net
sessions so we can change the session ID
in the URL okay so let me go ahead and
run this once again so when the page
loads now you should see that you know
the number of you online users cookie
less is equal to true so we have an
error there let's set it properly so in
web config file it should be true okay
let's run that now so we set the cookie
less attribute to true so we get that
session ID there okay now if I copy the
URL as it is open another browser window
and then paste that see that's the same
session ID so I'm not changing that now
I hit enter it says number of users
online is equal to one but then what I'm
going to do I'm going to open another
browser window and I'm going to paste
that but this time I'm going to delete
that session ID okay so if you look at
that I just have localhost the name of
the project and then waveform one when
the request goes to the server it it
seized URL okay there is no session ID
in the URL which means it thinks that
this request is coming from another user
and it's going to assign a session ID so
session start event will be fired and
then the session value will be
incremented so when I
let's look at that number of users
online is too because there is another
session ID so now if i refresh this
since the application state variable is
modified by this user you know now that
is going to get incremented by two and
the same is the case with this window
okay now if I open another window let's
copy this and let's change the session
ID once again
so number of users online is three
showing two here but if you refresh that
that should become three and same is the
case with the other windows because
application state variables are shared
by all sessions you know they're going
to reflect that change okay so we can
use application state variables
basically to track the number of users
online okay so let's refresh that and it
should change that as well number of
users online now we haven't seen how the
value gets decremented basically for
that the session should and if you look
at in web config currently the session
timeout is 20 minutes which is the
default one but if you are following
along with me to experience the session
timeout event what you can do is
basically set this to two or three
minutes
fire up the browser multiple browsers
like this and then you know if maybe
this process and active for that timeout
value the session and event will be
fired at that point the application of
online users will be decremented by one
you can see that value going up and down
depending on whether new sessions are
established or if the existing sessions
have expired so basically we can use
application state variables you know to
to track the number of users online so
every time a new user connects to your
application we want to increase the
number of users by online by one along
the same lines when the new it's when a
whenever it's a user session ends then
we need to decrease the number of users
online by one and we have seen how to do
that we have made use of session
underscore start and session underscore
end the events and by default the
browser instances shade the session
cookie to have a new session ID assigned
when a new browser instance requests the
web form set cookie-less is equal to
true for this
session state element in web.config and
we have seen how to do that and then
change the session ID in the URL so that
the web server thinks the request is
coming from a different user and a new
session ID gets assigned in that process
the sessions that event is fired so that
the value get incremented by one on this
