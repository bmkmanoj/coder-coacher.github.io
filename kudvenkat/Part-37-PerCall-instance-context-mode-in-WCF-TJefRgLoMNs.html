this video we'll discuss pair call
instance context mode in WCF with an
example this is continuation to part 36
so please watch but 36 before proceeding
when the instance context mode for a WCF
service is set to pair call and new
instance of the WCF service object is
created for every request irrespective
of whether that request came from the
same client or from a different client
let's prove this with an example let's
flip to visual studio let's create a new
project we want to create a class
library project and let's call this
simple service let's delete this class
one dot C is file that's generated we
want to add a WC of service to this
project and let's call this WCF service
simple service so within this service
contract let's actually change the name
of this operation contract to increment
number and we want this method to return
an integer alright and within the
implementation file let's actually
implement the interface method so within
this class within the service we are
going to have a private variable of type
integer and let's call it number and all
this method is going to do is increment
number by one so number equals number
plus one and then it's going to return
that number very simple service here now
let's lose this WCF service using the
console application so let's add a
console application to the solution and
let's name it host
now we need to add a reference to this
simple service and system dot service
model assembly so let's go and do that
so add a reference to simple service
project and a reference to system dot
service model assembly we need to add
you know the application configuration
file as well so add a new item
application configuration file that
should add app dot config file now we
need to specify here the configuration
to us the WCF service to speed things up
I have already typed the required
configuration so let's copy and paste it
right here and this configuration we
have discussed this in detail in the
previous sessions of this video series
so if you need explanation preach please
watch those videos so here we are
basically using net PCP binding you know
to make the service available alright so
this is the address for metadata
exchange and this is where the service
is available all right now within
program dot CS file we need to write
code to host the WCF service and again
to speed things up I have that code
already typed so let's copy and paste it
right there we need to bring in system
dot service model assembly
I mean namespace alright again we
discuss this code in the previous
sessions of this video series so if you
need explanation please watch those
videos so at this point we need to set
our hosts project as they start a
project so set and start a project and
let's run this by pressing ctrl f5 so at
this point we have our WCF service up
and running now let's create a client
for this WCF service so let's flip to
another instance of visual studio let's
create a new project and this time we
want to create a console application and
let's call this client
so we need to add a reference to the WCF
service so select add service reference
option and give the address you know the
meta data exchange address
localhost:8080
and click go so this should discover our
simple service let's give the namespace
as simple service click OK alright so at
this point we have the proxy classes
generated so let's go ahead and create
an instance of our simple service client
let's call it client equals new simple
service client and we want to invoke
increment number method and if you look
at this method it's returning an integer
so let's store that returned value in a
variable of type integer and all we are
going to do here is print that number
out on the console so let's say number
after first call equals the value okay
now let's go ahead and invoke you know
the function again okay and this time
let's go ahead and print the value again
and let's say number after second call
let's actually call it once more and
then print the value again so number
after third call okay now before we
actually execute this piece of code
let's actually stop you know the host
that is running so here within the WCF
service we haven't explicitly set the
instance context mode let's actually go
ahead and set the instance context mode
and how do we do that by using service
behavior attribute we discussed this in
our previous video session so service
behavior attribute and it has got this
named parameter called instance context
more and let's set that to per call
alright now let's actually go ahead and
run our hosts
so the host is running now let's go
ahead and run the client but before we
do that let's actually update our
service reference all right now let's go
ahead and run the client and let's see
what output we get look at that you know
number of the first call equals one
second call equals one third call equals
one so you know the number is not
getting incremented so why is that what
is the reason behind that what is
actually happening behind the scenes
because if you look at the WCF service
code here you know every time we are
trying to increment the value by one so
why is the value always one that's
because if you recollect what per call
means you know a new instance of this
WCF service object is created for every
request ok so what's happening when we
actually say you know increment number
on the client proxy class you know the
call is forwarded to the WCF service and
what is the WCF service going to do it
is going to create an instance of this
simple service class and then look at
this variable here underscore number
it's an integer variable it's a simple
type so it will be defaulted to its
default value which is 0 and then what
is this method doing it's incrementing 0
by 1 so at the moment number is 1 and
then it's returning that one value back
ok so that happens you know on the first
call
so once the value is returned back to
the client what is going to happen to
the simple service instance you know it
will be immediately destroyed you know
the server doesn't keep track of that
object anymore so the object is
destroyed right away so now when we make
this second call what's going to happen
the same process repeats again an
instance of the simple service is
created this variable is initialized to
0 incremented by 1 and then returned
that one back so every time we call a
new instance of this simple service
object is created on the server
and as a result this number variable is
set to its default value which is zero
incremented by one and then return that
value back okay so that's why we get a
value of one every time no matter how
many requests you issue whether that
call is coming from the same client or
different client line it doesn't really
matter you know as long as you have set
it to per call you know the service
instance get created every time so if
you want to maintain state between calls
then you probably have to store that
state somewhere or you may send it as
another parameter you know within the
method call when you call the function
okay so otherwise the service itself is
not going to maintain state for us if we
use per call instance context mode right
so what are the implications of per call
WCF service now we have better memory
usage and why is that that's because
service objects you know they don't
remain in the memory forever okay they
are freed or destroyed immediately after
the method call returns so the memory is
managed more efficiently there the
server is not holding on to those
objects after servicing clients so
better memory usage and concurrency is
not an issue anymore application
scalability is also much better because
we are not holding on to the resources
so you know as soon as a request is
served you know the object is destroyed
we are not holding onto any resources so
the applications can scale much better
and obviously the downside is that state
is not maintained between calls if you
want to maintain state you will have to
write your own code probably you may
want to save those values into a
database table or a file or you may can
also send it as an additional parameter
but we have to write that code ourselves
and another bottleneck could be
performance because you know there is
overhead involved in reconstructing the
service instance State on each and every
method call so these are the
implications of per call WCF service in
our next video we'll discuss pairs
in takes our instance context mode
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
