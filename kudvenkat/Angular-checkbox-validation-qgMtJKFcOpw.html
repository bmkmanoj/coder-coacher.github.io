tutorial in this video well discuss
checkbox validation in angular with an
example so here is what we want to do we
want to make this is active checkbox a
required field if we don't have this
checkbox checked then we want to display
this required validation error message
as soon as the checkbox is checked
the validation error message should
disappear notice we have our easy active
checkbox just below the gender radio
buttons validating a checkbox is very
similar to validating radio buttons and
text boxes we discussed validating text
boxes and radio buttons in our previous
videos in this series so let's look at
the steps required to make this easy
active checkbox a required field here is
our easy active checkbox HTML the first
thing that we need to do to make this
field a required field is to include the
required validation attribute next we
need to get a handle to this checkbox so
we can check whether if it has passed or
failed required validation to get the
handle we typically create a template
reference variable by exporting the ng
model director notice we have named our
template reference variable is active
now we can use this template reference
variable to check if the es active
checkbox is touched and if it is invalid
then add this has error Clause for
styling the element if there is a
validation error notice this is active
static text this text is displayed next
to the check box and we want to turn it
to red if there is a validation error
and this is the label that displays the
text so to turn it to red when there is
a validation error we use another
bootstrap class and that is the control
label class finally let's include a span
element that displays the required
validation error notice the ng if
structural directly right here again we
are using our template reference
variable is active to dynamically add
the span element to the Dom depending on
whether we have this required a
validation error or not so let's see
what changes and then take a look at the
browser now let's say the
focus on the gender field and then press
the tab key notice the focus is on the
ease active feel now if we leave the
field without checking the checkbox we
get the validation error if I check the
checkbox the validation error disappears
if I uncheck it we see the validation
error now this is not the behavior we
warned we are using this is active
checkbox to determine whether an
employee is an active employee or
terminated or a design employee if the
employee is resigned or terminated then
we don't want this checkbox to be
checked but when I do that we are
getting this validation error and that's
not the behavior we want notice the Save
button it is disabled because the form
is invalid now let's make the rest of
the fields on the form valid let's
provide a name and let's select the
contact preferences form notice now when
I make the checkbox valid the Save
button is enabled now and we can submit
the form but when I uncheck it we see
the validation error and the Save button
is disabled once again this
implementation of checkbox validation is
useful when you want to force the user
to select a checkbox before proceeding
for example on many websites you might
see a check box with tags I agree to the
terms and conditions only when we check
that checkbox the Save button or install
button whatever that is will be enabled
if we uncheck the check box then the
button will be disabled so in situations
like that where we want to force the
user to agree to the terms before they
can proceed this implementation of
checkbox validation is useful but in our
case this is not working as expected
what if the employee is terminated or
resigned we want to keep this checkbox
unchecked and then be able to save the
form but at the moment you are not able
to do that because this required
validation is preventing us now one
thought that might come to us is why
don't we add the required validator
conditionally by binding it to a boolean
expression
let's wrap the required attribute in a
pair
of square brackets and then bind it to
this boolean expression if the exact
property on the employee object is null
then add the required attribute
otherwise remove it notice this is
active property its value at the moment
is now and look at this condition one
more time if the property value is now
then add this required attribute so at
the moment on this either active
checkbox we have the required attribute
so if that field receives focus and
loses focus without having it check then
we see the validation error and notice
the value for that property is active it
is still now now look what happens when
I check the checkbox when we check the
checkbox the value for this property
changes to true now when the value is
anything other than now then this
boolean expression is going to return
false meaning the required attribute
will be removed from the checkbox so at
the moment we don't have the required
attribute on this checkbox so even when
I uncheck it you're not going to get the
validation error back notice the value
for this property right now it's false
and we are not getting the validation
error because this boolean expression
returns false meaning the required
attribute is now removed so at this
point we should have this here but an
enable but it is still disabled it's
disabled because we don't have the other
fields valid so let's make the rest of
the required fields valid by providing
the appropriate values at this point if
we look at the Save button
notice it is enabled irrespective of the
checkbox is checked or not we have the
Save button enabled but this
implementation of checkbox validation is
confusing now if I want to add an
employee who is not active then I first
have to check the checkbox and then
uncheck it only then the Save button
will be enabled let's actually look at
this in action by reloading the form
once again now let's provide values for
all the required fields except the is
active checkbox notice our Save button
is still disabled that's because at the
moment is active field is
quiet and we haven't provided a value
for that notice the value of this is
active property right here
let's now and look at what happens when
the field receives focus and loses focus
we see the validation error because when
this is active property value is now the
required validator is attached since we
don't have this checkbox checked we get
the validation error and as a result
this a button is disabled now keep in
mind the employee that we are creating
is an employee who is not active meaning
we want to keep this checkbox unchecked
but the required validation is
preventing us from doing that now to be
able to do that I'll have to check this
first when we check this the value of
the property changes from null to true
as you can see right here now when I
unchecked it the value changes to false
and notice this here button is still
disabled so for us to be able to create
an employee who is not active we will
have to check the check box first and
then uncheck it so this is definitely
confusing user interface to make this
less confusing there are two options one
option is to use a pair of radio buttons
instead of a single check box like this
so we use the label is active and then
we'll have two radio buttons yes or no
the second option is to remove the
required validator on this is active
checkbox and then treat null and false
values the same way that is we are
creating an employee who is not active
now when the checkbox is unchecked
we know this is active property can
either be false or now in both the cases
we want to consider that we are creating
an employee who is not active if the
checkbox is checked then this is active
property is true meaning we are creating
an employee who is active I'm going to
go with the second option and remove the
required validation on our check box
here is the code that we just discussed
