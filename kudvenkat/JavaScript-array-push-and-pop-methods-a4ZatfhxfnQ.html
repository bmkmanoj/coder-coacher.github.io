in this video we'll discuss push and pop
methods of the JavaScript array object
first let's look at populating and
retrieving elements from an array using
your for loop and the array index let's
create an array let's name it my array
now let's use a for loop let's
initialize this variable I to 0 I less
than or equal to 5 I plus plus we are
going to use this for loop to initialize
this array so my array of I equals I
into 2 so in this array we are going to
store all even numbers starting from 0
till 10 now let's use another for loop
to retrieve elements from the array and
we want to print all these elements on
the webform so let's use the write
method of the document object and we
want each number to be printed on a
separate line so let's use HTML break
and finally let's alert the length of
the array so now when we run this we
should have all the even numbers
starting from 0 till 10 print it and
look at the length of the array it is 6
now here we're using the array index to
retrieve elements from the array so when
we use array index it simply returns
those elements without removing the
elements from the array that's why the
length is 6 now let's look at push and
pop methods so what is this push method
this method adds new items to the end of
the array this method also changes the
length of the array pop method removes
the last element of an array and returns
that element just like push method this
pop method also changes the length of an
array so to populate an array we can
either use array index or push method
when we use push method it is going to
add the new item
to the end of the array and to retrieve
an item from an array we can either use
array index or pop method pop method
removes the last item of an array and
returns that element whereas when we use
the index it is not going to remove the
element from the array it simply returns
that element let's look at an example of
using this push and pop methods so here
we are using the array index to populate
it with elements instead of that let's
try and use push method now on the first
iteration of this for loop I value will
be 0 0 into 2 will be 0 so 0 will be
added to the end of this array and at
the moment this is an empty array so
that will be the first element within
the array on the second iteration Y
value will be 1 so 1 into 2 will be 2
this number will be added to the end of
the array so 2 will be present after 0
so this process goes on until I value
becomes 5 when I value is 5 5 into 2 is
10 that will be the last element and at
that point this condition will become
false and it will get out of the for
loop so here we are using the push
method to add elements to this array now
in the second for loop we are using the
array index to retrieve the elements
from the array instead of that we can
also use the pop a third so what is this
pop method going to do it will actually
remove the last element and return that
ok
so let's use the pop method here
and finally we are printing the length
of the array so let's run this and see
what output we get notice that first of
all the numbers are printed in reverse
order why is that that's because if you
look at what pop method does it removes
the last element and returns that
element okay now the last element that
is added to this array is 10 so that's
what get returned first and then 8 6 4
goes on until 0 ok and look at the
length of the array it is zero that is
because pop method actually removes the
element from the array and returns that
that's why after printing 0 finally we
are you know printing the length
property so at that point there are no
more elements within the array that's
why the length is 0 now let's look at
two more methods shift and unshift so
first let's look at unchipped method we
know that push method adds new items to
the end of the array now to add new
items to the beginning of an array we
use unchipped method just like push
method unshipped method also changes the
length of an array so let's look at an
example now so let's have two elements
within this array 2 comma 3 now to add
an element to the array we can use push
method so what is this push method going
to do it's going to add an element to
the end of the array so when we pass 4
to this method this element will be
added after element 3 now if I want to
add an element at the beginning of the
array then we use unchipped method my
array dot on shift
now let's say we want to add element 1
and we want that to be the first element
so this will be added before too
now let's print the contents of the
array to the webpage
and let's also print the length of the
array
so now when we run this we should get
one two three four those are the array
elements and the array length is four so
notice that when we use unshifted it is
adding that element to the beginning of
the array and when we use push method it
is adding that element to the end of the
array now let's look at shift method now
we know that pop method removes the last
element and returns that element now if
we want to remove and return the first
element of an array that's when we use
shift method just like pop method shift
method also changes the length of the
array and here we have an example so
let's look at that in action so let's
have one two three four and five
within this array
now when we use pop method what is this
going to do it's going to remove and
return the last element of the array so
let's create a variable let's name it
last element and let's actually write
that to the document so last element
equals
now this pop method is going to remove
and return the last element that is five
now if we want to get the first element
of the array then we can use shift
method so let's actually copy these two
lines and let's name this variable first
element and instead of using pop method
let's use shift method so first element
equals first element now let's print the
array elements and then the length of
the array so notice that last element
within the array is five first element
is one those elements are removed and
returned
hence within the array we only have two
three four and array length is three
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
