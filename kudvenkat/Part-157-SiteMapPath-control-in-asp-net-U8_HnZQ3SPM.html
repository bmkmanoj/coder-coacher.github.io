this video we'll discuss sitemap path
control this is continuation to part 156
so please watch part 1 56 from the
asp.net tutorial before proceeding with
this video set my path control displays
navigation path this navigation path is
often called as breadcrumb let's
understand using sitemap path control
with an example the first step is to
drag-and-drop sitemap path control will
work with the same example that we
worked with in the previous session of
this video series let's include sitemap
path control within the headed section
of all master page so let's flip this to
the source mode let's drag and drop
sitemap path control so that's our first
step the second step is to add web dot
sitemap file so let's flip to visual
studio let's right click on the project
name add a new item and we want to add
sitemap file and look at this sitemap
file has got an extension of dot sitemap
these sitemap files are actually XML
files and notice that this XML file has
got single sitemap element and directly
underneath the sitemap element we have
one sitemap node element and underneath
that sitemap node element we have couple
of other site map node elements and
notice that each site map node element
has got three attributes URL title and
description obviously title is something
that we see within the sitemap path
control and we can click on that as well
once we click on that link obviously we
will be redirected to a specific page
and that page is specified using this
URL attribute if you recollect from the
previous session the hierarchy of our
site looks something like this at the
root level we are going to have these
four levels home employee employer and
admin and under employee we have got
three more levels under employer 3
levels and and admin 3 levels basically
to support this hierarchy let's
implement in a web dot sitemap file to
speed things up I have already
implemented
the required XML so let's copy and paste
that within the sitemap file so
basically again this XML is
straightforward we have got single
sitemap element and within that there is
one sitemap node element and look at the
title this is actually dummy root in a
bit you will understand why we are using
this dummy root here and then under that
dummy's root we have home employee
employer and admin and under employee
sitemap node we have three more sitemap
nodes along the same lines under
employer 3mo and under admin three more
all right with these two changes let's
run the application and see how our
sitemap path control is working look at
that we are now going to home page look
at this the sitemap path control has
detected that we are on the home page
and it has displayed home here now you
may be wondering what is this dummy road
if you recollect the dummy route is
actually the sitemap node element that
is present in web dot sitemap file look
at that that's the root node now
obviously our hierarchy starts at this
level home employee employer and admin
there's no reason why we want to display
this dummy rule so to get rid of this
the first thought that comes to our mind
is let's get rid of that sitemap node
root element and let's see what's going
to happen if we comment that okay so
let's save the changes let's run this
application one more time and see what's
going to happen look at that exactly one
sitemap node element is required
directly inside the sitemap element so
directly within the sitemap element you
can have only one sitemap node element
but if you look at our XML here we have
home sitemap node element employees I
asked sitemap node element employer and
admin we have four sitemap node elements
and that's what the error message says
you cannot have
more than one site map node element
directly underneath site map element so
we can't get rid of this one but our
application requirement is basically to
hide the dummy root that we see here
okay so basically to achieve that what
we can do is we can make use of item
created event of the site map path
control so let's flip this to the design
mode let's get to the properties of the
site map path control click on the
events icon and here we have item
created even let's double click on that
so here we have the even handler so what
we are going to do here is dynamically
hide so we need to hide this root node
here as well as the path separator the
path separator here is greater than
symbol basically this angular bracket so
we need to hide both of these and to do
that I'm going to check look at this you
know into the seam and handler method we
are receiving this object site map node
item event arguments object so this
object is going to identify what type of
item it is so e dot item dot item type
if that item type is root type or a dot
item dot item type
if it is path separator and if ye dot
item dot item index equals 1 then e dot
item dot visible equals false so
basically here we are dynamically hiding
the root node and the first item
separator I mean the path separator okay
so you may be wondering why are we
checking the item index here because
look at that if the item type is path
separator and if that item index is 1
then we know it is the first you know
path separator and we want to hide that
all right with this change let's go
ahead and run this let's actually
include these two another bracket so
basically if a that this condition is
true or this condition is true then hide
that item it's as simple as that so
let's go and run this and see if we get
the output that we expect look at that
now we only see home let's actually
navigate to you know employee and upload
resume because that upload resume and
then employee and notice that employee
item is displayed as a link and once I
click on that I will be directed to
employee page employee dot aspx all
right now you know there are several
properties of this sitemap path control
you know that we can either configure
declaratively at design time or
programmatically at run time let's look
at some of the interesting properties of
the sitemap path control so at the
moment we are on the events icon so
let's click on properties icon so look
at this basically we have root node
parent node and current node the names
are self-explanatory here now if you
want to configure this
for the current node look at that you
have current node style and there are
several properties so for example back
color if I want that to let's say
something like blue look at that current
node background color is set to blue
let's actually set some yellow color
there look at that you can clearly see
that during the design time and there
are several other properties which I'm
sure you can play around with similarly
if you want to basically configure the
style for root node there should be
something called root node style again
there are several of them let's say I
want you know maybe a green background
color for root node look at that that's
what we get there and look at this path
separator by default apart separator is
angular bracket here now instead of
angular bracket if you want maybe a pipe
symbol you can include that as well so
look at that we get a pipe symbol as the
path separator and look at another
interesting property here path direction
now the path Direction is from root node
to the current node but if you want that
in the rivers that is from current node
to root node you can change path
direction from current to root node and
again look at this property parent
levels displayed by default it's -1
meaning it's going to display all the
levels but you can configure how many
parent levels you want to be displayed
for example if we set that to zero then
only current node will be displayed on
the other hand if you set it to maybe 1
then only one parent level will be
displayed let's set it to default which
is -1 so basically there are several
properties here that you can play around
alright that's it for today thank you
for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
