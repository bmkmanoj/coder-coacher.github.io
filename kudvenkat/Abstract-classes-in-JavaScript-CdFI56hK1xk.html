in this video well discuss how to
implement abstract classes concept in
JavaScript object oriented programming
languages like C sharp in Java support
abstract classes abstract classes are
incomplete
so trying to create an instance of an
abstract class will raise a compiler
error abstract classes can only be used
as base classes first let's look at an
example in c-sharp and then we will see
how to implement the same thing in
JavaScript let's flip to visual studio
so let's get to the code behind file of
this waveform 1 now here let's create an
abstract class public abstract class and
let's name this shape and within this
abstract class let's include a public
field and let's name this shape name and
initialize that to not let's also
include a public method which is going
to return a string and let's name this
method draw so basically this method is
going to return drawing you know we are
going to concatenate whatever is the
shape name to this string drawing ok so
the moment we have an abstract class now
let's create another class public class
and let's name this circle and we are
going to make this circle class inherit
from this abstract class shape and
usually within the circle class we will
have code specific you know to circle
now since shape is an abstract class if
we try to create an instance of shape
we will get a compiler that are straight
away saying that we cannot create an
instance of an abstract class notice
that when I hover that you know over
that red squiggly it says we cannot
create an instance of an abstract class
now let's go ahead and create an
instance of circle class circle class is
not an abstract class so we should be
able to create an instance of that class
so Circle C equals new circle now since
circle class inherit from this abstract
shape class all the public members of
the abstract class will be available to
circle class that is this public field
at shape name and this public method
draw both of them will be available
within this circle object so now I
should be able to say C dot shape name
and initialize that with whatever string
I prefer so let's initialize that with
circle and then let's invoke the draw
method now since we initialized the
shape name field with circle so it's
going to say drawing circle when we call
this draw method and let's write that to
the web page so response dot write and
let's run this page so it should print
the message saying drawing circle now C
is circle now since C is an object of
type circle this should return true so
let's run this so notice that it says
true now C is a shape now circle class
inherits from shape so C is also a shape
so the second you know response dot
write should also return true so let's
go ahead and run this one more time
notice that we get C is circle true C is
shape true now let's see how to
implement the same thing within
JavaScript so let's get to this HTML
page one dot HTM so first let's create a
function
let's name this shape and we are going
to have one public feel shape name and
let's initialize that to none and we are
also going to throw an error because we
don't want to allow anyone creating an
instance of this shape so throw new
error cannot create an instance of an
abstract class so basically here we are
mimicking abstract classes within
JavaScript
now let's associate a function with this
shape object so shape dot prototype dot
draw is going to be the name of the
function now this function is going to
return this string drawing this dot
shape name so the moment shape is an
abstract object so if someone tries to
create an instance of shape so where
shape equals new shape look at this when
we run this we get an error look at that
it says cannot create an instance of an
abstract class right because we are
throwing that error when someone tries
to use this constructor function and
create an instance of shape now let's go
ahead and create another function and to
this function let's pass a parameter
shape name and this dot shape name
equals shape name so we are initializing
that with the parameter
now let's associate this shape as the
base type for circle using the prototype
property so
Circle dot prototype equals I'm going to
use object.create method and then shape
dot prototype so basically this object
or create method allows us to create an
object without using the function
constructor okay so we are saying here
using this line that shape is going to
be the base type for circle now since
circle inherits from shape it's going to
have both these properties shape name
and draw method now let's go ahead and
create an instance of this circle object
by our circle equals new circle and
let's specify the shape name as circle
and since circle object inherits from
shape object it should be able to call
the draw method so circle dot drawn and
let's write this to the webpage document
dot write circle dot draw let's go ahead
and run this notice that it says drawing
circle you know the spelling is
incorrect there so draw in circle all
right now let's alert this message alert
circle instance of circle this should
return true because circle is an object
of type circle now circle instance of
shape this should also return true
because circle base type is a shape so
let's look at that so let's see if these
changes reload the page notice that we
get true so circular instance of circle
that returns true
once I click OK we get true again so
circle is instance of shape and we have
drawing circle
so this is how we implement polymorphism
in JavaScript this is the same example
that we just discussed thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
