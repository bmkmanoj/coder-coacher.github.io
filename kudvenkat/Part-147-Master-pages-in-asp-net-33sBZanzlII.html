this video we'll discuss master pages in
asp.net this is continuation to part 146
so please watch but 146 before
proceeding master pages in asp.net allow
us to create a consistent looking
behavior for all the pages in an asp.net
web application first let's create a
master page let's flip to visual studio
this is the same project that we worked
with in the previous session adding your
master page is straightforward all you
need to do is right-click on the project
name add a new item select master page
and notice that master pages have got
dot and master extension and let's name
this site dot master click add so this
should add a master page and notice that
within this master page we have got two
content placeholders one in the head
section and another within the body
section so what are these content
placeholders content placeholders define
a region on a master page where content
pages can plug in their specific content
for now let's get rid of these two
content placeholders altogether and then
we want to design this master page in
such a way that it looks like this and
if you recollect from the previous
session we already have the required
HTML that would give us this layout and
that's present in web form one dot aspx
so let's copy the HTML from there so
this is the HTML table which gives us
that layout so let's copy this table and
paste that within site master now let's
flip this master page to the design mode
notice that we get the exact same layout
and this is the section where we want
the content pages to plug in their page
specific content and for us to be able
to do that we need to include a content
placeholder so what's a content
placeholder that's a location or a
region within the master page where
content pages can plug in their page
specific content so let's drag and drop
content placeholder from the toolbox
so here we have the content placeholder
now let's put this text inside that
content placeholder and we can easily do
that in the source mode so here we have
the content placeholder
let's move this h2 tag along with this
text inside the content placeholder
let's format this HTML properly and to
do that let's select the entire HTML and
+ ctrl K + D okay so one important thing
to notice here is the ID of the content
placeholder control let's actually
change this to main content placeholder
in a bit we'll see how we are going to
make use of this ID to plug in page
specific content all right now let's add
a Content page adding content page is
straightforward all you need to do is
right click on the master page and
select add content page and look at the
amount of HTML that we have in the
content page now we don't have HTML had
body tags where are all they present
they are actually present within the
master page look at that we have HTML we
have head tag we have body tag since
they are already present on the master
page they need not be present on the
content page because this content page
is subscribed to that master page and on
that master page we already have those
tags okay and look at this this content
page is associated with this master page
using master page file attribute notice
the value it's set to site dot master
and that's present within the root
directory that's what the still the four
slash indicates okay so for web form two
dot aspx master page is site master so
HTML head and body sections are not
present on the content page as they are
already present on the master page
content pages are associated with master
page using master page file at
buuuut of the page directive so within
the content page we have got this page
directive and it has called this master
page file attribute which associates
this content page with this master page
all right now within this content page
notice that we have content control on a
master page we have content placeholder
control and within the content page we
have a Content control and look at this
content control has got a property
content placeholder ID and look at what
it is set to it is set to main content a
placeholder and if you recollect this is
the ID of the content placeholder on the
master page look at that main content
placeholder so this content control is
associated with this content placeholder
so whatever content that you put inside
this content control that will be
present or that will be substituted here
at this location okay now any Content
that you want to put on the content page
should go you know inside the content
control if you try to for example type
some text here and look at this when I
try to flip this to the design mode
there is an error okay and if we
actually run this we get an error as
well I mean a parse error basically
because on a Content page all the
content you know the controls and the
content should all be present inside the
content control look at this only
content controls are allowed directly in
a content page that contains content
controls so this page this content page
waveform to dot aspx this contains a
Content control if that is the case then
all the continent controls need to
present inside that control otherwise
you will get a parse error okay
now let's include maybe an h1 tag here
and say this is webform 1 content and
let's flip this to the design mode look
at that this is where from one content
you know the content of this page is
plugged at this location and can I edit
the layout of the master page look at
this as soon as I move my mouse here
it's grayed out it's disabled we can't
change the layout from the content page
so if you want to change the common
layout then we'll have to do that from
the master page okay so here are the
other points to remember about master
page content controls on a content page
is link to content placeholder on the
master page using content placeholder ID
attribute of the content control we've
seen that just now and controls like
text box button grid view etc and any
static text that you want on the content
page all that should be placed inside
the content control if we try to place
anything outside of the content control
we would get an error now when we have
flipped the content page to the design
mode notice that I can only edit this
section because this section is specific
to this content page this is a common
layout outside of that content
placeholder and look at that that's
disabled and grayed out
we can't edit that basically all right
let's add another content page so let's
right-click on the master page add a
Content page so we have wave form 3 dot
aspx and within this content placeholder
let's actually drag and drop maybe a
button a calendar look at that all of
them are placed inside the content
placeholder and let's also include a
text here saying that this is performed
too
okay so let's actually this actually
reform three and the other one is wave
form two because we already have wave
form one which is not using the master
page okay
now if we want this wave form one to use
the master page what we need to do we
can get rid of all this HTML use master
page file attribute to associate this
wave form one with that master page and
include a content control within this
wave form alright so now let's actually
go ahead and run this and navigate to
the form two dot aspx look at that we
get the common layout and this is the
content that is specific to waveform
tutorial specs let's try to navigate to
wave form three dot aspx look at that I
get you know the same layout but the
content that is specific to the form
three dot aspx is to say displayed here
now no matter how many forms you are
going to have within your project you
know if all of them subscribe to the
same master page then all of those pages
are going to have the same layout now
let's say for example we want to change
something within this common layout then
we don't have to do anything within the
content pages you just have one file to
change that is your master page so let's
say we want to change the header from
website header to my website header
okay look at that I changed it in the
master page and then when I navigate to
the form 3 dot aspx that's reflected
there if I navigate to waveform 2 dot
aspx that's reflected there as well so
maintainability will become much easier
so an asp.net master page allows us to
define a common layout for all the pages
in the application later if we have to
change something in the common layout we
only have to do it in one place and that
is within the master page that's it for
today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
