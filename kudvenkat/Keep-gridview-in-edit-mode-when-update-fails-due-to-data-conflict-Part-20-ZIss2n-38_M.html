Frank ed this is part 20 of asp.net
grid-view tutorial in this video we'll
discuss about displaying appropriate
status messages depending on the success
of update if the update fails then we
want to leave that row in edit mode
please watch part 19 of the asp.net
grid-view tutorial before proceeding
with this video because this video is
continuation to part 19 now if there are
no concurrency conflicts and if the
update succeeds then we want to display
successful status message as you can see
on the slide row with employee ID is
equal to one is successfully updated on
the other hand if there are data
conflicts and if the update fails then
we want to display failure status
message as you can see in the slide row
with employee ID is equal to one it's
not updated due to data conflict and at
the same time we also want to retain
this row in edit mode let's see how to
achieve this if you remember grid weed
control supports an event call row
updated event so if we go to the
properties and click on that events icon
so this row updated even when is this
even fired this event is fired after the
update operation so let's double click
this to generate the event handler and
if you notice this even handler method
this even handler method receives an
object of type grid view updated emit
arguments this object has caught a
property called affected rows which is
of type integer so this property is
going to contain the number of rows that
were updated okay so we can make use of
this property to determine if a row has
been successfully updated or not and
just to see speed things up I have this
already type so let me copy and paste
that code here now first let's get rid
of that compilation error because label
message is not there on our perform so
let's drag and drop that on the wave
form and we use that label to display
the Status Messages so let me drag and
drop that we don't want any default text
to be displayed so let's get rid of the
text property and I want to set font -
bold is equal to true and finally set
the ID property to LBL message
so that should have got rid of the
compilation errors okay
so what are we doing here we are
checking if affected rules is less than
one if it's less than one then we know
for sure no row has been updated in
which case we want to leave that row in
edit mode so how do we do that
it's very simple it's just one line of
code this object has got a property keep
in edit mode which is of type boolean as
you can say okay so we are setting that
property to true keep in edit mode
so obviously this line here is going to
retain that row in edit mode and then
after that we want to display this error
message row with employee ID is equal to
one is not updated due to data conflict
okay so how do we do that so obviously
this is hard-coded text and we need to
retrieve employee ID and we do that
using Kies property of this grid view
updated even documents object a key can
also be a composite key but in our case
it's not a composite key it's a single
key so we are using an index of zero on
that keys collection to retrieve that
employee ID column value and then we are
converting that to string and
concatenating that with the rest of the
message and finally we are setting the
full color of that label to red on the
other hand if the affected Rose is not
less than one then we know for sure a
row has been updated in which case we
want to display a success message and
that's what we are doing here row with
employee ID is equal to we retrieve the
employee ID concatenate that with the
rest of the message and then finally set
the focal err of the label to Navy
that's it now you might think this may
work as expected but it doesn't work
with object data source control as
expected a lot of people has actually
asked me if this control you know the
data source control is a sequel data
source control on our web form then this
code would have worked as expected but
since this is an object data source
control this property will always be
minus one if you want this to work
correctly as expected there are certain
other things that we need to do before
we can actually use this property in
fact let's put in a breakpoint here okay
now let's try to edit at the moment look
at this the name is mark and then if we
go back to the database select the data
name is mark for employee with ID is
equal to 1 now no one has changed this
data so let me try to change this to
mark one maybe and then let me update
this look at what's going to happen when
I once I click this obviously we will
drop into this breakpoint and look at
the property value affected roses minus
one now when is this even trace this
event is raised after the update has
been completed ok so now by this time
the row would have actually been updated
if you look at this mark is now updated
to mark one successfully but then here
we are checking this affected rows
property this is always going to be
minus one and because of it it comes
here it puts that through in edit mode
and then it retreat you know builds this
message and you know when I press f5
here so that Row is still in edit mode
and we get this error message okay in
spite of that row has been successfully
updated and there was no data conflict
so we get a misleading error message
here and why is that that is due to this
property not having the right value that
we expected to have so how do we correct
this problem there are two other steps
that we need to do before we can
actually make it work as expected ok so
what's the first step the step if you
remember you know the update is actually
done by this update employee method
which is present in employee data access
layer and if you remember this update
employee method has got a void return
type ok so the first thing is I want to
change that to enter first of all let's
get this out of debug mode so debug
detach all let's close this now and
let's change this return type to integer
okay and then obviously if you remember
this update employee method actually
execute this execute nan query method of
the command object and if you look at
the intelligence this executes non query
method is actually returning an integer
back so what's that integer if you
remember this executes nan query method
is actually going to execute this update
query so when we execute this update
query
is going to return as you know the
number of rows that were updated okay
and that number is now being returned by
this method executes non query and we
want to return that integer back to
whoever is going to call this update
employee method so we are returning this
integer that is returned by execute non
query and the return type of our update
employee method is also an integer okay
so that's the first step and which we
have just done and what's our next step
the next step is to basically use the
updated event of object data source one
control now look at this when we
actually run this okay and when we click
this edit button okay and then when we
click the Update button so I click at it
and then I change it to whatever I want
and when I click update button okay now
to this grid view control the data is
being served by object data source
control so obviously when I click update
you know the object data source controls
update method will be executed so what
is the update method of this object data
source control there is this update
employee method and if you look at this
update employee method what it is doing
it is actually returning you know after
it updates the employee record it is
returning the number of rows that hit
that has been affected ok and then what
we need to do basically is this update
employee method after it is successfully
executed this object data source control
has got an event updated event ok so
when is this event fired this event is
fired after the update operation has
been completed so we need to make use of
the C event and then this event handler
method receives an object ok object data
source status event arguments object and
this object has got a property return
value so this return value is going to
return the value that is being returned
by this update employee method so if
this update employee method updates a
row then it's going to return one if it
doesn't update any row then it it's
maybe going to return zero ok so
depending on what this update employee
method returns okay so that value we can
retrieve using this return value
property okay and look at this this
return values datatype is object and
that makes sense because the update
method can return anything it can return
a string integer you know it can return
any type okay but we know that we are
expecting an integer back so what I'm
going to do just to speed things up I'm
going to copy this code and paste it
right there so this is our second stab
so if you dot return value is integer
because we know we are expecting an
integer so we are checking if it is
really an integer and if it is an
integer then we are typecasting that to
be of type integer and we are checking
is that value greater than zero
okay if that is the case then we know
for sure a row has been affected so in
which case we are setting a dot affected
Rose is equal to whatever is being
written so that's our second step and
final step is basically to use the row
updated property so we are initializing
this affected Rose property and then we
can use that as expected so let me go
ahead and run this okay so just to
clarify everything you know there are
three simple steps first update employee
method gets executed and this method
returns an integer value indicating the
number of rows affected okay then update
event of object it asserts one control
is in work in this even handler method
we are retrieving the value that is
returned by the update employee method
okay and then we are using that value to
initialize affected rows property which
then will be used in row updated a mate
of grid view one control so pretty
simple and straightforward
let's see now it fit works as expected
so at the moment name is mock one I am
going to change it back to mark and then
let's update that look at that row with
employee ID is equal to one is
successfully updated let's go back and
check our data so it's mop now let's
change it to maybe to mark two or mark
one and then somebody else is actually
changing it to mark three
even before I have hit that update
button so at the moment it's mark three
- its latest value
but I am trying to update it to mark one
let's see what happens when I click
update look at that I get that message
row with employee ID is equal to one is
not updated due to data conflict and the
gradation is refreshed with latest data
now if I want to change it to mark four
I can do that successfully all right so
this is now working as expected on this
