he never previous tutorials we completed
learning about arrays and details about
arrays util class in this tutorial we
are going to embark the journey on
object-oriented programming we know that
Java is an object-oriented programming
language and everything in Java is
either a primitive or a reference you
remember once in our earlier tutorials
we discussed classes and objects classes
were blueprints that define the state
and the behavior and objects are
instances that will create it from these
classes let us understand this key again
using an example let's say I want to
create a bicycle clips we call that a
class declaration starts with an XS
modifier and here I have public access
modifier we will learn about XS modifier
in this tutorial itself in more detail
then we have a class reserved keyword to
declare class and then the name of the
class understand that the anatomy of a
class is something like this where we
have some fields you will see
constructor constructors essentially
help us to instantiate the objects of
these classes and then we had methods
note that these were also used to
understand what is the state and methods
were used to help us understand what is
the behavior so let's understand this if
I have three private fields let's say I
have a cadence
and then I have gear and then let's say
I also have you know integer speed so
these are the three fields and I want to
have a constructor which is a public
constructor and the constructor name is
same as that of a class and I have int
start cadence in to start speed and what
is the start gear and then I will say
that this dot cadence is equal to these
start cadence this dot gear is equal to
start here this dot speed is equal to
start street and then I need some
methods to get and set these variables
in a class ID you can use refactor you
can go to source you can generate
getters and setters you can say I
I need getters and setters for all these
and eclipse will help you to generate
all this for you
so this is the basic class declaration
format where I have some variables then
I have a constructor which will help me
instantiate the object of this class by
passing three input parameters and then
I have some methods which define the
behavior that help me to get and set the
various parameters and accordingly I can
have another class which is the input
start driver program I can call it
driver and then here I can declare a
main program where I can define the
variable of bicycle class something like
this and I can use a new keyword to
declare a bycicle object of this type I
note that when I hover over by cycle it
is that it needs three integers to
declare or to instantiate it so I will
pass it the value say 1 1 and 1 and now
by cycle is instantiated I can say that
I want to print by cycle dot getkey it
is and then when I execute it I get the
value 1 back so what is we learn we
learn that we can declare classes by
providing it three essential things
feeds constructors and methods there are
something extra that we can provide here
let's say bicycle was belonging to some
base class and let us say that base
classes a class base and I am are
defining anything every class can extend
a base class in this way you can use the
extends keyword to say that a class is a
subclass of some other class
same way in Java there's a construct of
interface let's say I have an interface
called eye speed interface essentially
define the behavior of glasses just like
glasses define a template for objects of
similar type interfaces help us to
understand what is the behavior exposed
by different classes for example if I
have a base class called document and
then there are multiple kind of
documents these all documents can be
derived class or subclasses of the base
class document but let's say I have an
interface called printable then all
these documents can actually implement
some interface so this is a large
another syntax to tell that how a cow
stickler they should be extended it
connection a base class and it can
implement some interface there can be
more interfaces for example if I have
interface I won and I also have another
interface I to then the class can
implement i1 and i2 at the same time we
will learn about interfaces their
requirements in our later tutorial but
for now understand that a class
declaration can have one base class and
it can implement multiple interfaces
right so we can have name of superclass
we can have name of implemented
interfaces and we can also have access
modifiers for example instead of private
I can also make all these fields taught
I think now it's high time to understand
what this excess modifiers actually mean
there is for excess modifiers or excess
levels of Java 1 visible to package when
we do not specify any excess modifier
like in case of base class I have not
specified any excess modifier it is by
default visible to this package this is
the package default excess level then
there is a little excess modifier which
is private which means that that
particular subject is visible only to
the class the third one is public which
ensures the visibility to the world and
the fourth one is predicted which means
that the subject is visible in the
current package as well as in all the
subclasses note that whenever we have a
top-level class for example if I have a
top-level bycicle class here then I can
have different access modifiers at this
place but for top-level class I can only
have either a public or nothing which
means package I cannot have protected at
the top-level class it will give error
I cannot even have private here this is
also error so our top level classes
cannot be protected or private
it can only be public all default which
is packaged when you say about top-level
classes you might think that what is the
definition of a top-level class why
would some class be top-level in Java
programming language we can't create a
class with within a number
such a class is known as nested class
let's create a new class I create a new
class
I call it outer class now
this outer class let's say I don't want
to specify any access modifier this
means it is visible to package by
default and I want to create another
class inside which is nested class I can
create a nested class the nested class
can be private this is a valid
declaration but the outer class cannot
be private or protected as I have
mentioned just now so you are in word so
your nested class can be private second
thing is your nested class can be either
static or it can be non-static let us
create two nested classes one is the
nested class one and second one nested
class two
I am creating a nested class two as
static class and this one is non-static
don't
note that non-static nested class are
also called as inert assets and this is
static nested class and if I have a
variable here let us say private int
we're equal to five know that this
variable class is visible in this inner
class I can have
something like this where this email
variable is Auto variable var plus 5
however this might be invalid in a
static class it will say that cannot
make static reference to a non static
field variable defined in the outer
class so your nested classes in Java can
be of two types
static and non-static non-static nested
classes are also called
inner classes your inner classes can be
private so in this tutorial we learnt
about classes and objects we learnt
about access modifiers we also learnt
about nested classes you might be having
questions in your mind why should we use
nested classes there are some compelling
reasons for using nested classes on top
of my mind I can tell you that it is a
way to logically group classes that are
only used in one place and also it helps
us helps us in creating encapsulated
bundle of objects that are very closely
used together it can also lead to more
readable and maintainable code in our
next tutorials we will learn about
interfaces classes and how to use
inheritance and polymorphism as
object-oriented constructs in Java
programming language so stay tuned see
