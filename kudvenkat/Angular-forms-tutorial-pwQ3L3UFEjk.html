tutorial in part 2 of this video series
we discussed performing the read
operation and display the list of
employees in this video and in the next
few videos we'll discuss performing the
create operation to understand the
create operation let's build a firm that
helped us create a new employee for this
we'll make use of this create employee
component that we created in one of our
previous videos along the way we'll also
discuss performing validation and
displaying meaningful error messages to
the user there are two ways to create
forms in angular template driven forms
model driven forms modern different
forms are commonly called as reactive
forms both these approaches have their
own pros and cons for example template
driven forms are generally used to
create simple forms on the other hand
reactive forms are used to create more
complex forms for example if you want to
add form controls dynamically or perform
Crossfield validation we use the
reactive forms approach there are
several other differences between
template driven and reactive forms we'll
discuss those differences in detail in a
later video in this video we'll use the
template driven approach to build a
create employee form as the name implies
template driven forms are heavy on the
template this means we do most of the
work in the view template of the
component now the first thing that we
want to do is design our create employee
form we want it to look like this to
keep this form simple at the moment we
only have two fields full name and email
in our upcoming videos we'll discuss
adding the other fields like phone
number Department date of birth etc also
notice at the moment we only have text
boxes on the form again in our upcoming
videos we'll discuss working with radio
buttons checkboxes drop down less etc we
are using bootstrap to style this creat
employee form as you can see here we've
got a bootstrap panel within the panel
header we have this text create employee
in the panel body the two text boxes and
their associated labels and in the panel
footer they Save button
so let's design
here employee form like this to speed
things up I'm going to copy the panel
HTML that we already have in our list
employees component let's copy these
five lines of code and paste it within
our create employee component and then
we'll change the bits that are required
first we need to close the panel dev so
let's include a closing div there and we
also want to close this outer div so
lets include another closing there and
then we want a panel footer as well so
let's make a copy of that div and paste
it right there and we want this dev to
be the panel footer so let's change the
class from panel - heading to panel -
footer and within the panel footer we
want a button and we want this to be
Save button
let's close the button and then we want
this button to be of type submit' so
let's set the type attribute to submit
and we want to style this button using
the bootstrap button classes so let's
set the class attribute to BTN and BTN -
primary and then within the panel
heading we want to display this text
create employee so let's remove this and
include create employee text and we
don't want this ng4 so I'm going to
remove that altogether let's save our
changes and our server is running in
watch mode so the browser should have
automatically reloaded notice we have
got a panel as expected now we need to
include those two text boxes and their
associated labels within the panel body
so let's flip over to visual studio code
and inside this panel body dev let's
include another development and I'm
going to set its class to bootstrap form
group class and inside this form group
we are going to have a label and its
associated input element so let's
include a label first and the screen to
display
full name and we want an associated
input element as well so let's create an
input element give it an ID let's call
it full name and we want a text box so
let's also set the type to text and
we're going to use another bootstrap
class to style this text box and that
class is form
- control and let's close out input
element so this is going to display the
text box for full name let's do the same
thing for email so let's copy that and
paste that here and change the label to
email and the ID here - email let's save
our changes since our server is running
in watch mode when we take a look at the
browser we should say full name and
email at the moment the labels and their
associated input elements are not linked
meaning when I click on this full name
label notice its associated input
element doesn't receive focus so let's
link the label with its input element
and we do that by using the for
attribute so on this label element here
let's set the for attribute to the ID of
its associated input element in this
case full name so let's do the same
thing on this label as well so let's set
its for to this ID email let's save the
changes notice now when I click on full
name label its associated input element
receives focus similarly when I click on
email label its associated input element
receives focus until now on this Crede
employee forum we have not done anything
specific to angler all this that you see
right here is standard HTML and
bootstrap now let's wrap all this HTML
in a form tonight
let's move the closing form tag to the
end now one very important point to keep
in mind is whenever angular sees this
form tag it's going to automatically
attach a directive called ng form
to this form element the ng Foam
detective supplements the form element
with additional features it keeps track
of all the form controls that we create
and monitor their properties like value
valid touched dirty pristine etc even at
the Forum level we've got all these
properties will discuss these properties
in detail in our upcoming videos in this
video we'll be looking at the value
property to get it reference to this
form I'm going to create a variable here
and I'm calling it employee form and I'm
going to set this to ng form remember
this is the directive that angular
attaches whenever it says the form
element so here are this employee form
is called the template reference
variable meaning it holds a reference to
this entire form and notice we have set
it to ng form and this ng form directive
is attached to the form element whenever
angular sees the form tag and we know
this ng form directive supplements the
form element with additional features
and properties that means now we can use
this template reference variable to
access various features and properties
that the ng form directive provides for
example to get the value of the form we
can use its value property on the
employee form template reference
variable along the same lines if we want
to check if the form is valid we can use
its valid property now let's use the
value property suggest after the closing
form element I'm going to use
interpolation use the employee form
template reference variable and then use
the value property on that and to nicely
format the data I am going to use JSON
pipe let's save our changes and take a
look at the browser
notice nothing is displayed let's
investigate what's going on by launching
the browser developer tools we are on
the console tab and look at this error
right here
there is no directive with export as set
to ng form and notice here we are
setting our template reference variable
employee form
engi form this antifoam directive is
provided by the forms module but we
haven't imported that forms module yet
so let's go back to visual studio code
and within our route module file which
is AB dot module tortillas let's include
the required import statement to import
forms module so forms module is present
in this library angular slash forms and
now we need to include the forms module
as part of the imports array notice the
error is gone so let's close the
developer tools and look at what is
displayed right here we have an empty
object so let's understand what's
happening behind the scenes because this
is important now if you look at this
employee form this is a template
reference variable that we have defined
right here so it holds a reference to
our form
so what angular is going to do behind
the scenes is it automatically creates a
foam model for us and that form model is
going to keep track of all the form
controls at the moment on this form we
have two form controls that we are
interested in full name and email but if
you look at the auto-generated phone
model notice it is empty at the moment
even when we type within our full name
form control and email form control
nothing happens the angular auto
generated form model is still empty
that's because for the form controls to
be tracked by the angle generated phone
model we will have to use ng model
directive on all those form controls but
it's just the ng model directive and
two-way data-binding in great detail in
part 15 of our angular 2 course so if
you need to both these concepts please
check out our angular 2 course I'll have
the link available in the description of
this video at the moment none of our
form controls have the ng model
directive so naturally the angular
generated form model is empty now let's
set the ng model directive on one of
these form controls and see what happens
let's actually set this on the full name
input element so let's use the banana in
a
syntax and then use the ng model
directive so this specifies two-way
data-binding which we discussed in great
detail in our angular 2 course and I'm
going to set this to full name let's
save our changes and take a look at the
browser notice now we don't have even
that empty object let's launch browse
the developer tools and see what's going
on notice the error message right here
if ng model is used with an M form tag
either the name attribute must be set or
the form control must be defined as
standalone so basically it's saying if
we use this ng model directive with an F
form tag then we also have to set the
name attribute so let's set the name
attribute right here and I'm going to
set it to FN short for full name because
we have bought too many full names here
so let's save our changes and take a
look at the browser notice the error is
gone and we have that empty object back
now look what happens when we type in
the full name form control we have this
property called
FN this is the value that we have
specified for the name attribute so
basically angular is using the name
attribute value as a property in the
generator for model we also have the
value that we have typed into the
corresponding form control now look what
happens when we type in the email form
control nothing happens so at the moment
the angular generated for model is not
tracking this email phone control and we
know the reason for that that's because
at the moment on this email form control
we don't have ng model directive or the
name attribute so let's define both of
them on this email form control as well
let's change the name to email and let's
also set the ng model directive to email
now both the form controls should be
tracked by the angular generated phone
model there we go now to make this
property name more meaningful let's use
full name instead of FN and to achieve
that we know what to do we have to
change the name property value right
so let's change this to full name and we
know this is the end regenerated phone
model and to specify that I'm going to
include the static text bangla generated
phone model so now if we take a look at
the browser we have those changes right
here so if I type in the full name
property now we see the property name as
full name instead of FN and we also see
the email as expected now what we want
to be ultimately do is access this
Anglet generated phone model within our
component class once we are able to do
that we can save this data anywhere we
want beta database table text file XML
file anywhere really accessing this form
model within our component class is very
simple for that on the form tag I'm
going to use the ng submit directive
notice we are using event binding here
so anytime we submit this form either by
hitting the enter key or by clicking the
Save button
remember the Save button is a submit
button so when we click on that the form
is submitted
so when this form is submitted we want
to call this save employee method and to
the save employee method we are passing
our template reference variable at the
moment we don't have the save employee
method so let's go ahead and create that
now so in our component class let's
include save employee method we know
this method is going to receive our
employee form let's call it EMP form and
the type of this is going to be ng phone
we don't have this ng form imported yet
we'll do that in just a bit
this method is not going to return
anything so let's set the return type to
void for now let's log the phone model
to the console in our upcoming videos in
the series we will discuss calling a
service to save the data to a database
table for now let's log the form model
to the console finally let's include the
required import statement to import ng
form from angular forms let's save our
changes and take a look
the browser let's fill in full name and
email phone controls and then before we
click the Save button let's launch
browser developer tools and then submit
his form by clicking the Save button
notice we have the full name and email
log to the console as expected now let's
log the entire employee form and see
what happens at the moment we are logged
in the value property of the employee
form let's knock off that and lock the
form itself let's fill in these two form
controls and before we submit this form
remember at the beginning of this video
we discussed that this ng form directive
supplements this form element with
additional features and properties like
durty touched valid value etc now when
we submit this form we should see all
those properties now let's make some
more room right here and if we look at
this
ng form since we have modified the data
within the form controls notice the
dirty property is set to true and if we
scroll down a bit we can see the touched
property set to true because we have
touched the form controls and if we
scroll down a bit we can see the value
property it's an object and if we expand
that we can see the two properties email
and full-name and we have our valid
property right here at the moment it is
true because we don't have any
validation rules so both the form
controls have passed validation so the
form is also valid so all these
properties are very useful for
performing validation eliska's
validation in our upcoming videos will
also discuss working with checkboxes
radio buttons drop-down lists etc so
please stay tuned thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
