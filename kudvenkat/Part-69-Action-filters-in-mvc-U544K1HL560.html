in this video will answer a few
questions related to action filters what
our action filters in asp.net MVC can
you name a few action filters that are
commonly used is it possible to create a
custom action filter so what our action
filters action filters are attributes
that can be applied either at the
controller level or just to a specific
action method within a controller when
these action filters are applied at the
controller level then they are
applicable for all actions within that
controller for example here we have
caught home controller which has got two
action methods and then if we apply an
action filter at the controller level
for example validate input is one of the
action filters so if I apply that at the
controller level then it is applicable
for all these action methods within this
controller on the other hand if I want
that to be applicable for just one of
the action methods then I can apply that
directly on that action method so action
filters can be applied either at the
controller level or just to a specific
action method so what is the purpose of
these action filters what do they
achieve action filters allow us to add
pre and post-processing logic to an
action method that means they allow us
to modify the way in which an action is
executed if this statement is not clear
at the moment don't worry we'll be
discussing these action filters in a
great detail in our upcoming videos and
it should be much clearer at that point
of time name a few commonly used action
filters and here are a few of them
authorize child action only handle error
we will be discussing these in a great
detail in our upcoming videos is it
possible to create a custom action
filter absolutely and we will discuss
that as well in a later video session on
this slide you can find a few resources
here you can see a link to my YouTube
playlist where you can find all the
videos in a logical sequence you can
also find a link to my blog and here you
have code samples and text versions of
all videos thank you for listening
that's it for today have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
