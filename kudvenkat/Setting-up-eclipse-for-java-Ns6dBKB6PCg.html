tutorial we learnt about object-oriented
programming concepts and also learnt
about classes and objects in Java in
this tutorial we are going to set up our
Eclipse environment and then we will
also create sample programs to show how
to create programs and run them in
Eclipse Eclipse is an IDE integrated
development environment in our very
first tutorial we discussed in brief how
to download extract and create Eclipse
IDE system in our operating system we
are going to recall that and we are
going to setup Eclipse IDE for us recall
that we can download Eclipse from
Eclipse dot Watchi from here you can
download the Eclipse installer using
your 32 or 64 bit version and finally
what you did is this a file once you
download that zip file you can extract
it using right click extract all option
and then once the eclipse archive is
extracted you will see something like
this the Eclipse extract folder contains
configurations drop-ins features plugins
etc but one thing to remember here is
Eclipse dot exe the executable that
starts the Eclipse IDE
please do not forehead tool right click
this and create shortcut you can pin it
to taskbar and also create shortcuts in
your Start menu this is how Eclipse gets
installed it is extremely easy now let's
see this in action
I click Eclipse and the first window is
the workspace launcher where it is
asking me the workspace location I can
create any any workspace but it is
better to create anywhere non operating
system drive here I have used the drive
slash
sour training once I click on okay the
Eclipse workbench will get loaded this
is the Eclipse workbench there are two
modes here one is the Java perspective
and second one is the Java Enterprise
Edition perspective now let us create a
simple project here we can go to file
new Java project we can give the project
name as sample project and then we can
keep the default JRE selected if you
have multiple versions of Java Runtime
engine then here you can select one of
them you would remember that we had
installed on its JDK 1.8 that comes with
cherry one-pointed therefore we have
that as a default selection choice here
once I click on finish in my package
Explorer window I see our sample project
is created you will also see the
reference to JRE system library and a
folder source already created I can
right click on this folder and then
create something known as a package
what is the package in Java a package in
Java is essentially a hierarchy of
folders that is used to create related
files together it is a way to organize
your multiple files in large projects I
can name it here comm dot training dot
Java note the naming conventions or
project is to use all small letters or
and every word separated with the dot
sign once I click finish a package
that's created and I can keep my first
class in it I can again right-click it
go to new and create a class let's say
we create same employee class which we
created in our last tutorial
employed or tower gets created in order
to save time we are going to copy the
employ torch over content
you will see here we had created two
classes employ an employee demo I will
create the first one employee dot Java
and I will just copy the content here
so employee class is created now let's
create another class employed a mood or
Java people we don't have to give dot
Java here we can just give the name of
the class
now in this employ demo class we will
write the code ourselves rather than
copying it so I create a main method
public static void main string Arg s
note that if I make any sin tax error
the IDE would complain immediately if I
forget this closing this then it
immediately points me with a red spiral
line now let's create employ Joe equal
to MU when I site new am PLO y ee i can
press conquer space to see what are the
various ways to create this this is
known as intelligence we can say
employees and we can give it name Joe
and 30 and similarly we can create
another instance Mike which is another
employee of 25 years old and now we can
say Joe dot note that as soon as I put
dot Eclipse IDE helps me to show what
are the various methods available I can
write your greed and then Mike dot great
similarly I will ask Joe dot work and
Mike dot work
once you have done this we can save all
from the icon on the toolbar or we can
also go to edit or sorry find file and
save say all and then we can run the
code from here we see the output in our
console window which exactly matches
with what we had seen in our previous
tutorials so in this tutorial we learnt
how to start Eclipse and create one
sample program in it in our coming
tutorials we are going to do all our
programming in Eclipse IDE there are
other IDE also like NetBeans IntelliJ
IDEA they are equally awesome and I
would suggest you to try and all of them
and choose one of them to do the
programming so then stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
