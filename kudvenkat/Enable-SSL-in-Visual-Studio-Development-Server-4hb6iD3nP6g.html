tutorial in this video we'll discuss how
to enable SSL that is HTTP in visual
studio in our next video we'll discuss
how to automatically redirect to HTTPS
from HTTP if a request is issued using
HTTP so let's flip to visual studio now
to enable SSL within visual studio
select your project from the solution
Explorer in our case the project is
employee service which is of our asp.net
Web API project and then plus F for K
this launches the project properties
window notice here we have SSL enabled
property by default this is turned off
let's set it to true the moment we do
that notice it says SSL URL so if you
want to use HTTPS protocol then this is
the URL to use and if you want to issue
a request using HTTP then this is the
URL to use and look at the port number 4
4 3 5 2 that's the port number for HTTPS
so let's launch browser and let's issue
a request using HTTP protocol HTTP colon
four slash four slash localhost colon 4
4 3 5 2 that's the port number API for
slash employees now notice the browser
reports an error
it basically says your connection is not
private and we have this advanced link
here when we click on that we have
another link here it says proceed to
localhost and it basically says it's
unsafe to do so let's click on this so
when we click on this we will be able to
issue a request to our web api service
and it's going to send the data back but
then this error message that we see here
is a little annoying and when we click
on this little triangle right here it
says your connection to the site is not
private click on details
and here we have got certificate error
it says there are issues with the site
certificate chain and when we click on
this button view certificate look at
what the message says this says this CA
root certificate is not trusted to
enable trust install the certificate in
the trusted root certification
authorities store so basically it's
saying this certificate that Visual
Studio has issued is not trusted and to
make it a trusted certificate install it
within the trusted certifications store
now let's see how to do that so that we
can get rid of this error message to
enable trust for the certificate issued
by Visual Studio launch the run window
type MMC dot exe and then click OK click
YES on the security problem that you get
this launches console root window within
this window click file add/remove
snap-in and then select certificates
from the list box on the left hand side
click add we want to use this map in to
manage certificates on our local
computer so select computer account
radio button click Next on this screen
select local computer and click finish
and then ok so now the console root
window is displaying all the
certificates that we have on this local
computer expand this and then expand the
personal folder here within this
certificates folder we have this
certificate issued by Visual Studio so
this certificate is issued to localhost
issued by localhost this is the
expiration date and look at the friendly
name is expressed development
certificate which basically tells this
is issued by Visual Studio now to get
rid of this error that we have we have
to place this certificate issued by
Visual Studio in the trusted root
certification authorities store to do
that we will have to first export this
to a folder in your computer and then
import it from there into this trusted
root certification authorities tour so
let's first export it to a physical
folder on our
local computer so I'm going to
right-click on the certificate select
all tasks export this launches the
certificate export wizard click Next we
don't want to expose the private key so
select that radio button click Next
leave the default here DRN coding binary
click Next and here I will have to
specify the full path including the
filename where we want to export this
certificate to I have already created a
folder called test certificates within C
Drive so this is where I want to export
the certificate to and the name I want
to give it is localhost you can give it
any name you want and then let's click
Save click Next we get the summary click
finish the export was successful so now
if we look in that folder C colon
backslash test certificates we have the
certificate that we have exported now we
want to import it from here
to our trusted root certification
authorities store so I'm going to expand
that right click on the certificates
folder all tasks import this launches
the certificate import wizard click Next
and we want to import it from C test
certificates this is the certificate
that you want to import click Next we
want to place that certificate within
this certificate store trusted root
certification authorities click Next we
have the summary click finish the import
was successful so now within the
certificates folder under trusted root
certification authorities we have the
certificate issued by Visual Studio now
we should not get the certificate error
anymore so we have to close all the
instances of the browser let's copy the
URL
close Google Chrome let's relaunch
Google Chrome and now when we visit this
URL we should not get that certificate
error anymore but notice we are still
getting the error and if we look at the
error message it's a different message
now it says this site uses a weak
security configuration as
jae-won signatures we are getting this
certificate error because of a bug in
Google Chrome now if we use Microsoft
edge we don't get that error so we are
visiting the same URL notice we don't
get error and we get the data as
expected so this certificate error that
we are getting in Google Chrome is
because of a bug in it at the moment we
can use either of the protocols that is
HTTPS or HTTP to issue a request or
asp.net Web API service to use HTTP to
issue a request we have to use a
different port number two three to five
eight
so let's issue a request using HTTP so
we are using HTTP that's the port number
and let's go to API slash employees so
here we are using HTTP and here we are
using HTTP so we can use either of the
protocols in our next video we'll
discuss how to automatically redirect
these requests that are issued using
HTTP to HTTPS so to enable SSL in visual
studio set SSL enabled property to true
in the project properties render to
resolve invalid certificate issue place
the certificate issued by visual studio
in the trusted root certificates folder
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
