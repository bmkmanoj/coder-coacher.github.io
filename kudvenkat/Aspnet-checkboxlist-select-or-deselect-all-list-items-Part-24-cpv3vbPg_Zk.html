venket this is part 24 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll learn about
selecting a specific list item within a
check box list control using selected
value and selected index properties
we'll also learn how to select or
deselect all list items of a checkbox
list control before continuing with the
session I strongly recommend to watch
part 17 21 and 23 of this video series
let's look at an example let's drag and
drop a check box list control on to the
waveform from the previous session we
know that a check box list is a
collection of list item objects and
these list items can be added to the
check box list add the design time using
the HTML source or we can do it at run
time programmatically using code let's
add some sample list items to this check
box list control so this check box lists
control is now displaying levels of
education like diploma graduate
postgraduate doctorate let's change the
repeat direction to horizontal so all of
them appear in one line okay now when we
run this application you know none of
the list items within this check box
list is selected by default now let's
say for example I want graduate to be
selected when the page actually renders
there are two ways to do that we can do
that at design time using the HTML
source so here I can set this graduate
you know selected to true so when you
set this property to true for this list
item object so let's flip that to design
mode and see that graduate is selected
so obviously when the page renders this
list item object the graduated list item
object is selected by default okay but
then we are doing that at design time
you know in the HTML sewers is it
possible to do programmatically
absolutely and how do we do that we can
make use of the selected index and
selected value properties okay
so first let's see how to use the
selected value now if you look at the
at this the value for the graduate list
item object is to so programmatically I
can say the ID of the checkboxes
checkbox list 1 dot selected value is
equal to 2 so now when I run the page
look at that in the design mode you we
remove that selected property so
obviously it is not selected at design
time but when we run the application at
runtime the list item object with value
is equal to 2 which in our case is
graduate will be selected when the page
renders similarly I can also make use of
the selected index property because if
you look at that you know these list
item objects have caught index as well
the values is 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 and the indexes
starts from 0 so for diploma at 0 for
graduate it's 1 so if I want the
graduate list item object to be selected
then I can make use of this selected
index property and it's an integer so
select the index property it's an
integer so I'm setting that to 1 and if
you look at the index of 1 that's for
the graduate list item object so
obviously when we run this the page you
know when when the checkbox list renders
it should default to graduate look at
that but then one important thing to
keep in mind here is that whenever you
do this you know the default selection
in the page load diamond make sure you
do that within this if not is post bacc
condition okay otherwise what's going to
happen let's actually look at that let's
you know drag and drop a button control
onto this web form okay so I have a
button control here let's put an xtml
break there so it comes in the next line
let's double click the button control
okay now let's say whenever I click this
button I want to show the text of all
the selected list item objects so
obviously to do that we can make use of
the for each loop so for each list item
a lie-in checkbox list 1 dot items ok
what we want to do if Li dot selected if
the list item is selected then all we
want to do is to write the text of that
list item so li dot text and then let's
put an HTML break so that the each
selected item text will come in its own
line ok so now look at what we are doing
we are you know setting the selected
index of the checkbox list one control
on the page load event ok let's run that
so obviously on page load the graduate
check box will be selected by default
because we have said that you know
selected index to that one now look at
that when I click this button graduate
check box is selected it appears
correctly as expected now let me select
diploma postgraduate and doctorate as
well look at that we have everything
selected now I click the button look at
what's going to happen all of the
selections are gone and it only
retaining that graduate why is that
that's because if you have understood
the events in the page lifecycle of a
web application page load even gets
fired before the button click event ok
so when the page is rendered I'm
actually selecting all of them and when
I click the button the page will get
posted back to the server on the server
you know view state restoration happens
during the page initialization event so
all of these are selected but then after
that page load event happens in the page
load event what are we doing we are
saying the selected index of checkbox
list one control is one which is nothing
but the Graduate so only that gets
selected and button click event is
happening after the page load event so
by the time it gets to execute this
button click event you know it has only
graduate list item object selected
that's why only that gets printed out so
for this page to correct to work
correctly all you have to do is wrap
this in this
Asian if not is post back which means we
want to default the selection of that
checkbox list one control you know only
if it is the initial cat request if it
is not a postback request if it is a
postback request then don't execute that
okay so now if we run this during the
initial get request this property is
post pac will return false false of
false is true so it will come here
graduate will be selected you know now
if I click that okay Graduate printed
fine when I select diplomat postgraduate
I'm literally unchecking graduate and I
click the button look at that I get what
I expect if I want all of them I select
all of them and I get all of that okay
so whenever you use selected index or
selected value and you are doing that in
a page load event make sure you wrap
that inside if not is post back
condition all right so we have seen how
to you know select a specific list item
within a check box list control using
selected value in selected index
properties now let's see how to select
or deselect all the list items of the
check box list control now let's drag
and drop a button control on to the
webform
okay let's drag and drop a button
control here and let's have another
button control okay let's actually put
some space in between the button
controls and let's change the text of
the button first button control to
select all and then the text of the
second button control to deselect all
okay so when we double click this button
control you know the even handler gets
generated so let's write the code there
so when we click that button select all
button what should happen we want to
select all the list items of the
checkbox list control how do we do that
you know if you if you have understood
properly until now all you have to do is
look through each list item object
retrieve the list item object and then
set the selected property to true if you
remember list item object has got
several properties like text value and
along with that it is also having the
selected property if you said that to
true that specific list item object will
be selected now we want all the list
items to be selected so we loop through
each one of them and set the selected
property of that list item object to
true and to loop through each list item
we can make use of the for each loop so
for each list item Li n check box list 1
dot items what we want to do we just
want to set the selected property of
that list item object to true that's all
and when we click the DZ deselect all
button what we want to do we want to do
the opposite of that look through each
list item object and set the selected
property to false it's as simple as that
so we set this to false so now when we
run this when the page loads you know it
defaults to the graduate but look at
this when I say select all all of them
get selected and I deselect all all of
them gets D selected select I'll click
this button and it prints everything
okay on this slide you can find
resources for is p.net c-sharp and
sequels of interview questions that's it
for today thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
