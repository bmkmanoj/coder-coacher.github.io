tutorial in this video well discuss how
to validate form fields using regular
expressions to use a regular expression
we use pattern validator pattern
validator can be used to meet most of
our application complex validation
requirements regular expressions are
extremely useful when you want to
validate if a given string confirms to a
specific pattern for example you can use
regular expressions to check if a given
email confirms to a valid email format
similarly you can also use a regular
expression to check if a provided post
code confirms to a specific country post
code format in addition to checking
conformity with a pattern they can also
be used to extract sub strings from a
given input string in our previous video
we used the angular built-in email
validator to validate this email form
field in this video let's use the
pattern validator
to do the same here is the email field
HTML notice at the moment we are using
the angular built an email validator
to validate if the provided email
confirms to have a lead email format
instead of using this angular built-in
email validator let's use the pattern
validator with the pattern validator we
also specify a validation expression and
this validation expression right here
validates if the provided email confirms
to a valid email format it is easy to
learn for ziggler expressions initially
they may appear complicated but if you
get the basics right it is very easy to
understand them however you can also
finally commonly used regular
expressions on the Internet for example
if you want to find a regular expression
to validate email address simply search
the internet using the string regular
expression for email validation that's
how I found this regular expression so
the only thing that is left to do is
display this message email is invalid if
the pattern validator fails validation
remember when we were using the email
validator to validate the email we are
checking on the errors collection
if we have got this key email when we
were using the email validator if it
fails validation then angela is going to
attach this key email to the errors
collection similarly when the pattern
validator fails validation Angela is
going to attach the key pattern to the
errors collection property so we simply
check for that key and if that key
exists that means the pattern validator
has failed validation and at that point
we want to display this message email is
invalid notice when the email field
receives focus and we leave the field
without typing anything we see the
message email is required that's because
on the email input field we are also
using the required value data now if I
type something into the email field and
if that is not a valid email format we
immediately see the message email is
invalid and this message is coming from
our pattern validator
if we type the complete email address
and if it confirms to a valid email
format notice the validation error
message goes away immediately when I
delete a few characters and when the
email becomes invalid we again see the
message email is invalid if we delete
everything the required validator kicks
in and we see email is required
validation message now let's take this
email validation to the next level here
is what we want to do instead of
allowing any email domain we only want
to allow regime techcom email domain so
only presume techcom is a valid email
for us any other email like ABC at
gmail.com XYZ that Microsoft com all
those domain email ids should be
considered invalid to achieve this all
we have to do is provide a regular
expression that specifies that pattern
and here is that regular expression so
if you look at this regular expression
notice we are looking for presume tag
and the domain extension is calm so if
we save our changes and then take a look
at the browser notice when I type ABC at
gmail.com that's not a valid domain for
us we immediately see the error message
email is invalid if I try ABC at
pledging techcom the error goes away if
I try ABC app regime tech dotnet the
validation error message is still there
because only presume techcom is a valid
email for us so we have just seen how
powerful these regular expressions are
using them we can meet most of our
application complex validation
requirements here is the example that we
just discussed thank you for listening
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
