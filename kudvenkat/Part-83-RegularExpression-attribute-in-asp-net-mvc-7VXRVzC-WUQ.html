this video we'll discuss regular
expression attribute we'll be working
with the example that we started in part
80 so please watch parts 80 81 and 82
before proceeding this video regular
expression attribute is great when it
comes to pattern matching validation
let's understand using regular
expression attribute with an example at
the moment this name field allows any
characters it allows alphabets numbers
and even special characters look at this
when we click Save that string gets
saved to the database and it's very
unusual for a name to contain numbers
and special characters so here is our
business validation requirement for this
name property name can contain first and
last name with a single space between
them last name is optional so if last
name is not present then there shouldn't
be any space after the first name only
upper and lowercase alphabets are
allowed numbers and special characters
are not allowed this business validation
requirement can be very easily met using
regular expression attribute let's look
at using that so this is the employee
class that we have been working with
let's decorate this name property with
regular expression attribute and notice
that this attribute expects a parameter
of type string so we need to pass
regular expression here so here is a
typical example of a regular expression
so this regular expression is going to
ensure whatever value that we enter for
the name property is going to meet all
these validation rules so let's copy
this regular expression and pass it as
an argument for our regular expression
attribute and let's build a solution and
look at that we get a compile a genera
and that's basically because of this
backslash s backslash within c-sharp has
got special meaning it's an escape
sequence character so backslash T for
example represents a tab space backslash
n represents a newline character but
backslash s it doesn't represent
anything so it's unrecognized and that's
the reason why c-sharp compiler throws
in
a compilation error and now to fix this
we need to prefix the string with an @
symbol and add symbol is called as
verbatim literal so this verbatim
literal is not going to process the
escape sequences instead backslash will
be treated like any other character we
discussed verbatim literal in part 4 of
c-sharp tutorial so now let's build a
solution let's navigate to edit view
notice that the name contains numbers
and special characters let's try to
submit that and look at that we get the
validation message the field name must
match the regular expression and it
prints the regular expression this
message doesn't make any sense to the
end user so we definitely want to change
this error message and to do that we can
use error message property and this is a
named parameter so let's go ahead and
specify the error message that we want
so let's say we want this message please
enter upper and lowercase alphabets only
let's build our project let's reload
this
and let's click Save look at that we get
our customized message now let's try a
valid name so this has got first-name
with a single space and then a last name
let's try to click Save and see if that
gets saved to the database look at that
it gets saved to the database all right
understanding and building regular
expressions is beyond the scope of this
video but however if you are interested
in learning the basics of regular
expressions here is a link that can
explain the basics and this website is
also very useful for writing and testing
regular expressions in fact this regular
expression to validate name you know I
picked it up from that website let's
actually navigate to that website
so if you want to find that the commonly
used regular expressions you know click
on this community tab and here you can
find the list of commonly used regular
expressions now to find the expression
that we used to validate name I simply
typed first name here then I click the
search so there are several of them I
used these this regular expression first
name last name look at this one say
double click that name there the
expression that is associated with that
will be loaded into this text box and
within this text box we can type our
strings and check if they match the
pattern prescribed by this expression
look at that mark for example is a valid
name so it matches that pattern that's
why I look at that it's highlighted on
the other hand if I say Mark you know
that's highlighted but then if I plus
number mark one look at that that's not
highlighted let's say Mark is the first
name a single space and then last name
that's highlighted again if I say mark
and then it space and then I don't enter
the last name again that doesn't match
the pattern so very easy to test your
regular expression as well
alright now let's look at another
example of using a regular expression
let's say on this view we also have
email now a valid email should contain
an app and a dot symbol within it okay
for example here test is not a valid
email look at this when we click Save
that gets saved to the database and
let's say our business validation should
ensure that only valid emails are saved
to the database so we need a regular
expression to validate email format okay
so that strings should contain an @ and
a dot symbol within them okay
so again I can get that regular
expression from this website so if I
delete whatever search string that we
have click search look at the first one
is email validator
okay so double-click that that gets
loaded here I can copy that and then
let's use you know that regular
expression with email property first of
all let's write the property so email is
of type string let's include the get and
set accessors and let's decorate this
with our regular expression attribute
and then pass the regular expression and
again since it contains back slashes we
need to use the button literal alright
so let's build a solution let's reload
this fear so test is not a valid email
after it reloads let's try to save and
see if it allows it look at that again
it says the field email must match this
regular expression again you know how to
overwrite that with a custom error
message now if I try test at again
that's not a valid email so that doesn't
get save data the other hand test at
test comm is a valid email let's click
Save and that should get saved to the
database look at that that gets saved
alright that's it for today thank you
for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
