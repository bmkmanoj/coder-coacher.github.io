in this video we'll discuss the common
reasons why sequel data adapter dot
update doesn't work when used with
sequel command builder this is
continuation to part thirteen so please
watch part thirteen before proceeding
this is the example that we worked with
in the previous session at the moment we
are able to load student data from the
database table and we are able to make
changes and update as well this update
is actually performed by the data
adapter object so notice that this da is
actually an instance of sequel data
adapter and then on that instance we are
invoking the update method which is
actually updating the underlying
database table now in this example by
using sequel data adapter along with
sequel command Elda so when we use
sequel data adapter along with sequel
command bilder and when we invoke the
update method and if it doesn't work
there are two very common reasons that I
have seen and one of the very common
reasons is this developers tend to
forget to associate sequel command
builder object with sequel data adapter
object without this Association sequel
command builder object does not know how
to automatically generate insert update
and delete statements so if you look at
our example notice that here we are
creating an instance of sequel data
adapter and then we are retrieving the
Select query from view state we
discussed that in the previous session
and then we are associating that with
this data adapter object using the
Select command property and then in the
next line we are creating an instance of
sequel command builder and then we are
associating the data adapter with sequel
command builder object using the data
adapter property at this point sequel
command Elda also has information about
that select query so based on that
metadata this sequel command builder
class is automatically going to build
insert update and delete transact sequel
statements and once we invoke this
update method on the data adapter object
the data adapter has the required
transaction
equal update statement so it's going to
update the underlying database table
without any problem but just imagine
what is going to happen if we comment
this line obviously the association
between data adapter and command builder
is missing so sequel command builder
doesn't have any knowledge about the
Select query used to retrieve data so it
cannot generate update statement and
hence we will get an exception when we
try to invoke the update method on the
data adapter object let's look at that
in action look at that once I click this
update we get an exception update
requires a valid update command and that
makes perfect sense
let's uncomment this and let's build our
solution okay here is the second common
reason this select command that is
associated with sequel data adapter does
not written at least one primary key or
unique column now if you look at the
Select query that we are using in this
demo we are selecting all the columns
from Tbls students table and if you look
at to be a student's table we've got ID
name gender and total marks columns and
within these columns ID column is a
primary key and we are returning that
column as well okay that's why our
application is working as expected
now let's comment I mean let's remove
this primary key so let me delete this
primary key constraint so at the moment
we don't have you know any primary key
or uni unique column within this table
okay as a result let's reload this
waveform look at that after we load the
data and then once we hit this Update
button we get an exception okay because
the Select query that we are using is
not returning you know at least one
primary key or unique column that is the
reason so the exceptions is dynamic
sequel generation for the update command
is not supported at
mainstay select command that does not
return any key column information okay
so if we convert this let's refresh this
columns so we don't have primary key
let's actually change this column to
unique column so let's design the table
and in in the designer we are going to
create a unique index on that so that
you know this ID will be a unique column
so right-click on the ID column select
indexes and keys click Add and we want
this ID column to be unique close up and
save the table now let's reload our page
let's make a change and click update
look at that it works as expected so
this is the second reason now sometimes
it may be very useful for us to inspect
the automatically generated insert
update and delete statements if you want
to have a look at them you can use this
get insert command to look at the insert
statement similarly get update and get
delete methods to look at the update and
delete statements that are
auto-generated for us let's actually
look at them in action let's go to the
web form and let's include another table
within this div tag let's include an
HTML break and then a table and let's
use a TR and let's include two TDs let's
actually copy this
so in the first TR in the first TD let's
say we want to display insert statement
let's put that inside a boulder tag and
then we need a label as well so let's
drag and drop a label and maybe let's
call it lvl insert let's copy that label
put it in this TD and this TD as well so
here we are going to display let's say
delete statement so let's call it delete
and here we are going to display update
statement so let's call it update and
let's name this label as lvl update and
this label as lvl delete and within the
code-behind file once we click the
Update button let's set lvl insert dot
text equals so we have the command
builder object the object instance is
builder so builder dot look at that get
insert command this method actually
returns a sequel command object but from
that insert command just give me the
command a text which is going to return
a string okay
similarly LBL update dot text is going
to be builder dot get update command and
let's get the command text LVL delete
dot text equals
build a dot get the delete command and
let's get the command text property okay
and let's get rid of this default text
label
right so let's go and run this now
load the student information make some
change
click update look at that you know this
is the generated insert statement and
here we have the update and delete
statements ok so basically if there is
an issue and you are troubleshooting it
if it's not working as expected
then you know you can look at these
insert update and delete statements that
are auto-generated probably that could
give you a clue on how to resolve the
issue that you have all right and notice
that these queries are using
parameterised I mean these are basically
parametrized queries to avoid sequel
injection we discuss sequel injection in
the previous sessions of this video
series alright that's it for today thank
you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
