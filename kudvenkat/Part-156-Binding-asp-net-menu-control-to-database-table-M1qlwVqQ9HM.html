video well discus binding asp.net menu
control to a database table this is
continuation to part 155 so please watch
part 155 from the asp.net tutorial
before proceeding with this video at the
moment this menu control is bound to an
XML file we discussed this in our
previous session in this video we'll
discuss binding this menu control to a
database table and obviously the first
step here is to move this menu data to
database tables and for that purpose we
are going to create these two tables
notice the table on the left hand side
this table contains the top-level menu
items and the top-level menu items our
home employee employer and admin and
notice that's what this table contains
this is the menu text and this is the
URL that we want the user to navigate to
when they click on that menu tags and
look at the table on the right hand side
this table contains level two menu items
so underneath employee we have upload
resuming edit raise you may view resume
and notice how these two tables are
related
using this column parent ID so this is
the foreign key look at the parent ID
for the first three rows it's number two
so these are child items for employee
menu item and along the same lines for
employer four five and six are the child
items how do we know that look at the
parent ID it's number three and employer
ID is number three so basically this
column looks up in this table so pretty
straightforward now the first thing here
is we need a stored procedure which is
going to retrieve data from these two
tables I have already created these two
tables so these are the tables table TBL
menu items level 1 and TBL menu items
level 2 here is the sequel script to
create and populate these tables with
some sample data
I'll have the script available on my
blog in case if you need it and look at
this I've created a very simple stored
procedure here all this procedure has
got as to select statements retrieving
data from the two tables
now let's flip to visual studio at the
moment this menu control is bound to an
XML file so first of all let's remove
that association so here we have the
menu control first we need to get rid of
this datasource ID attribute from the
menu control and the next thing is to
remove these data bindings and finally
let's get rid of the XML data source
control that we used all right now we
need to write some ad or net code to
retrieve data from the database table so
within the code-behind file of the
master page let's include the required
using statements so system dot data we
need system dot data dot sequel client
and system dot configuration and within
the web config file I already have a
connection string that points to sequel
server that's installed on my local
machine so within the code-behind file
let's include a private method so
private void and let's call this maybe
get menu items and now first we need to
read the connection string from web
config file for that purpose we are
going to make use of configuration
manager class dot connection strings off
what is the name of the connection
string DBC s dot connection string
should give us the connection string the
next step is to create the sequel
connection object and we are going to
create the sequel connection object
using this connection string now let's
create an instance of sequel data
adapter and we want the sequel data
adapter to execute this stored procedure
SP get a menu data look at this when we
execute it we get data from these two
tables TBL menu items level 1 and level
2 so we want this stored procedure to be
executed and we want this adapter object
to use this connection object that we
have created to execute the store
procedure
right now let's create a data set object
let's call it D s equals new data set
and fill the data set with data so
what's going to happen when the
statement is executed data from these
two tables is now present within this
data set now the next very important
thing that we need to do is we need to
establish the relationship between these
two tables in the data set and to do
that so data set dot relations dot add
we want to add a relationship okay so we
are going to use this overloaded add
method where we can specify the name of
the relationship the parent column and
the child column so let's call the
relationship as maybe child rules and
now how are these two tables related
where is the parent column present the
parent column is nothing but the lookup
column so we are using this value to
look up in this table so this is the
parent column and this is the child
column and look at this when we execute
the stored procedure in which order are
we getting the data you know the first
table contains the parent items and the
second table contains the child items so
within the data set we have got two
tables and the index in four tables
within the data set is zero-based so
data set the tables of zero would
actually give us this table okay
so within this table which column is
that the parent column ID column so dot
columns of ID so that's the parent
column and what is the child column
child column is present in the second
table and the name of the column is
parent ID
all right so we have established the
relationship in a bit we'll see how we
are going to make use of this
relationship now the next step is to
basically loop through the rows within
these two tables and build menu objects
dynamically because technically a menu
and asp.net menu is a collection of menu
item objects so let's go ahead and
create you know an instance of menu
items but we'll have to do that inside a
for each loop because for every row we
have to create an instance of menu item
object and add that to the menu control
so for each data row and let's call this
level one data room in data set dot
tables of zero dot roll so we are
basically looping through the parent
rows now we just look at which table we
are looking through tables of zero
that's the parent table which is this
table and then as we get the rows what
we need to do we need to create an
instance of menu item objects so menu
item let's call it item equals new menu
item and obviously menu item has got
text and navigate URL property so text
equals so where are we going to get the
text for the menu item from this column
of this table so what is the name of the
column menu text and we have the data
row here level one data row of menu text
is the name of the column and convert
that to strain and the next important
property is the navigate URL property
and where are we going to get the
navigate URL value again the column name
here is navigate URL so let's copy this
and paste it right there so navigate URL
alright so that would give us the parent
items but under employee we have got
child
items as well so we need to associate
child
objects to this menu item okay so what
we need to do here technically is if
this row has got a child item go ahead
and retrieve child items from the second
table and build child item menu objects
and then add them to the parent menu
item okay so to get the rows from the
second table what we are going to do
here is take level one data row and then
we are going to get look at that get
child rows method and then we specify
the name of the relationship so what is
the name of our relation child rows so
that should give us all the child rows
from the second table here okay and look
at the return type of this method what
is it returning it later it's returning
you know an array of data rows so let's
actually store that in a variable of
type data row array and let's call this
maybe level two data rows and now what
we need to do we need to loop through
each of this rows and then build menu
item objects dynamically again because
those are going to be child items for
this menu item object so let's use
another for each loop so for each data
row and let's call this maybe level two
data row in level two data rows
collection and again a child menu item
is also a menu item so menu item let's
call this child item equals new menu
item and obviously even the tail menu
item has got text and navigate URL
property so we need to set that as well
so child item dot text where are we
going to get the child item text from
level two data row
and in the stable you know these columns
are also menu text and navigate URL so
we don't have to change the column names
here so this has to be level two and
this has to be child item okay
so the most important thing here is to
associate this child item menu object to
this item and how do we do that this
menu item object has got child items
property so child items dot add the
chili tamatar
and then finally within this for each
loop what we need to do we need to add
this menu item to the menu control
itself and what is the ID of the menu
control its menu one so menu one dot
items dot add so we need to add the item
okay so pretty straightforward code
let's go ahead and run this but before
that we need to actually invoke this
method so let's invoke that in the page
load even handler so get menu items
should do all the work for us
alright so let's go ahead and run this
and see if it works in the same way but
now we are actually getting the menu
items from a database table instead of
from an XML file look at that you know
we are on the home page home page is
already selected and we discussed that
code in our previous session so if I
select admin we are on admin page and
admin menu item is selected alright and
this is the same code that we discussed
just now that's it for today thank you
for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
