in this video we'll discuss different
types of action result objects that can
be returned by an action method notice
that here we have the signature of a
typical action method within a
controller
notice that the return type of an action
method here is action result so anytime
we add an action method to a controller
by default the return type is going to
be action result this action result is
actually an abstract class
look at that it's an abstract class and
then there are several subtypes that
derive from this action result class
okay and you can see the complete list
here look at that there's something
called view is a partial view result
jason result so all of these are derived
types of action result now to arrive at
this list I have used a tool called il
spy this tool is extremely useful in
case if you want to decompile assemblies
and then inspect the source code if you
want to download the tool that's
available at this link so once you are
at that website click on this button
download binaries which should download
all the required assemblies in a zip
format expand them to a folder and then
within that folder you should see an
executable called il spy dot exe double
click that and the tool should run and
now we want to inspect this action
result class now this class is present
in an assembly called system dot web dot
MVC ok so we need to load this assembly
into this tool and system dot web dot
MVC is present in gag global assembly
cache so we need to open it from there
so click on file select open from drag
and then type the name of the assembly
system dot web dot MVC there are three
versions of this assembly let's pick up
the latest version which is dotnet I'm
in 4.0 click open that should load the
assembly into the tool and then notice
that this action result class is
actually present in this namespace
system dot web dot MVC
so let's go ahead and expand that
namespace and within that we should see
this class action result and then once I
expand this derived at types look at
that
I get the list of all derived types okay
so I can see Jason result I can say view
result partial view result and then look
at this one say double click that class
it's actually decompiling and I can look
at the source code okay and once I
expand this view result class look at
that I can expand base types and we know
the base type one of the base types is
action result okay so we have back at
this
so basically very handy tool in case if
you want to find out you know the D
compile the source code you can use this
tool not only that if you want to find
the list of all derived types for a
given base class you know extremely
useful tool okay now we know that there
are several subtypes that are deriving
from this action result class so the
obvious next question that comes to our
mind is why do we have so many subtypes
that's because depending on our project
requirement our action method may return
different objects for example we may
return a view okay so here if we look at
our controller action method the return
type here is action result and then here
we are invoking this view function and
if you look at the intellisense here
I'll look at the intellisense the return
type of this view function is few result
object okay now look at what is the
return type that we have specified
action result and we are actually
returning a view result object that's a
different object but then since these
two classes that is action result and
view result class are related by
inheritance so we can return the view
result object as the inherited type okay
so basically you know we may return a
view or we may return you know a
redirect result for example you know we
may redirect the users to a different
action but in within a different
controller if that's the case then
you have to return every direct result
object okay so for example when we use
this function redirect to action that's
that's what we use and then we specify
the name of the action and look at what
it is returning back look at the
intellisense redirect to route result
object okay so basically you know that's
another class which derives from our
base type which is action result okay so
there could be several things that we
return from an action method depending
on our project requirement and that's
the reason why we have so many subtypes
and the obvious next question that comes
to our mind is what should be the return
type of an action method you know should
it be the base type or should it be the
specific return type for example you
know I can return JSON data as well okay
so if we are returning you know data in
JSON format then I can leave the return
type as the base type or I can actually
change that to Jason result type the
specific type that this helper method is
returning so should we use the base type
or should we use the specific derived
type okay now in general it's a good
practice to return specific subtypes now
if you know that this index action is
always going to return a view then
rather than specifying the return type
as action result okay so if I if I know
this one is always going to return maybe
if view okay so obviously view function
will return a view result object okay so
if that's the case instead of leaving
the return type as action result use
view result object
okay so return the specific type but
there may be cases where depending on
conditions you may change the type of
the object that you return for example
if you have a condition and if that
condition is true then you want to
return a view that is a view result
object if that condition is false then
maybe maybe we want to return
jacent result object in that case you
know we cannot have two return types for
our action method so that's when you
know you can use the base type okay but
in all other cases I would say if I know
for sure we'll be returning a specific
type only from the action method then
it's better in order to specify that
specific type as the return type for our
action method and here is the list of
all you know these subtypes the type of
objects and then the helper methods that
are used to return that type of object
so for example if we want to return a
view result object look at that if I
want to return a view result object we
use the view helper method similarly if
I want to return a partial view result
object then we use partial view helper
function okay
if I want to return a piece of
JavaScript code that can be executed on
the client then bu you know basically
the object type is JavaScript result and
we use this JavaScript helper function
within the controller okay so this is
the list which can be useful to you
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
