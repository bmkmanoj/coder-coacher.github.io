this video we'll discuss passing data
from a Content page to a master page
this is continuation to part 147 so
please watch part 1 47 before proceeding
here we have a textbox control on the
master page and we have another textbox
control on the content page let's say we
enter some text here and then once I
click this button set text we want to
display this text in the textbox control
that we have on the master page so
essentially here we are passing data
from the content page to the master page
let's see how to achieve this first
let's design our master and content
pages we'll be working with the same
example that we worked with in the
previous session so let's flip to visual
studio so this is our master page side
master so we need a textbox control on
the master page so let's include an HTML
break here and then a textbox control
and let's give it an ID
txt on master page all right now let's
design our content page waveform to Tori
SP X so instead of this text here
please enter some text so this is going
to prompt the user to enter some text
and then let's include an HTML break and
then a text box here and a button
and let's change the text on the button
to set text all right so let's actually
navigate to their form to dot aspx and
see if we get the same design that we
have on the slide okay so there we go so
whatever text that we enter here and
then once I click this button we want to
display that text within the textbox
that we have on the master page to
achieve that the first tab is to include
a public property on the master page
which is going to expose the textbox
control so basically this property is
going to return that extra box control
that is present on the master page and
notice that this is a public property
and then our content pages will be able
to use that property and then set the
text property of this textbox control
so first let's include this public
property within the master page so
within the code-behind file of the
master page let's include a public
property so this property should return
the textbox control so the return type
is going to be textbox and let's call
this property textbox
on master page and let's include just
the get accessor so we want to return
which textbox this textbox that has got
this ID txt on masturbate so let's copy
this ID and return that from this
property
you can either simply say return this
text box or you can use this keyword
this dot look at that I get intellisense
as well
txt on master page now what does this
indicates here this indicates an
instance of this class so what is this
class site nothing but side dot master
so essentially your web forms and master
pages are nothing but classes okay so in
this class you know we have this textbox
control return that okay all right so we
have a public property now within the
content page we need to act
that property and then you know retrieve
this text box control and then set the
text property of that text box control
okay so let's navigate to waveform to
dot aspx let's flip this to the design
mode double click on the button to
generate the even handler all right here
we need to first access the master page
that is associated with this waveform so
how do we access that simply use master
property and look at what is this master
property returning its returning master
page object okay so now so on the master
bait that is associated with this
waveform you know we have a public
property and what is that public
property textbox on master page now look
at this when I press dot and then when I
say textbox on master page am I able to
access that property no I am NOT why is
that that's basically because this
master property is actually returning
master page object okay
so in order for us to be able to access
this property we need to typecast that
master page object to the actual master
page what is the actual master page for
this waveform tool its site dot master
okay and what does this master bait it's
nothing but a class so basically what
I'm going to do here is use the typecast
operator typecast this to be of type
site and then once we have type-cast at
that now look at this when we plus dot
we have access to that property text box
on masturbate and what is that property
returning look at the intellisense it's
returning a text box control all you
need to do is set the text property so
text of that property equals whatever
text that we have entered within text
box one control this text box one
control is present on the content page
it's as simple as that so let's actually
go ahead and run this and see it in
action
so let's say hello from content page and
then let's click this button look at
that we have passed the data from the
content page to the master page okay so
what did we do we first included a
public property in the master page which
is going to return the textbox control
and then on the content page we're using
that property and then setting the text
property of the textbox control that is
returned by this property okay but then
if you notice what we are doing here
you know this master property returns
master page object and we are explicitly
typecasting it to the actual master page
but then do we really have to do that
not really we can get a strongly typed
reference of the associated master page
as well and to do that use master type
directive so on the content page what we
can do is we can just like how we have
page directive we can specify master
type directive and then this directive
has got an attribute virtual part set
that to the master page that is
associated with this waveform okay so
once we have set this directive on the
content page then look at what's going
to happen let's comment this line when I
say master look at the intellisense what
is it returning back is it returning
master page object or site object it's
returning site object which is nothing
but the actual master page that is
associated with this waveform tool so
now when I say . look at that i get to
access that property directly without
having the need to typecast it so text
box on masked page dot text equals text
box 1 dot text
so our application should work in the
same manner it's just that now we are
using a strongly typed reference of the
master page look at that so once we have
a strongly typed reference you can
directly access the property without
having the need to typecast it now to
retrieve a master page associated with a
content page there are two ways we can
use either the master property which we
have been doing until now or we can also
use page dot master property so look at
this
instead of master property let's comment
this I can use page dot master and again
look at what that master property page
dot master property is returning it's
returning a master page object now if
you remember we have specified master
type directive on the content page but
when I use page dot master it's
returning master page object which means
we will have to typecast it to the
actual master page and then we should be
able to access the property okay so
basically that is the difference between
using master property and page dot
master property so when we use page dot
master property you know this property
is going to always return an object of
type master page object and because of
that we need to explicitly typecast it
to the actual master page if we need to
access its properties and methods
whereas master property returns a
strongly typed reference of the actual
master page if the content page has
master type directive specified we have
seen that just now otherwise master
property works in the same way as page
tour master property that's it for today
thank you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
