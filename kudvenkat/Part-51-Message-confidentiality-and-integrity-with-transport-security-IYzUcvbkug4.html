this video we'll discuss message
confidentiality and integrity with
Transport Security this is continuation
to part 50 so please watch but 50 before
proceeding in part 47 of this video
series we discussed message
confidentiality and integrity with
message based security out of the box WS
HTTP binding provides message based
security message based security
automatically encrypts and digitally
signs the messages to provide
confidentiality and integrity we have
practically seen this in part 47 by
inspecting the logged messages using the
service trace viewer out of the box net
TCP binding provides transport security
even with transport security all the
messages are encrypted and digitally
signed to provide confidentiality and
integrity let's understand this with an
example
that's flip to visual studio we'll be
working with the same example that we
worked with in the previous session so
we have built the simple service in the
previous session and if you look at the
configuration file notice the binding we
are using its net TCP binding and net
TCP binding implements security at the
transport layer let's go ahead and
enable message login for this WCF
service to do that click on the Tools
menu select WCF service configuration
editor and then open the config file and
to enable message log in click on the
Diagnostics folder enable log Auto flush
and enable message logging and then set
log entire message to true alright let's
go ahead and run our WCF service the
service is up and running now let's go
ahead and run the client application
let's issue a request and we got the
response back so both the request and
response messages should have been
locked now so let's go ahead and open
the service host project folder in
Windows Explorer and there we have the
service log file so let's go ahead and
open this log file
with Microsoft servicetrace Viewer
utility and the last message here is the
response message and if you look at the
messages tab here look at that this is
the body of the Swope and voila and then
surprisingly you know the message is in
plain text we expected this message to
be encrypted and digitally signed so why
is it in plain text the reason for that
is because you know the encryption and
the digital signature is applied at the
transport layer by the time the message
is arrived at this log it's already
decrypted that's the reason why we see
it in plain text that's it for today
thank you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
