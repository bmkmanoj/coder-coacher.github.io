tutorial in this video well discus
animating colors using jQuery with the
basic jQuery functionality
animate method cannot animate non
numeric style properties like color
background color border color etc jQuery
UI add support for animating colors and
class transitions let's understand this
with an example on the page right here
we've got a div element with an ID we
also said this style attribute we've set
with 200 pixels 1 pixel solid black
border padding of 5 pixels font size of
15 pixels we've got some text inside
this div element and then a break
element and important element so if we
view this HTML in the browser this is
how it looks like at the moment so when
we click this animate button we want to
apply some styles to this development
and animate them using the jQuery
animate function we want to try and
animate both numeric and non numeric
style properties so back in visual
studio within our jQuery ready function
I'm going to create a variable let's
call this toggle color and I'm going to
initialize this to false and then when
we click this button that's when we want
those animations to happen
so let's hook up a click event handler
to this button the ID of the button is
BTN
animate so let's use the jQuery ID
selector find the button element and
associate a click event handler so
inside this click event handler what I'm
going to do is create another variable
and I'm going to call this development
and let's find the development using its
ID the ID of the development is my day
and I'm going to check the value of this
variable so it's a boolean variable so
it contains basically true or false if
it is true then what we want to do is
find the development and animate it
using the jQuery animate function
so the first parameter that I'm going to
pass to this function is a JavaScript
object which is going to contain the
style properties that we want to animate
so what are the properties that we want
to animate we want to animate let's say
font size so we want to change the font
size to 15 pixels that is a numeric
style property and similarly I also want
to change border width property again
border width is a numeric property I
want to change it to 1 pixel and I also
want to change background color and
let's change background color to red
this is a non numeric property this is a
color property and we also want to
change color the foreground color to
white and finally let's also change
border color and we want to change
border color to green okay so if toggle
color if that is true then we want to do
that else we want to do a similar thing
but we want to slightly change the
values of these style properties so
let's make a copy of this and let's
change font size to 20 pixels bored of
it to 5 pixels let's change the
background color to green font color to
white and border color to red okay so if
it is true you know if toggle color
variable is true do this if it is false
do this ok all this is happening inside
the click event handler and what I'm
going to do is when I click the button
once you know the first time the
struggle' color variable is going to be
false so it comes here it checks this
condition so this variable is false so
it's going to come to the else part
apply these styles animate them and then
what I want to do is change the value of
this variable to opposite of what it is
currently so inside that click event
handler I'm going to say
toggle color equals not of toggle color
so what is this going to do if the
variable value at the moment is true
it's going to apply a naught so it's
going to make it false if it is false it
will change it to true all right so with
all these changes let's reload our page
and look at what's going to happen when
we click this animate button so look at
that it has animated all the numeric
style properties right font size is
changed
what of it is also changed but look at
the non numeric style properties that is
the color properties the background
color is not applied foreground color
that is the font color is not changed
and even the border color it's not
changed okay that's basically because if
you look at our jQuery code right here
so here we have the jQuery code and the
script file that here we have referenced
is just a basic jQuery file we don't
reference the jQuery UI file so jQuery
UI add support for color animations and
class transitions so if you want to
animate colors using the jQuery animate
function then you need to reference the
jQuery UI file and I have already
referenced that within my project but we
need to reference that on this page so
I'm going to simply drag and drop that
jQuery UI file on this page so now let's
go ahead and save the changes reload
this page and look at this when we click
the animate button now the colors are
also applied the background color is
change to green font color is changed to
white border color is changed to red if
I click the button again look at that
background color for Ella and border
color all the colors are changed and at
the moment you know it's using the
default time for animation you can
change the time if you want using the
second parameter of the animate function
which is speed let's specify the speed
in milliseconds let's specify that as
2000 milliseconds
now all these animations should complete
over a period of 2000
milliseconds look at that it takes like
two seconds to complete those animations
so here is the example that we just
discussed in our next video we'll
discuss an example of class transitions
thank you for listening and have a great
