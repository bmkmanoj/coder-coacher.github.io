fainted in this video I let you know
some simple tips and tricks to effect
will use this YouTube channel here's the
link for my youtube channel youtube.com
for /good vented once you type this URL
in a browser window and then once you
hit enter you will land on this page
where you can find links for videos
playlists etc once you click on this
playlist link you will be redirected to
another page where you can find all the
playlists for example here we can find
WCF asp.net web services c-sharp etc now
if I want to find all the asp.net MVC
videos in a logical sequence then I
would go for asp.net MVC tutorial for
beginners so within this playlist notice
that we have all the asp.net MVC videos
in a logical sequence now let's say
you're looking for a specific video or a
specific concept there are two ways you
can find that the best way is to
actually use the search channel
functionality and to get the search
channel functionality on any of the
youtube channel pages just below the
banner notice that you have got this
magnifying glass click on that
magnifying glass that will provide you
with an interface to enter your search
term that's a for example we are looking
for something called polymorphism so we
enter that search term and then click on
that magnifying glass so within this
channel it's going to bring up all the
videos that has this word with the net
polymorphism and look at that here the
first one is polymorphism in c-sharp the
video that we are looking for okay
that's one way another way is to
actually use you know the browser search
functionality let's say for example with
an asp.net MVC I'm looking for HTML
helpers okay so I go to the asp.net MVC
tutorial for beginners playlist and
while I am on that playlist I will press
ctrl F so that will bring up the browser
search interface and let's say here we
type HTML helpers notice that there are
at the moment for matches and here the
first video is HTML helpers in MVC and
there are other videos as well which has
got
that are birds within their title okay
and then Isaac keep pressing the down
arrow it will highlight the respective
video okay so that's another way to find
the video that you're looking for
now slides go samples and text version
of the videos all or on my blog and here
is the link for my blog c-sharp - video
- tutorials dot blog spot.com now when
you navigate to that blog on the right
hand side you will find you know two
sections dotnet video tutorials and
slides and a dotnet video tutorials
notice that you've got WC I have asp.net
web services dotnet basics etc now let's
say for example I want asp.net related
text version of the videos and code
samples I simply click on asp.net link
there so that will open up this page
right here and on this page basically we
have all the parts you know whatever so
if you look at this page right here look
at that all the parts are in logical
sequence here for example if we want to
know about list controls in asp.net I
click on that link that is going to take
us to another page and on this page
basically we have the text version of
the video okay and any code samples that
we have used will also be available on
that page and then if you look at the
other section right here you know which
is slides basically if I go to for
example asp.net here on that page on
this page you will find all the links
for asp.net related videos and the
slides can be found in those pages for
example if I click on XP dotnet page
lifecycle events on this page you know
we will have these slides belonging to
that video okay so there are the slides
and then once I click on any of the
image it's going to open up you know
those images I can use the left and
right arrow keys to navigate to the rest
two images and if you want to download
this images simply right-click on any of
the image select this option save image
as and you know specify where you want
to save that okay all right so on my
blog you have slides code samples and
extra version of the videos now I record
videos on a daily basis so if you want
to receive email alerts when I upload
new videos please feel free to subscribe
to my channel and subscribing it's very
easy on the YouTube channel homepage you
have just below the banner you have this
subscribe button once you click on that
subscribe button you'll be redirected to
a page where it will prompt you to enter
your Gmail username and password once
you provide that you are subscribed and
any time I plot a new video you are
going to receive an email alert now a
lot of you have complained that you know
in spite of subscribing you're not
actually receiving email alerts that
would basically be because the email
alerts are you know coming to into your
spam folder so please check your spam
folder if you find the email there
market as not spam
so that next time onwards you will
receive them right to your inbox and if
you find a video useful and if you
really like it you know please express
your liking by clicking on that video
for example let's say if I you know
click on this for example video
obviously just beneath the video there
is this like button so if you like the
video please express so by clicking on
that like button that's a motivation for
me to record more and more videos and to
teach is to learn I strongly believe in
this concept so obviously as this
YouTube channel is growing I am finding
it extremely difficult to answer all the
questions that are posted by your
YouTube subscribers
so obviously I'm unable to keep up with
the number of questions that are coming
in so if you know an answer for a
specific question and if you have time
please feel free to answer those
questions so by by helping others you
are also learning new things by that I
mean to answer you know a specific
question if you don't know the on
so already you will do some research and
along the process you will learn a lot
of things so basically just below the
YouTube video you will find lots of user
questions and comments so if you know an
answer for a specific question please
feel free to answer them and if you
think these videos can help others as
well please feel free to share them here
is the link for the playlist you know
basically where we can find all the
videos in logical sequence so please
feel free to share this link with your
family and friends are you know on your
social network so that they can also
benefit from this videos finally coding
is fun
so enjoy programming thank you for
listening that's it for today have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
