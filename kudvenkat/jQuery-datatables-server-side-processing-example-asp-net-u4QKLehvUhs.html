in this video well disk is implementing
server-side processing for jQuery data
tables plugin this is continuation two
parts 109 and 110 in part 109 we
discussed implementing a stored
procedure that can perform paging
sorting and filtering and in part 110 we
implemented asp.net generic handler that
calls the stored procedure retrieves the
data and converts the data to JSON
format in this video well disc is how to
display that JSON formatted data using
jQuery data tables plug-in so here is
the request response cycle between those
three components so the jQuery data
tables plug-in is going to issue a
request to the asp.net January canler
the asp.net generic hand level then
called the database stored procedure
retrieves the data and converts that
data to JSON format and then that JSON
formatted data will then be displayed by
the jQuery data tables plug-in on the
web page so let's look at that in action
let's flip to Jerome so this is the same
example that we worked with in the
previous video session notice here we
have our employee data handler that we
implemented in the previous video
session so this generic handler is
calling the stored procedure SP get
employees I've also added a webform to
this project and within the body section
I've included an HTML table I've given
it an ID data table and then within the
head section in that table I've included
the headers for our table so basically
we want ID first name last name gender
and job title column headers so that's
what I have specified within the P head
section here now within our jQuery ready
function let's find this data table
using the jQuery ID selector and on that
let's call data table function and we
need to specify our options so the first
thing that we need to do is specify the
columns that we want to bind to so
basically if you look at what this
handler is doing so it's actually
returning us you know this object result
so
what are we doing with that object we
are serializing that to JSON format and
if you look at this a data property
it contains list of employees and if you
look at each of the employee object
notice that these are the properties
that are present in that object ID first
name last name gender job title so here
what we are going to do is specify the
properties that we want to bind to okay
and we specify that using columns so
columns this is going to be an array and
this is going to be an array of JSON
objects so data and the first property
that I want to bind to is ID so because
if you look at what we have in the
header first we have ID then first name
last name gender and job title okay so
let's specify the other properties that
we want to bind to so ID first name last
name gender and finally job title okay
so those are the columns and the next
thing that I want to specify is
server-side processing so we want to
basically tell jQuery data tables
plug-in that you know we want
server-side processing and we do that
using be server-side option so the B
letter here before that option name
specifies that it is a boolean option
meaning we can either set to true or
false so since we want suicide
processing I'm going to set it to true
and it's not enough if you just specify
that you want server-side processing we
also want to tell it about the resource
that is going to provide the data that
is the server-side data in our case this
employee data handler is the one which
will provide us the required data that
is the sorted filtered and paged data we
specify that using s Ajax
source again s in front of the option
name specifies that this is a string
option meaning you know we need to
provide a string value and you know the
employee data handler is the external
resource that's going to provide us the
data that this plug-in requires that's
it so those are the three options that
we need to specify so let's save our
changes let's go ahead and run this and
it should retrieve the server-side data
look at that in the table we've got 14
rows so let's go ahead and select all
the rows from the table so notice that
we've got 14 rows in the table all the
14 rows are displayed and look at this
when I click on first name the data is
sorted by first name so all this
processing now is happening on the
server side the stored procedure is
doing this for us
similarly when I click on the first name
again the data is sorted in the
descending order by first name sort by
gender look at that similarly sort by
job title and the filtering should also
work look at this for example if I type
female within the DB we have got four
females and look at that it displays all
the full female employees and look at
what the status says here showing one
two four or four entries filtered from
14 total entries so how does the data
tubule know about this that is from
these two options that we have specified
the total records that we have in the
table and the filtered count now if we
type for example you know s R look at
that it displays all the senior
developers there are eight senior
developers it says one to eight of eight
entries filtered from 14 total entries
and look at this the moment I start
deleting them the data in that table is
dynamically updated and paging should
also work so on the first page we have
one to ten rows let's click on ID look
at that data is sorted by ID in
ascending order one to ten rows
when I click on the second page we
should get from 11 to 14 and look at the
status text here so paging sorting
filtering everything is working as
expected
all this processing is being done on the
silver side by by our stored procedure
so in this video here we're using the
employee data handler I mean this is the
asp.net generic handler so we are
implementing server-side processing
using asp.net generic handler in our
next video we'll discuss how to do the
server-side processing using asp.net web
servers so here is the HTML code and the
jQuery code now if you look at this
table we have the column names only in
the header if you want them in the
footer as well then what you can do is
include tee food section and specify the
column names there as well so let's save
our changes reload this page now we
should get column names both in the
header and footer so the HTML here and
the Tegrity code thank you for listening
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
