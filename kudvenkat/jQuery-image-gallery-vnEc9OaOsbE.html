this video we'll discuss how to create
an image gallery with thumbnails using
jQuery here is what we want to achieve
notice we've got five image thumbnails
when we click on any of the image
thumbnail we want that image to be
displayed in the main image section we
discussed how to achieve exactly the
same thing using raw JavaScript in part
41 of JavaScript tutorial in this video
we'll discuss how to achieve this using
jQuery so let's flip to visual studio
here I have an asp.net web application
project to this project let's go ahead
and add a new folder and let's name this
images and for the purpose of this demo
we're going to make use of these five
images on any Windows machine you can
find these images at this path I'll have
this path available on my blog so let's
copy these five images and paste them
into the images folder in our project so
we've got the required images now within
the body section we want this main image
element section so let's create an image
element and let's give it an ID let's
actually call this main image and let's
set the height of this to 500 pixels and
width to 540 pixels and we also want a
three pixel solid gray border
so let's actually set that as the value
for border and let's set the source of
this image element to the first image in
this images folder so source equals
images for slash the first image and
let's include a break element and then
we want these five thumbnail images so
I'm actually going to wrap those
thumbnails in the development so let's
create a development and let's give this
an ID let's call this div container
and this development is going to contain
five image elements so image and the
source of the first image element is
going to be the first image within this
images folder so images for slash you
know the first image and we want the
height of the thumbnail to be hundred
pixels width also to be hundred pixels
and we wanted three pixel solid gray
border around each thumbnail I'm
actually going to create a class for
that so within the head section let's
include a section for style and I'm
going to call this image style so we
want height to be 100 pixels width to be
100 pixels and border of 3 pixels solid
gray all right
so let's set the style plus for this
image element I'm going to set that to
image style okay and we have to do that
for these four images as well in the
interest of time I have already typed
the required HTML so let's copy that and
paste it right here so we've got the
other four image elements we have the
class set to image style and the source
set to respect to image within the
images folder so let's save the changes
and let's reload this page and look at
this we should get the main image
section and the image thumbnails okay
now what we want to do is when we hover
the mouse over any thumbnail we want to
change the border around thumbnail to in
a red color and we want this cursor
style to be changing to a hand symbol so
let's see how to achieve that a nun
mouse out we want to lose those styles
and when we click on the thumbnail we
want that image to be displayed within
the main image section so basically we
are going to bind three events to each
image thumbnail mouse over Mouse out and
click so within the script section so
with no already function we want to find
all these image elements so these image
elements are present inside a
development with ID
container so within our jQuery ready
function find a div with ID div
container and within that we have some
image elements nested so I want all
those image elements so here we are
using ancestor descendant syntax find
all image elements that are the
descendants of this development and we
are going to use on function and we are
going to bind three event handlers okay
so I'm going to use the JSON object so
the first event that I want to bind is
mouse over so mouse over what we want to
do we want to call a function and what
do we want this function to do we want
to change the border and we also want to
change the cursive style so I'm going to
find you know the image element on which
we mouse over we're going to use this
keyword for that so this will refer to
the element on which we have moused over
and we are going to use CSS function and
we want to change two styles so I'm
going to use JSON object again and what
styles do we want to change we want to
change cursor style and we want the
cursor to be pointer and we also want to
change the border color so border -
color and we want that to be red
all right so on mouse-over we want to
change those styles and similarly we
want to bind Mouse out as well so Mouse
out we want to call a function and again
with Mouse out we want to change the
cursor back to default and border color
to gray so I'm going to copy that
and change the cursor to default and
border color to gray and finally when we
click on the thumbnail what do we want
to do we want to display the thumbnail
image within the main image section so
we want to now bind a click event
handler so first what do we want to do
we want to retrieve the image URL from
the thumbnail so I'm going to create a
variable here I am going to call this
image URL equals dollar this so here
this represents the thumbnail image on
which we click and we want the source
attribute value so I'm going to use a
TTL function and then the attribute
value that we want is source so that's
going to give us the image URL because
the source attribute has caught the
image water and that will be present in
this variable now we want to set that as
the image URL for the main image element
and this main image element has got an
ID so I'm going to find that image
element by ID so dollar and the ID is
main image and we want to set this
source I mean the source attribute of
the main image element again using the
attr function and the value of that is
going to be this variable image URL all
right so that's all there to it let's
save the changes let's reload this page
and look at this when we mouse over we
get that red border and look at the
cursor style its hand once we click that
the image is displayed within the main
image similarly when I click on this we
get that ok so the image gallery is
working as X
affected now look at this when we click
on a thumbnail the image is instantly
displayed within the main image section
now if you want some animation effects
like if you want the old image to slowly
fade out and then the new image to
slowly fade in you can use fade out and
fade in functions as well so let's see
how to achieve those animations so here
on this main image element I'm going to
call fade out function okay so what is
this going to do this going to you know
slowly fade out that image and let's say
we want that fade out to happen over a
period of 300 milliseconds and when that
happens we want to call a function and
once the old image is faded out what do
we want to do we want to set you know
this main image element source to the
source of the image that is present
within the thumbnail so here I notice
I'm going to use again this key word so
this key word here refers to the main
image element because we're using this
within the context of this main image
element so dollar this and I'm going to
set source attribute value and for that
we are using the attr function source
and the source is going to be this
variable which contains the thumbnail
image URL okay so that is going to set
the URL image URL for the main image
element and we want that new image to
slowly fade in so I'm going to call fade
in here and b1 that fade in to happen or
a period of 300 milliseconds so let's
save the changes let's reload this page
and look at this when we click on a
thumbnail now we get the animation you
know the image slowly fades out and the
new image slowly fits in and here is
that example which we just discussed in
our next video we'll discuss how to make
this image gallery a little more
efficient using the concept of event

have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
