this video we'll discuss jQuery select
menu widget with examples jQuery select
menu widget duplicates and extends the
functionality of a native HTML select
element to overcome the limitations of
the native control so if you look at the
HTML here we've got a select element if
set the style attribute to control the
width of this select element to 200
pixels and within the Select element
we've got five different options so
basically we have got five countries
here and notice each option has got a
value and a label label is what the end
user sees and if you look at the second
option here we also have set this
selected attribute to selected so if we
view this HTML in a browser you know
this is how it looks like so we will get
a drop-down list so here we're not using
any jQuery so this select element will
be rendered as a drop-down list and
since we have said this second option
attribute selected to select it by
default when this drop-down list is
rendered India will be selected so I
have this exact same HTML already typed
on this waveform so if we view this page
in the browser this is how it looks like
and notice by default India is selected
so here we are not using any sort of
jQuery now let's go ahead and see how to
use the jQuery menu widget so to use the
jQuery menu widget we'll have to find
the Select element so let's find it
using its ID so within our jQuery ready
function I'm going to use the jQuery ID
selector find the Select menu and on
that I'm going to call jQuery UI select
menu function so let's save our changes
reload this page and look at what is
going to happen to this drop-down list
so this is jQuery select menu widget now
here our jQuery is not doing anything
big it is just applying some styles to
the drop-down list now let's look at an
example of using select element with opt
group elements now first let's
understand what is the use of opt group
element the author group element is used
to group relay
options in a drop-down list and if you
look at the example right here notice
that we have two groups the first group
is country USA and that group has
options belonging to country USA so in
this example we have cities belonging to
USA within the first optic group in the
second up group we have cities belonging
to India so these option group elements
are especially useful if you have large
number of options in the drop-down list
now with this HTML this is how you know
the drop-down list will be rendered so
we have a group USA there and under USA
we have two cities and then we have
another group India under that we have
got two cities so from these options you
can only select the members of a group
but not the group itself so let's look
at this in action so again I have this
HTML already typed in the interest of
time so let's go ahead and copy that
HTML and paste it here now at the moment
we don't have the style attribute set so
let's go ahead and set the style
attribute so style equals with two let's
set it to 200 pixels so let's go ahead
and save our changes reload this page
and look at this we have country USA I
am not able to select that group itself
but I can only select the options
underneath that group you know in this
case New York and Los Angeles similarly
I can select the cities of India but not
India itself okay so here we're using
jQuery select menu if we don't use the
jQuery select menu so let's comment out
that line and when we reload this page
you know here it is using the native
select element and this is how it will
be rendered the styles are not applied
by jQuery now let's look at an example
of changing the button icon so first
let's understand what is this drop-down
list button icon now as far as jQuery
select menu is concerned the button icon
is the image that you
see on the right hand side here notice
that it is circled now by default the
button icon is this UI - I can -
triangle - 1 - s so that's the name of
the icon for the list of all jQuery
icons visit this URL so when we visit
that URL we can see all the icons that
we can use with this drop-down list
ok now the default icon so let's go
ahead and uncomment this line save the
changes and let's reload this page so
now jQuery has applied the Styles and
look at this we have a knight in here
that's the default icon now for some
reason let's say I want to change that
to something else
then you can use icons option so if you
look at the images that we have here so
we've got several images now let's say
for example we want to associate this
icon to the drop-down list button to do
that I am going to use icons option and
again I'm going to use another
JavaScript object and I want to change
the button icon to that image so let's
save our changes and let's go - and
reload this page and look at this it
should change the icon now we have a
downward pointing arrow now to control
the width of the select menu we can use
width option at the moment to control
the width of this drop-down list right
here we're using the style attribute now
if I don't use the style attribute then
you know we have no way of controlling
its width but if you want to control it
using the jQuery style then you can use
the width option so along with the icons
option I'm going to use width and I'm
going to set maybe the width of this one
to 300 pixels so we specify the width in
pixels so let's save our changes and
reload this page and look at that now we
have the width of this drop-down list to
300 pixels so you can either use the
style attribute
or you can use the jQuery wit option of
the Select menu now let's look at an
example of retrieving the selected item
value and labor so if you look at each
option right here it has got a label and
a value now whenever we select a value
from the drop-down list I mean any item
that we select we want its value as well
as label okay so how do we do that to
retrieve the selected item texts and
value you can use the Select event so
when is the select event fired this is
fired whenever you select an item from
the menu so let's go ahead and retrieve
the selected item text and value so I'm
going to hook up this select event
handler function so I'm using the select
option here and we are going to
associate a function the this function
will be called in response to that event
and this even handler function is going
to receive two parameters the event
object itself and the UI element that
triggered the event in this case the UI
element that trigger the event is the
Select menu itself so what I'm going to
do here is use the JavaScript alert
function and we have the UI element and
on that I'm going to call item and to
get the label we use label property and
let's append a string to that so label
equals whatever we get from that
property and to that lets up in this
space and then we want value so value
equals again to get the value I can use
UI dot item dot value property so let's
save our changes and reload this page
look at this when we select Los Angeles
we get label it's Los Angeles value
equals two similarly when we select
Bangalore we get the label and the value
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
