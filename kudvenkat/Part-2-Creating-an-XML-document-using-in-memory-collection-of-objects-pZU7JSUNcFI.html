in this video we'll discuss creating an
XML document using n memory collection
of objects in part 1 of this video
series we discussed creating this XML
document by hard coding these XML
elements in code if you recollect the
example that we worked with in the
previous video session notice that
student data is hard-coded within the
application in real-time applications
data usually resides in a database table
there are several data access
technologies that are available today to
retrieve data from the database for
example we could use a do dotnet or link
to sequel or entity framework once the
application has retrieved data from the
database then the application may use
data structures like arrays less queues
etc to store that data in memory for
processing for the purpose of this demo
let's assume that we already have the
student data retrieved from the database
and the application is storing it n NR a
and now what we want to do is create
this XML document from that array of
student objects using linked to XML so
let's see how to achieve this let's flip
to visual studio so this is the same
example that we worked with in the
previous video session the first thing
that you are going to do here is add a
class file to this project and let's
name this student dot CS to speed things
up I have already implemented the code
required for this class so let's copy it
from the notepad and paste it within
this class so this class is
straightforward here we've got four
properties ID name gender and total
marks in addition we also have this get
all students method which returns an
array of student objects and within the
method we are creating a student array
here which is initialized to four which
means we can store for student objects
within that array and here are those for
student objects and the method finally
returns that array back in reality we
will have a do or net or linked to
sequel or some sort of data access code
here to retrieve this data from the
database but to keep things simple I've
just hard-coded student data within this
method so now what we want to do
is whatever student objects that this
method is returning we want to use link
to XML and convert the students into an
XML document so let's see how to achieve
that so within our main method so this
code is going to stay the same so we
still need the XML declaration we still
need that XML comment and the root
element within the XML is going to be
students and then within students root
element record student child elements
and each student child element has got
name gender and total marks child
elements so we want to create the same
kind of structure so the code until here
is not going to change let's remove this
hard-coded student data from here and
I'm going to keep these two closing
brackets here because the first closing
bracket is actually going to close this
root element and the second closing
bracket loses this XML document
constructor okay so here we are going to
write a link very so let's bring in
system dot link namespace so system dot
length and let's call the variable
student n we have got our student class
get all students so this method is going
to give us an array of student objects
so what we want to do with that student
objects is select a new X element so
here is the route students element
within that we want a child student
element and student element has got an
ID attribute so we are going to create a
new instance of X attribute so this
class help us create the XML attribute
so the name of the attribute is going to
be ID now where are we going to get the
student ID from from this student object
so student dot ID property should give
us that and each student element has got
name gender and total marks elements
okay so we are going to create an
instance of X element again and then the
name of the element is going to be named
and we need to get student name so for
that we are going to use the student
object again and then use the name
property similarly we want gender and
total marks so gender and we are going
to use the gender property of the
student object and finally total marks
all right so we are going to close this
student element here this closes the
root element and this closes the final
XML document so that's all there to it
so what is this going to do it's going
to take each student object and then
create a student element under this
students root element okay so let's
click on the show all files notice that
we already have data XML so let's go
ahead and delete that first and then
let's pin this down let's run our
application so let's say show all files
once again notice that we have our data
dot XML there and notice that we have
the exact same XML so this is all the
code that is required to create an XML
document from an array of objects that's
it for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
