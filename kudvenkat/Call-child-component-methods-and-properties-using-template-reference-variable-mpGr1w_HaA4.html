in this video we will discuss how to
call a child component properties and
methods from parent component using a
template reference variable one way to
do this is by using an output property
well discussed using output properties
in detail in our previous video in part
37 another way to do this is by using a
template reference variable so let's
understand this with an example
here is what we want to do when we click
on any of these employee panels right
here we want to display the respect to
employee name and gender in an h1
element in the parent component so from
the child component we want to pass the
respective employees name and gender to
the parent component so the parent
component can display in an h1 element
but is how to do this in our previous
video using an output property in this
video well discuss how to do exactly the
same thing but using a template
reference variable instead at the moment
in our child component that is this
display employee component we have a
known property called
notify we using this output property to
pass employee name and gender to the
parent component we don't need this
output property anymore so I'm going to
delete this first we also don't need
this handle click let's delete that as
well and the respective types output and
even Tomita from the import statement
right here next in the view template of
our child component we don't need to
handle this click event anymore so let's
delete this as well in our parent
component that is this list employees
component class we don't need the state
of from child property and we also don't
need this handle notify even handler
finally in the view template of our
parent component we don't need to bind
to the notify event of the child
component anymore we also don't need
this ngf structural directive on the h1
element and we don't need this binding
expression so this completes remove the
code related to the output property that
we created in our previous video now
let's quickly make sure we don't have
any
violation errors notice now when we
click on any of these employee panels we
don't see their name and gender
displayed right here in an h1 element
that's because we remove the output
property that was capable of doing that
now let's also launch browser developer
tools just to make sure we don't have
any errors on the console tab there we
go we don't have any errors now what we
want to do is the same thing pass the
name and gender from this child
component to the parent component so the
parent component can display in the h1
element right here but we want to do
this using a template reference variable
in the view template of our parent
component that is our list employees
component the first thing that I'm going
to do is create a template reference
variable that points to our child
component to create a template reference
variable we use the hash sign and then
give it a meaningful name I'm going to
name it child component we can now use
this template reference variable to call
any of the child components public
properties and methods but before we do
that let's understand what we are trying
to achieve here now whenever we click on
any of the employee panels right here we
want to pass a respect to employee name
and gender to the parent component now
we know it is this child component that
is displaying these employee panels
right here so what I'm going to do is
grab this child component inside another
development so let's include a
development right here and then move the
closing there to the end let's format
this code a bit so now we have this
development surrounding each of these
employee panels whenever we click
anywhere on this employee panel we want
to pass employee name and gender to the
parent component so what I'm going to do
is wire up a click event handler on this
development so what do we want to do
when there's a click on the employee
panel we want to use this child
component template reference variable
and call it public property within our
child component so if we take a look at
our child component notice it has caught
this public
the employee and this is the property
that we want to call using the child
component template reference variable we
know this property has got the name
property which is going to give us the
name of the employee - this
let's append single-spaced and then we
want the gender of the employee so we
are again going to use the template
reference variable and then the employee
public property and then we want the
gender so what do we want to do with
this name and gender string well we want
to display this using this h1 element
right here so let's include a template
reference variable on this h1 element
I'm going to call it h1 variable now we
are going to use this template reference
variable and use its inner HTML property
to display the name and gender string
within the h1 element so we have pretty
straightforward code here first we are
creating a template reference variable
on our child component we are then using
the template reference variable to
retrieve the employee name and gender
string and then assigning that to this
h1 element when we click on the employee
panel so let's save our changes and then
take a quick look at the browser notice
now when we click on an employee panel
we see that respective employee's name
and gender displayed as expected at the
moment we are calling the public
property of our child component from the
parent component using this template
reference variable calling a public
method is very similar let's look at a
quick example first within our child
component let's create a public method
I'm going to name it get employee name
and gender this method is going to
return a string so I'm going to set the
return type to string so we want to
return employee name separated by a
single space and then the employee
gender so we want to call this method
from our parent component so let's copy
the name and within our parent component
insert of all this code right here let's
call the public method get employee name
and gender using
the template reference variable child
component let's save all these changes
and then take a quick look at the
browser notice even now it works exactly
the same way as before so to call child
component of public properties and
methods from the parent component using
a template reference variable first we
create the respective public properties
and methods in our child component in
our case we have this employee property
and ask at name and gender method next
in the parent component create a
template reference variable on the child
component using that template reference
variable we can call any of the public
properties or methods in the child
component so there are two ways to pass
data from the child component to the
parent component we can either use
output properties or template reference
variables with output properties there
are several moving parts in the child
component we first need to create a
custom event we then need to raise that
custom event from the parent component
we need to bind to the child component
custom event and handle it with a
template reference variable approach we
do not have so many moving parts
we just need to declare a template
reference variable on the tailed
component and then use that to call the
tale the component public properties and
methods now in our application we don't
need this template reference variable
code so let's go ahead and delete that
we don't need this h1 element we don't
need this in a development and a no
change component we don't need this
method
that's it in this video thank you for
watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
