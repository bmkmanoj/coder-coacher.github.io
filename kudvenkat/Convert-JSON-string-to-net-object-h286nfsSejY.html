this video we'll discuss how to convert
a dotnet object to a JSON string and
adjacent string to a dotnet object in
dotnet we have caught a class called
JavaScript serializer this class is
present in system dot web dot script dot
serialization namespace this class has
got this he realized method which is
going to convert a dotnet object to a
JSON string let's understand this with
an example we'll be using this employee
class in this demo notice this class has
got four public properties first-name
lastname gender and salary first let's
create this employee class let's flip to
visual studio to this project let's add
a new class file and let's name this
employee dot cs and in the interest of
time I have already typed all these for
public properties in a notepad so let's
copy them and paste within the employee
class so we have got the employee class
with the four public properties and I
have also added this webform one dot
aspx to our project so let's get to the
code-behind file so within the page load
event let's create two instances of this
employee class so we want to create two
instances like this look at that we are
populating all the properties of the
employee class again in the interest of
time I have typed the code required to
create these two employee objects so
let's copy that from the notepad and
paste it within the page load event of
our code behind file so we have created
two employee objects now let's go ahead
and create a list of employee so list of
employee and let's call this list
employee equals new list of employee and
to the list let's add the two employee
objects that we have created so we want
to add employee one and employee to
alright now we want to convert this list
of employees
Jason strain and to do that we are going
to make use of JavaScript serializer
class and this class is present in
system dot web dot script dot
serialization namespace so now let's go
ahead and create an instance of our
JavaScript serialize at last and let's
call the instance also JavaScript
serializer equals new javascript
serializer and this class has got
serialize method which is going to
convert a dotnet object to a json string
and this serialized method we are going
to pass our list of employee object so
this list at the moment contains two
employee objects and we want both the
employee objects which are dotnet
objects to be converted to a JSON string
and if you look at the serialized method
look at what it is required returning
back it's actually returning a string
back which is nothing but a JSON string
so let's store that in a variable of
type string and let's call it JSON
string and finally let's write the value
that is present within the JSON string
to a web page so let's pass JSON string
to the response tort write method let's
go ahead and run this page so the two
employee objects which are dotnet
objects should be converted to a JSON
string look at that we get the JSON
string back ok so now let's see how to
do the opposite let's see how to convert
this JSON string to a dotnet object so
to convert a JSON string to a dotnet
object we use the same class which is
JavaScript serializer but this class has
got another method which is deserialized
so this method is going to convert a
JSON string to a dotnet object so let's
see how to do that so I have copied this
JSON string and if you look at the JSON
string that we have just copied we've
got a lot of double quotes within that
now within c-sharp
double quotes have got a special meaning
so let's create a string variable first
and let's call this jason
string equals so double quotes in
c-sharp indicates the beginning and end
of his string and if you look at this
jason string it already has double
quotes but those are part of that string
so we don't want that to be treated as a
beginning or end of the string so we
need to escape that so let's replace all
double quotes with backslash double
quote so we want to escape those double
quotes so ctrl H and then I want to
replace double coat with backslash
double quote so replace all instances so
I'm going to copy this string and paste
it within our visual studio okay so the
first double quote here indicates the
beginning of our Jason string and the
last double quote indicates the end of
the string whatever double quotes we
have here are part of this string
because they are preceded by a backslash
so we are escaping that backslash I mean
double quote
so we have our JSON string now now we
want to convert this JSON string to a
dotnet object we know that this jason
string contains you know two employee
objects so we want to construct a list
of employee object you know using this
JSON string and for that we are going to
make use of you know the deserialized
method of the java scripts utilize
serializer class so let's create an
instance of this javascript serialize a
class and we are going to use
deserialized method okay and if you look
at this deserialized method that's got
two parameters the first parameter is
the input string so let's pass our JSON
string as an input parameter and there
is a second parameter as well we have to
specify the type of the resulting object
so this JSON string will be converted to
a dotnet object so we have to specify
what is the type of that dotnet object
going to be in our case it's going to be
list of employee so list of employee and
you know we need to get the type of that
so
we need to use type of keyword so type
off list of employee and look at what
the what this deserialized method is
returning it's returning an object back
so we know that it is actually returning
a list of employee back so we need to
type gas that to be of that type list of
employee and let's store that in a
variable of that type and let's call it
list employee okay so now this list will
contain the two employee objects that is
the dotnet objects now let's go ahead
and loop through each employee object
within that list and then print out the
values of first name last name gender
and salary so let's use a for each loop
for each we know that in the list we
have an employee object so for each
employee in list employee so let's spawn
start right we want to write you know
the property name first name equals and
to that let's append employee dot first
name and an HTML break so we get each
property value on a separate line so
let's make three more copies of this and
next we want to get last name gender and
finally celery and then let's retrieve
the respective properties so last name
gender and salary okay now we have got
two employee objects so for this last
property you know let's include the HTML
breaks okay so let's save those changes
and freed on the page look at that we
get both the employee objects back and
we are retrieving first-name lastname
gender and salary property values so
serialized method is going to convert
a dotnet object to a JSON string whereas
the deserialized method is going to
convert a JSON string to a dotnet object
and these methods belong to JavaScript
serializer class and this class is
present in system dot web dot script dot
serialization namespace thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
