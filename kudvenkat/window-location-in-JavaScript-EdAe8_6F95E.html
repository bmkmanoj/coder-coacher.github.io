in this video we'll discuss the use of
location object the vendor dot location
property returns a location object that
can be used to get information about the
current page this property can also be
used to redirect the browser to a new
page in part 73 of this video series we
discussed how to detective javascript is
enabled by using no script element
another way is by using vendor dot
location property let's look at that in
action let's work with the same example
that we worked with in part 73 so let's
flip to visual studio this is the same
example that we worked with in the
previous video session to this project
let's go ahead and add a new page and
let's name this page default dot HTM and
within the head section let's include a
section for script vendo dot location
equals HTML page 1 dot HTM so let's copy
the page name and paste it here and then
within the body section let's include an
h1 element and let's display this
message it seems that you have disabled
JavaScript please enable JavaScript now
when we navigate to this default dot HTM
page and if we have JavaScript enabled
in the browser so it's going to come to
this script block and this piece of code
will be executed and this line will
cause the page to be redirected to HTML
page 1 dot HTM if javascript is disabled
then this piece of code will not be
executed and we will stay on this page
and the page says it seems that you have
disabled JavaScript please enable
JavaScript so we can use this location
property to detect if javascript is
enabled or not so we can either use no
script element or render dot location
property so let's look at this in action
so let's go ahead and run this
so at the moment with an IE we have
JavaScript enabled look at this when we
try to navigate to default dot HTM it
redirects us automatically to HTML page
1 dot HTM that's because let's actually
throw in a breakpoint here and run this
page in debug mode so look at that you
know we come to default dot HTM page but
it hits this breakpoint look at that
when I hover the mouse over location
property it shows us the URL of the
current page which is default of HTM but
then we are changing the location to
HTML page 1 dot HTM so this will
redirect to HTML page 1 dot HTM now
that's good and disable JavaScript so
let's go to Internet Options security
custom level scroll all the way to the
down and then select disable radio
button click ok so now let's navigate to
default dot HTM look at that it seems
that you have disabled JavaScript please
enable JavaScript so basically this
piece of code will not be executed so we
will continue to stay on the same page
and we get to see that message saying
that javascript is disabled this window
dot location property is especially
useful if we have two different sites
that is one side for the users with
javascript another side for users
without javascript in the scenario we
can make the home page of the non
javascript website to be the default
page and in that page will include
script like this vendor dot location
equals the URL of the JavaScript enabled
side now if users have JavaScript
enabled in their browser and they visit
this default page they will be
automatically redirected to the
JavaScript enable side if they don't
have JavaScript enabled then this piece
of code will not be executed so they
will continue to stay on the
which works without JavaScript enabled
here we have some of the useful
properties of the location object href
hostname protocol and part name href
returns the full URL of the current page
host name returns the domain name
protocol returns the protocol that is
HTTP or HTTPS and path name returns the
name and path of the current page and
here is an example so to speed things up
I have already typed out so let's copy
and paste this within this default or
HTM page at the moment we have
javascript disabled so let's go to an
enable JavaScript
and let's run this page notice that HLF
property returns you know the full URL
hostname gives us the name of the host
that is in this case it's localhost and
part name gives us the name and path of
the current page and protocol returns
the protocol that is used in this case
we are using HTTP so we get HTTP back
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
