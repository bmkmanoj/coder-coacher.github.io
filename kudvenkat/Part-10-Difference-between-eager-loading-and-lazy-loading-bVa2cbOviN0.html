tutorial in this video we'll discuss the
difference between Eagle loading and
lazy loading the disk is lazy loading in
part 8 and the Eagle loading in part 9
please watch what's 8 and 9 before
proceeding with this video with lazy
loading we have a problem called n plus
1 select problem first let's try and
understand this problem with an example
in the example right here notice that
there's a one to many relationship
between department and employee entities
this means the department can have one
or more employees now let's say we want
to iterate through all the departments
and then for the each department we want
to print the employee first and last
names belonging to that department now
by default link to sequel is going to do
this it's going to issue one select very
to load all the departments and then n
additional select queries to load the
employees belonging to each department
in this case n represents the total
number of departments for example if we
have got three departments then there's
going to be one select query to load all
the three departments and then three
additional selector is to load the
employees belonging to each department
so that's why this is called n plus one
select problem let's actually prove this
with an example let's flip to visual
studio so the code that we have here is
going to print all the three departments
and then the employees belonging to each
department notice that there are three
departments now let's uncomment this
code which is going to log the generated
sequel commands to the console screen
let's rerun this keep in mind there were
three departments so this one select
query to load all the three departments
and then notice that we have got three
additional select queries to load the
employees belonging to each department
so this is the first additional query
here we have got IT department and then
when we try to print the employee names
belonging to IT department that's when
an additional select query is issued to
load the employees belonging to that
department look at the bear claws here
where department ID equals at p0 so it's
a parametrized query and that the
parameter value in this case is one
and then we have the ideal HR department
and then when we try to put in the
employees belonging to HR department
that's when another additional query is
issued and in this case the parameter
value is 2 and finally payroll and in
this case the parameter value is 3 so
there were three additional select
queries to load the employees belonging
to each department so this is n plus 1
select problem so what's the difference
between eager loading and lazy loading
which is good
eager loading or lazy loading without
looking at the application architecture
and what we are trying to achieve we
cannot really say one is better over the
other both have their own advantages and
disadvantages
there are clear performance trade-offs
between easy loading and lazy loading
with eager loading all the data is
retrieved in a single query which can
then be cached improve the application
performance with eager loading we are
trading memory consumption for database
round-trips
because we are loading all the data in a
single query with lazy loading we only
retrieve just the amount of data that we
need in a single query when we need more
data related to the initial data
additional queries are issued to the
database this means there are several
round trips between the application
server and the database server in
general these databases around trips are
very often the major performance
bottlenecks in most applications lesser
the round trips
better the performance for example if on
a given page if we are just displaying
departments then there is no reason for
eager loading delete an employee's data
so in this case lazy loading works fast
on the other hand if we are displaying
both the department and employees data
like we did in the example then eager
loading works fast as it avoids the
additional round trips to the database
so if you're not sure of what data is
exactly required then start with lazy
loading and if it is leading to n plus 1
select problem then use eager loading
that's it for today thank you for
listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
