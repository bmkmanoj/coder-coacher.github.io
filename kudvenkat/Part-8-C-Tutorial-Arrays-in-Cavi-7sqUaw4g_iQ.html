rank it this is part eight arrays in C
shops in this session we will learn what
is our and the advantages and
disadvantages of using various let's
look at an example now if I create a
variable of type integer
I can only store one value within that
if I want to store more than one value
in this variable it's not possible
that's when RS come into picture if you
want to store a group of similar data
types in a single variable you can make
use of that is for example let's say I
want to store a collection of even
numbers to do that I can create an
integer array &amp;amp; store my even numbers
let's see how to create an array let's
say for example I want to store 3 even
numbers and obviously even numbers are
integers so I can create an integer
array whose size is 3 and 2 3 integers
within that so let's see how to create
an integer array now to create a
variable of type integer we say this is
the data type this is a name variable
and this is a value that we want to
assign to that variable but on the other
hand if you want to create an integer
array you'll say int of square brackets
so these square brackets indicates that
we are going to create an array let's
give it a meaningful name for example we
want to store even numbers I'm going to
name that and ok so we know that we are
going to create an integer array this is
the type and this square bracket
indicates it in a it as an array and if
it's an array we know that it's a group
of similar data types in this case group
of integers how many integers do you
want to store 1 2 5 10 so you have to
specify the size so to specify the size
you use the new keyword and say end and
then again within a square bracket you
specify the size of the array in this
case I want to create an integer
gray and stool three integers within
that hurry and how do I store these
three numbers now arrays are integer
index based starting at zero so the
first element is at position zero so
events of even numbers of zero equals
zero because the first event number is
zero even numbers of 1 the first I mean
the second even number which is 2
similarly even numbers of sorry third
element there's 4 and let's say for
example I want to print the second even
number console the thread line even
numbers of 1 so what's going to happen
in this location we are storing 2 so it
prints that number out when we run this
program which is nothing but 2 in
position 1 we are storing 2 and we print
that out so this is a very simple
example of narae's okay now what is the
advantages of what is the advantage of
using air is obviously an array is a
collection of similar data types so if
you want to store a group of similar
data types then you can make use of
Paris it could be integers flutes double
string any data type for that matter for
example if you want to store you know up
your your friends names a group of
friend name then you can make use of a
string array alright now what is the
advantage of using arrays advantage is
they're strongly typed ok meaning if the
array is of type integer
you can only store integers within that
array and if you try to store for
example let's say accidentally if you
try to store maybe a string for example
like Hello we know this is type string
but this array is of type integer and
you already see there a red squiggly
indicating an error
so cannot if you look at the error
message it is cannot implicitly convert
the type string to into because we know
that even numbers is an array of type in
video okay so arrays are strongly typed
that's a very good benefit okay we will
realize the advantage of being you know
strongly type later when we compare
arrays with other collection classes
that are available with important
framework which are nothing but less you
know and generics etc so under then
don't worry about that just keep in mind
that you know array so strongly typed in
nature which is definitely the greatest
advantage arrays okay now what are the
disadvantages with using arrays the
disadvantages are once you initialize
the size of an array they cannot grow in
size anymore for example in this case
the size of this array is three now if I
try to hold a fourth element within this
array for example six now if I go ahead
and compile this and the way to compile
is go to the build menu simple solution
and if you look in the status bar at the
bottom left hand corner it says build
succeeded so no issues but on the other
hand when you actually run this at
runtime you get an exception and
obviously you get an index out of range
exception okay so what does it mean that
means the array size is three but I am
screwing but I am trying to store a
fourth element into that array which is
not possible so we don't have a location
three which is technically four because
it starts from zero so the index is
Holdings range if you want to store a
fourth element into this array and that
makes sense
okay so what does this prove this proves
that once you specify the size of an
array its fixed you cannot you know
store more elements than the initial
size so it means arrays cannot grow in
size over time that's one I got one
disadvantage of arrays actually within
dotnet we have other collection
passes like list in our hash table etc
which can grow in size of matically
which we'll be talking about later when
we talk about those collection classes
so until then don't really worry about
them okay so one of the disadvantages of
using arrays arrays cannot grow in size
once initialized another disadvantage we
have to rely on the integral index
indeces there is no better way to store
our factory items from the array but we
if we use collection classes it's very
easy to store or retrieve items we don't
have to rely on this integral indexes
which we'll be talking about when we
actually talk about collection classes
and on that okay but for now understand
that the only way that you have this
tool are retrieve elements out of an
array is to rely on these integral
indexers for example let's say by
mistake if I try to retrieve an element
you know maybe instead of typing one by
mistake I I typed ten and when I go
ahead and build the solution it compiles
fine no compile time error but when I
try to run this program it gives me an
index out of range exception because
this location does not exist within this
array and why did the data happen
because I have to rely on this integral
and excellence
okay so that's why you know arrays are
good in a way they are strongly typed so
definitely that's a greatest advantage
of arrays once you define an array to be
of specific type you can only store that
specific type of elements in that array
that's a greatest advantage but the
disadvantages are once you define the
size of an array they cannot grow in
size over time number one and number two
the only weight is to add a few elements
of the array is to use the integral
based indeces which is definitely
error-prone and a little complicated but
on the other hand if we if we use the
collection classes that are available in
Jordan framework you know their type
safe number one and also they there are
several convenient methods to store and
retrieve elements of that collection
which we'll be talking about at a later
point of time okay most of the time
endured met if we have to store a group
of similar data types we will be using
generics which we'll be talking about at
a later session but at this point what
you need to understand is an RA is a
collections in the data types there are
advantages of using arrays which is
strongly type and disadvantage is that
it the arrays cannot grow in size once
initialize and we have to rely on
integral indexes to store and retrieve
elements from the array that's it for

great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
