this is the introduction to angular 2 in
this video we look at a few benefits
provided by angular 2 and why should we
use it while many developers are already
using angular 1 we know angular 1 was
released in October 2010 and it is by
far the most popular JavaScript
framework available for creating web
applications many developers are
honestly using angular 1 so the obvious
question that comes to our mind is why
should we use angular 2 well the first
thing to keep in mind is that angular 2
is not a simple upgrade from angular 1
Angela 2 is completely rewritten so it
has a lot of improvements compared with
angular 1 so let's take a look at few of
these improvements performance from a
performance standpoint angular 2 has
faster initial loads change detection
and improved rendering time not just
performance we also have include
modularity dependency injection and
testability if all these technical terms
doesn't make sense at the moment don't
worry just because all these is great
detail in our upcoming videos one
important thing to keep in mind is that
according to angular Conference meetup
angular 2 is 5 times faster compared to
angularjs 1 mobile support angular 1 was
not built for mobile devices it's
possible to run angular 1 on mobile but
we'll have to use third-party frameworks
for that angular 2 on the other hand is
designed from the ground up with mobile
support in mind mobile device features
and limitations like touch interfaces
limited screen real estate and mobile
hardware have all been considered while
designing angular 2 so with angular 2 we
can build a single application that
works across mobile and desktop devices
component based development component
based development is the future of web
development in angular 2 everything is a
component components are the building
blocks of an angular application the
advantage of the component based
approach is that it facilitates greater
code reuse and from a unit testing
standpoint the
of components make angular to move
testable we'll discuss what a component
is and how to build components with
examples in detail in our upcoming
videos another benefit is that angular 2
we've got more language choices we can
use any of these programming languages
to build an angular 2 application we can
use Eggman script 5 or X no script 6 at
my script 6 is officially renamed to
es2015 so keep in mind these two terms
Atma scripts X and es2015 might be used
interchangeably and then we have type
script besides these three programming
languages we also have dart pure script
L and some other languages as well among
all these languages type script is the
most popular language keep in mind
angular 2 itself is built using
typescript typescript has great support
for XML script 6 standard the obvious
questions that come to mind at this
point are what is typescript and what is
X market so let's answer these questions
now first let's understand what is
atmosphere the JavaScript language
standard is officially known as techno
script over the past several years many
versions of Eggman script were released
starting with Eggman script version 1
all the little Atmos crap version 7 most
modern browsers that are available today
support Atma script file the browser
support for Eggman script 6 is still
incomplete
however a process called translation
combines tech mask rips 6 2x a script 5
that most browsers can understand Atma
script 6 is officially known as Atma
script 2015 and it has introduced
several new features like classes
modules arrow functions etc we'll
discuss all these features with examples
in detail in our upcoming videos if you
are interested in learning more about it
mascot standard and what these different
versions have to offer please refer to
this Wikipedia article now let's
understand what is typescript
craft as a free and open-source
programming language developed by
Microsoft
it is a superset of JavaScript and a
process called translation compiles
typescript to JavaScript that the
browsers can understand using typescript
to build angular applications provide
all these benefits we know typescript
has create support for es2015 standard
so when we use type scriptable angular
applications we can also use
object-oriented features like classes
interfaces and inheritance if you have
any experience with object-oriented
programming languages like C Java Java
then learning typescript is very easy
because of all these benefits creating
maintaining and refactoring angular
applications using typescript can be an
enjoyable experience
so naturally typescript has become the
number one choice of many developers for
developing angular applications in this
course we will be using typescript as
the programming language so the obvious
question that comes from mind is should
I learn typescript to watch this course
the answer is no we will cover all the
required typescript concepts as we
progress through this course another
benefit of using typescript as the
programming language is that it is fully
supported by all these code editors so
you can pick and choose your favorite
code editor in our next video we'll
discuss setting up angular 2 in visual
studio thank you for listening and have
a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
