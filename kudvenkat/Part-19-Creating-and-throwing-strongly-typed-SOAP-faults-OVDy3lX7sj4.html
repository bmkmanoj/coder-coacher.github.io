this video well discuss creating and
throwing strongly-typed so false from it
WCF service this is continuation to part
18 so please watch part 18 before
proceeding in part 18 of this video
series we discussed throwing a generic
so fault using fault exception class
instead of throwing a generic so fault
we can create strongly type 2 so false
and then through them creating our own
strongly-typed so false allow us to
include any additional custom
information about the exception that has
occurred and there are three very simple
steps to create a strongly typed so
fault let's look at those steps in
detail step 1 create a class that
represents your so fault decorate the
class itself with data contract
attribute and the properties within the
class with data member attribute in this
example here we are creating a class
called / 0 fault this class is going to
represent a strongly typed soup fault
for / 0 exception and notice that the
class itself is decorated with data
contract attribute and the properties
within the class are decorated with data
member attribute right to speed things
up I have already typed this code so
let's copy that code from the notepad
let's flip to visual studio and in the
WCF service project let's go ahead and
add a class file and let's call this / 0
fault dot CS and let's paste here on the
code that we have copied so it's the
same code that you have seen in this
slide now this data contract and data
member attributes are present in system
dot runtime dot serialization namespace
alright so that's the first step
step2 in the service data contract use
fault contract attribute to specify that
you know this operation contract is
going to throw divided by zero fault
so for that association by using the
fault contract attribute and we do that
within the service data contract so
let's flip to visual studio so within
this file I calculate a service dot see
as we have our service contract and
within the service contract we have got
one operation contract divided and you
know we want to associate divide by zero
fault with this operation contract and
to do that we are going to make use of
fault contract attribute and then we are
going to specify type off our divided by
zero fault
so basically this fault contract
attribute is telling that this divide
method can throw divided by zero fault
that's our step two step three in the
service implementation create an
instance for strongly-typed at so fault
and then through it using fault
exception class okay so let's go to end
you know type in this code so if you
look at the service implementation
itself here with our calculator service
dot CS file at the moment we are
checking if denominator is zero and then
we are throwing a generic fault
exception instead of that let's use try
catch blocks so let's use a try block
and then when we are you know trying to
divide two numbers if at all if there is
any exception catch that we know that if
denominator is zero it's going to throw
divided by zero exception so let's catch
that exception and then now we are going
to create our divided by zero fault and
let's call it so basically we are
creating an instance of divided by 0
fault class and then if you recollect
this class has got two properties within
that one is the edit and the other one
is details both of them are of type
strain this error property is going to
contain you know maybe the message that
we want to display to the end user and
this details property can contain any
custom information that we want to
include so let's populate both of those
properties divided by 0 for.net cin
clued the error as the message property
from the exception object and we have
details property so here we can include
any custom information that we want to
include let's say for example
denominator cannot be zero okay so at
this point we have created an instance
of our strongly typed so fault all that
is left is to actually through this you
know fault exception and how do we do
that using fault exception class so the
new fault exception of type / 0 fault
and then within the constructor we are
going to pass the instance of the / 0
fault that's it
so at this point our serve is factually
throwing it strongly typed it so fault
right but in our client application so
before we may
can you change this to a client
application you know we first need to
run this service hole so let's go ahead
and run the WCF service itself so the
service is running let's flip to the
client application since this service
implementation has changed let's go
ahead and update the service reference
so basically this should generate the
definition for our strongly typed so
fault as well and then within here
instead of simply catching a generic
fault exception let's try to catch this
strongly typed so fault which is divided
by zero now look at that the
intelligence doesn't bring divided by
zero fault that's basically because it's
living in a different namespace that is
in the calculated service namespace we
have got divided by zero fault so now we
are catching the strongly typed so fault
okay and the instance name here is fault
exception this fault exception object
has got detail property and within that
detail property notice that we have got
the two properties that we have
specified error and details so let's
specify error and then details so fault
exception dot detail dot details all
right with this change let's go ahead
and run the client so let's pass ten and
try to divide it by 0 click divided and
we should be able to retrieve the error
and details property of or strongly
typed so far look at that that's the
error that's the value that is present
in the error property and that's the
value that is present in the details
property of this divided by zero fault
exception that we are receiving
and this is the same piece of code that
we have just looked at that's it for
today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
