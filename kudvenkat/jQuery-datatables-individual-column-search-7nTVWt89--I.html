three tutorial in this video we'll
discuss how to implement search
functionality on everyday query data
table column let me explain what I mean
notice the example right here we've got
a search text box across every column
and notice what the search text box say
so for first name it says search first
name and the last name it says search
last name so on and so forth now if we
enter Rob for example in the search
first name textbox then it should search
only within the first name column and
the matching rules should be displayed
so let's see how to achieve this let's
flip to visual studio this is the same
example that we worked with in the
previous video session so if vbu this
page in the browser at the moment this
is how the table is standard we only
have the search functionality here but
we don't have a search text box across
every column so let's see how to achieve
this we will be modifying the same
example so I would strongly encourage
you to watch part 1 0 6 before
proceeding with this video the first
thing that I'm going to do here is
create a variable and store the
reference of the data table and add and
I'm going to call this variable data
table instance so we are storing the
data table in this variable we will be
reusing this variable in a bit and
notice here we have this success
callback function opening raised and the
closing brace is right here so just
before the closing brace I'm going to
use a selector and find all the th
elements that we have in the tea food
section of this table so this table has
got an ID it is data table so let's use
the jQuery ID selector to find the table
using its ID within that we have got tea
food section and within the P food
section we have got th elements so we
want all those th elements I am going to
use the jQuery each function and loop
through each of those th elements now
the first thing that I want is the title
the header you know text
so if you look at the pH elements we
have the same set of th elements in the
T head section as well as in the t food
section they are present in the same
order as well okay so what I'm going to
do now is retrieve the header text from
the pH elements that are present in the
tea head section of this table okay and
the reason why we need the text is
because if you look at the text boxes
here notice what they say the first name
search text box a search first name
similarly last name search text box is
search last name so somehow we have to
get that header text so to get that we
are going to loop through each of the th
elements and let's create a variable
here title equals and I'm going to use
the same selector but I'm going to
modify that so instead of using t food
here I'm going to use t head and let's
use the jQuery EQ function and to this
EQ function we can pass the index of the
ph element within the array that this
selector returns and since the th
elements that are present in the tea
head section t food section since they
are in the same order the index of you
know this th element matches the index
of this th element in both the cases it
is zero for first name it is one for
last name it is two so on and so forth
so what I'm going to do here is use
dollar this keyword so this keyword
references the th element that we are
currently iterating over and on that I
am going to use the jQuery index
function to retrieve its index and we
are passing the index to the EQ function
and that is going to return as the ph
element you know that's present in the
tea head at section and notice the th
element has got you know the text ID
first name last name etc depending on
the element that we are currently
iterating over so I am going to use the
text function here and that's going to
return us the text of the th element
okay and the next thing that we want to
do is create a new
box and we want that text there within
the text box to do that I'm going to use
this keyword here download this so here
this keyword again references the th
element within the footer section that
we are currently iterating over and on
that I am going to use the HTML function
and we want to you know add a new input
element of type equals text and I'm
going to use the placeholder attribute
here placeholder equals search so it
should say search first name search last
name etc search and to that I'm going to
append whatever value we have got in the
title attribute and then we need to
close the double quote and the input
element itself right so with this change
let's reload our page and see what we
get now look at this I have to scroll
all the way down to see those search
text boxes look at that the search text
box across IDs a search ID search first
name etc okay now I don't want to scroll
to see them so I'm going to remove this
crawl Y property that we included in the
previous video session so let's get rid
of this property and let's go ahead and
reload this page so now look at this I
don't have to scroll down to see these
search text boxes okay
alright now the border is not properly
said that's because we have set a fixed
width
I mean fixed width to the development
surrounding that data table so I'm going
to actually change that to a different
width so let's change it to maybe 700
pixels 1700 pixels and now it should
properly surround the data table alright
so now we have the search text boxes
okay and at the moment you know this
website column is not searchable that's
because in the previous video session we
have said searchable option to false
let's include that in search by changing
that
- - okay right so now what we want to do
whenever you know we type for example
Rob here then we want to search for Rob
in the first name column and display
only the matching rows so we want to
handle two events here the key up event
as soon as you know I key upon letter R
we want that search to kick in so we
want to handle key up and we also want
to handle change event on this textbox
so for that what I'm going to do is
notice here we are using this variable
data table instance so that's holding a
reference to our data table so right
here I'm going to use that and I'm going
to use columns function okay now another
important thing to keep in mind here is
that if you look at you know the
constructor function that we are using
look at this when I press control space
look at that there are two versions of
data table right one with a small letter
D and another one with capital letter
days so what is the difference the
constructor function with capital A
today that's the new version okay and
the one with small letter D is the old
version so if you are using the old
version and if you want to use the new
API that comes with data tables then you
will have to use API function on this
variable if this is not clear at the
moment don't worry that will be clear in
just a bit for now let's go ahead and
use this new constructor function data
table with a capital letter D alright so
now notice here we using columns and I'm
going to use every function to loop
through every column in the data table
okay and I'm going to create a variable
here and I'm going to call this data
table column equals this so we are
looping through every data table column
so this keyword here references the
element that we are currently the data
column that we are currently iterating
over and
now dollar this dot footer so I'm using
a function here dollar this dot futa so
it's going to find the footer and within
the footer what do we have so if you
look at this page right here within
every footer of this data column we have
a text box and this text box you know
it's an input element right so within
the footer I want to find input element
and I want to use the jQuery on function
and associate to event handlers one is
key up and the other one is change
so whenever those events are triggered
we want to handle them so this is the
function that's going to handle them so
what do we want to do on key up and when
the text in the text box in the search
text box changes we want to search this
column right so data table column dot
I'm going to use search function and to
the search function we have to tell what
we are searching for and where is that
value going to be present it's going to
be present in the respective text box so
now we can use this dot value to get the
value out of the text box and then once
we have searched we want to retrieve the
matching row so I'm going to use draw
function for that okay
so pretty straightforward code there so
let's save our changes and let's go
ahead and reload this and look at this
when I type our look at that only you
know those names that have our row
matches you know displayed all the
others are filtered out similarly for
example if I type s here you know it
should match only two rows right and
here if I type letter G look at that we
get only one row all right so now if you
look at another constructor function
that we are using they're using the
newer version now if I use the old
version look at this we are using the
old version let's save these changes and
let's reload our page and look at this
when I type Rob for example now the
filtering is not working ok and if we
launch developer tools so I'm plus f12
and if we look at the console we should
have an error
so basically notice that it says columns
is not a function ok so here we are
using the old constructor function and
if we have to use the new API then you
know we have to use here look at that
it's complaining that this columns is
undefined
basically so to get to that I'm going to
use the API function and on that we can
use in our columns so now if I save this
let's reload this page now we should not
get that error and the search should
again continue to work as it used to do
alright so a they use a PA function if
you're using the old constructor if
you're using the new constructor
function then you don't have to use that
API function to use the new features all
right so at the moment if you look at
you know the search text boxes they are
present within the footer now if you
want them in the header for some reason
then you could very easily change that
you have to do a couple of modifications
so instead of P food here we are going
to change that to P head and here we are
going to change that to P foot and right
here instead of da I'm going to use
header so that's all so let's save all
changes reload this page and look at
this now we have the search text boxes
in the header but there is one problem
here look at this when I click on the
search ID text box look at that the data
is getting sorted every time I click on
any of the search text box the data is
being sorted by that column and we don't
want that behavior we want the data to
be sorted on
when I click on these little triangles
right we don't want this heart when we
click on these text boxes so we want to
prevent that so to do that what I'm
going to do is we're going to reuse this
selector so I'm going to cash or cash
that in a variable so let's call this
search text boxes equals that expression
right there and we can reuse this
variable so search text boxes and here
I'm going to use search text boxes on so
now I'm going to wire up click function
and to this function let's pass the
event object and I'm going to say e dot
stop propagation let's save our changes
reload the page and look at this now
when I click in the search text box this
sorting is prevented right and when we
type for example Rob look at that this
search functionality still works and
here are the steps that we have
discussed
so this code basically include these two
blocks of code to include the search
text boxes in the header if you want
them in the footer then these are the
two code blocks that you need to include
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
