this video we'll discuss including and
excluding properties from model binding
using bind attribute please watch bar 20
before proceeding with this video in
part when T we discussed achieving
exactly the same thing by passing a
string array as a parameter to this
update model function notice that here
we have a string array with name
property and this string array specifies
an exclude list by passing the string
array to this update model function we
are telling the default asp.net MVC
model binder to exclude a name property
from model binding we have also
discussed using another overloaded
version of update model where we have
specified and include less so this
string array here specifies an include
list and notice the properties ID
generator City date of birth so by
passing the string array to the subject
model function we are telling the
default asp.net MVC model binder to
include only these properties in model
binding instead of using string array we
can also use bind attribute to achieve
exactly the same thing let's see how to
do that I'm going to make a few changes
to this controller action method the
first changes I'm going to get rid of
this ID parameter and then use employee
object as a parameter so this employee
object is going to receive automatically
the posted form values and then I'm
going to specify you know the bind
attribute right here and then notice
that this bind the attribute class has
got two constructors the second
constructor has got some named
parameters and look at this we can
specify our include and exclude list so
notice that include is equal to string
exclude is equal to string meaning your
properties has to be a comma separated
list of string okay so I'm going to
specify and include list so include
equal to and then we can specify the
properties that we want to be part of
model binding so I want ID gender City
and date of birth so let's copy that and
specify that as our include list
okay so now we are passing in employee
object recorded of that ID parameter so
obviously this line will throw a
compilation error because we don't have
that ID parameter anymore but we can
very easily get the ID of the employee
by using this employee object so
employee object has got ID property so
employee ID and look at this when we
have you know we have told the default
asp.net model binder to only include
this properties in you know model
binding so it's not going to find name
property so from the posted form values
it will pick up only ID generousity and
date of birth and then update you know
the properties of this employee object
but not the name property name or
property will be null and then if we
pass this employee object to the
database you know to the safe employee
method it will be saved to database and
the name will be come now but that's not
what we want we want to retain the
existing name of the employee is just
that you know when somebody goes to edit
view you know we don't want them to be
actually changing the name of the
employee there okay but we want to
retain the existing name of the employee
okay so to do that you know this
employee's property is going to return
all the employees from the database sort
of which we are getting that single
employee whom we are editing and then I
am going to retrieve their name using
name property okay and then look at this
since we are already passing the
employee object here you know we cannot
create you know there's no point in
creating another instance of employee
object here so I'm going to get rid of
that and I'm going to set the name
property of that employee object okay to
whatever is is present in the database
okay and then we can get rid of this
update model function because you know
this employee object will automatically
be receiving the posted form value so we
don't have to call this anymore so I'm
going to get rid of that update model
there and then if model state is valid
we are passing that
Floy object to the save employee and
then we are redirecting the user to
index action all right if there are any
model state validation errors we remain
on the same view and get the opportunity
to see those validation errors so that
we can correct and submit the phone once
again so with these changes let's go and
run this and see if it's going to work
as expected so I go to the employee tab
edit action and I'm going to edit the
first employee and let's click on save
and see what's going to happen look at
that it says the name field is required
why is that that's because you know the
default asp.net MVC model binder is only
going to bind ID generated city and date
of birth from the posted form values
it's not going to update name property
so when it gets to this line model State
DOT is valid it's going to check okay
I didn't bind a name property to this
object okay but then if you look at the
employee class within our business layer
we have got this employee class if you
look at this employee class we have
decorated this name property with the
required attribute and the default model
binder did not bind a value for that
property so so that's why it
it throws false you know its returns
false model State DOT is valid is going
to return false okay so how to get rid
of this error one way is to simply get
rid of this required attribute there
with that change let's go ahead and run
this and see if we get the same error so
let's navigate to employee controller
edit action and we are editing employee
with ID is equal to one let's click Save
and see if it's going to get saved
so the save is now working we are not
getting any compilation errors let's
edit change some data you know let's
change the gender to female let's change
the city to London and let's save it so
the update is working as expected now
let's actually fire up fiddler and let's
try to generate a post request okay so
it's asking me you know there's a new of
version of fiddler do I want to upgrade
not now let's delete the existing
request there let's generate a post
request by clicking on the Save button
so we have this is the post request so
I'm going to go on to the composer tab
drag and drop this post request okay and
let's change the name as well so I'm
going to change the name from echo white
XYZ to let's say ABC gender from female
to male and let's change the city from
London to Chennai and let's execute this
and let's see if the name is changed we
don't want the name to be changed so
let's actually go back let's you know
reflect this index action look at that
only gender city is changed name is
still XYZ okay so we are able to specify
our include list using bind attribute
instead of passing a string array to
update model function alternatively we
can also specify our exclude list so
instead of specifying your include list
I can simply say exclude is equal to I
want to exclude name property from model
binding it's as simple as that
so we can either include and exclude
properties from model binding by passing
string array to update model function or
the second way is to actually use buying
the attribute and specify your include
and exclude list on this slide you can
find resources for asp.net c-sharp and
sequel so interview questions that's it
for today thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
