in this video we'll discuss different
functions that are available to
manipulate strings in JavaScript so
what's a string in JavaScript a string
in javascript is any text inside codes
you can use either single or double
quotes in the first example here we have
a string in double quotes and in the
second example we have a string in
single quotes concatenate in strings
there are two options to concatenate
strings in JavaScript you could either
use plus operator or can cat method in
this example we have concatenated
strings using the plus operator we have
two variables here string 1 and string
to string one has the hello word and
string 2 has JavaScript word and on the
third line here we are concatenated
string 1 with a single space string and
that is being concatenated with string 2
variable again using the plus operator
so the result is hello' JavaScript with
a single space between hello and
JavaScript words in this example here
we're concatenated strings using the
concatenate string one variable we are
calling the concat method and two
concatenated we are passing two strings
the first string has a single space
within it and the second string is
string 2 variable which has javascript
word so the result of this is hello'
JavaScript with a single space between
hello and JavaScript words in this
example notice we are passing two
strings to the concatenate to the concat
method let's look at an example so at
the moment - this can get method this is
one string and this is another string so
we are passing two strings
let's pass another string so I'm going
to pass a string with spaces on either
sides and then I'm going to have this
word hello and then let's pass another
string world so now at the moment we are
passing 1 2 3 and 4 strings to the
concat method so when we you know run
this we should actually have 5 strengths
that is string 1 a single space string 2
and then the hello bird and then the
world word so when we run this we should
get hello Java Script and hello world
now there may be times when you need
single quotes inside a string within
your output for example we want the
output to be like this
welcome to JavaScript training but then
the JavaScript word should be present
inside single quotes like this okay but
remember single code has a special
meaning that indicates you know the
beginning and end of a string but
strings in JavaScript can be present
either inside double quotes or inside
single quotes now if you want codes
inside your strings in the output there
are two options for you option one is
place the entire string in double quotes
like this okay so in this string the
beginning of the string is indicated by
this double quote and the end of the
string is indicated by this double code
so you can use single quotes within the
string wherever you want so this is
going to produce this output so the
JavaScript word is now present inside
single quotes okay so that's one option
the other option is if you want to place
your entire string inside single quotes
you know maybe because that's your
coding practice or standard within your
organization but then if you just use a
single code without this backslash then
JavaScript is going to treat that you
know as you know a character which
indicates the end of the string but
that's not what we want we want that
single quote to be part of the string
itself so that's why we use the escape
sequence character the backslash you
know just like c-sharp
even in JavaScript the escape sequence
character is backslash so when you use
backslash single code then JavaScript
knows that you want that character to be
treated as you know part of the string
and not to use that to indicate the end
of the string okay
so notice that here we have again
backslash
single coat and then finally this single
quote here is going to indicate the end
of that string so the result is welcome
to JavaScript training now you can use
these two approaches if you need double
quotes instead of single quotes inside
your string for example if you want this
javascript fur to be present inside
double quotes then you know you can use
eight this option or this option again
converting a string to an uppercase this
is straightforward all you need to do is
use the to uppercase method so here we
have a variable uppercase string and at
the moment it has this string within it
JavaScript with small and uppercase
letters when you call to uppercase it's
going to convert all the letters to
uppercase and this is how the output
will be and if you want to convert a
string to a lowercase use to lowercase
method and the output is here and if you
want to find the length of a string that
is the number of characters that are
present inside a string in JavaScript we
have the length property so in the first
example here on the string itself we are
calling the length property and that's
going to give us 10 because there are 10
characters in the word JavaScript here
we are storing the string inside a
variable and on the variable we are
calling the length property so within
this string here we've got 16 characters
and that's what is the output removing
white spaces from both ends of a string
and to do that use the trim method so if
we look the example here we've got two
variables string one string to string
one has a B and notice that we have a
white space at the beginning and at the
end of the string the same is the case
with string two now on the third line we
are calling the trim method on string
one variable so what is this trim method
going to do it's going to knock off the
whitespace that is present at the
beginning and at the end of this train
so a B without a space that's what this
will achieve and then we are using the
concatenation operator that is plus and
then on string two we are calling the
trim method again so this method is
going to remove the white spaces on
either sides of
string - so the result is we will get
ABCD without whitespace you know on
either sides and between a B and C D
replacing strings in JavaScript use
replaced method this method searches a
given string for a specified value or a
regular expression and then replaces the
specified value with the replacement
value and returns a new string this
method does not change the original
string so if you look at the example
here in my string variable we have
hollow JavaScript now what we want to do
is we want to replace this javascript
word with hell over I mean world word so
on my string variable we are calling the
replace method so this is the word the
first parameter is the word that we want
to replace and the second parameter is
the replacement value so in place of
JavaScript we want world so when we run
this we get the result as hello world so
here we are using a specified value
instead of this you can also use a
regular expression so let's now look at
an example of using regular expressions
so now in this example here we are
performing a case sensitive global
replacement what do we mean by global
replacement in the entire string you
know wherever you find this word blue
replace that with this word green ok now
here we have some strange characters
that is 4/4 / so the first thing that
comes to our mind is why is this word
blue present between two forward slashes
basically we use those four slashes to
specify you know whatever we have
between those four slashes is a regular
expression so basically we are telling
here we want to find this word blue in
this string and then notice that after
this forward slash we have this letter G
this letter G indicates Global
replacement so in that entire string
wherever you find the word blue replay
start with this word green now look at
the result so
source string is this one a blue bottle
with a blue liquid is on a blue table
okay now the difference between this
word blue and the rest of the two in our
words blue is this blue has a capped a
letter B in it and if you look at the
result that blue is not replaced with
this word green because this replacement
is a case-sensitive replacement okay
that's why that word is not replaced but
the other instances of blue are replaced
with this replacement string green so
the result is a blue bottle with a green
liquid is on green table now if you want
to perform a case-insensitive
replacement we have the exact same
regular expression except that we also
have this letter i' which indicates
case-insensitive global replacement so
now the output is a green bottle with
the green liquid is on a green table
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
