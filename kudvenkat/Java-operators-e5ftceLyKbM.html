Java tutorials in this tutorial we are
going to learn about operators in Java
now that we have learned how to declare
and initialize the variables we need to
do something with them if we have one
integer defined or declared as two and
another integer declared as three we
need to do something book at both of
them now learning to understand water
operators in Java programming language
is one of the best thing to start with
now let us understand what are operators
or what is operator precedence
what are metric operators water unary
operators what are relational and
bitwise operators you will see all these
in practice we will write small programs
as well as understand what these
operators mean before we start let us
understand what are operators so
operators are something that takes some
operands they perform some operations on
them and then they give some output
depending upon number of operands they
might be called unary binary or ternary
operators let's take an example I hope
you all know about plus operator now
plus is something that takes two
operands and gives out output twice by
doing then operation of addition
now here 2 &amp;amp; 3 are operations of
operands addition is the operation plus
is the operator to identify that
operation and 5 is the final result as I
said those operators which take single
operand
are called unary operators and those
which take two operands are called
binary operators now let's understand
what is the precedence of operate
operators if you are giving some
competitive exams or preparing for
Oracle's or certifications in that case
there are certain quotients where
knowledge of operator precedence is
awkward most simple
you need to understand that these
operators are evaluated based on this
precedence operators with higher
precedence are evaluated before
operators with relatively lower
precedence so in this diagram which you
see on the slide in this table the
operators on the strain lines have equal
precedence and whenever operators of
equal precedence appear in same
expressions there is a rule that what
should be evaluated first
now all the binary operators except the
equal to equal 2 that is a assignment
operator except the assignment operator
all the binary operators are evaluated
from left to right assignment operator
is evaluated from right to left what I
mean by this is when you write int X
equal to 5 this is an assignment in this
scenario the assignment is evaluated
from right to left 5 is assigned to
something which is on the left side of
the assignment operator that is equal to
now let's briefly watch this table there
are certain operators which are postfix
operators like expression plus plus or
expression minus minus there are some
unity operators like + plus expression
on - - expression these this table
essentially tells us that the rules are
such that operators with higher
precedence that is towards the top of
the table are evaluated before the
operators with relatively lower
precedence let's see all this in action
so that we understand them better let's
start with something which is much known
to us let us say arithmetic an
assignment operator so in this scenario
if I write int X equal to 5 now this is
assignment
now this should be clear that it is
evaluated from right to left and now if
you try to print the value value of x is
value of x is 5 so the sign is operation
operator comes actually worked out now
rest of the operators which we are going
to learn in this demo let us talk about
arithmetic arithmetic operators so in
this we will talk about plus minus
multiplication division and then
percentage that is a remainder now if I
have two variables in X equal to five
and int y equal to two then if I say
that int result equal to X plus y and I
try to write and if I try to output this
output of X plus y is result now let's
try to evaluate this one
so let's say I use P and Q s variables
because X is already used above an
assignment and if I execute this code
then I get output of X plus y is 7 right
now let's use minus operator for - you
get output of X minus y is 3 in job
upper multiplication we use a strict
sign and you will see that value of
multiplication will give you 10 Division
is again interesting both are integer
values so the result is 2 so what
happens here is both are integer and the
output which is 2.5 is also converted
automatically to 2 and not last but not
the least but very important operator is
percentage operator here if I write X
percentage Y the output is 1 this means
Anand file is divided by 2 the remainder
is 1 now these were the arithmetic
operators note that here you also see
this plus sign this is also an operator
as you guess it this is essentially a
concatenation operator this strength is
concatenated with this result output all
the result is integer but this integer
is concatenated with string and in this
operation Java automatically converts
this integer into its corresponding
string representation and concatenate or
append to this string which is on its
left right now let's understand
something about unary operators
unary operators are again very
interesting so if I have eight of em is
equal to six and if I write this out
value of x + + + X X + + now let's
understand what would be the output of
this one so I am using M as a variable
here the value of M plus plus is 6m + +
operator means that use the value of M
and then increase it by one
I repeat F plus plus means use the value
of M and then increment it right there
is another operator which is another
unary operator which is M minus - M - -
would print again it will print 6
because it will use the value of M and
then decrement it in order to see this
as proofs that the values actually
decrease decreased value of M is M so if
you see here value of n becomes slice
after this operation right if I use -
minus M in this scenario - minus M will
mean decrement the value and then use it
right let's understand this in action
you will see that the value of M - my L
actually I should change here also so
the value of minus minus M is 5 and
value of M is 5 here it will decrement
and then
use it I hope this is clear right now
let's understand the automatic operators
and assignment operators so we so first
of all an operator which was assignment
operator in this case it is evaluated
from right to left as I explained in
case of our thematic operators we have
left to right evaluation for example
plus addition subtraction multiplication
division and remainder operation and you
also saw that we can combine the
operators let us see how to combine the
operators combination so in this case if
I write int of let's take two new
variables H equal to o M plus 1 right or
let's say if I have to write into H is
equal to or or if I to write if I to
reuse the variable I can use in em is
equal to M plus 1 M plus 5 let's say so
I can and I can see the output of this
as value of M is so the value of M in
case in this case is 10 this same
operation can be written as plus equal
to and you will see the output remains
same right now this is the combination
of average operators plus equal to minus
equal to x equal to division equal to
all these are valid from combination of
operators right there are other
operators also which are conditional
operators like conditional and
conditional laws but we will see them
while we learn the conditions and
conditional constructs in Java like if
etc unary operators like plus plus minus
minus
we have already seen there is another
operator which is unary operator which
is not which is negation for example if
I write boolean X boolean are bool equal
to true and if I write this out if I
write value of bool is here the value of
bood is true
but if I put here not operator then it
will just negate its value right so this
is also unary operator now let's move to
relational operators now in order to
understand the relation of datas we can
have some values like we will say int x
equal to 5 and let's say int y equal to
say 3 and now I want to understand
whether X equal to Y so if I write x
equal to 5 if X is equal to 5 and Y is
equal to 3 then this entire expression
will turn out to be true right what I am
trying to check is that if X is 5 and Y
is 3 here and is the conditional and
operator and let's see the output
so the result is true if I write if X is
5 and Y is 4
first of all X will give an X equal to
equal to 5 will evaluate to true and
because it is conditional and then y
equal to equal to 4 will get evaluated
which will turn out to be false if Y is
3 and if X is 4 if I evaluate this first
of all X equal to equal to 4 will get
evaluated and since it is already false
this second condition Y is y equal to 3
will not get evaluated this is the
conditional nature of this operator
right if I write all conditional or
operator here then X equal to equal to 4
will get evaluated since this will give
false because of conditional or nature y
equal to equal to 3 will also get
evaluated which will return true and
hence the result would be true let's see
the answer right so here we have a
conditional operator of equal to equal
to sign which we just now saw the not
equal to is represented by not equal to
greater than equal greater than greater
than less than greater than equal to
less than equal to these all are
relational operators and you can use
them as we have used equal to equal to
sign
conditional I on conditional or a really
interesting operators as I said when
condition1 and condition2 is returned
both get evaluated if all is there then
all the conditions are getting evaluated
in conditional and if first condition is
false
second condition will not get evaluated
that is the conditional nature right yes
now let's talk about one more operator
which is which is also interesting
nature
let's say if I write in the term re
result I'm using the variable name
ternary result because I'm going to use
term any operator ternary operator says
that if X if a condition is given and
then if this condition is true then
assign the value of zero or otherwise
minus one so note that this equation
mark e : is condition operator we
provide a condition then we provide
conditional operator then the value
which should be used wherein when this
condition is true then : and then
condition then a value which would be
used when the condition is false so
let's see what is the result here turn
read is world is so ternary result is 0
because X is 5 if I would be checking
the condition if X is not equal to 6 or
not equal to 5 then out Turner it is 8
is minus 1 because X is equal to 5
therefore X not equal to 5 were written
false and therefore minus 1 is getting
used right now this was essentially the
ternary operator now let's talk about
bitwise operators in order to understand
the bitwise operators what we are going
to do here is we are going to use some
kind of demo for this you need to
understand that if I assigned int a is
equal to that's it - then
behind-the-scene this is nothing but a
binary 0 0 1 0 if I use int be equal to
say 4 then this is 0 1 0 0 right now you
so I want to use the bit operator then
first of all let me show you the
negation operator so if I write this out
value of value of a before operation it
is a and then what I am going to do is
that I am assigning a equal to negative
a and then I am going to print value of
a Oscar operation is this one now let's
see the output of this this thing so
value of a before operation is - value
of a after operation is - three
note that in Java integer variable
contains 32 bits right now after
applying the negation the bit pattern
would change to zero is becoming once
and one becoming zero and the final
value of that is minus three right now
let's move to other operators this was
negation now if I have B which is 4 and
if I'm using 0 1 0 0 which is full thing
here now I want to let's see and so
let's say if I say in result equal to a
and B now a and B means this is it this
is bitwise and bitwise and now the value
of
a and B is
value of a and B operation is zero
now when you to add operation then you
will see that the output is zero zero
zero zero because if bitwise and we'll
give you all zeros now if we use bitwise
or operator all you have to do is you
have to change this and to simple or
operator and let's see the value the
value should be equal to X this one
which is equal to six right output is 6
now this is bitwise or operators now one
of the very interesting operator which I
am going to tell you now is bitwise XOR
operator with bitwise XOR operator says
that when the two bits are different now
let's see this in action then we will
understand more about it now this is
bitwise or operator right now bitwise X
or B should also give you the same
result 6 why because 0 1 will give you 1
1 0 will give you 1 0 0 will give you 0
1 1 will give you zero right now bitwise
XOR operator will give you again 6 right
now this was the bitwise operation
operator we learnt about inversion of
bit we learnt about bitwise and we saw
the demo of this Weishaupt and we also
saw it twice XOR so this was the basic
introduction of operator precedence
water various operators in arithmetic
domain logical operators and bitwise
operators this is the basic knowledge
that you will be using in our coming
tutorials
while we write constructs like if or so
it is condition switch condition and
different kind of looping constructs
right in in those scenarios you would be
using various conditions where such
operators will be of very use way off
lot of cues
I hope you enjoyed this tutorial stay
