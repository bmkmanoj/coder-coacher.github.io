this video we'll discuss configuring the
netting to be binding to use message
security mode instead of transport
security the default security mode for
net TCP binding is transport Transport
Security provides message protection
that is encryption and digital
signatures at the transport layer in
this video we'll discuss customizing the
net easy be binding to use message
security instead of the default
transport security the MSDN link right
here contains all the system provided
bindings and their security defaults if
we navigate to that URL notice the net
tcp binding right here the default
security mode is transport but net tcp
binding also supports message and mix
the security modes now let's flip to
visual studio let's create a new project
of type class library and let's call the
simple service let's delete this class 1
dot cs file that's what we generated to
this project let's go ahead and add a
new item and we want to add a WCF
service let's call our WCF service
simple service let's change the return
type of this operation contract to
string let's call this get message and
let's also include a parameter of type
string now let's go ahead and implement
the service contract within simple
service dot cs file let's get rid of
this to work method and we want this get
message method to return a string so we
are going to concatenate the word hello
with the parameter value and then return
that string back to the caller so we
have a very simple division series here
on let's host our WCF service using a
console application let's call this
console application host now let's build
our simple service and then let's add a
reference to a simple service and we
also need to add a reference to
what service model assembly so let's go
ahead and do that as well all right now
let's go ahead and add the application
configuration file within the host
project and within the config file we
need to specify the required
configuration to host the WCF servers to
speed things up I have already typed
this configuration so let's go ahead and
paste it right here and look at the
endpoint we have the ABC of the endpoint
address binding and the contract look at
the binding its net TCP whining and if
you look at the configure idea we don't
have any section that customizes the net
TCP binding meaning we are using the
default subnet DCP bindings and the
default security mode for net TCP
binding is transport so at the moment
this de BCF service is using transport
security mode and then within program
dot C as file of this host project let's
bring in system dot service model
namespace and within the main method we
need to write code to start the WCF
service and to speed things up I've
already typed this code so let's go
ahead copy and paste this code right
here and then let's set our host project
as the starter project and then while we
are here let's also enable message
logging and to do that click on tools
select WCF service configuration editor
click on file open and we want to open
this config file so let's open this app
config file that is present within the
host project and we want to enable
message logging so enable auto flash and
enable message logging and set this log
entire message to true
okay so at this point we have message
logging also enable so let's go ahead
and run our WCF service by pressing
control f5 so we have the WCF service up
and running now let's create a client
application for our WCF service so let's
create a windows forms application let's
call this client let's drag and drop a
button control onto this form and let's
actually change the text on the button
to something like call service and then
let's also change the name of the button
to BTN call service let's double click
the button to generate a click event
handler now let's add a reference to our
WCF service and the base URL is
localhost 8080 that's where our WCF
service is available so click go this
should discover our simple service
that's available at that address and
let's specify the namespace as simple
service so at this point we should have
the required proxy classes so within the
button click even handler let's create
simple service client let's call it
client and the client has got this get
message method and let's say we want to
pass name as protein and whatever string
that we get back we want to display that
within message box so message box dot
show we are going to pass that return
value to the message box alright so now
let's go ahead and run the client as
well and then click call service sohe
loop regime we get the message that we
expect now since we have enabled message
logging let's go to the hosts project
folder within Windows Explorer and then
inspect the logged message value
so if we navigate the last message and
look at the XML right here notice that
the message body is in plain text okay
and this basically implies that at the
moment we are using Transport Security
so Transport Security provides message
protection that is encryption and
digital signatures at the transport
layer so by the time the message is
arrived at the message log it's already
decrypted that's why we see it in plain
text okay so this implies that the
defaults of the net TCP binding are
being used now let's go ahead and
customize the net TCP binding to use
message security instead of Transport
Security and how do we do that
just include a binding section and then
specify the security mode as message so
here we are customizing net TCP binding
and look at this we have given this
binding a name called net PCP and then
within the endpoint we are associating
this customization with this endpoint
using the binding configuration
attribute so let's go ahead and do that
so let's close the client and the WCF
service console and then let's actually
navigate to WCF service solution so
within the app dot config file just
below system dot service model element
let's include the bindings section and
we want to customize net TCP binding so
let's give this binding a name let's
call it net TCP you can give it any
meaningful name you want and then we
want to set the security mode so
security mode equals message okay so
once you have the section here now we
need to associate this customization
with the endpoint so we are going to use
the binding name for that and then go to
the endpoint and here use binding
configuration attribute
and then specify that name there all
right so with this changes let's go
ahead and run the WCF service once again
and then let's go to the client
application let's actually delete the
service reference and then let's add the
service reference once again so now we
have customized the WCF service to use
message security instead of the default
Transport Security and at this point if
you look at the app config file of the
client application notice that you know
this is the binding configuration one
name and if you look at that binding
configuration element okay that's the
one and look at this we are using net
ACP binding and if you look at the
security mode here its message security
mode okay all right so now let's go
ahead and run the client application and
then click call service so we should get
that message hello pragya and now let's
go to the log folder and then inspect
the log so now if we navigate to the
last message notice the board a so here
we have the soap message so that's the
soap envelope but if we scroll down here
we have this soup body and look at the
data right here Sipho value so this is
encrypted so the message is encrypted
here which implies that they using
message security and not transport
security so it's very easy to customize
you know the security mode and decline
credential type in the previous video
session we discussed customizing WS HTTP
winding to use Transport Security
instead of its default message security
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
