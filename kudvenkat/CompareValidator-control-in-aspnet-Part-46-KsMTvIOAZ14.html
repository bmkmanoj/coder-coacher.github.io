venket this is part 46 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll discuss
about the compare validator control in
asp.net before continuing with the
session I strongly recommend to watch
parts 44 and 45 of this video series
compare validated control is used to
compare the value of one control with
the value of another control or a
constant value the comparison operation
can be any of the following equal
greater than greater than equal less
than less than equal not equal datatype
check
compare validator can also be used for
data type checking we'll look at an
example of each of these now when we try
to register with any of the websites
usually it will ask us to enter username
then password re-type password if the
password and retype password fields does
not match you know we get a validation
error message stating password and
retype password must match as you can
see on the screen now let us see how to
achieve this using compare validator
control let's flip to visual studio I
have the webform already designed just
to save some time and it's a simple HTML
where you have password text a text box
retype password and a text box okay now
let's drag and drop a compare validator
next to this retype password text box so
let's flip to the source mode so here I
want the compare value data validation
control so let's drag and drop that
there okay let's give this compare
validator a meaningful ID since it's
comparing passwords I'm going to call
this compare validator
passwords run it is equal to server and
let's give it a meaningful error message
the error message that we want is
password and re-type password must match
and what are the other properties if you
look at what we want we want the
password and compare password I mean
retype password to be compared so the
first thing that we have to specify here
is the control to validate property so
which control are we validating here we
are validating txt D type of password
text box okay and we want the value
within this text box to be compared with
the value in txt password text box and
to tell that we can use control to
compare property so control control to
compare is DX D password so now the
value in these two text boxes will be
compared with each other but how will
the comparison be done will they be
compared for equality or greater than
greater than equal to so which
comparison operation will you do
how will you specify that using the
operator property of the compare
validator control so operator is equal
to we want to compare for equality if
they are equal that's fine if they are
not equal then validation should fail
and another thing that we have to
specify is the data type
so which data types are you comparing
are their strings d x what's the data
type here in our case a password is a
string data type okay and one more small
thing that we have to do we know that
password and retype passwords should be
masked so let's set the property of the
textbox control text mode property to
password so that whatever the user types
that will be masked and the final thing
let's change the full color of the
validation control to red and we can do
that in the designer or in the HTML okay
so that's it
and if you look at the button here when
I click the button we have the event
handler here if the page dot is valid
property returns true we know that the
validation has succeeded and we know
that page dot is valid property is going
to return true if all the validation
controls has succeeded validation in
which case we want to write a do dotnet
code to save the data but here we are
just displaying the status message data
saved and then we are setting the color
of the label control to green whereas if
the validate is valid property returns
false then it comes to the else block in
which case we know that at least one
validation controls have failed
validation so we want to display that
error message validation fail data not
saved and the label color is set to red
there okay so let's go ahead and run
this form and see if the validation is
working as expected
so once we type a password and if retype
password doesn't match with that so I am
typing the password as test but I am
typing there retype password as best
let's see if they match they don't match
and we get the error message
let me try type in the matching password
and look at that the error message goes
away so we can use in this example we
have just seen how to use compare
validator to compare the value of one
control with the value of another
control now let us see how to compare
the value of one control with a constant
value now that we will do using data of
application textbox so if you look at in
other web form design here I have a text
box where the user can enter date of
application now the rule is that the
date of application date should be
greater than or equal to in a11 2012 so
I want to compare the date that user
enters in this textbox with that
constant value so let us see have to do
that using the compare validator control
so let's drag and drop the compare
validator control next to this textbox
so we have that compare validator let's
flip to the source mode and change the
properties so this compare validator is
actually you know comparing date of
application so I'm going to call that
compare validator date of application
run at is equal to server and let's give
it a meaningful error message so date of
application must be greater than 0 1 0 1
2012 so that's the error message now
which control are we validating here we
are validating txt date of application
and remember here we don't have another
control to compare we want to compare
with a constant value and to do that we
use a property called value to compare
so value to compare is equal to what's
your constant value that you want to
compare to 0 1 0 1 2012 ok so instead of
control to compare we are using valid
value to compare and the other
properties remains the same for example
operator we need to specify what type of
comparison you want to do I want to do a
greater than comparison and you also
have to specify the data type so what is
the data type that you are comparing
here in this case it's going to be a
date so that's it now
let's go ahead and run this and see you
for validation works as expected now the
idea is the date of application should
be greater than 1 1 2012 now let me
enter this state 1 1 2010 which is
obviously less than 1 1 2012 let me try
to save because that date of application
must be greater than 1 1 2012 we get
that error message as expected on the
other hand if I enter 2013 look at that
data saved there a message goes away as
expected and if you want the error
message in red color obviously you will
set the full color property to red okay
now the last example that we look at is
we have discussed that compare value
data can also be used for data type
checking I just want to ensure whatever
data that the user enter matches the
type that I am expecting for example age
I want the age to be entered by the user
in a numeric in a number format rather
than in alphabets let's see how to
achieve that using compare value data
again on this web form we have a text
box where the user can enter their age
and I want to ensure that that's an
integer so let's see how to do the data
type checking using the compare
validator control so let's drag and drop
the compare validator control on to the
web form and let's flip to the source to
set the property so this is validating
age so I'm going to call this compare
validator age then it is equal to server
error message each must be a number if
that's the error message that we want
and I want the full color to be red so
let's set that and let's get this on the
next line okay so what what are the
other properties that we need to set now
the first thing is the operator okay so
what operator what comparison we want to
do we don't want to do equal greater
than or greater than equal we want to do
a data type check so I'm going to choose
my operator as data type check and
obviously you have to specify the
control to validate so which control I
want to validate I want to validate txt
age okay and another important thing is
the type so what is
the datatype check that you want to do
you know on which data type you want to
do that how will you specify that using
the type property and I am expecting an
integer type so anything that the user
enters into the textbox must be
converted to integer if not then through
an error message okay so let's see those
are all the properties that needs to be
set for data type checking
okay so let's flip to the design mode
let's run this and see if that works as
expected
so each I enter let's say for example
ten alphabets look at that age must be a
number on the other hand as soon as I
enter in number you know click away the
error message goes away now another
thing look at this if there is an error
let's say I enter 10 and I click Save
button look at that it shows the error
message but look at this the textbox
doesn't receive the focus you know what
I basically want to do is whenever the
validation fails you know I want the
control to receive the focus
automatically when the validation fails
is there a way to achieve that
absolutely there is a property called
set focus on validation failure so if
you look at the properties there set
focus on error by default that property
is false if you set that to true then
whichever control this validation
control is validating it will
automatically you know make that control
receive the focus if the validation
fails so let's run this now and keep in
mind this validation control I mean this
property is supported by all validation
controls so if I plus 10 and then click
Save look at that
I validation fail and I still have the
cursor blinking there so I can just type
in backspace and then enter my correct
data as expected so set focus on error
property supported by all validation
controls if this property is set to true
then the control will automatically
receive focus when the validation fails
and we have seen the properties that are
specific to the compare validator
control to compare the type operator and
value to compare
