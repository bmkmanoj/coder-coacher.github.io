in this video well discuss the angular
project structure we already know one of
the easiest ways to generate a working
angular project is by using the angular
CLI tool with this ng new command we
generate a working angular project out
of the box in no time
I've already executed this command and
here is the angular project generated by
the angular CLI tool as you can see
there are several files and folders in
this project in this video we'll discuss
all these files and folders and their
purpose except the source folder and its
contents in our next video we'll discuss
the source folder and its contents so
let's get started with the rest of the
files first let's look at this package
store Jason so what is packaged for
Jason and what does it contain
in short this package store Jason file
contain the packages to build and run
our angular application we can also add
our own custom scripts so if we look at
this package dot Jason notice there are
two sets of packages dependencies and
dev dependencies these dependencies are
essential for running our angular
application whereas these dev
dependencies are only required to
develop the application which means we
don't need these packages on our
production servers now all these
packages and dependencies and dev
dependencies are installed into this
node modules folder by the node package
manager
when npm install' command is executed so
in addition to the packages this package
to our jason file can also contain
custom scripts so if we look at this
package store jason file again notice we
have script section right here and the
start property is pointing to this
command ng serve so when we execute NPM
start it's actually going to execute
this command ng serve and what does ng
serve do it builds the application and
starts the server now in addition to
that if we also want to launch the
browser and open our application within
that we can modify the start property so
instead of just ng serve we can also
include this option - - open
so what is this command going to do it's
not only going to build the application
and start the server it's also going to
launch the browser and open our
application with the net when we execute
npm start command so let's quickly
verify this let's go back to command
prompt change the directory to our
angular project and then we want to
execute this NPM start command and
behind the scenes it's going to execute
ng serve - - open because that's what
NPM start is pointing to look at that
ng serve - - open is being executed
there we go
built completed the server is running in
watch mode we have the browser launched
and our application running next we have
the node modules folder which we have
just discussed the node modules folder
is right here and we know that whatever
packages we have under dependencies and
dev dependencies these packages are
installed into this node modules folder
so when we expand that we can see all
the modules right here next we have e to
e folder e to e stands for end to end as
the name implies this folder contains
end to end tests and their configuration
files will discuss end to end test in
detail in our upcoming videos dot
angular - CL I dot Jason this is the
angular CLI configuration file which is
right here
we discussed the settings in this file
in our previous video next we have dot
editor config this is the configuration
file for visual studio code which is
right here as you can see the settings
in this file lets us set certain coding
style guidelines for example what NN
style do you want spaces are tabs what
should be the end n size etc we can
share this editor configuration file
with other developers in our team to
maintain consistent coding styles if you
want to learn more about this editor
configuration please visit this URL
right here next we have the dot git
ignore file this file contains the files
and folders that we do not want to check
into source control and
file is right here now one of the
folders that we definitely don't want to
check in the source control is this test
folder whenever we build of our angular
application the build results are copied
into this test folder so we definitely
don't want to check that into source
control and that's the reason why it is
listed in this git ignore file so
basically all the files and folders that
are listed here are ignored and they are
not checked into source control karma or
cons dot J s karma is the unit test
runner for angular applications as the
name implies karma dot conf tortillas is
the configuration file for karma and
that file is right here just like
caramel corn tortillas we have
protractor conf dot J's and that file is
right here protractor is an end-to-end
test framework for angular applications
as the name implies protracted corn
tortillas is the configuration file for
protractor next we have the readme dot
MD file as the name implies this is the
readme file and if we look at this file
within Visual Studio code notice out of
the box it contains some commonly used
angular CLI commands like ng serve ng
generate ng build etc now we can enhance
this file to include our own project
documentation so if anyone checks out
our application they know the commands
to use to build on and test our
application ts config dot jason TS in
the file name stands for typescript as
the name implies this is the typescript
compiler configuration file and this
file contains several typescript
compiler settings for example if you
want your typescript code to be
automatically compiled to JavaScript
when we save the typescript file then
set this compile on save property to
true similarly if you don't want dot map
files to be generated then set source
map property to false dot map files are
useful when debugging our application we
don't usually need these
my files on a production server so when
we do a production build we usually set
this property to false finally we've got
Tia Slynt dot Jason Bangla has got a
built-in linting tool which checks our
typescript code for programmatic errors
stylistic errors and any non adherence
to our coding standards and conventions
Tia Slynt dot Jason is the linting
configuration file will discuss the
settings that we've caught in this file
in our upcoming videos when we discuss
lending in detail in our next video
we'll discuss the source folder and its
contents thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
