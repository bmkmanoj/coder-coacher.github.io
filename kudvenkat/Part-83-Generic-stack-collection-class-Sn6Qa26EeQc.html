video we'll discuss the generic stack
collection class stack is a generic last
in first or collection class that's
present in systems or collections or
generic namespace the stack collection
class is analogous to a stack of plates
as you can see here if you want to add a
new plate to the stack of plates you
would place it on top of all the already
existing plates and if you want to
remove a plate from the stack you'll
first remove the one that you have last
added the stack collection class also
operates in a similar fashion the last
item to be added to the stack will be
the first item to be removed from this
tag let's understand this with an
example so we'll be using this customer
class in this demo in our main method we
are creating five instances of this
customer class customer one through
customer five first let's create an
instance of this tag class and what type
of stack do we want to create we want to
create stack of customers so the type ER
is going to be customer and let's call
it stack customers and to add an item to
the stack we use push method so what is
this push method going to do it's going
to push the item at the top of the stack
at the moment we don't have any items
within the stack so when this method is
invoked this customer one object will be
the only item within the stack and that
will be present at the top of the stack
and what's going to happen if I add
another customer object this customer to
object will now be placed on top of
customer one so which object do we have
at the top of the stack right now
customer two let's add other customer
objects as well so customer three
customer four and customer five so which
object do we have at the top of the
stack right now customer file and why is
that because that is the item that is
that added last to the stack so these
are stacked one over the other so at
this point we have customer five object
at the top of the stack and if we want
to remove an item from the stack which
item are we going to get back
customer five and why is that because
that is what is present at the top of
the stack and how do we get an item from
the stack we use pop method for that and
what is this pop method going to do it's
going to remove and return the object
that is present at the top of this tag
so let's store this object in a variable
of type customer and let's call it c1
and let's say I want to print the ID and
the name of the customer so c1 doth ID
and I want to separate that with a dash
okay and what is this pop method going
to do it's going to remove and return
the item from the stack so let's also
print the count of the items that are
left within the stack so let's say items
left in this tag equals and how do we
get the count of the items within the
stack we can use count property just
like how we have used it with other
collection classes okay now let's go
ahead and pop out the rest of the
objects that we have in the stack and to
speed things up I have already typed
this code so let me copy and paste it
right here and if you look at this code
again this is very similar to what we
have here it's just that we are invoking
pop method several times okay so let's
go ahead and run this and see what
output we get look at the first item to
be removed and returned from the stack
is one zero five which is customer five
object and that is what we have added
last to this tag so stack is last in
first or collection the last item that
you add will be the first item that will
be removed and returned when you invoke
this pop method and look at what is
going to happen to the count
it gets decremented why is that because
pop method removes the item and then
returns the item okay now is it possible
to iterate through all the items within
the stack absolutely we can use for each
loop with the stack collection class
just like how we used it with other
collection classes like less
dictionary and cue so let's use the for
each loop so for each customer see one
in stack customers collection so let's
say I want to print their ID and name
and then the total items that are left
in the stack and let's get rid of this
code and let's run this now and look at
that when we use a for each loop we
still get the items in last in first out
order and look at the total count it's
still five because for each loop only
iterates through the items within the
stack but it's not going to remove them
all right now we know that a pop method
removes and then returns the item that
is present at the top of the stack is it
possible to return an item that's
present at the top of the stack without
removing it absolutely we can use peek
method for that purpose now if you
remember we have used the speak method
with the cue collection class as well
and in that case what is that going to
do it is going to return the item that
is present at the beginning of the queue
in a similar fashion when you use peak
method with a stack collection class
it's going to return the item that is
present at the top of the stack without
removing it let's look at that in action
so let's say customer c1 equals stack
customers dot peak and if you look at
the intelligence look at what it is
going to do it's going to return the
object that's present at the top of the
stack without removing it and then let's
print the ID
their name and then the total count all
right so let's run this now look at that
we get customer one zero five and look
at the count still five because peak
method doesn't remove the item from this
tag it only returns the item that is
present at the top of the stack and how
do you check if a specific object exists
within the stack we can use contains
method just like how we used it with a
queue collection class we use it in a
similar fashion if the object that you
are looking for exists within the stack
then this method is going to return true
otherwise it's going to return false all
right so to insert an item at the top of
the stack use push method to remove and
return the item that is present at the
top of the stack use pop method a for
each loop iterates through the items in
the stack but will not remove them from
this tag the items from the stack are
retrieved in last in first out order the
last element to be added to the stack
will be the first item to be returned
from this tag and to check if an item
exists in the stack use contains method
what's the difference between pop and
peek methods pop method removes and
returns the item at the top of the stack
whereas peek returns the item that is
present at the top of the stack without
removing it that's it for today thank
you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
