Yahoo in this video well discuss
generating modules using the angular CLI
in a real world an angular project
typically contains more than one module
when we generated this angular project
using the angular CLI we got one module
out of the box which is this app module
this is the root module of our
application we can also generate modules
using the angular CLI to generate a
module using the angular CLI we may use
this command ng generate module and in
the module name or we can also use its
alias ng G for generate M for module and
the module name let's generate a new
module to generate a new module we use
ng which stands for angular CLI itself
G for generate M for module and let's
name a module student module this is
going to create a new module called
student it's going to place this module
inside its own dedicated folder which is
also named student as you can see right
here now for us to be able to use this
newly generated module we must first
import it into the root module and
angler cela is not going to do that for
us automatically by default now we have
two choices here one we can manually
import the student module into app
module or we can instruct the angular
CLI to do so at the generation time well
this is the second option in just a bit
first let's manually import the student
module into our root module which is the
app module notice within visual studio
code we have student folder and inside
that we have our student module which we
have just generated now let's import the
student module in our app module and
there are two steps for that first we
need to include the required import
statement to import the student module
from this file right here and then we
need to make the student module part of
the imports array so these two steps we
have the student module imported into
our route module now instead of manually
importing the module we can
anglers he lied to do that for us
automatically to tell angular CLI to
import the newly generated module into
another module we use - - Moodle option
notice in this case we are telling not
only generate the students module but
also imported into our route module app
module we can either use the full option
named module like that or we can use its
alias M then specify the name of the
module so let's generate a new module
before that let's clear the screen
ng G M this time let's name a module
customer module we not only want to
generate this module we also want to
import it into another module so let's
use - M and then specify the name of the
module into which we want to import
that's newly generated module we want to
import it into app module now let's also
use the dry-run flag so we can actually
see the list of files and folders it's
going to generate notice it not only
created the customer module it also
updated app module to import customer
module into it by default the customer
module that is generated is placed
inside its own dedicated folder which is
also named customer if you don't want a
folder of its own
then simply set - - flat option - true
so this is going to place the customer
module directly within the app folder
and also notice by default a module will
not have a spec file generated if you
also want a spec file to be generated
then said - - spec equals true now let's
execute this command without the dry run
flag so it's actually going to
physically create these files for us
there we go
notice now our customer module does not
have a dedicated folder we have a spec
file created and app module is also
updated notice within visual studio code
behalf of a customer module right here
the spec file is here and if we look at
our app module we have the required
import statement and custom module is
also made part of the inputs array
so to generate a spec file set - - spec
option - true if you don't want a
dedicated folder for the modular
generating set - - flat - true thank you
for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
