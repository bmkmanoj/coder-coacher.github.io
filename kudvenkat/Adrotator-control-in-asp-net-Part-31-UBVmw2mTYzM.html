venket this is part 31 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll learn about
using the asp.net to add rotated control
the ad rotator control in asp.net is
used to display random ads these ads can
be stored in an XML file or in a
database table in this example we will
see how to use an XML file so let's flip
to visual studio here I have a simple
asp.net web application project let's
add an XML file to this project right
click on the project select add new item
select XML file since this file is going
to contain the advertisements
information give it a meaningful name
let's call this adds data in this case
and click Add that should add the XML
file now we know that this XML file is
going to serve as the data source for
the ad rotator control so this XML file
is going to store the advertisements
information okay now I have this
advertisement XML already typed then
let's copy and paste that here so if you
look at this since the add a rotator
control has to understand these ads it
has to confirm to a specific structure
now the root element here is the
advertisements element and I have three
advertisements here and each ad has got
you know if you look at in the end it
has got an image and then when the user
clicks on that image they can navigate
to the advertisers website so the image
of the ad where is that present that is
determined by the image URL property so
here we are seeing for the first ad the
image URL is going to be present you
know until the till there's nothing but
in the current web applications rooted
directory I am going to have images
folder within which I am going to have
Google dot PNG so obviously within our
web application project we need to have
the images folder so right-click and add
a new folder and let's call that images
and this folder is going to contain
Google dot PNG image and similarly if
you look at the second ad that's going
to contain pledgie m-- and the third ad
youtube so all the images are going to
come from
this part within the root web
application directory check the images
directory and then there the image
should be present I already have this
image so let me copy all of them and
paste them into this images folder okay
so we have the images so now when we run
the web application project what's going
to happen you know this if this end is
displayed that image gets displayed and
then when the user clicks on that ad you
know it has to go to the advertisers
website and that is controlled by the
navigate URL the URL of the advertiser
right here okay and then alternate text
obviously the image is missing for some
reason you have misspelled ad or your
image is missing
then in that case it will use this text
please visit google.com and then the
next important you know element here is
the impressions and if you look at that
for each ad I have a different number
now what is this this is a weighted
number meaning you know this element
actually determines how often among
these ads a specific ad will be
displayed the higher the number the
higher is the likelihood that specific
ad will be displayed if you look at this
I have three ads here and the highest
number as far as impressions is
concerned is a presume ad the second and
it has got 30 so it's most likely that
this ad will be more frequently shown
rather than the other two ads okay so
now let's go ahead so all we have done
until now is created an XML file which
is storing our advertisements
information and then the images we added
the images to our web application
project now to display the ads
themselves we need to add the ad rotator
control onto the web form so let's drag
and drop the ad rotator control and if
you look at this control it's like any
other standard asp.net control it is got
the ID and when it is equal to server
now somehow we need to link that this ad
rotator control with this XML file that
has the advertisements information so
how do we do that there is a property
called advertisements file you can do
that here
within the HTML source or I can actually
flip to the design mode go to the
properties of this and then set the
advertisement file there so click on the
ellipsis button from your project
selects adds data that XML click okay so
that should have added the advertisement
file there that's it we have hooked up
everything now let's go ahead and run
this project so obviously the ad rotator
control will look at the XML file read
one of the advertisements information
and load that here and look at that it's
actually displaying this ad pragya ad
and now as I move my mouse over the add
look at that at the bottom of the
browser window it displays the navigate
URL the URL that I am going to go to
when I click this ad and that is
determined by navigate URL so when I
click that I will visit the presume
techcom website the advertisers website
and if you look at this here it's
actually we are actually navigating to
the advertisers website within the same
window leaving the original website now
some people prefer to open the links to
advertisers websites in a new window is
it possible to do with the ad rotator
control absolutely all you have to do is
to set a target property so go to the
HTML source and there is a target
property set that to underscore blank
that's all we have to do so now let's go
ahead and run this once again now when
we click any advertisement we actually
will land up on the advertisers website
in a new browser window so when I click
this look at that I am still on the
original site but then the YouTube has
actually opened up in a new browser
window
okay let's close that all right so we
have seen how to you know open the
advertisers website in a new browser
window and another important element
here within the XML file is the keyword
okay now we could use this keyword
actually this keyword element to filter
the advertisement that we want to show
using the ad rotate ad rotate control
now this ads dot XML can contain
hundreds and hundreds of ads okay and in
my web application let's say I have 25
or 30 web pages and based on you know
the content of this specific web page I
want to filter the ads okay is it
possible absolutely okay now let's say
on web form one I want to display only
Google ads if you look at the
advertisements that we have at this time
we have three ads out of which two are
related to Google YouTube and google.com
are related to Google now on this web
form one you know it's more it contains
most inform or information about Google
websites and Google products so probably
displaying Google ads on this page is
more relevant contextual advertisement
ok so I want to filter every other ad
except you know Google ads is that
possible
absolutely and how do we do that using
the keyword filter so you specify the
keyword filter here now I want to
display only Google ads on this web form
one dot aspx so in that case I use this
Google Keyword and put that there so
what's going to happen when when this
page renders the ad rotator control
filters every other ads it only picks up
those ads which matches that keyword you
know Google in this case only YouTube
and Google will be shown let me run this
now so no matter how many times we are
going to refresh this company this page
it's going to either show YouTube or
Google it will never show presume tech
ad okay now we are changing
keyword filter you know in the HTML we
can also change that this actually in
the code-behind file programmatically on
the page load or anywhere in in any
event that you want and how do we do
that all you have to do is add rotated
one dot keyword filter and specify your
keyword filter there and now this
technique is is very useful because you
know in a real time you have the master
page and usually the master page
dictates the layout of your asp.net web
application project and maybe you have a
top banner there displaying
advertisements and which actually
generates revenue for you but you have
hundreds and hundreds of pages within
that web application and depending on
the you know content on each specific
content page you know you want to change
the advertisements that you want but you
show on that banner and the master page
so in the content page you can actually
change the keyword filter will actually
talked about this when we talk when we
discuss about master pages in in a later
session but keep in mind changing the
keyword filter at runtime could be very
useful especially when the ad rotator
control is a master page and if we want
to change the keyword filter on each
content page based on the keyword
density so that we can do contextual
advertisement we'll talk about this when
we talk about master pages in a very
great detail in fact with an example on
this slide you can find resources for
asp.net c-sharp and sequel server
interview questions that's it for today
