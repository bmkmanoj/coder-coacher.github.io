venket this is part 126 of asp.net video
tutorial in this video we'll discuss
about cashing application data in
asp.net in parts 119 to 125 of the
asp.net video tutorial we discussed
about caching web forms caching multiple
responses of web forms
fragment caching using user controls
caching multiple versions of user
controls if you haven't watched these
videos I would strongly encourage you to
do so before continuing with the session
it is possible to store application data
in the web server memory using the cache
object so that the data can be retrieved
faster for example let's say we have a
stored procedure that takes five seconds
to execute and return data we can cache
the data returned by this stored
procedure within an asp.net web
application using the cache object so
that next time when we try to access the
data we can get it from the cache rather
than reprocessing the stored procedure
again let's see that in action let's
flip to sequel server management studio
I have TBL products table here and I
have a stored procedure here called SP
care products and if you look at the
stored procedure it's pretty simple all
it does is select star from TBL products
but before that we have this wait for
delay now since this is a very small
table and has got only 4 rows you know
if I execute the select star from TBL
products it's going to execute in less
than a second just to introduce some
artificial query processing time I am
using this wait for delay here so wait
for delay you know the first two zeros
are the hours the next two 0 7 minutes
and the last 2 zeros are seconds so I am
blocking the execution of this stored
procedure by 5 seconds using this wait
for delay to introduce an artificial
query processing time so now if I
execute the stored procedure it's going
to take at least 5 seconds because we
are blocking the execution for 5 seconds
using this wait for delay here ok now
let's see how to execute the stored
procedure from within an asp.net web
application and then we will try and
catch the data that that is returned by
this stored procedure so let's flip to
visual studio so here I have an asp.net
web application project we have this
waveform 1 dot aspx
and at the moment the design is pretty
simple I have a button control I have a
grid view control and the label control
okay so if you look at the HTML that's
what you see here a button control grid
view and label control okay
in the code-behind file i have already
returned the ad or dotnet code to
retrieve you know to basically execute
the stored procedure SP get products and
return the data and if you look at that
it's the simple ad or net code okay so
if you're new to a do dotnet code I
would strongly encourage you to watch
the ad or dotnet video tutorial we
discussed about you know connecting the
to the database and executing commands
and stored procedures so basically if
you look at this here we are using the
configuration manager class to read you
know the web config connection strain so
in web config file I have a connection
string here and the name of the
connection string is DB connection
string which is basically pointing to my
sequel server local sequel server
database so let's change the connection
string to that and then after we have
the connection string we have you know
creating the sequel connection object
creating a sequel data adapter object
and we are specifying the stored
procedure that we want to execute in
this case SP get products and the stored
procedure will be executed using this
connection object and then we are
specifying the command type as stored
procedure because this is a stored
procedure that we are executing creating
a data set here and then we are
populating that data set with the
results that we get back after we have
the stored procedure executed and look
at this the important thing to note here
is that the return type of this method
is a data set object and look at this
finally we are returning the data set
back so pretty simple straightforward ad
or dotnet code now let's say you know
whatever data said that we get back by
executing by calling this method we want
to cache that data so how do we do that
caching data itself is pretty
straightforward all you need to do is
use the cache object and then give it a
key so I can give any meaningful key so
here as we are storing products data I'm
going to give it a key called products
data
and then you know we can simply assign
our data set so we invoke this method
and then whatever this method is going
to return I am going to you know store
in the cache object with this key okay
that's it this is how we store you know
basically the data in a cache now let's
actually create a data set object let's
call it D s and then let's assign
whatever this method is returning to
that data set and then let's use the
data set in order to be stored in the
cache all right now let's assign this
data set to the grid view control so we
have a grid view control with ID GV
products so I'm going to assign that
data set as the data source for the grid
view control so GB products dot data
source is equal to data set and finally
let's go ahead and invoke the data bind
method and let's also say in the label I
want to display the number of rows that
we have in this data set so to retrieve
the number of rows in the data set I use
data set dot you know data set is
nothing but a collection of tables and
we know that this data set contains one
table so data set dot tables of 0 which
returns the first table and within that
I want the number of rows and then I can
use the count property so let's convert
that to string and let's say you know we
have a label control again which
displays you know a message to the end
user so I'm going to set the text for
that label so label message dot text is
equal to you know this line here will
return the number of rows so I'm going
to append that to you know hard-coded
string basically saying rows retrieved
okay so very simple all we have done so
far is you know executed the stored
procedure whatever data we have caught
in back you know we are storing the data
in a data set and then we are basically
using caching the data set using this
key products data and then we are
setting the data set as the data source
for the grid view control calling data
bind and then displaying the number of
rows that we have in that data table in
a label control okay so let's go ahead
and run this actually we have this code
in page load instead of that let's
actually have this code in the button
click event so on this waveform one I
have this button so when I click that
button that's when I want to do this so
I'm going to copy and paste that code
there so let's run this application as
you might expect the first time you know
when I click that button it's going to
take five seconds at least to execute
that stored procedure okay because this
stored procedure will take five seconds
at least because of this wait for delay
so the waveform is still loading here
once it loads up now look at this when I
click this button look at that it is
still processing processing it's going
to take at least five seconds for that
data to be loaded into the grid view
control so four rows are retrieved
now let's modify this code a little bit
so that you know even if I click now
again it's going to take five seconds
again look at that it's still processing
why because every time you click the
button you are executing you know you're
calling that method which in turn will
execute that stewed procedure and it's
going to take always five seconds to
load
instead of that let's say if I already
have this data in this cache you know
retrieve that from the cache rather than
reprocessing the stored procedure every
time and to do that so basically I'm
saying if we will check okay is there if
is if this cache object is now so I am
basically saying if cache of products
data not equal to now okay if it's not
equal to null then I want to retrieve
data from the cache object else if it is
null then we know that we don't have
anything in the cache
in which case we want to you know call
this method execute the stored procedure
retrieve the data and then put the data
in a cache object and then assign that
as the data source for the grid view
control so now here let's slightly
change this magic message since we are
retrieving data from the database I am
going to say you know whatever are the
number of rows retrieved from database
okay and then I'm going to copy this
just to avoid you know just to save some
time in typing and paste it here and
then we will modify this so if cache of
products data are not equal to null then
what I want to do is basically I want to
retrieve the data set from the cache
object so instead of calling this method
I'm going to retrieve that from the
cache object so cache of products data
now if you look at you know this cache
object look at what it is returning back
it is returning an object back but what
are we expecting we are expecting a data
set so I can type gasps that using the
typecast operator to data set and then
look at that what are we doing with the
data set we don't have to put it in the
cache because it's already there in the
cache so I'm going to get rid of that
line we are simply setting the data set
as the data source calling data bind and
then we are displaying this message in
the label and here let's say date
whatever rows you know four rows
retrieved from cache okay now another
thing I want to do I also want to let's
say display the time it takes you know
when it is retrieving from cache as
opposed to you know the time it takes
when we have to load it from the
database and to do that I'm going to do
a small trick here so let's use a
date/time object detail let's call this
start time so when I click this button
I'm capturing what is the current date
and time on the server and to do that I
can simply use date/time dot now okay so
this is going to return the current date
and time when it is about to start
processing this piece of code so that's
the start time and similarly let's go
ahead and go ahead and compute the end
time so when the processing reaches here
we know that it has completed processing
so I'm going to call this DT and the
time that's the variable okay now how do
I find out the difference between you
know start time and end time in seconds
it's pretty simple let's say end total
seconds for example or total time is
equal to all we need to do is from the
end time subtract the start time so DT
minus DT start time and then we have a
property called a second so when we
subtract two dates we have this property
seconds which returns you know the
difference between that end time and
start time in seconds convert that to
string basically that's the integer so
let's store it in that variable okay
so now what I want to basically do here
is look at this we are already appending
this message to the label here instead
of that let's use a string builder
object build the message and then
finally we'll set that as the text for
the label and to do that I'm going to
use a system dot text string builder
class is present in systems or text
namespace and let's call this SP message
as the name of the variable so a new
string builder and what I am going to do
here is instead of assigning that
message directed to the label I'm going
to append that to the stringbuilder
object okay I'm going to do the same
thing here
okay finally here to the stringbuilder
object again I am going to append the
time it took as well so to the already
existing message I'm going to append
let's say for example let's put a
full-stop here and if we'll stop here
and maybe a space there and a space
there and then we will append the number
of seconds it took so the total number
of seconds is in this variable so I'm
going to take that convert that to
string using two string and then maybe
we can save five seconds load time okay
so now let's go ahead and run this and
see what's going to happen let's rebuild
the solution so if you look at this the
code is pretty simple caching the data
itself very straightforward all you need
to do is use a key and then specify
whatever data that you want to cache
okay and obviously we are using the
cache object for that okay and basically
here we are checking if the cache you
know cache of products data is not now
retrieve that products data from the
cache object typecast it to data set
store it in this variable which is then
set as the data source for the gridview
control called data bind and then here
we are retrieving the number of rows
that are present in that table okay so
let's go ahead and run this now so
control f5 to run the application so
when the waveform loads up you know when
we click the button for the first time
it's going to execute the stored
procedure and get the data from the
database
look at that it's still processing it's
going to take at least five seconds and
we should be getting the data from the
database and we don't have the message
there that's basically because we
haven't set that to the label so let's
go ahead and set that to the label so
LBL message door text is equal to
whatever is there in the stringbuilder
object so string builder object dot to
string and if you are wondering why we
are using string builder object why
can't I use a string object anytime
you're modifying strings and or
performance reasons
is always better to use stringbuilder
objects because strings of type string
are immutable whereas strings of type
string builder are mutable if you want
to know the differences between you know
string and stringbuilder object we have
discussed about that in the c-sharp
video tutorial so please check that
video all right now let's build the
solution once again and run it ok so the
first time when we click the button it
should take at least 5 seconds to
execute the stored procedure look at
that it's still processing ok and in 5
seconds time look at that 4 rows
retrieved from database look at that
that's the message and 5 seconds load
time so it took five seconds load time
now when I click the button again what's
going to happen it it drop it checks
this here okay cache of product data not
equal to null that's true so it will
come here retrieve the data from the
cache and then display that so it has to
be relatively faster I click the button
look at that 4 rows retrieved from the
cache 0 second slow time if you want to
actually know the milliseconds as well
there is another property here instead
of seconds you can actually use dot
total seconds okay
now let's run that so total seconds
actually returns a double so let's
convert that to B of double data type
and run this now so let's build this
once again so now when we click that
button it should show the time including
the milliseconds so when I click the
button it's going to take at least 5
seconds this is the first time so it has
to execute the stored procedure look at
that it actually took 5 seconds and that
mini milliseconds now if I click that
again look at that it literally took
less than a second I'm in zero seconds
ok and look at the message for rows
retrieved from cache so no matter how
many times you click now it's going to
load you know within a very less time
because we already have the data in
cache we don't have to re execute the
stored procedure so
location is going to perform better so
in this video we discussed about storing
application data in cache using direct
assignment that is I have a cache key
and then I'm assigning data to that key
okay in our next video we'll discuss
about other options that are available
to store data in the cache object on the
slide you can find resources for asp.net
