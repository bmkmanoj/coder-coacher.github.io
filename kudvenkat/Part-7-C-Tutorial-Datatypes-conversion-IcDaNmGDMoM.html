am banker this is part 7 left 5
conversions in c-sharp in this session
we will learn implicit conversions
explicit conversions and the difference
between ours and tryparse methods let's
look at an example let's say I have a
variable of type integer which is
initialized to a value of 100 now I want
to convert this to float data type so
let's say I have a variable of type
float and I want to initialize this
variable with the value of this variable
so I will say float F equal to I and
then I want to print the value of this
float variable so now if I go ahead and
run that integer is initialized to 100
the value of integers and float and
float value is printed which is 100 so
the conversion happened without me
having to do any explicit conversion so
what are we doing here we are converting
an integer to a float data type from the
previous video sessions we know that
float is a much bigger data type than
integer so obviously when we convert
integer data type to float data type
there is going to be no loss of
information number one and number two
there isn't going to be any exception as
well because integer is much smaller
than float data time okay
so implicit conversion when does that
happen
implicit conversion is done by the
compiler for us automatically when there
is no loss of information if that
conversion is stopped so obviously when
we convert from integer to float there
is going to be no loss of information
and if there is no possibility of
throwing any exceptions during that
conversion
okay because float is a much bigger data
type than integer so there is no
possibility of overflow exception
happening so that's why the conversion
and for us implicitly without we having
to do it okay so let's think about this
the other way around let's say I have a
variable of type flute which is
initialized to one twenty three point
four five and since it is absolute
variable I have to you know suffix
letter F now I have another variable of
type integer I and I want to initialize
this the flute value so if I do this
look at the red squiggly line and that F
cannot implicitly convert type flute to
end because we know that flute is a much
larger data type than integer number one
so there is a possibility of overflow
exception if the number is much bigger
but in our example here the number is
123 point four five so integer can hold
one would be 123
in fact it in column much bigger number
so this isn't going to be an overflow
exception but there is going to be lost
information in what form
Sloat can have fraction bar but integers
cannot have fractional part so now if we
actually try and print this integer have
a look at what's going to happen it
doesn't give us any exception sorry but
we have to do that conversion here
because compiler will not do the
conversion for us and there are two ways
to do the conversion
that's the explicit conversion because
look at this integer cannot hold
fractional values so if the compiler was
to do this conversion what would have
happened you know we would have lost a
fractional part and if this is a
measurement of some you know engineering
calculation or a chemical formula or any
financial value it would have a great
impact on the business that's why the
compiler you know if there is going to
be any loss of information or if they're
going to be
exception it will not do the conversion
for us we have to do that explicitly
okay and how do we do it explicitly
there are basically two ways one is you
can use the typecast operator which is
an opening and a closing parenthesis and
the other videos making news Department
frameworks convert class so let's go
ahead and use the typecast operator so I
want to convert this variable to be of
type integer now if I go ahead and run
look at this the actual value of this
float variable is one two three point
four five but since we have converted
that to an integer we have lost that
fractional part so that's why you know
the C shop compiler didn't do this
conversion impulse it implicitly for us
because there is a lot of information
here so obviously so the general rule is
that if you're converting from a smaller
there type to a bigger type size the
conversion happens for us implicitly but
on the other hand if we try to convert a
bigger they divide to a smaller data
type because there is a possibility of
or exceptions we want and there is
possibility of you know loss of
information that's why the compiler will
not do the implicit conversions for us
and we have to do the conversions and
one way to do the explicit conversions
is to use the typecast operators as
shown here and the other way is to use
the convert class for example I can do
the same thing using the convert class
convert a dot to end now you will see
different versions of you know 2nk
methods here doing 16 32 64 and what are
these depending on the nor the size of
the integer datatype that you are using
you know in 16 1 in 32 4 in 64 in 64
obviously we have 64 bits there meaning
8 bytes that can hold a much bigger
number
keep it anyhow let's use two and
thirty-two and if I go ahead and run
this there's not going to be any
difference in the output except that
we're using the convert class so within
the convert class there are actually
several methods you know if you want to
convert to decimal you can do that if
you want to convert to date/time you can
do that
captain Gillian so from any data type to
any data type if you want to convert you
can make use of this convert class
that's another way that we have to do
the explicit conversions now what is the
difference between using typecast
operator and using the convert class if
I use the typecast operator and if this
float is going to hold a bigger number
than an integer obviously if you look at
this number this much bigger than an
integer variable can hold so if I run
this and if I try to convert this float
to an integer there will actually be an
exception because an integer variable
cannot hold this huge number but look at
what's going to happen so when I run
this oh actually I think it can hold
that number let's make this slightly
bigger yeah so now if you look at this
one we got a number saying minus 2 this
is the least the minimum number of an
integer okay the interesting thing note
to notice here is that the typecast
operator did not have an exception it
try to do that conversion from fruit to
interior would it fail and it's you know
it just it is just showing the minimum
number that it can hold so if we use the
typecast operator we don't get an
exception but on the other hand if we
try to do the same thing using the
convert class we get the exception so
when I use the convert class convert dot
two in 32 so I run this I get an
exception unhandled X
in system that although exception
obviously this value and I'm trying to
hold that in this variable of type
integer it cannot hold it it's much
bigger so obviously overflow exception
occurs okay so there are two ways to do
explicit expert explicit conversion one
is to use the typecast operator the
opening and closing currencies and the
other one is to use the convert class
difference between them is that we use
the typecast operator we don't get an
exception whereas with the convert class
we get exceptions if there is an
exception so we have seen the implicit
and explicit conversion
so this is an example of an implicit
conversion example which we have already
seen at an example for explicit
conversion as well and as I told you
there are two ways to do it using the
typecast operator and the convert class
reference typecast operator doesn't
throw an exception if there is a problem
converting that data type whereas
convert class test or an exception
and finally there is another way to
actually convert between data types for
example let's say the number that I have
is in a string format for example STR
number equals 100 so basically this is a
number we know that as humans but then
since that is you know enclosed within
double quotes it is treated as a string
by the C shaft compiler so because of
that if I try to do this in the I is
equal to STR number if I try to do this
the compiler will throw an error
straight saying that cannot implicitly
convert between types string and indeed
you okay
so obvious let me go to the explicit
conversion and and if the number is
actually is in a string format there is
a better way of doing this using the
parse method so we want to convert the
string data so end dot parse function
and you all
and look at the datatype it expects you
know a string to be passed in in our
case str number and it will convert that
string to an integer so obviously if we
look at the return type from the
intellisense the return type of the
parse method is integer and it will
store that in this variable so obviously
we try to print that console dot write
line I it prints that ok very good
a third way to convert from one data
type to another especially if that in
type business ring format okay now let's
say for example by mistake you know I
have some digits here some characters
from alphabets okay now is this a valid
number definitely not now if I go ahead
and try to run this application now when
the application runs it tries to convert
this number to an integer and obviously
it cannot do that and there will be a
format exception so the format of this
number cannot be converted to an integer
so we get an exception so let's run that
and format exception as expected okay
now how do we avoid this exceptions
there is a variation of parse method
which is nothing but a try parse method
okay
so let's say for example I want to
convert you know des to an integer I can
use instead of parse there is a try
parse method and if you get the
parameters for this method they are
slightly different you know it breaks a
string input which we want to convert to
integer data type in our case STR number
and then the other output is an output
parameter you know after this method
converts this to an India wait should it
store that value into the parameter that
we are going to pass right here okay so
first let's create a variable to hold
the result so
and let's say result and let's
initialize that to zero and now we pass
this variable as second parameter so now
what's going to happen okay
another important thing you have to use
the out keyword I'll tell you why in
just a bit okay so this tryparse method
is going to take the string convert it
to an integer and store it in this
variable and this is an output parameter
for this method now functions can have
different types of parameters value
parameters reference parameters or
parameters and parameter arrays which
we'll be talking about in a very great
detail in a later section so until then
don't worry about that but what's
happening here is the Strymon tryparse
method converts the string into an
integer and stores in this variable but
here look at this the string cannot be
converted to an integer so what will
happen to this this will remain zero and
another interesting thing to note is
that the written type of tryparse method
is actually boolean so what does that
mean
the tryparse method written true if the
conversion is successful otherwise it
will return false so there is a boolean
written data type that's coming back if
the conversion is successful it returns
true otherwise false so we can say bool
is conversion successful now if this
conversion is successful then this
method will return true so what we can
do is if conversion is successful then
we know that there will be an integer
number that we can print else we can say
control right line please
and valid number okay so if we go ahead
and run this what's going to happen
since this number cannot be converted
into an integer it Rosen I mean it
doesn't really exception but the
subscribers method religion Falls and
since this is false it gets to the else
bar and it will ask us to enter a valid
number on the other hand if we enter a
valid number something like line on line
eight seven and run this program again
it prints that valid number okay so
that's basically the difference between
parts and try price so let's go back to
the slides
so if the number is in a string format
you have two options basically to
convert that from string to any other
data type will be integer float double
whatever okay parse and try powers pass
me that there was an exception if it
cannot pass the value better straight
bars returns a boolean indicating but it
is succeeded up there to be successful
cause a fail but it doesn't throw an
exception so in general use parse if you
are sure that the value will be valid
and this node and there isn't going to
be any exception otherwise use try parts
in case you need up that's it for today
thank you for watching have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
