tutorial in this video well this is the
benefits of social logins and using
Google authentication with asp.net Web
API so here is what we want to do on our
login page we want to include this
button login with Google once we click
this button the application 3 directors
to Google sign-in page where we provide
our Google credentials and once we are
successfully authenticated by Google
it's going to redirect us back to our
application where we can see the
protected data in our case protected
data is employees data let's look at
this in action
notice on the login page we've got this
button login the Google once I click
this pattern notice we are redirected to
the Google sign-in page now let's login
with our Google credentials I'm going to
use this username Web API 33 at
gmail.com let's provide our Google
password once I click sign-in
notice I am successfully authenticated
by Google and at this point Google is
asking for my permission to allow the
application to view the data that Google
is holding about myself so I love the
application so at this point we are
redirected back to our application and
we are on data dot HTML and notice what
the message says here hello Web API 33
at gmail.com so this is the username
that I have used to authenticate myself
with Google and now when I click load
employees I can see the employees data
once we click the log off button we are
logged out and back on the login page
and if you look at these two tables a
spinet users and asp net user logins
notice in both of these tables we have
got an entry for our Google login look
at the email address this is the same
email address that we have used to
authenticate ourselves with Google and
look at the password hash column this is
null so we don't have to write any code
to manage usernames and passwords and
authenticate users all this is done by
external authentication provider in this
case the external authentication
provider is
Google so what are the benefits of using
social logins like Google Facebook
Twitter Microsoft etc for application
users registration is simple and easy
all they have to provide is their social
login username and password and the user
is automatically registered with our
application this also means one less
password for the user to remember when
users don't have to remember multiple
usernames and passwords to log into
multiple web sites there will be less
failed logins as you know remembering
multiple usernames and passwords it's
definitely a hassle from the development
point of view we do not have to write
code to manage usernames and passwords
all this is done by the external
authentication providers like Google
Facebook Twitter Microsoft etc to use
Google authentication first we have to
register our application with Google to
register our application with Google
let's navigate to this URL console
developers.google.com/live in with our
Google credentials once we have
successfully logged in we are going to
create a new project to create a new
project click on this drop-down right
here
and then select this option create
project I'm going to name our project
employee Web API service let's click
this create button this is going to take
a few seconds to complete the project
creation notice it is still busy
creating the project for us once the
project is successfully created click on
this tab right here credentials and then
click on this option or consent screen
and then provide a product name which
will be shown to the users so let's
specify the name as employee Web API
service and let's click the Save button
now click this button which says create
credentials what we want to do here
create Roth client ID so let's select
this option of our application type is
web application so I'm going to select
this radio button and I'm going to leave
this default name web client 1 and then
we need to specify the authorized
JavaScript origin the application is
running at this URI localhost colon 3 4
8 3 8 so basically the authorized origin
is nothing but the origin where your
application is running
so let's specify the URI right here and
then we also need to specify the
authorized redirect URI and the redirect
URI is going to be localhost colon 3 4 8
3 8 4 / sign in - Google so this is the
URI to which the user will be redirected
after he is successfully authenticated
by Google and notice here we get client
ID and client secret we need both of
these to enable Google authentication
for our asp.net Web API service in just
a bit we'll see how we are going to use
both of these let's click OK now there
is one more last thing that we need to
do here we need to enable Google+ API
service to enable that click on library'
and under social api is click on this
which says Google+ API and then we'll
have to enable that service so just
click the enable button which is going
to enable the Google+ API service for us
so these are all the steps to register
our application with Google now let's
see what we need to do from the web api
service ID to use Google authentication
first we need to enable Google
authentication to enable Google
authentication open this file start up
dot auth dot CS and scroll all the way
down notice the code block that enables
Google authentication is commented so
let's uncomment this and we need to
specify client ID and client secret we
got both of these after we have
registered our applique
with Google so let's go to Google
console and then click on this
credentials tab and then click this edit
icon notice here we have client ID so
let's copy that and paste it right here
similarly let's copy the client secret
and paste it right here
next we want log in with Google button
on our login page so let's open login
dot HTML page and just after this
existing user login table we want this
social login table so to speed things up
I'm going to copy this HTML paste it
right here and then change the bits that
are required so the text is going to say
social logins we don't need any button
or anchor elements so let's remove them
from there we don't need this call span
here so let's get rid of that as well
and here we just need one TR we don't
need all these TR so let's delete all of
them and within this TR let's include a
TD and then we need a button for Google
login so let's include an input element
of type button let's give it an ID let's
call this BTN Google login the value on
the button is login the Google and let's
use the boot share button classes BTN
and bTW and success let's save our
changes and reload our login page notice
now we see log in with Google button
let's know wireup click event handler
for our login with Google button the ID
is BTN Google login so let's use the ID
find the button and then wire up the
click event handler so what is supposed
to happen
when we click this log
with Google button we want the user to
be redirected to Google sign-in page so
window dot location dot href equals some
redirection URI so where are we going to
get that URL from to get that URL we are
going to issue a cat request to this URL
right here localhost colon port number
three four eight three eight four slash
API four slash account four slash
external logins and then we have got
couple of query string parameters
I'll have this URL available in the
description of this video so issue a get
request to this URL which is going to
give us another URL and we will specify
that as the value right here before we
issue a get request let's give our
solution a pearl bail succeeded now
let's go ahead and issue a get request
to this URL right here so once we issue
a get request to this URL look at what
we are getting back we are getting
another URL right here so this is the
URL that we want to redirect the user to
when we click that log in with Google
button so I am going to copy that URL
and then specify that right here now if
you notice the URL right here we have
got a query string parameter which says
redirect underscore URI so basically
this parameter specifies the URL that we
want to redirect the user to after he is
successfully authenticated by Google so
this URL is encoded here that's the
reason why we can't read it easily but I
am going to copy it until here so these
last five numbers here three four eight
three eight that is the port number at
which our application is running so I'm
going to copy the redirect URI which is
URL encoded and I'm going to decode that
now to decode the URL simply type in
Google URL encode decode and we have a
website here URL - and go - decode so
let's paste the encoded URL right here
and let's decode that so this is our
redirection URI HTTP colon four slash
four slash localhost colon three four
eight three eight now in our case what
we want to do is we actually want the
user to be redirected to our login dot
HTML page after he is successfully
authenticated by Google so I'm going to
specify this as the redirection URL so
let's copy that paste it right here and
then let's encode the URL so the encoded
URL let's take it and then I am going to
specify it as the value right here so
instead of redirecting it to the you
know root application root I am actually
going to redirect after the user is
authenticated by Google to login dot
HTML page all right so let's save our
changes and we also need to do one more
change in application o or provider file
you can find this file and providers
folder so let's open the file and we
have to make a change in validate client
redirect URI method so again here the
redirection URI is specified as the root
of our application instead of that I am
actually going to redirect the user back
onto our application login dot HTML page
let's give our solution a build reload
the login page and let's log out of the
Google account and now let's click log
in with Google button we expected it to
redirect us to Google sign-in page but
we are getting invalid request error
this is because if you look at this
redirect URI query string parameter the
value for this is this notice after
login dot HTML we have these encoded
characters percentage to F these encoded
characters stand for a forward slash so
let's copy the redirect URI value let's
go to URL and code decode tool let's
click this start over link and let's
paste our end coded URL right here and
let's click this decode URL
notice at the end we have got a forward
slash but if you look at this file right
here application or what provider
validate client redirect URI notice in
the redirection URL right here at the
end we don't have a forward slash so
there are two ways to fix this error one
way is to include a four slash here the
other way is to remove the four slash
from here so to remove the four slash
let's remove the encoded characters
let's save our changes reload our login
page and now let's click login with
Google button notice now we are
redirected to the Google sign-in page so
let's provide our Google credentials now
let's sign in now Google is asking for
permission to allow the application to
view our email address and basic profile
info let's click this a log button so we
are giving of a permission and now we
are redirected back to login dot HTML
page and look at the URL to the URL we
have the access token appended so we
need to retrieve this X token from the
URL and need to do a few things first
let's write a JavaScript function that's
going to retrieve the access token from
the URL we are going to keep all over
Google authentication related JavaScript
functions in a separate file so let's
right click on the scripts folder and
let's add a new JavaScript file let's
name this Google authentication
and we are going to make use of jQuery
so let's drag and drop jQuery and let's
roll it to our function let's call this
function get access token so to retrieve
the access token from the URL let's use
location dot hash so basically this is
going to check if the URL has got a hash
in it notice within our URL after hash
we have got the access token so location
dot hash is going to written as the hash
and whatever we have after the hash okay
so if location dot hash is true the
meaning if there is a hash in the URL
and if location dot hash dot split and
we are going to split using this string
access to kin equals so we want to split
it using that so again if this is true
thee meaning if the hash fragment has
got this access token equals then we
want to split it so if it is true thee
then what do we want to do let's
actually split it so let's create a
variable let's call it access token
equals location dot hash dot split
access token equals so what is the split
function going to do it's going to
return as a string array with two
strings in it the string at index
position zero is going to contain access
token equals and the string at index
position one will contain the access
token value and in the URL in addition
to access token we also have few other
query string parameters notice here we
have token type expires N and we also
have state now we don't need all those
query string parameters so we want only
the access token value so we want to
further split the string that we have at
index position one so take the string at
an x position one
and then call again the split function
and this time we want to split it using
the ampersand character so the access
token value ends here and then we have
an ampersand there so we want to split
it at that point
so let's split it using ampersand and
let's take the index string at index
position zero so this is going to give
us the access to again so now we are
going to do another check if access
token is true D if we have a value in
this access token variable then what we
want to do is call another function is
user registered we don't have this
JavaScript function yet we'll create
that in just a bit
so basically this function is going to
check whether if the user you-know-who
is authenticated by Google is already
registered with our application so to
check if a user is already registered
with our application let's issue a get
request to another URL using fiddler
we have fiddler fired up here to check
if the authenticated user is registered
with our application we are going to
issue a get request to slash API slash
account slash user info we also need to
send the access token to the server
using authorization header since the
access token is a bearer token we also
have to use this word bearer and then
the access token value we've got the
access token in the URL so let's copy it
from the URL so the access token value
starts right here and within the URL we
have other query string parameters as
well token type expires in etc we don't
need all those query string parameters
we just need the access token value
which ends right here so let's copy it
and paste it right here let's execute
this request notice the request
completed successfully and look at the
response we got we got a JSON object and
look at this property has registered
this is set to false so basically the
user who is authenticated by Google
is not yet registered with our
application so the function that we are
going to know right now is going to
issue a get request to this URI and
check if the user is registered with our
application if the user is already
registered with our application then
it's going to store the access token and
user name in browser local storage and
then redirect the user to protected
areas within our application in our case
he will be redirected to data dot HTML
in case if he is not registered this
function is going to call another
function which we are yet to implement
and that function will have the code to
register the external user
so first let's implement is user
registered function which is going to
check if the user is registered with our
application we are back in Google
authentication dot J's file let's
implement these user registered function
to this function we are also passing the
access token so the first thing that we
want to do here is issue an ajax call
let's specify the ajax options the first
thing we want to specify is the URL the
URL to which we want to issue a request
is right here / api / account / user
info and that URL we want to issue a get
request so method is get and we also
need to specify headers first let's
specify content type header content type
is application for / jason and let's
also specify authorization header the
value for this is this word vader
followed by a single space and then to
that we will append the access token
which is coming into this function as a
parameter and when the request completes
successfully we want to handle the
response that comes back from the server
using this success function so let's
pass the response to the function and
the first thing that we want to do here
is check has registered property
notice once we issue a get request to
this URL and the response that we get we
got this has registered property which
tells us if the authenticated user is
registered with our application or not
if the user is registered with our
application then we want to store the
access token and username in local
storage and then redirect the user to
data dot HTML page so local storage dot
set item let's use the key as access
token so this is the same key that we
are using on the login page and we are
getting the access token from the
parameter similarly within the local
storage let's - username as well let's
use the key as the username and where
are we going to get the username from we
get the username from the response
object using the email property so let's
use the response object email property
and then finally we want to redirect the
user to data dot HTML page so window dot
location dot H ref equals data dot HTML
so if the user is successfully I mean if
the user is registered with our
application this is what we want to do
if the user is not registered with our
application then we want to register the
user so to register the user we are
going to call another JavaScript
function let's call it signup external
user and this lets pass the access token
we'll implement the signup external use
a function in just a bit first let's
look at the URL that we need to issue a
request to to register the external user
here is the URL slash API slash account
slash register external to this URL we
need to issue a post request first let's
make a copy of this function is user
registered and then change the bits that
are required first of all the name of
the function is signup external
user to which we are passing the access
token and then we want to issue a
request to this URL so let's copy that
and specify it right here and to this
URL we want to issue a post request
instead of a get request the headers are
going to be the same and when the
request completes successfully that is
when the user is registered successfully
with our application we want to redirect
him to Google sign-in page that is the
same page to which we redirect the user
when we click login with Google button
that is present on all login dot HTML
page so I am going to copy this line of
code right here and then paste it right
here so what is this signup externally
use a function doing this registers the
user with our application and then
redirects him to Google sign-in page we
also need to make a change in register
external function this function is
present in account controller so let's
go to account controller and here is the
register external function so stuff all
we don't need this parameter register
external binding model parameter and so
let's get rid of that we don't need this
F block as well so let's get rid of that
as well and to get the email property
value we are going to make use of this
info object instead of the model object
we have already deleted the model object
so it's no longer available but to get
the email property value let's use the
info object which also has the same
email property and let's go to login
page and let's reference this Google
authentication dot JS file on our login
dot HTML page this script file is
present in scripts folder so let's drag
and drop this just after the jQuery
script file here and then within our
ready function let's call get access
token function now let's look at the
flow let's see what happens you know
when we login with our Google
credentials so on login dot HTML page we
have this log in with Google button
we click the button we send the user to
Google sign-in page so the user logs in
with his Google credentials once that is
successful Google will redirect the user
back to login dot HTML page that is the
same page with access token appended to
the URL and on this page we are calling
get access token function and what is
this function doing it retrieves the
access token from the URL and then calls
is use a registered function passing it
the access token and what is the C's use
a registered function doing it checks if
that external user is registered locally
with our application if he is already
registered with our application then
it's going to store access token and
user name in the browser local storage
and redirect him to the data page where
he can see employee's data in our case
the external user is not yet registered
with our application so in this case
it's going to call sign of external user
function passing it again the access
token and what is the sign of external
user function doing it registers that
external user with our application by
issuing a post request to this URL and
once the user is successfully registered
it redirects us back to the Google
sign-in page and this time again the
access token method will be called get
access token it retrieves the access
token from the URL and then this time
since the user is already registered
with our application that's going to
store the access token username and
browser local storage and then redirects
the user to data dot HTML page where he
can see employee's data so with all
these changes let's give our application
a build build succeeded now let's go
back to login dot HTML page we are
already logged in with this email
address Web API 33 at gmail.com and
notice to the URL the access token is
appended so at this point when we look
at these two tables a spinet users a
spinet user logins we don't have web api
33 registered with our
location yet so these two tables are
empty so when we click login with Google
button look at what's going to happen we
are redirected to data dot HTML and look
at the message hello Web API 33 at
gmail.com and then I click load
employees we can see the employees data
and at this point if we look at these
two tables notice there is an entry for
web api 33 at gmail.com in both of these
tables so this external user is now
registered with our application now
let's log out of gmail and let's also
log out of our application and at this
point when we click login with Google
it's going to redirect us to Google
sign-in page let's login with another
email could wait it let's provide the
password and sign in notice it's asking
to allow the application to view all our
email address and basic profile
information let's allow it and now we
are redirected back to data dot HTML it
identifies that I am logged in with good
Wengert at gmail.com and we can see the
employees data as well so at this point
if we look at these two tables we have
an entry for could when cut at gmail.com
we are back on the slides let's quickly
recap the steps to use Google
authentication first we have to register
our application with Google to register
the application with Google go to
console developers.google.com step two
in startup dot dot dot CS file that you
can find in app and it's called start
folder uncomment this block of code
include client ID and client secret that
you have got after registering your
application with Google this block of
code enables Google authentication for
asp.net Web API service step 3 in login
dot HTML page include this HTML table
which displays login with Google button
step 4 wire up click event handler for
login with Google button when we click
login with Google button we are
redirecting the user
to Google silent page to get this
redirection URL issue a get request to
this URL right here step file modify
validate client redirect URI method to
redirect the user to login dot HTML page
after the user is authenticated by
Google you can find this method in
application / provider dot C as file in
the providers folder notice here we have
changed the redirection URL to four
slash login dot HTML instead of just the
forward slash step 6 add a JavaScript
file to the scripts folder name it
Google authentication dot J's
and include these three JavaScript
functions get access token which
retrieves the access token from the URL
these user registered this function
checks if the user authenticated by
Google is already registered locally
with our application sign of external
user this function registers the
external user with our application and
here we have got get access token
function here is user registered
function and finally sign up external
user function step seven in account
controller dot CS modify register
external method to remove the parameter
register external binding model
parameter and we also removed the if
model state dot is valid code block from
there and then we are using info object
instead of the model object to retrieve
the external user email and finally on
login dot HTML page reference Google
authentication dot JS file and call get
access token function so those are all
the steps required to use Google
authentication with asp.net Web API
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
