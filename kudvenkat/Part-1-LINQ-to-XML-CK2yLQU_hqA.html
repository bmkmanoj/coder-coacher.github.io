tutorial in this video well disk is how
easy it is to create an XML document
using link to XML first let us
understand what we mean by this term
functional construction functional
construction is the ability to create an
XML tree in a single statement so let's
see how to create this entire XML tree
in a single statement using link to XML
but before we do that let's look at the
classes that we will be using to
construct this entire XML tree to create
the XML document itself we will use a
class called X document and within the
XML document you know this first line is
called as the XML declaration so to
create this XML declaration we use X
declaration class and here we've got an
XML comment to create an XML comment we
use X comment class and here we have got
students root element and the root
element has got student child elements
so to create a root element or the child
elements we use this X element class and
then notice this student element has
caught an ID attribute so to create an
XML attribute we use X attribute class
so all these classes are present in this
namespace system dot XML dot length so
let's see how to create this entire XML
tree in a single statement let's flip to
visual studio so here I have a new
console application first let's bring in
that system dot XML dot linked namespace
and now we want to create an XML
document so ie I'm going to make use of
X document class let's call this XML
document equals new XML document and if
you look at this class there are four
overloaded versions but we are going to
use this overloaded version which has
caught this params parameter so we can
pass as many arguments as we want so the
first thing that we want within the XML
document is the XML declaration and to
create that we use X a declaration class
and then notice this XML declaration has
got the version and coding and whether
its term alone or not okay so let's
create a new
X declaration object and we are going to
make use of this overloaded version so
the version of the XML is 1.0 and the
end coding is UDF - 8 and it's a
standalone one so that will create this
XML declaration okay
after that we want this comment creating
an XML tree using linked to XML and to
create the XML comment we use X comment
class so we are now going to create an
instance of X comment class and then we
specify whatever comment we want there
so what is the comment creating an XML
tree using link to XML so let's copy and
paste that there so after the comment
what we want we want this route students
element so we are going to make use of X
element class ok and what is the name of
the element it's going to be students so
students and that root element should
have you know this child element student
so we are going to now create another X
element instance notice that we are not
closing the constructor of this class
okay so the X element that we are going
to create now is going to be child of
the students root element okay so new X
element now the name of the element is
going to be student and if you notice
the student element has also got ID
attribute so we are not going to close
that instead we are going to create an
instance of X attribute and then what is
the attribute name we want we want ID is
the name of the attribute
so I'd a and what is the value ID 1 0 1
so 1 0 1 so that should create the
student element with
you know ID attribute and that value so
once we have the student element within
student element we have got three more
elements name gender and total marks so
we are not going to close this
constructor yet so we are going to put a
comma there and then create another new
x element and the name of it is going to
be name and what is the value that we
want mark so mark and we want gender
total marks okay those two elements as
well so I'm just going to make a copy of
that one
so here it's going to be gender and this
one is going to be total marks okay
gender is going to be male total marks
is 800 okay
so now this should create the first
student element now we want the second
student element so what I'm going to do
is put a comma there and then take this
and make a copy of it okay that is going
to be our second student so for second
student the ID is going to be 1 0 2
let's look at name gender and total
marks name is Rosie gender female and
900 so name is Rosie female and 912
marks okay similarly we can create the
other two student elements as well
so let's make a copy of this one
and let's make another copy okay so the
ID is going to be one zero three here
the ID is going to be one zero four so
for the third student name is Pam female
850 so here our name is going to be Pam
female and the marks are 850 and the
fourth student is John male 950 so John
male and the marks are 950 so now we
have all the four student elements now
we need to close this root element
constructor and the XML document
constructor so we need two more closing
brackets and that's going to end with a
semicolon so now we have the XML
document okay so notice this entire
statement is a single statement okay
now let's actually save this XML data to
an XML file let's actually save it to
this folder itself the project folder so
let's open the project folder in Windows
Explorer so that's the complete part
where we want to save the file
so this XML document object has got save
method so XML document dot save and to
this we specify the name of the file so
then the path is going to be that and
then within that let's call the file
data dot XML and since it's we are using
a backslash here there is no escape
sequence called backslash d so that's
why it's giving that compilation error
so use a verbatim literal or you can use
double backslash whatever you prefer but
I prefer using where bottom literal
because this makes your code more
readable okay so now let's go ahead and
run this so we don't get any output but
it should have created that XML document
and to see the XML document click on
this icon show all files so notice that
we have the XML document now when we
double click that look at this it has
created an XML document that looks like
this we've got the XML declaration XML
government students is the root element
and within that we have got for student
you know elements and each student
element has got name gender and total
marks as the child elements that's it
for today thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
