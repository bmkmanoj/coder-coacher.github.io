tutorial in this video well discuss HTTP
put post and delete verbs this is
continuation to part two so please watch
part two before proceeding when we talk
about a database table row these are the
four actions that we can perform on the
row create read update or delete a row
in the context of an asp.net web api
resource these four actions correspond
to get post put and delete as shown in
the table right here let's now
understand some terms and concepts
related to HTTP request and response
system request verbs these HTTP verbs
get post put and delete describe what
should be done with the resource for
example do you want to create read
update or delete an entity get put post
and delete HTTP verbs are the most
commonly used ones for the complete list
of the HTTP verbs please visit this URL
right here request header when a client
sends a request to the server the
request contains a header and a body the
request header contains additional
information such as what type of
response is required for example do you
want the response from the server to be
in XML JSON or some other format request
body request body contains the data you
want to send to the server for example a
post request contains the data for the
new item that you want to create the
data format may be in XML or JSON
response body the response body contains
the data sent as a response from the
server for example if the request is for
a specific product the response body
includes product details either in XML
or JSON format response status codes
these are the HTTP status codes that
give the client details on the status of
the request some of the common status
quotes are 204 okay for 0 for not found
2:04 no content for the complete list of
HTTP status codes and what they mean
please visit this URL right here now
we'll use a tool called fiddler to
perform post put and delete actions you
can download fiddler from this URL right
here I've already downloaded and
installed it now let's modify the values
controller that we worked with in our
previous video so that it can support
post put and delete actions
let's now flip to visual studio this is
the same example that we worked with in
our previous video within our values
controller class at the class level
let's include a static variable the type
is going to be list of string let's name
it
strings this list is going to contain
three strings so it's going to contain
value one value two in addition to these
two strings let's include another string
and the value in this string is going to
be value zero and what we want this get
method to do is return the list so let's
simply return our static variable
strings we have another overloaded
version of get method which has an ID
parameter we want to use this ID as an
index for example if we pass zero as the
value for ID then we want to return the
string that is present at index position
zero within our static variable which is
value zero if we pass one then return
value 1
if we pass two return value two so from
this overloaded version of the get
method
let's return strings of ID post method
we use this method to create a new item
notice this method has this value
parameter which is of type string
so whatever string that we are passing
to this method we want to add it to our
static variable so let's call the add
method and pass the value to that put
method we use this to update an item
notice this method has got two
parameters the ID of the item that we
want to update
the new value with which we want to
update it with okay so we are going to
use the ID as the index and we want to
update the item at that index position
with this new value that is also coming
in as a parameter we use the delete
method to remove an item so let's use
this ID to remove an item at the
specified index position so strings dot
remove add and we pass the ID to that
function which is going to remove the
string at that index position all right
so let's give our solution a build so
the build has started as you can see in
the status bar it's going to take a few
seconds to complete the build has
completed now let's reissue the request
since we have rebuild the solution it's
going to take a few seconds to reload
notice we have got three strings as
expected
let's now launch fiddler and perform
post put and delete actions I'm going to
click on start all labs scroll down a
bit and then select fiddler this should
launch fiddler and I'm going to delete
this traffic which is already captured
let's now issue the get request once
again this request should have been
captured by fiddler they we have it I'm
going to double click on this notice the
response that we are getting back is XML
notice we have values from 0 till 2 now
what I'm going to do is click on the
composer tab drag and drop the request
on to the composer tab so the requests
that we have issued is get this is the
URI to which we have issued that request
now we want to issue a post request and
create a new item so I'm going to click
on this drop down notice in addition to
get post put and delete we have several
other HTTP verbs as well let's select
post and the post we also have to
specify a request body and I'm going to
specify the request body in JSON format
so the new item that we want to add to
our stead
variable is new string and when we send
something to the server we have to
specify the content type so I'm going to
specify that in the header so we use
content type for that and the content
type is going to be Jason so application
for slash Jason and then I'm going to
click execute notice the request
completed let's double click on that
look at the status code that we are
getting back to zero for no content it's
just a post request we have added a new
item to the collection there's nothing
to return that's the reason why we get
to 0 for no content now let's verify
whether if the item has been added to a
static variable and to do that I'm going
to go to the composer tab once again and
then issue a get request with the get
request we don't specify a request for T
that's the reason why it has become red
so I'm going to delete that and then
execute this once again that it goes to
executed completed successfully now
first of all notice you know we have
over four strings value 0 1 2 and our
new string and if you look at the
response header look at that the HTTP
status code that we got is 200 ok and
what we are getting back here at the
moment is XML now if you want the
response to be in Jason then you specify
that within your request header so let's
go to the composer tab and in our get
request so here look at that at the
moment we accept any of these text slash
HTML application slash XHTML or XML now
we have XML available you know from the
Web API so that's what we are getting
but if you want Jason you can specify
that using this accept header here
so I'm going to delete all this and then
specify application for slash Jason and
then let's eat reissue the request
so request completed successfully let's
double click on that notice now what
you're getting back is a JSON object
we've got value 1 0 1 2 and our new
string now we've seen how to perform a
post now let's see how to perform our in
output action so I'm going to go back to
the composer tab and then select port
instead of post and let's say we want to
update that new string to updated string
so we want Jason back and we are going
to send Jason to the server so let's
specify content type and we want the new
string it to be updated string and then
and we want to update the last string
and the index position for that is 3 so
now let's go ahead and execute our
request so here is our request again
look at that since it's an update we get
HTTP status code to 0 for no content
let's go ahead and change this to a get
request and let's get request we don't
have the body so let's go ahead and
delete that and let's issue a get
request to values URI execute that and
here's the request completed
successfully and notice that the value
is updated to updated string now finally
let's issue a delete request let's go
back to the composer change this to
delete and we want to delete our last
item which is pleasant at index position
3 and let's issue the request so it's
completed again we get to 0 for no
content let's go back to the composer
tab and change this to get and execute
for some reason we get a 4 C 500 error
500 is internal server error that's
basically because if you look at our
composer look at the get request that we
have issued if we should a get request
to an item that is present at index
three we don't have an item at index
position three that's the reason why
we've got that error so let's get rid of
that ID there and then when we execute
this that a class should complete
successfully so the header 200 okay and
if we look at the raw data what we are
getting back is Jason because that's
what we have asked for we want the
response format to be in Jason now when
we use this index position three we got
an exception 500 internal server error
we'll discuss how to deal with these
exceptions in a later video now if you
look at these three methods post put and
delete for all these three methods the
return type is void and that's the
reason why we get the HTTP status code
as to zero for no content we have
complete control on what status codes we
want to return from these methods with
asp.net web api will discuss how to do
that in a later video thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
