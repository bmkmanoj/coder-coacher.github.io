am venket this is part 52 of sequel
server in this session we'll understand
what database normalization is all about
list the different normal forms that are
available and we'll also learn how to
put a table in the first normal form so
what is database normalization database
normalization is a step by step process
of organizing data to minimize data
redundancy which in turn ensures data
consistency so what do we mean by data
redundancy duplicated data data
duplication is nothing but data
redundancy okay let us see with an
example how data redundancy can actually
lead to data inconsistency now we have a
table here which has got employee name
gender and salary and along with that we
also have the department information in
the same table now if you look at the
department information we have
department name department head and
department location now if you look at
the IT department there are three
employees within the IT department Sam
Simon and Todd and look at this for
these three employees all the three
columns department name department head
and department location you know all
these three columns are repeated okay
now let's assume in the IT department
there are 5000 employees obviously we
all have to repeat department head and
department location columns along with
the department name so what is the
disadvantage you know the obvious
disadvantage is that disk space wastage
okay so if there are 50,000 employees in
IT department I'm going to repeat
department name department head
department location you know 50,000
times obviously there's a lot of wasted
disk space which is directly
proportional to the number of rows in
the table as you increase the number of
rows the disk space also increases okay
so the second problem is data can become
inconsistent
okay let's understand how data can
become insist inconsistent now let's say
at the moment department head for I mean
IT department head is John now let's say
John has resigned and we have a new IT
deep I
and head Steve okay so we need to update
the department head so now if you have
to change the department head name for
IT department and let's assume there are
50,000 employees in IT department you
will have to update all the 50,000 rows
just imagine what would happen if you
forget to update a few rows obviously if
you do that the data is going to become
inconsistent okay so for some of the
rows you know in some of the rows the
department head will be John and in some
of the rows the department head will be
Steve so we will not actually know who
is the actual department head so your
data is strong it's inconsistent so and
why did we land in this problem because
of the duplicated data so data
redundancy can actually lead to
inconsistent data so if you reduce data
redundancy your data is going to be
consistent and obviously another problem
is DML queries can be slow what are the
examples of DML queries insert update
delete now let's say I want to update
you know department head name from John
to steam and let's assume there are 1
million employees in IT department
obviously we will have to update 1
million records
obviously that update statement is going
to take time ok so these are the
problems of data redundancy disk space
wastage data inconsistency and your DML
queries can become slow ok so obviously
to solve this we will normalize the
tables now this table is normalized here
if you look at this we actually have
broken down the table into 2 so we have
Dept table here department ID department
name department head department location
columns ok and then we also have given a
primary key to uniquely identify each
department in this departments table and
then what we are doing in the employees
table we are only having employee named
genders
and then the department ID to which they
belong so obviously we have broken this
table down into two and then whatever
are the repeating columns we have moved
that to a separate table okay so now we
don't have to repeat department name
department head and Department location
in the employees table all you do here
is you know refer the department ID okay
so even if there are fifty million
employees in the IT department you ever
are going to have one row for IT
department in TBL department table so if
you want to change the department head
from John to steam you only have one row
to update no matter how many employees
are there in that department okay so
obviously here the data will be
consistent so when you join this
employee table with table Department you
know we are going to get consistent
department names I mean or department
head names for a specific department
okay so this way you know normalized
table design can reduce data redundancy
which in turn can actually save space so
we are saving a lot of space here and
your DML queries can also become faster
because just imagine updating 50 million
rows and updating just one row in TBL
department table how fast the DML query
can be basically database normalization
is a step by step process there are this
is just an example that we have seen
until now
okay so database normalization is
basically a step by step process there
are six normal forms first normal from
through sixth normal form 1 and F 2 and
F through 6 and F most database in the
real world are in third normal form and
there are certain rules that each normal
form has to follow which we'll be
talking about in the next video series
today we will also discuss about first
normal form so what are the rules that a
table should follow if it has to be in
the
first normal form okay first of all the
data in each column should be atomic no
multiple values separated by commas what
do we mean by this let's look at an
example so here if you look at the table
here I have the department name and
employees within that department if you
look at this the employee column here is
not atomic why because you are storing
multiple employees in the same column
separated by commas so these values are
not atomic so the data in the employee
column is not atomic in the department
name its atomic but in the employee name
it's not at atomic there are multiple
values separated by commas now what are
the problems of non-atomic columns
obviously if you want to select insert
or update or delete just one employee
it's not possible for example let's say
I want to remove Mike you can't you have
to update this entire you know cell ok
so you can't just remove Mike from there
okay you have to update the entire cell
so that's the problem with non-atomic
columns ok so obviously if we don't want
to have this another design that we can
think of is something that you have you
can see here now if we want to have
atomic values I know that in a
department there are three employees so
let me create three employee columns in
the same table so department name stays
Aziz
but then for each employee I am creating
a separate column so employee one
employee to employee 3 column ok so that
I can store
Sam Mike Shawn in their own cell in
their own column so now in this table
each column is atomic but then because
of this design you have introduced
another problem you know repeating
column groups so if you look at this
employee column it's actually repeating
itself employee one employee to employee
3 so a table should not contain repeat
in column groups why there are several
problems associated with repeating
column groups so what are those problems
now if you look at the design
the maximum number of employees that can
be present in the department is three
let's say there is a new employee
joining in the IT department where will
you store him
you have to alter the table structure
and altering a table structure is not a
good practice because there could be
applications referring to that table
already and you may have to modify those
applications as well okay so obviously
you have to change the table structure
here if there is going to be a fourth
employee in any department on the other
hand look at this HR HR department has
got only one employee
so obviously employee to an employee
three columns will be null so what's the
problem
waste disk space okay so with repeating
column groups you know you either have
to change the structure of the table if
there are more employees going to be in
that department or if there are fewer
employees than the columns that we have
we are going to waste the disk space
okay so so how do we put this table in a
first normal form obviously to do that
we are breaking this table into two okay
department table here that you can see
what we have done basically is we have
in the department table we got
department ID we have given it a primary
key to uniquely identify each department
within that table so department IT
department id-1 id2 HR and then the
repeating employees we have put them in
another table with you know department
ID as a foreign key so in the IT
department there are three employees Sam
Mike Shawn so whatever we are doing here
we are having one employee column and
one department ID column so Sam Mike
Shawn their department ID is one so we
know that these three people belong to
IT department and then department ID two
is HR Pam is in the HR department okay
even if a specific department is going
to get 100 employees we don't have a
problem now we will simply have you know
more rows with that department ID
okay so now this structure is in first
normal form why the data in each column
is atomic if we look at the data in each
column it's atomic no multiple values
separated by commas and the table does
not contain any repeating column groups
there is no column you know there is no
column like department name one
department name two similarly this one
employee one employee to employee three
etc the column groups are not repeating
themselves and in this departments table
we are able to uniquely identify the
record using the primary key and then to
find out which employee belongs to which
department they are actually using
department ID as the foreign key in this
table so all the rules are satisfied so
this design is said to be in the first
normal form in the next video session we
will talk about how to put you know a
table in the second normal form on this
