venket this is part 79 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll discuss
about tracing in asp.net tracing enables
us to view diagnostic information about
a request which is very useful when
debugging application related problems
in this session we're going to
concentrate on the basics of tracing and
in a later video session will discuss
about where trace and can actually be
used in fact we'll discuss about an
example where we will solve the root
cause of a performance related issue
very easily by using tracing tracing can
be turned on or off either at the
application level or at the page level
to enable tracing at the application
level all we have to do is set the trace
elements enabled attribute to true let's
flip to visual studio I have an asp.net
web application project here on this web
form one dot aspx I have got a grid view
control and then this waveform 1 loads
up we are creating an instance of the
data set object and we are invoking the
read XML method which reads the contents
of the country's dot XML file into the
data set which in turn is used as the
data source for the grid view control
and finally we are invoking the data
bind method so we have this country's
dot XML file within the project when I
when I run this platform as you might
expect the data will be loaded into this
waveform into this grid view control now
I want to enable tracing for this web
application and if I want to enable
tracing at the application level within
web dot config file I can set the trace
elements and enable the attribute to
true so trace enabled is equal to true
that's it now let me go ahead and run
this now so the perform data is loaded
but then on the page I don't see any
trace information so where is this trace
information logged when we enable
tracing in web config file for the
entire application the trace information
is actually logged in a trace file
called trace dot ax stay so let me copy
this URL open another tab in the browser
paste the URL there and instead of web
form 1 dot aspx I'm going
type in trace dot ax de and press ENTER
look at that I get this trace viewer
file and here look at this it's webform
1 and we made a get request it's not a
postback request so if you look at the
verb it's get request and the HTTP
status code is 200 which means okay and
the file is wave form 1 dot aspx and the
time of your request ok and if you want
to see the complete details of this
trace you can click on view details and
there's very useful information here
which can be used for debugging purposes
in a later video session we will see how
this information can be used to solve
the root cause of a performance related
issue so for example look at this we
have request details
what's the session ID what is the time
of the request what is the encoding for
the request and response encoding and
what is the HTTP status code 200 in this
case which means ok and the request type
is a get and not a postback request and
another interesting thing here is you
can see all the page level events and
the time they take to complete ok and
then further down we have the control
tree the entire control tree on the
webform ok and then further down we have
information about session state
application state any cookies that we
have you know that's a session cookie
and any cookies in a persistent cookies
that we may have written HTTP header
information form variables collection
query strings and HTTP server variables
ok so a lot of useful information on
this you know trace page alright so at
the moment we have enabled tracing for
all the pages within our web application
now let's say I want to disable tracing
for a specific page for example within
this web application project
I have test dot aspx page now let's go
ahead and request test dot aspx instead
of web form 1 so I'm going to say test
dot aspx now if I come here and refresh
my trace viewer file look at that I also
get the test page ok but let's say I
want to disable tracing for test page
how do I do that in spite of having it
enabled at the application level all you
have to do is
one on the page set the trace elements
to false that's said okay now let's go
ahead and request this page once again I
press f5 here okay I got that and let me
refresh this now look at that you know
the trace information for test page is
not logged and let me access webform one
just to make sure it's still being
logged so I have their form one dot aspx
now I come here plus a file look at that
where form 1 you know it's traced but if
I go back to test dot aspx and i refresh
this you know it's not traced anymore
okay so to disable tracing for a
specific page set trace is equal to
false in the web forms page directive
and that's what we have just done and if
tracing is enabled at the application
level the trace messages are returned to
a file called traced or a XD trace dot a
XD file can only be access to local a so
if you look at this now my web server
and my web server is on this machine and
I am accessing the trace view of file
locally on that web server now if I try
to access the stress viewer file from a
remote machine you know I will not be
able to do that ok but then is there a
possibility to access the stress viewer
file from a remote machine absolutely
for that you have to set the local only
attribute to false by default this
attribute will be true if you don't set
that it will be true because trace file
has got very useful information that
could be I mean security sensitive
information that could be useful to a
hacker to hack into the server so set
this attribute to false only when it is
required by default it is true which
means the strace file is only available
when accessed on that web server locally
if you access that from a remote machine
it's not available but however we can
make it available by setting this local
only attribute of the trace element to
false let's see how to do that
so within web config file all I have to
do is set local only attribute to false
this will be true by default you're
selling not only make this available
locally but also remotely that's what
this attribute means when you with set
it to false to up and trace messages now
if you look at this the trace messages
are actually returned to this trace file
now let's say instead of you know
accumulating these trace messages you
know I want these trace messages
actually to be returned on the page
itself at the end of the page
I want the trace messages to be
displayed is it possible absolutely all
you have to do is you know for this
trace element there is another attribute
called page output you can set that to
true so the moment you set that to true
you it's telling write the trace
information at the end of the page so
now for this test page if you remember
we have disabled tracing so let's you
know request waveform one so we're from
one dot aspx now look at that
the trace information is actually
written to the end of the page itself
okay so that's how we we displayed the
trace information at the end of the page
and use a request limit attribute this
request limit is very interesting now
how long should we capture this trace
information in the Playstore ax defer
let's go ahead and disable this page
output we don't want that to be on the
page okay now we have this trace a XD
file so let me refresh this web page so
if you look at this trace toward a XD
file it's actually capturing you know if
you press f5 so many times you know i+
like seven eight times now I plus f5
look at that there are these trace logs
all the requests are captured within the
trace file but how many requests are
going to be logged is there any limit
for these trace messages absolutely and
how do we determine that to determine
that or to specify the limit for the
trace messages to be returned to the
trace log we use an attribute called
request limit by default its value is
ten okay so if you look at this one look
at this approximately I mean there are
ten entries here and you can see this
remaining Zee
which means it will not log any trace
messages you know going further now if
you look at this the last request was
locked as 1838 15 for now if I request
this platform 1 when I press f5 I
pressed it a couple of times
let me refresh this by pressing your
file look at that you know the trace
information is not captured for this
webform one in the trace viewer because
the request limit has read the default
value is 10 and it stopped tracing ok
now we can change that using the request
limit for example let's say I want to
track only the first five requests I can
set that to 5 let me save that let's go
back here let's really close this page
let's press f5 here look at that so I
got one request at 1840 let me press f5
and a couple of times now look at this
there are four remaining entries that
that can be logged now if I press f5
here there's one remaining entry and if
I press f5 here I press f5 now so
remaining is 0 which means from now on
since that request limit has reached you
know the DES trace information is true
is not logged for any web form okay so
that's the request limit attribute use
request limit attribute to control the
number of trays requests that are stored
on the server the default is 10 after
this limit is reached the server will
stop right into the trace file ok if you
want to log trace messages even after
the limit request limit has reached then
set most recent attribute to true when
this attribute is set to true the old
entries in the trace log are discarded
and the new entries get added but at any
given point of time only 5 entries are
maintained you know it keeps on
discarding the old entries and keeps on
adding the new entries or new requests
okay
let's quickly look at that attribute so
I'm going to set this most recent is
equal to true and we have said the
request limit to 5 so let me now save
that first and come here ok so I'm
requesting this one let's come here
request this okay so that's one request
let me press fi one two three four so
now if we refresh this we should have
five entries and remember the first
request was made at eighteen forty one
thirty seven now when I make another
request and come here look at what
happens to this eighteen forty one
thirty seven when i refresh this that's
good that goes away look at that it's
gone of a and I got another request at
eighteen forty one fifty seven okay so
that's the use of most recent attributes
okay when this attribute is set to true
the old entries in the trace log are
discarded and the new entries get added

asp.net c-sharp and sequence of
interview questions that's it for today
