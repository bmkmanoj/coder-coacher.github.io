this video we'll discuss quantifiers in
length all any and contains methods
belong to quantifiers category
quantifier is return true or false
depending on whether if some or all of
the elements in a sequence satisfy a
condition let's look at these methods
one by one with examples all method
returns true if all the elements in the
sequence adds for a given condition
otherwise false here is an example here
we have got an integer array which
contains numbers from 1 to 5 all method
in this case is going to return true
because all the elements in this number
sequence satisfies this condition every
element is less than 10 so all method in
this case is going to return true there
are two overloaded versions of this any
method one version does not take any
parameters the other overloaded version
takes predicates as parameter using a
predicate we can specify a condition now
the older version which does not take
any parameters simply checks if the
sequence contains at least one element
now numbers sequence contains at least
one element so any method in this case
is going to return true now any method
in this example here is checking at
least one element in this number
sequence satisfies this condition now
none of the elements in this number
sequence is greater than 10 which means
none of the element satisfies this
condition so any method in this case is
going to return false there are two
overloaded versions of the contains
method one of the old world version
takes only one parameter the other
overloaded version takes two parameters
now contains method in this case you
know is checking if this number sequence
contains this element 3 using the
default equality compare now since this
number sequence contains number 3
contains in this case it's going to
return true
now here contains method is checking
whether if this country's string array
contains this country India and notice
that here we are passing another
argument so here we are passing an
alternate equality compare now if we
don't
the second argument here this contains
method is going to return false because
by default string comparison is going to
be case sensitive with the default
equality compare that's what it does so
it will see India with small litters
differently from India with capital
letters and for that reason contains
method will return false but here we are
passing an alternate equality compare
and telling you know to ignore case
while comparing strings so contains
method in this case is going to return
true now when it comes to complex types
like employee customer etc the default
equality compare will only check if the
object references are equal not the
individual properties values of the
objects that are being compared now if
you look at the example here contains
method in this quiz is going to reckon
false so notice that here we have a list
of employees at the moment we have got
two employees within that list and this
contains method is checking okay this
employee is list does it contain an
employee with ID 1 0 1 and named Rosie
yes we do have such an employee within
this list but contains method in this
case it's going to return false
why that's because here we are using you
know the overloaded version which takes
only one parameter so which means this
is going to use the default equality
compare and this default equality
compare by default will only check if
the reference of this object equal to
the reference of this employee object
and that's not true there are two new
employee objects so the object
references of that object and this
object will be different and as a result
contains method a will return false but
our intention here is to actually
compare the individual property values
of the objects and if they are equal
then we want to treat them as equal
objects now to solve this problem there
are three ways and here are they one of
the ways is to use the other overloaded
version of the contains method to which
we can pass a custom class that
implements ie equality compare R and the
second option is to override equals and
get hash board methods and employee
class and the third option and the
simplest option is there
is projecting the properties into your
new anonymous type which overrides
equals and get hash code methods behind
the scenes now we discussed all of these
three options in detail in part 26 of
the link tutorial when we were distinct
are discussing distinct method so in a
similar fashion these three options can
be implemented for contains method as
well so please check part 26 from link
tutorial that's it for today thank you
for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
