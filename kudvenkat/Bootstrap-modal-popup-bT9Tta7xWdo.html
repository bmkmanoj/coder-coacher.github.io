this video we'll discuss the bootstrap
model plug-in creating a model with
bootstrap is straightforward let's say
how to create a model with a header body
and footer so here is what we want to do
when we click this login button that is
present on the right hand side of the
page we want to display this login form
as a model when we click this close
button that is present within the footer
of the model we want this model to be
dismissed along the same lines when we
click this little cross button which is
present in the header of the model we
want this model to be dismissed let's
see how to achieve this let's flip to
visual studio the first thing that we
are going to do here are to create a
model is created development with class
model let's also give this model an ID
let's call it login model and we want
this model to be displayed only and
users click the login button
we don't want users to be accidentally
tabbing into the model so to prevent
that we are going to set tab index to
minus 1 inside this development we are
going to create another development with
class model dialog and inside this
development another development with
class model content and inside this div
we create our model header body and
footer to create the model header we
create a development with class model
header and with no model header we want
title as the I mean login as the title
so to create the title we are going to
use in H for element and set its class
to model title and the title is going to
be login along with the title we also
want this little cross button which is
going to dismiss the model to get that
cross button we are actually going to
use the button element and the class on
this is going to be closed and we are
also going to use data dismiss attribute
and we are going to set data dismiss
attribute to model so this attribute
will actually make the model
to be dismissed when we click this cross
button and to get this cross button the
content for the button is going to be
ampersand x semicolon and then the next
thing that we want to do is create our
model body which is going to contain
fields for the user to login username
and password we discussed forms in part
20 of this video series so I'm actually
going to paste some HTML within our
model body first let's create model body
to create model body all we do is create
a development with class model body and
inside this we have a form we discussed
forms in part 20 so I'm not going to go
over this HTML finally what we want is a
footer
for our model and to create a footer for
the model we are going to create a
development with class model footer and
within our footer we want a button to be
able to login and a close button to
dismiss the model so let's create a
button element here and the class is
going to be the end let's also use BTN
primary contextual state class and the
text on this button is going to be login
and here we want the text on the button
to be closed and for this model to be
dismissed we will use data dismiss
attribute and we are going to set that
to model all right so let's see where
changes reload our page now we can't see
anything on the page that's because this
is a model and something should trigger
this model and to trigger this model we
need this login button so just before
the model let's go ahead and create
another button and the class of this is
going to be BTN let's also use PT and
primary and we want a small button so
I'm also going to use BTN SM class
and the text on the button is going to
be login now I'm going to use you know -
data - attributes here data - target so
when we click this login button which is
the model that we want to show this is
the model which has caught this ID login
model so we are going to use the jQuery
ID selector and point to that login
model and we are also going to use
another data - attribute and that is
data - toggle and we are going to set
that value to model let's save our
changes reload our page notice now we
have the login button we want this login
button on the right hand side so along
with all these classes I am also going
to use pulled write which is going to
place it on the right hand side of the
page and now when we click this button
look at that it shows up the login form
with user name and password fields when
we click this little cross notice the
form is dismissed similarly when we
click the close button again the form is
dismissed now let's look at a few
classes and attributes that we can use
to customize the behavior of the model
at the moment the model can also be
closed by pressing the escape button
look at that when I press the escape
button the model is closed if you want
to prevent the model from closing when
users press escape button then use data
- keyboard equals false so on this model
div I'm going to use data - keyboard
equals false let's reload our page and
look at this now when we press the
escape button the model is not dismissed
but if we click anywhere outside the
model notice the model is still
dismissed if you want to prevent that
from happening then use data - backdrop
equals static so let's use that
attribute data - backdrop equals static
let's save our changes
reload the page look at this we have the
model now when I click anywhere or
or when I press the escape button the
model is not dismissed the only way to
dismiss this model is either by clicking
on this little cross button here or this
close button now at the moment look at
this when I click this login button the
login model immediately appears instead
if you want to animate it if you want
this login model to slowly fade in and
fade out then use this fade class so I'm
going to use the fade class on this
model div let's see what changes reload
our page now when I click this login
button the login form slowly fades in
and when I click close it slowly fades
out to create a small model use model SM
class to create a large model use model
LG class at the moment what we are
seeing here is the default model size so
if I want a small model on this
development that has got this modal
dialog class let's use model SM class
and when we reload the page and click
this login button now we have a small
model if you want a large model instead
of model SM class use model LG class now
we have got a large model thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
