tutorial in this video well discuss a
new type called I HTTP action result
introduced in asp.net Web API - this is
a type that a controller action method
can return below to discuss the
difference between I HTTP action result
and HTTP response message let's
understand the difference with an
example that slipped revisions to do now
at the moment within our students
controller we've got a static list of
students in web api 1 we have a type
called HTTP response message that a
controller action method can written for
example if we want to return the list of
all students then we would typically
implement a public method which is going
to return HTTP response message let's
call it get to create this HTTP response
message object we use the request
objects create response method if you
look at the return type of this method
notice it's returning HTTP response
message and we're going to specify two
parameters for this method the status
code that we want to return and the
value that we want to return the status
code that we want to return is okay
which is going to return 200 and we also
want to return the list of all students
let's implement another get method which
is going to find a student by ID and
then return that specific student again
that it earned type is going to be HTTP
response message but this time the get
method is going to have a parameter of
type integer the ID of the student let's
create a variable here let's call it
student equals within our student static
list find the first or default student
where student ID equals the ID that you
are passing if student is equal to null
that means we have not found the student
in that case we want to return status
code for 0 4 so again they're going to
use the request object but this time we
are going to make use of the screed
error response method and then let's
specify the HTTP
status code HTTP status code is not
found which is going to return four zero
four and we can also specify any
exception message that we want that
simply say student not found if we have
found the student then we want to return
that student with status code okay which
is going to return 200 let's below
solution and test it with fiddler let's
issue a get request to this you are
which is going to return us the list of
all students like this completed so on
the our tab notice we get status code
200 okay and also the list of all
students let's try to find a student by
ID let's execute the request completed
and look at the status code that we got
200 okay and student ID 2 is returned
let's try to find a student who does not
exist
let's specify the ID as 8 and if we look
at the row tab again notice we caught
status code 4 0 4 not found and we also
got the exception message that we have
specified student not found and at the
moment they using HTTP response message
type we have this type in web api one in
web api - we have i HTTP action result
type wherever we are using this HTTP
response message type we can replay
start with I HTTP action result type so
the obvious question that comes to our
mind is what are the benefits of using a
HTTP action results over HTTP response
message time there are two main benefits
one the code is going to be cleaner and
much easier to read and the second main
benefit is that unit testing these
controller action methods become much
simpler when we use a HTTP action result
over HTTP response message type in a
later video we'll discuss unit testing
controller action methods and at that
point you can find the difference it
makes when we use I HTTP action result
over HTTP response message type so let's
return I HTTP action result type and to
written I HTTP action result
and look at this here they're going to
return the list of all students and
status code 200 okay and to do that all
I have to do is use this helper method
and then to this we are going to pass
the list of students that we want to
return and now if you look at this
okay method look at the return type it's
actually returning okay negotiated
content result type but what is this
method returning I HTTP action result
but this is still okay because that type
that is okay negotiated content result
implements a HTTP action result
interface so let's actually prove that
let's go to the definition on this
method and here we have okay negotiated
content result I and if we go to the
definition on that notice it implements
a HCB action result interface now
similarly we can rewrite this code as
well so instead of returning actually
the response message let's return I HTTP
action result and here we want to return
status call not found so I'm simply
going to use the helper method not found
and here we want to return status but
okay along with the student object so
again we are going to use the okay
helper method to that we pass the
student object that we want to return
and if you look at this not found method
it is returning not found result again
this not found result implements I HTTP
action result interface so let's quickly
build our solution and test it one more
time using fiddler let's issue a request
to this URI API slash students which is
going to return us the list of all
students Vic was completed on the rod
tab we can see the status code 200 okay
and the list of students let's try to
find student by ID let's try to find
student with ID 3 completed we caught
the status code 200 okay and that
specific student let's try to find a
student who does not exist
completed we got the status code for
zero for not phone but we don't have the
message student not found if you want
that message as well then instead of
using not found method use content
method and with this method we are going
to use the status code not found and we
specified a message that we want to
return student not found let's build a
solution one more time and verify if we
get the message
let's issue the request one more time it
was completed successfully notice we get
the message - did not found along with
status code four zero four so in
addition to these helper methods okay
content not found we have several other
helper methods as well that return a
type which implements I HTTP action
result to find a complete list of those
methods simply right-click on any of
these methods and then select Kuto
definition we have the list here notice
we have a bad request method which is
returning bad request result and if you
look at this type it implements I HTTP
action reserved interface we have
several other overloads of this bad
request implemented similarly we have
got content health method we've got
created helper method we use this method
if you are posting an item and when we
want to return status code to zero one
similarly there is an internal server
error we simply call this helper method
internal server error so what is by HTTP
action result it's a new type introduced
in web api to that any controller action
method can return its namespace is
system dot web dot h t DB what are the
benefits of using i HTTP action results
over HTTP response message there are two
main benefits the code is cleaner and
easier to read unit testing controller
action methods is much simpler and here
we have the list of helper methods that
return a type that implements a HTTP
action result interface finally this is
the same example that we just looked at
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
