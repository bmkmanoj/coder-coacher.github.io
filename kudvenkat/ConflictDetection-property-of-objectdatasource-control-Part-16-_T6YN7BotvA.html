venket this is part 16 of asp.net
grid-view tutorial in this video we'll
discuss about conflict detection
property with object data source control
please watch part 15 of the asp.net
grid-view tutorial before proceeding
with this video in part 15 we discussed
about deleting data from grid view using
object data source control we didn't
discuss about concurrency in part 15 let
me explain what I mean by this
if you remember we retrieve the data
that's present in the stabile employee
table and then display that within this
crib you control now let's say after the
data is displayed in the grid view
control you know the data that's present
in the underlying table has been changed
okay now for example if you look at the
moment in the grid view control employee
with ID is equal to 1
his name is Mark and even in the table
the data you know the name for employee
with ID is equal to 1 is mark now let's
say someone has changed the name from
mark to park where employee ID is equal
to 1 so obviously when we execute this
query the name gets changed so at the
moment it's park for employee ID is
equal to 1 but in the grid view control
it is still mark now when I click this
bet delete button look at what's going
to happen the row gets deleted ok so in
spite of the underlying data as you know
actually changed I'm still able to you
know delete the data from the grid view
control now in most cases this is fine
but let's say our project requirement is
such that if the underlying data is
changed then I don't want the deleted
update operations to work because we are
effectively over writing changes that
somebody else have changed even before
we have realized that the data has
changed ok so if the underlying data has
changed after it was loaded into the
grid view control then I don't want to
allow that rule to be deleted is that
possible absolutely that's what is the
conflict detection property is for we
discussed about how to use this conflict
detection property with sequel data
source control if you haven't watched
part 14 of the ASBO tribute tutorial I
would strongly encourage you to do so
before continuing with this session ok
now let's see how to use this conflict
detection property with object data
source control
now if you look at this at the moment
you know if you look at the delete
employee method that's Pleasant in the
employee data access layer so this is
the method which gets invoked so if you
look at our web form we have this object
data source control so if you look at
the HTML here that the way it's
configured the object data source
control has got this delete method so if
you look at the property delete method
it takes in this delete employee method
so which is nothing but the delete
employee method that's present in
employee data access layer and if you
look at this delete employee method it
has got only one parameter which is
employee ID okay and we're using this
employee ID as the value for the sequel
parameter at the employee ID so what is
the sequel parameter that's what is used
in the query so delete from TBL employee
where employee ID is equal to at
employee ID okay so this is a
parametrized query and for you know the
value for this parameter is being passed
here which is nothing but the method
parameter okay so this delete queries
only checking the primary key of the
table okay it's not caring about the
other columns that's name gender and
city okay even if these columns are
changed as long as the primary key
matches it's going to delete the row so
that's why even when we have changed the
name you know and then deleted that
record you know it was deleted without
any issues okay now what we basically
want to do is we don't want to allow the
deletion in case if any of this data has
changed okay
so obviously the first step in order to
achieve that is to basically change this
delete employee method again instead of
using just the employee ID as the
parameter I want to pass in you know
basically the employee ID name gender
and city all of these you know
properties because if you look at the
table we have four columns here we need
to match all of the four columns even if
one of the columns have changed then we
don't want to allow the rule to be
deleted okay so the first thing is to
implement that a delete employee method
with the four parameters and just to
speed things up I have this method
already typed so let me copy that and
paste that here and then we'll go over
the code okay
so if you look at this delete employee
method now instead of one parameter it
has got four parameters now employee ID
name gender and city now if you look at
the names of the parameters now I have
included if you know this word original
underscore you know this prefix for
every parameter okay so when the data is
loaded into the grid we control you know
at that point you know whatever is the
state of the data the values for those
columns should be passed you know into
these method as values for these
parameters and I click that delete
button okay so since we want those
original values to be passed and to give
these parameters a meaningful name I
have included that original underscore
prefix here okay so for parameters
coming into the method and this is
simple ATO dotnet code okay
so what are we doing here we are reading
the connection string from web config
file and using that connection string we
are preparing the sequel connection
object and then look at this delete
query this is what is important so if
you look at this delete from TBL
employee where employee ID is equal to
at original employee ID name gender and
city so we are basically using every
table column here okay and then
obviously this is a parameterised query
and we need to supply values for these
sequel parameters that you see in this
query and that's what these lines of
code is doing here so this is the
parameter for employee ID name gender
and city and the important thing to
notice here is that look at this the
value is nothing but the method
parameter so we using these method
parameters as the values for these
sequel parameters which are present in
this parameter is query okay so whatever
values that gets passed into this method
are now used as values within this
delete query okay all right so that's
the first change change the
implementation of this delay
I employ a method now the next change
obviously is to you know reconfigure
this object data source control at the
moment if you look at this object data
source control delete method is delete
employee which is correct but then if
you look at the delete parameters it's
only using employee ID because this is
the old version so we need to include
the rest of the parameters as well that
is the original name gender and city
okay now if we want we can type the
manually here or if we reconfigure the
object data source control there going
to auto generate for us so let's
reconfigure that so configure data
source so our business object is going
to be the same thing now employee data
access layer click Next the select
method is also going to be the same
thing but then our delete method is
going to change now look at this the
delete method I still see the old one
why is that that's because after we have
changed the method we haven't recompile
the solution so let's go ahead and
recompile the project so build the
project once we do that this class will
be recompiled so now let's go ahead and
reconfigure this object data source once
again so the business object is the same
thing select method is the same thing
but the delete method is going to differ
so delete employee now look at that we
have all the four parameters there click
finish and the moment we do that and
then flip this waveform to the source
one notice the delete parameters it's
going to include all those values for us
okay so with that change let's go ahead
and run this so we have done two things
now we have changed the delete employee
method in our employee data access layer
and then we have reconfigured our object
at our source control two steps now look
at this when I try to click this delete
button look at what's going to happen I
get an error that's because you know
there are two more things that we need
to do okay what are those we need to set
you know the conflict detection property
of this object data source control now
by default if you don't set that it's
going to have a value of overwrite
changes meaning even if the underlying
data has changed all
the delete or update method to overwrite
those changes okay but then we don't
want to do that now we want to compare
all values if they don't match then
don't allow the update or delete to
happen because the rules doesn't match
so we have to set that property and
there is another property that we need
to set which is nothing but all the
parameters format string so if you look
at this delete employee method look at
the format of these parameters every
parameter has got this original
underscore original and the scope prefix
okay so obviously since we are using
that prefix and you know to identify
these parameters which are going to
contain the original values you know to
identify that correctly by the object
data source control you will have to
specify what is that format for those
parameters that you are using it's
nothing but original underscore and then
whatever is the name of the field
employee ID name gender or city so in my
web form I'm going to specify that so
original underscore and then a
placeholder so as simple as that okay so
three things that we need to do you need
to change the method itself to include
you know all the parameters and then
reconfigure your object data source
control and then finally set the
properties conflict detection property
and old values parameter format string
property okay so those are the two
properties that we need to set all right
now let's go ahead and run this with
this changes so at the moment if you
look at this you know employee with ID
is equal to two that's John now if I
click that record because at the moment
within the database the data hasn't
changed so when I click that it should
be deleted safely but look at this third
employee is Mary let's change her name
to something else maybe Sarah let's set
that to three update let's select the
data back so mary has been changed to
Sarah now let's try to delete this and
see what happens look at that the rule
doesn't get deleted because it doesn't
match the name
so obviously no Rosa match hence the
delete will not go through and the
script simply refreshes with new data
okay on this slide you can find
resources for asp.net c-sharp and
sequels away interview questions that's
it for today thank you for listening
