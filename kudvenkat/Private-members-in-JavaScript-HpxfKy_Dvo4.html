in this video we'll discuss private
members in Java square in any
object-oriented programming language
classes can have private and public
members for example a class in c-sharp
can have private and public fields and
functions here we have an example in
this employee class notice that we have
got one private real and two public
fields we also have a private function
and a public function the private
members of this class that is the
private field and the private function
they are available only within this
employee class they are not available to
any code outside of this employee class
whereas the public members that is these
two public fields and this public
function they are available both within
the employee class as well as to any
code outside of the employee class we
know that javascript is an
object-oriented programming language so
objects in JavaScript can also have
private and public fields and functions
let's look at an example let's create a
function here let's name it employee and
let's include two parameters first name
last name now we want this to be a
constructor function so this constructor
function is going to construct an
employee object for this and we want
this employee object to have two public
properties first name and last name
so here the employee object is going to
have two public fields first name and
last name in JavaScript we create public
fields using this keyword so these two
here are public fields now let's go
ahead and create a private field in
JavaScript we create a private field by
using the VAR keyword let's name this
private full name so this private field
will be available only within this
employee constructor function it will
not be available to any code outside of
this function
and now let's create a private function
now there are two ways we can create a
private function in JavaScript we can
simply nest a function inside this
constructor function something like this
function private let's call this cat
full name so this is a private function
this function is available only inside
this constructor function it's not
available to any code outside of this
function so this is one way to create a
private function the other way is by
using ver keyword their private get full
name and we want that to be a function
so this is also a private function now
let's initialize this private field
using this private function so private
full name equals first-name append space
and then last name so basically we are
computing the full name of the employee
and we want to return the value that is
present in this variable private full
name so we have got a private function
as well now let's create a privileged
function now what is a privileged
function we'll discuss that in just a
bit but first let's go ahead and create
a privileged to create a privileged
function we use this keyword this dot
let's actually name this privileged get
full name and we want this to be a
function so here you know this function
is a privileged function will understand
you know what why a privileged function
is required in just a bit now all we
want this function to do is call this
private function so call private get
full name and return its value back
now let's go ahead and create a public
function to create a public function we
use the prototype property of the
constructor function what is the name of
the constructor function here it's
employee now we use the prototype
property of this employee constructor
function now we use prototype we
implement inheritance will talk more
about prototypal inheritance in a later
video session but for now just
understand that to create a public
function we use the prototype property
of the constructor function in our case
the name of the constructor function is
employee dot notice that we have a
prototype property and dot we specify
the name of our public method that's
actually named this public get full name
and we want this to be a function and
this public function it's going to call
this privilege function so this dot
privileged get full name and return the
value okay so at the moment we have an
employee constructor function which has
got two public fields one private field
one private function one privileged
function and one public function so what
is a privileged function privileged
methods are created using this keyword
we have just seen that and public
methods are created using the prototype
property of the constructor function
privilege the methods so if you look at
this privileged method notice that it's
calling the private method so privileged
methods can access private fields and
private methods public methods can call
privileged methods but they cannot call
private methods so notice within this
employee constructor function we have a
private function and a public function
now both of them are present in the same
function for the same employee
constructor function but still this
public function cannot directly call the
private function
okay that's the reason we need a
privileged function so a privileged
function can call a private function and
a privileged function can be called by a
public function okay and like public
methods privileged functions are also
available outside of the constructor
function so outside of this constructor
function we can access this privileged
function and this public function but we
cannot access this private function and
this private feel so public feels
privileged function and public function
can be accessed outside of this employee
constructor function but not the private
members that is this private view and
this private function public fields and
functions are available both inside and
outside of the employee constructor
function private fields and functions
are available only inside the employee
constructor function attempting to
access private fields and properties
outside of the constructor function will
result in undefined error so let's look
at an example so we have our employee
constructor function so let's use this
constructor function to construct an
employee object so here let's create a
variable let's name it employee equals
new employee so we using the constructor
function and let's pass storm as the
first name and grower as the last name
document dot write employee dot notice
that I can call public get full name and
let's append an HTML break
now let's go ahead and call the
privilege function as well so when I
press dot notice that in the
intellisense it shows in a privileged
function and the public function so
let's call our privileged function
privileged get full name remember both
public and privileged functions are
accessible outside of the containing
constructor function now let's also
access the private field now what is the
name of the private field I mean private
function the name of the private
function is private get full name so
let's try to access that here first of
all notice that when I press dot I don't
see the name of that private function in
the intellisense you know it indirectly
says you cannot call it outside of the
function outside of the constructor
function but let's try to call that and
see what's going to happen so the name
of the function is private get full name
let's copy that and let's try to call it
and let's also try to call the private
field so here we have these two public
fields
these are definitely accessible you can
actually access a public field when I
say employee dot notice that I can see
first name I can see last name so that's
a public field so that's going to print
the value but then let's try to access
the private field and the name of the
private field is private full name so
let's copy that and try to call that
outside of the containing constructor
function all right so with all this code
let's run this in debug mode let's
actually put a breakpoint here oh it
already executed so let's actually break
this
so let's throw in a breakpoint let's run
this one more time so it calls the
employee constructor function and we
should have an employee object here so
we are calling public get full name that
should be called without any error and
privileged function should also be
called without any error now we are
trying to call the private function
let's see what's going to happen first
of all look at this when I hover the
mouse over it says private get full name
is undefined similarly when I hover the
mouse over private field name look at
this private full name undefined okay so
the private members of the constructor
function are not available outside of
that constructor function can we modify
a private field outside of the
constructor function remember private
fields are not accessible outside okay
so obviously the straight answer is no
you can't now let's actually look at an
example so here the private field name
is private full name right so that's
actually now when we try to do this
employee dot private full name
it throws undefined error we have just
seen that let's actually do this
employee dot private full name equals
ABC now what is this going to do now
this line here says add a field called
private full name this is actually going
to be a public field add a public field
to the employee object with the name
private full name so we are adding this
field to the employee object on the fly
dynamically now if you look at the
private field name the private field
name is also the same private full name
so this is a private field within the
constructor function and here to the
employee object we are adding a public
field with the same name
so is this going to change the value
that is present in this private free
so the answer is now there are two
different things this is a private field
and the scope of this is only within
that function outside of this employee
constructor function
you know this private field does not
exist here whatever we are adding to the
employee object that is you know a
public field you know incidentally it
happened to have the same name as that
of the private field okay so let's
actually prove that there are two
different things by calling get public
get full name and then we'll again try
to actually print the value that is
present in private full name public
property okay so this is a public field
so let's throw in a breakpoint and let's
learn this in debug mode so let's press
f10 so we have the employee object now
at this point when I hover the mouse
over look at this I am trying to access
private full name
you know the employee object does not
know anything about it outside of that
constructor function that's the reason
it says employee door private full name
is undefined and after that I am
dynamically adding a property to the
employee object corporate name private
full name so this will be added as a
public field so when I + f10 look at
this now when I expand this employee
object notice that it also have a
private full name public field and that
is initialized with ABC whatever value
we have now let's call this and get full
name method so it goes into the you know
get full name function which calls you
know privileged function so let's press
f11 so that's cool though goes into our
privileged function and this privileged
function is calling our private function
so let's press f11 now so it goes to the
private function now when I press f10
here look at this
this private function that contains a
value of Tom Grover so this is a private
field within the constructor function
now if I go back here you know it's
still in debug mode and this private
field contains Tom Grover that's the
name of our employee and if we go here
and look at the employee object and when
I expand this look at this this private
full name contains ABC so this proves
that these are two different things
within the function you know that's a
private field and here this is a public
field and you have just seen that the
values are two different things
so now when we press f10 so it comes
back from the function so the call came
back and then look at this private
full-name this public field still have
that value of ABC so when I press fi on
the browser we should see ABC so
definitely those are two different
things
this is a public field that happened to
have the same name as that of the
private field within the employee
constructor function so private fields
we declare them using the VAR keyword
inside the object and can only be
accessed by private functions and
privileged methods public fields are
declared using this keyword and are
available outside the object private
functions there are two ways to create
them you know we can either create a
private feelings in where keyword like I
mean back keyword like this or you know
like a nested function inside another
function like this using the function
keyword and these private functions can
only be called by privileged methods we
have seen that as well privileged
methods these are declared using this
keyword and they are available both
within and outside of the containing
object public methods these are defined
by using the objects prototype property
and they're available both within and
outside the object thank you for
listening and have a gray
a day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
