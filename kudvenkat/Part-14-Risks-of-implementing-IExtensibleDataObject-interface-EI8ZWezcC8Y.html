this video will discuss the risks of
implementing AI extensible data object
interface this is continuation to Path
13 so please watch part 13 before
proceeding in part 13 of this video
series we discussed how to implement the
I extensible data object interface to
preserve unknown elements during
serialization and B serialization of
data contracts the downside of
implementing I extensible data object
interface is that it carries the risk of
denial of service attack since the
extension data is stored in memory the
attacker may fled the server with
requests that contain large number of
unknown elements which can lead to
system out of memory and denial of
servers so the next question of how to
turn off I extensible data object
feature arises one way to turn off I
extensible data object feature is to
remove the implementation of I
extensible data object interface from
all the data contracts this should work
fine as long as we have few data
contracts on which I extensible data
object interface is implemented if you
look at the employee service that we
have been working where this employee
service has got two operation contracts
get employee and save employee both of
these operation contracts are making use
of this employee data contract and
notice that this employee data contract
implements I extensible data object
interface now if we want to disable the
support for AI extensible data object
one way is to remove the implementation
from this data contract and we also need
to remove you know the property
implementation now this will work fine
for us just because we have only one
data contract that implements AI
extensible data object interface but
just imagine if we have large number of
data contracts within our application
that provides implementation for AI
extensible data object that means we
have to go to each and every data
contract and remove the implementation
which is tedious and error-prone so the
WCF team at Microsoft has thought about
this and has provided us
an option to enable or disable support
for I extensible data object feature
through service behavior configuration
so we basically include service
behaviors element give the behavior a
meaningful name and then use this
attribute ignore extension data object
of data contract serializer so set this
to true it's going to ignore the
extension data and using configuration
to enable or disable support is much
better rather than changing the
application code that's because if we
change the application code we need to
rebuild our application and redeploy to
the production server on the other hand
if we change the configuration we don't
have to rebuild and redeploy we just
need to stop the service and start at
once again
so using configuration is much better so
with this configuration option later if
we want to enable support for I
extensible data object all we need to do
is set this attribute to false and we
are done we don't have to go back to
each and every data contract and then
provide implementation for I extensible
data object interface okay so at the
moment if you look at this employee data
contract it's providing the
implementation for I extensible data
object which means this service is going
to preserve the unknown elements for
clients and then when the response is
sent back those unknown elements are
also sent you know in the XML that is
sent back to the client okay so let's
actually look at that in action let's
run this service host and let's go and
run the client as well so let's get this
employee 1 and let's specify male s
gender for 1 employee 1 and let's save
this employee with ID 1 0 1 save
employee so employee is saved let's get
rid of this gender and look at this when
we get employee that the unknown element
gender is also retrieved back and if you
look at the database table so 1 0 1 look
at that there is no gender but then the
service is retaining that with an
extension data property and then
returning that back to the client
all right now let's see how to disable
support for I extensible data object
using service behavior configuration so
we go to the configuration file of our
service and we come to this behaviors
element which has got service behaviors
within that and we already have a
behavior and that enables metadata
exchange so here let's add data contract
serializer and then specify the
attribute ignore extension data object
and set that to true so we are going to
ignore extension data so no matter you
know how many unknown elements are there
in the request that's coming to the
service the service is now going to
ignore those extension I mean those
unknown elements at the service side and
then when the response is sent to the
client you know those unknown elements
are lost okay
so let's go ahead and stop the host
that's already running let's read on the
host and let's come to the client now
let's get employee 1 once again and
let's save this employee using ID 1 0 2
so save employee and look at this when
we get this employee look at that gender
is lost because we disabled the support
for I extensible data object feature
using service behavior configuration and
if you want to do it programmatically
without removing the implementation of I
extensible data object another way is to
use this service behavior attribute on
the service itself and then specify that
name the parameter ignore extension data
object so if you look at our employee
service we are already using the service
behavior attribute to set the instance
context mode now you know look at this
version of the service behavior
attribute you know there is a property
called ignore extension data object so
we can specify it programmatically as
well
okay so we can either do it you know
using the service behavior attribute
programmatically or using configuration
using service behavior settlement now
what actually happens when we set this
attribute you know to true either
through configuration or by using this
so this behavior attribute basically the
DC realizer will not populate the
extension data property okay so when the
client sends a request
obviously the request is coming in an
XML format okay so when that request is
received at the service the deserialize
that the server's needs to reconstruct
employee object from that XML so the DC
réaliser will come into action and then
when it finds any unknown elements since
we have turned off the support for
extension data the deserialize ER is now
going to ignore those unknown elements
it will not store the unknown elements
within that extension data property so
if you look at the employee data
contract so this employee data contract
has got this extension data property so
let's actually close the host that's
already running and put a breakpoint
within this save employee and then let's
go ahead and run this
okay the service is running with
debugging enable let's go and run
declined as well let's get employee 1
and let's save this employee with ID 2 0
1 so let's click save employee look at
that it comes in to save employee and if
you look at extension data I look at
that the members are basically now so
the deserialize ER which has
reconstructed this employee object you
know ignored those unknown elements okay
on the other hand if we enable support
you know that extension data are
property of this employee object would
have been populated with the unknown
elements that are received at this
service all right that's it for today
thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
