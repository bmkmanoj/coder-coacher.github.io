in this video we'll discuss ternary
operator in JavaScript ternary operator
can be used as a shortcut for FL
statement first let's look at this
interacts with the ternary operator
we'll first have a boolean expression
boolean expressions return true or false
if the boolean expression returns true
then the statements that are present
after the question mark will be executed
and if this expression returns false
then the statements that are present
after : symbol will be executed let's
look at an example let's first write a
program that's going to check whether if
the provided number is even or odd let's
do that using FL statement and then we
will see how to replace that FL
statement with a ternary operator so
let's flip to visual studio first we
want to prompt the user to enter a
number so let's use the prompt function
for that please enter a number in case
if the end user didn't enter any number
then we want to return empty string as
the default this prompt function is
going to return the value in a text
format let's convert that to a number
format using number function let's
create a variable to store the number
let's also create another variable to
hold the message that is whether the
number is even or odd if user input
modulus two equals zero so if a number
is divided by two and if the remainder
is zero then we know it's an even number
in which case we want to initialize this
message variable with this string your
number is even in case if the boolean
expression returns false then it comes
to the else part and we want to
initialize this message variable with
this string your number is odd and
finally let's pass the message variable
to the alert function let's quickly run
this program and test it let's first
pass an even number so it says your
number is even let's reload the web form
and it says your number is odd all right
let's replace this if-else statement
using ternary operator so let's get rid
of all these lines and with the ternary
operator we can check whether the number
is even or odd in a single line so let's
use the boolean expression use an input
modulus to equal 0 so this boolean
expression is going to return true or
false if it returns true then we want
this string your number is even and if
it returns false then we want this
string to be returned your number is odd
so what's going to happen here so with
the ternary operator we will have the
boolean expression first so this will be
evaluated if this returns true then this
string will be returned so this string
will be used to initialize this variable
if this expression returns false then
this string will be used to initialize
this variable and then we are passing
the variable to the alert function so it
should work the same way as before so
let's pass even number it says your
number is odd reload the waveform pass
an odd number and it says your number is
odd can we have multiple statements per
case with the ternary operator now if
you look at this example at the moment
you know if this expression returns true
then we only have one statement right
here now is it possible to have multiple
statements executed if this expression
returns true absolutely ok if you want
multiple statements to be executed for
each case that is if this expression
returns true I want to execute multiple
statements if this expression returns
false even in that case I want to
execute multiple statements it's
absolutely possible and to make it
possible you have to have those multiple
conditions within brackets and each
condition must be separated by a comma
let's look at that in action so we have
the number in this user input variable
so first we have the boolean expression
we are checking if it's divisible by two
or not if it returns zero as the
remainder then what we want to do is
alert your number is even so that's one
statement that I want to execute I want
another statement to be executed alert
your number is and whatever is the
number that the end user has entered we
want to display that so let's use the
user input variable to do that so at the
moment notice that we have two
statements here and we want both of
these statements to be executed in case
if this expression returns true
so we separate the statements with a
comma put both the statements within
brackets so both of these statements
will be executed in case if this
expression returns true if the
expression returns false even in that
case I want to execute two statements
and these are the two statements that I
want to execute so alert your number is
odd and then we want we also want to
print the number okay and we don't need
this function anymore so let's quickly
run this and see if we get two alerts
let's first pass an even number click OK
and notice that your number is even as
soon as I click OK we get another alert
your number is four so both the
statements that are present are executed
let's reload the waveform pass an odd
number so your number is odd and then it
says your number is nine so it's
possible to execute multiple statements
now multiple if else if statements can
also be replaced with a ternary operator
let's look at an example let's write a
JavaScript function you know that's
going to display the month name based on
the month number we'll do that first
using if else if statement and then we
will see how to replace these multiple
if as if statements with ternary
operator
so first let's prompt the user to enter
a month number and we want only the
first three month numbers one two three
if they enter anything else we want to
display a message saying unknown month
name okay
so we have the month number in this
variable user input if user input is
equal to 1 then we know month name is
going to be January so let's create a
variable to hold the month name so if
user input equals 1 then month name is
equal to January else--if
user input equals 2 then month name is
February
else--if user input is 3 then month name
is going to be March else if it's not 1
2 or 3 then we want to simply initialize
this month name variable to unknown
month and then finally let's use the
alert function and then pass month name
variable to it okay
so let's quickly test this so let's send
a month to so February let's enter a
month 9 click OK and it is unknown month
as expected now here we've got multiple
if else if statements now let's see how
to replace these with ternary operator
so we can rewrite this entire program
using ternary operator so basically you
can get rid of all these conditions then
we can say so month name equals user
input is equal to 1 okay so that's a
boolean expression it's going to return
true or false if it returns true then we
know the month is January in which case
we want to return the string January in
case if that expression evaluates to
false then we know it's not number one
so I am going to check if it is equal to
number two okay so this is a boolean
expression again so now I can use
another question mark here so if this
expression returns true then we want
this string to be returned February okay
if this expression returns false then I
want to again check if user input is
equal to three if that condition is true
then we want to return March
else if this expression returns false
then we want to return unknown month so
you can have many conditions with the
ternary operator at the moment we have
three conditions so let's quickly run
this and see if it works the same way so
first let's pass to just February let's
reload the waveform
let's pass three this March reload
let's pass ten unknown month so it's
also possible to have multiple
conditions thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
