in this video we'll discuss the
convention used by MVC to find views
please watch by 31 before proceeding
notice this index action method with an
employee controller class this does not
specify the name of the view to return
so there are two questions to answer
here how does a speed or net MVC know
which view to use and what locations to
say is p.net NB c search by default to
answer these two questions i'm going to
delete this index view from the employee
folder so let's flip to visual studio so
this is the MVC demo project that we
have been working with I'm going to
delete this index view from this
employee folder with this change let's
go and run this and notice this index
view this nut does not specify the name
of the view to return let's see what's
going to happen look at that we get an
error stating the view index or its
master was not found so what is the name
of the view it's looking for the name of
the view here is index and what is the
name of our action method index so by
convention asp.net MVC looks for a view
with the same name as that of the
controller action method okay so here
the controller action method is action
method name is index and it is looking
for review with name index so where is
it looking for that view in which
locations is it going to search for that
view there are two locations look at
that views slash folder name matching
the controller name look at the error
message it's actually looking within
views folder and then it's looking for
employee folder so what is the name of
our controller here employee controller
so it's going to look for a folder name
you know where the name matches with the
name of the controller in this case
employee controller so it's going to
look for a folder with named employee
within views okay so that's the first
location we use slash folder name
matching the controller name and the
second location is views slash shared
folder but if you look at our project do
we have a shared folder within views
folder no we don't why is that
that's because we have used an empty
template when we created this project so
let me explain what I mean if I go to
visual studio and when we create a new
project file a new project and I want to
create an asp.net MVC for web
application once I click OK here notice
that it is asking me to pick a template
now when we created this MVC demo
project we used this empty template okay
so because of that it did create you
know shade folder within views but
there's nothing stopping us from doing
that
but then when you create a project you
know by selecting internet application
as the template and then once you click
OK it's going to create a project that
looks like this ok notice that within
views we have a folder shared ok so it's
going to the second location location
that it's going to search is the shared
folder and then look at the error
message within those two locations it's
looking for a view with name index but
notice the extension it can have
different extensions either
aspx if your view engine is an ASP X
view engine then it's you know the
extension will be dot aspx ok on the
other hand if it's a partial view then
it the extension is going to be dot asex
will discuss more about partial views in
a later video session and then it can
also be dot CS HTML or dot VB HTML if
your view engine is raisa and depending
on the programming language you know the
extension is going to differ but then
the idea here is it's going to search
for a view with this name with these
extensions what are the different
extensions dot see as HTML VB HTML or
did aspx or dot a SC X and it's going to
search in these two locations and that's
by convention okay now let's go back to
our MVC demo project let's see that I'm
going to have a view with that name
index so let's add a view so the name of
the view is going to be index I'm going
to choose you know aspx as our view
engine we're going to create a strongly
typed view against this employee we're
not going to use any master page and the
scaffold template is going to be
let's add that so that should add a view
with name index and then the extension
dot aspx let's create another view with
the same name so let's add a view the
name is again going to be indexed this
time again the view engine is going to
be aspx and then I'm going to create a
strongly typed view against employee
object scaffold template list I'm going
to create a partial view let's add that
so this should add a view with named
index but the extension is going to be
dot ASC X we'll talk more about partial
views in a later video session let me
add another view with the same name this
time I'm going to choose our view engine
as Frasor the rest of the conflict the
rest of the configuration is going to
stay the same and let's add this view so
it's going to add index dot c sh t ml so
within this employee folder i have you
know three views with the same name
index the only the extension changes and
then let's have some text so here within
this let's go back to this index dot
aspx this is the aspx view so within the
title let's say the view name is you
know let's output this text so we know
that when the page renders what view we
are looking at so let's go back to razor
view and here let's say it is CS HTML
and then let's actually take this h2 tag
and then let's go back to this partial
view let's paste it there okay so within
this employee folder we have three views
with the same name only their extensions
differ and then let's save everything
and let's go back to our employee
controller and if you look at this
within this index action method we are
not specifying the name of the view so
if i have views with these different
extensions with the same name which view
is it going to pick by default let's see
that let's actually run this and see
which view it's going to return now look
at this error message and if you look at
this error message its first looking for
something with index dot aspx so by
default it's going to pick that view so
it found a match look at the title here
it's looking for I mean it has picked up
index slash aspx oh it has picked up
this view index dot aspx okay so let's
say now instead of the aspx view I want
to use the razor view is it possible
absolutely all you need to do is you can
specify the full part of the view so
what I can do here I can specify the
name of the view here I can use a
different overloaded version of this
view function where we can also specify
the name of the view so basically they
using this overloaded version so here we
are going to specify the full part so
I'm going to use the still symbol which
indicates the current directory and then
from there navigate to muse folder from
there navigate to employee folder and
from there look for a view with this
name index dot CS HTML and now if we run
this it should pick up the raise of you
rather than the aspx our view so it's
still loading there and look at that it
has picked up the raise of you if you
specify only the name of the view so now
let's say I have seen several people
doing this they simply specify the name
of the view like this with its extension
now if you do that and if you actually
run this we actually get an error look
at what's going to happen look at that
it's looking for a file I mean a view
with this name index dot CSS HTML dot
aspx so this entire thing that you have
passed here you know it considers that
as the name of the view okay that's why
we get this error so if you want to
specify you know the name of the view
then use the full path or you can also
do this you can get rid of this
extension and then if you run this by
default it's going to pick up the aspx
view
so if you don't specify the full part
and then only the name of the view look
at that it actually picked up aspx fear
now if you want to use a view which is
not inside the views folder of the
current controller notice this here you
know within this folder name matches the
name of our controller the employee
controller now let us say the view that
this controller needs is present in a
different folder in that case you can
still specify the full path and it's
going to work for example let me create
a new folder here let's add a folder
let's call it home and then maybe let's
move all of these views into this home
folder so now let's actually delete this
or let's leave it there so it's going to
look for an index view now let's run
this and see what's going to happen as
you might have guessed we will get an
error why because it's going to look for
that index view within employee folder
and shared folder within views but then
within those folders we don't have a
view with that name so it's going to
edit out but then we know that this view
is present in a different folder okay so
in that case you have to again specify
the full path so tilled for slash within
views we have home folder and within
that we have an index dot aspx fear so
even if the view is present in a
different directory you can still
specify the full path to pick up that
view so here we get the view as expected
so please know that asp.net MVC is all
about convention over configuration
views folder contains one folder for
each controller and a shared folder okay
so if you notice this MVC one
application you know we just created
using that template internet application
template
notice that here within the controllers
folder I have two controllers account
controller and home
Rolla and to match those two controllers
look at the views folder I have a folder
with name account this folder is going
to contain all the views that relate to
relates to account controller
similarly home controller is going to
contain all the views that relates to
home controller okay and then I also
have a shade folder and what is the
shade of folder going to contain shade
folder is basically used to store views
shared between controllers okay so if
you want to use a view that's going to
be shared between both this employee and
home controller then our shade folder is
the right place to put that view for
example master pages you know we use
master pages to give a consistent look
and feel for our website okay so the
shared folder is the right folder to put
your master pages okay and if you're
using razor View engine you know the
master page is called as layout page so
your master pages and layout pages are
stored in the shared folder okay we'll
talk more about layout pages and master
pages in a later video session on this
