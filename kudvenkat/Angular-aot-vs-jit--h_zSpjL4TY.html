in this video we'll discuss a OD that is
ahead of time compilation and jet
just-in-time compilation in angular we
have got two models of compilation jet
which stands for just-in-time
compilation and äôt ahead of time
compilation as the name implies JIT
compilation compiles the application
just in time in the browser at runtime
whereas the ahead of time compilation
compiles the application at Build time
itself with a development build by
default we get jet compilation and this
is how it works the application code
along with the angular compiler is
downloaded by the browser at runtime
when a request is issued to the
application the JIT compiler in the
browser compiles the application code
before it is executed this means our
user who made that first request has to
wait for the application to compile
first in our previous videos in this
series we already discussed when we do a
build we get these standard JavaScript
bundles in line bundle main polyfills
styles and vendor this vendor banner
right here contains the compiler along
with the angular framework the compiler
is roughly half of the angular framework
let's actually see what we've got in
this vendor bundle there is a tool
called source map Explorer that we can
use to inspect these JavaScript bundles
as the name implies the source map
Explorer tool analyzes the source maps
that are generated along with these
JavaScript bundles to draw a map of all
the dependencies for us to be able to
use this source map Explorer tool we
have to install it first to install
source map Explorer we execute this
command npm install source - map -
Explorer - - save - Deb
I've already executed this demand so I'm
not going to execute this again
once you have the tool installed do a
development build if you have not done
so already I've already done and
development build on my machine so if we
look at the disk falter within the
routing demo project folder notice we've
got all our JavaScript bundles along
with their respective source my files
and look at this vendor bundle it's
roughly around 2.2 MB and half of this
size is the angular compiler we know
with the development build by default we
get JIT compilation and for the JIT
compilation to work the browser needs to
download the compiler and that compiler
is present in this render bundle so
let's use the source map Explorer tool
to inspect what this vendor bundle is
made up of and the source map Explorer
tool is installed in the node modules
folder within that we have got dot bin
and within that we have our source map
Explorer we want to run this source map
Explorer tool against this vendor bundle
this vendor bundle is present in the
dist folder within that we have of a
vendor bundle so now when we press the
Enter key it's going to analyze the
source map files and draw a map of all
the dependencies there we go we have the
contents of our vendor bundle displayed
in a graphical form in the browser the
total bundle science is 2.25 mb of that
2.25 mb the compiler is 1.0 2mb just
over 45% and we have the other angular
framework files like the angular core
router etc with äôt compilation the
angular application is precompiled so
this means the browser loads executable
code so it can render the application
immediately without waiting to compile
the application first this also means
that the äôt as the application is
already pre compiled there is also no
need for the browser to download the
angular compiler as we already know the
compiler code is roughly half of the
angular framework so omitting it
dramatically reduces the application
size by default the production world is
ahead of
compiled so there is no need to bundle
up the angular compiler code in the
vendor bundle this brings down the
vendor bundle size by almost 50% in
addition it is also minified ugly filed
and tree shaped to remove any code that
we are not referencing in our
application so the bundle size is
further reduced now let's do a
production build and then inspect the
vendor bundle generated by that
production world so let's flip over to
the command prompt and execute this ng
bailed command with - - prod option we
know by default the production world is
not going to generate source map files
but for the source map Explorer tool to
work we need the source Maps so let's
turn on source maps by setting - SM
option to true there we go our
production build is complete now let's
run the source map Explorer against this
vendor bundle
notice now depend a bundle is just 313
kilobytes and Beth in the bundle we
don't have the compiler anymore because
with production build by default we get
ahead of time compilation and with ahead
of time compilation as our application
is already pre compiled we don't need
the browser to download the compiler
anymore another benefit of aut compiler
is that it detects and reports template
binding errors at Build time itself
instead of at run time let's understand
what we mean by this but an example in
our home component class I'm going to
include a function I'm going to call
this function get text and as you can
see this is a very straightforward
function all it does is return the
string hello presume let's bind to this
function in the view template we have
our home component view template right
here so I'm going to include it
development and bind it to this function
cat text notice I have deliberately
misspelled the function name so let's
save all our changes and then execute
the ng serve command there we go our
build is complete we know this ng serve
command does an in-memory build and the
server is listening at port number 4200
let's navigate to localhost colon 4200
and we see the message homeworks we know
this is coming from our home component
view template so if we look at the home
component view template whatever message
we have here we see that in the browser
but this development is not displaying
the string that is returned by this get
text function and if we launch our
browser developer tools by pressing f12
but in the console notice we have that
template binding error
remember we deliberately misspelled the
get text function so it's complaining
that get text is not a function now we
only know about this template binding
error
one time and we launched the browser and
navigated to /home but at the time if
you look at the console here notice we
don't have any information about that
error with this ng self-command by
default we get jet compilation and not
the ahead of time compilation and we
just proved with JIT compilation will
only come to know about the template
binding errors at runtime and not at
compile time now let's see how things
are going to change when we use ahead of
time compilation stop the server first
and let's execute the ng self command
again but this time with a ot option set
to true there we go build failed to
compile as you can see that ahead of
time compilation we will get to know the
template binding errors at Build time
itself instead of at run time now let's
quickly recap what we have discussed so
far for JIT compilation the browser
needs to download the anglican pyla
whereas with a OD compilation it does
not have to while the application is
being JIT compiled in the browser uses
haft way whereas with a OT the
application is precompiled so there is
no such wait with jet compilation the
template binding errors are only known
at runtime were asked with a ot
compilation
welcome to know about them at best time
itself by default both the commands ng
bailed and ng serve uses JIT compilation
with either of these commands we can use
a OT option to turn on ahead of time
compilation with a production world by
default we get ahead of time compilation
for some reason if you want to turn off
a OT for your production world simply
said a OD option to false that's it in
this video thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
