venket this is part 19 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll learn about
mapping virtual path to a physical path
using server dot map path method now
before we do anything let's create an
asp.net web application project and
understand what we mean by physical path
and virtual path now here I have a
simple asp.net web application project
that I have created and within this
project I have a page and the webform is
called as page and root directory so
first lest let's understand what we mean
by root directory or root web
application directory okay now this
project should have been physically
created somewhere on the hard disk okay
so how do we find out what is the folder
in which this project is physically
created right-click on the folder and
select open folder in Windows Explorer
that should open up the physical folder
where we have this project created now
if you look at this its present in C
colon backslash sample web backslash
sample web if you look at the name of
the project its sample web and if you
look at the name of the solution it's
also a sample web and that's the reason
why we have to sample web folders here
one sample web folder is for the
solution the solution folder and the
other one is the actual web application
project folder so for this web
application project the root directory
is C colon backslash sample web
backslash sample web as you can see here
okay so that's the root directory and
this is the physical path where we
actually have this particular file page
in root directory dot aspx now if the
user has to view this file in a browser
then you know let's try to views the
this in a browser right click on that
and say view in browser now you should
see that file in the browser window so
this address that you type here in the
browser window is the virtual path okay
so meaning this path really does not
exist this is being served by the web
server okay so this is the virtual path
and to this path you know there is a
physical path associated okay which is
nothing
but you know if you want to see this
page you're typing this virtual part and
they browse the vendor okay but this
file
you know this page in route direct
directory dot aspx this has to reside
somewhere physically on the hard disk so
what's that physical path so we will see
how to use the server dot map path
method to map the physical path or to
map this virtual path to a physical part
okay so let's look at that with an
example and to understand the server dot
map path method it because it can be
used in several different ways depending
on the characters that we pass in for
the virtual path let's actually
understand that with an example so I
want to create you know our web
application project to have this
structure so within the root directory I
want to add categories and electronics
folders so let's go ahead and add them
to add that right-click on the project
I'm going to add a folder called
electronics or categories and within
categories you know electronics is a
category so let's add a folder there
let's call this electronics and then to
this folder if you look at this we are
adding page in electronics folder so
let's add a webform so to this folder if
I have to add a webform I can select
right click add new item select the
webform and let's call you know page in
electronics folder so let's give that
name so page in electronics folder let's
click Add so we have that platform there
another thing that we want to do we want
to add the data countries in countries
dot XML so let's add those folders so
I'm going to right click on the project
add let's call this data and to this we
need to add another folder and let's
call that countries so add that folder
and then to this let's add countries dot
XML add a new item I want to add an XML
file
let's call this country's dot XML okay
in this country's dot XML let me copy
and paste a sample XML that I have here
okay so if you look at this it simply
displays the country ID and country name
that's data about the countries okay now
let's see how we can use the server dot
map up map path method now if you look
at this the server dot map path method
returns the physical part for a given
virtual part this method can be used in
several different ways depending on the
characters that we use in the virtual
path so let's say if you look at this I
have a page here a page in electronics
folder and if you look at the hierarchy
of this page its present you know in
electronics folder which is presented
categories and this folder is present in
the root directory of the project sample
web is the root directory okay now
within this page if I go to the aspx
page and let's use this in a response
tort write method to write something
onto the webform and I'm going to say
response dot right and we are using this
server dot map path method and if you
look at the method in you know the help
text here it returns the physical path
that corresponds to the specified
virtual path on the web server
so to the map path method and just
passing in dot okay so let's see what
that returns and then just to have you
know n HTML break I am using the break
there okay so now let's run this look at
this you know pay attention here page in
electronics folder this is present at
this part now when I use when I pass dot
to the server dot map path method look
at that it gives me the current
directory of the executing page so if
you look at this page in electronics
folder dot aspx its present in
electronics folder which is present in
categories so electronics categories
which is present in sample web sample
web is the root directory here
okay and rest of the part that we get so
the dot symbol gives you the you know
the physical part of the current
executing page since this page is an
electronics folder you know you will get
the complete part until that current
folder when you use the dot symbol okay
now let's say I want to get to the
categories folder then how do I do that
now you are in the current directory the
current directory is electronics but I
want to get to the categories folder the
parent directory of the executing page
so how do we do that you can use dot dot
for that let's see that so if I pass in
here dot dot and if I run this now it
gives us the parent directory of the
current execution page so I get to the
categories page okay now how do I get to
the root directory of my web application
project the root directory is sample web
so how do I get to the root directory
there are actually two ways to get to
the root directory and the commonly used
way to get to the root directory of a
web application is to use a character
called a tilde character okay
so let's copy and paste this so this is
the tilde character okay so the stilt
character resolves the virtual path to
the root directory of the web
application project and we know the root
directory of this web application
project is C colon backslash sample web
backslash sample web so if we run this
now you should see that root directory
so remember these three symbols you know
are commonly used dot to get to the
current directory of the executing page
tour thought to get to the parent
directory and till the character to get
to the root directory of the web
application project another way to
actually get to the root direct you know
currently we are two levels deep in the
hierarchy of the folders and as far as
this page is concerned now if I want to
get to the root directory the simplest
way is to use the tilde character or
another way you know we know that if we
use dot
we get to the current directory but
whereas if we use dot dot we get to the
parent directory and then if I use dot
dot again I get to the parent directory
of this directory which is nothing but
the root directory of the web
application project so to get to the
root directory from this page I can
either you still character or I can use
dot dot for slash dot dot ok so if we
run this now you should see the root
directly the last you know statement
should also give you the root directory
as expected ok but remember you know
tilde symbol is usually used to you know
get to the root directory of the web
application project so as you can see
here server dot map path dot you know
returns the current physical directory
of the page that you are running
whereas dot dot returns the parent
directory of the executing page where it
still returns the physical path of the
true directory of the application in our
next video session we will actually look
at a practical application of this you
know server dot map path method now we
have this countries dot XML will try to
read the data and display that in a
drop-down list from a page that we are
here and then this page in root
directory dot aspx now if you look at
this another simple example here if you
go to the you know page in root
directory this page is already in the
root directory okay so on this page if
you exactly copy paste this code let's
try to copy paste this code ok we know
that dot will give the current directory
dot dot will give the parent directory
now this directory does hat doesn't have
a parent directory because this is the
root directory of the web application
project outside the scope of the
application web application project you
cannot navigate that's why this line
will threw an error you know let's
actually run this application and see
what's going to happen this will
actually throw an error at this point of
time because you are already in the root
directory and you are trying to navigate
out of the root directory that's why you
get that error
okay but whereas let's comment that now
tilt will always give us the root
directory no matter you know how deep
you are in the hierarchy it will give
you the root directory so this works
fine but again this one is going to
throw an error because dot dot will try
to resolve to the parent directory we
are already in the root directory beyond
that we cannot navigate that's why we
get an error if we have this line so
let's comment that but dot should give
you the current directory current
directory is nothing with the root
directory and tilde will give you the
root directory so now if we run that in
both the cases we should get the root
directory of our application okay on
this slide you can find resources for
asp.net c-sharp and sequel server
interview questions that's it for today
