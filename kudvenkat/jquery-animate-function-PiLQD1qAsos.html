this video we'll discuss how to do
animations in jQuery using jQuery
animate function animate function lets
us animate CSS properties let's
understand this function with a few
examples look at the example here were
calling animate function on this
development at the moment this animate
function has got two parameters the
first parameter is a JSON object and
this JSON object at the moment has got
one CSS property font size and we are
setting that property to 50 pixels the
second parameter is the duration for
animation we specified duration in
milliseconds so what is this animate
call on this development going to do
this is actually going to animate this
development while changing the font size
from its initial size to a size of 50
pixels so that change is going to happen
or a duration of 2,000 milliseconds as
an animation let's look at this in
action let's flip to visual studio so
here we have a development it has got
some text we also have a button element
when we click this button that's when we
want to animate this development so
within our jQuery ready function let's
find the button element by ID so when we
click the button we want to call a
function and within this function we
want to animate the development so let's
find the development by ID so the ID of
the development is my dev and we want to
animate that so I'm going to use this
animate function now the first parameter
is going to be the JSON object with CSS
property that we want to change the CSS
property that we want to change is font
size and we want to change the font size
to 50 pixels and we want that change to
happen over a duration of 2,000
milliseconds so let's save the changes
reload this page and look at this when
we click the animate button look at what
happens to the font size it slowly
increases from its initial size to a
size of 50 pixels and that change
happens over a duration of 2,000
milliseconds
so here is the syntax for animate
function notice that it has got four
parameters out of these four parameters
the first parameter is the required one
the rest three are optional so the first
parameter is going to be the json object
where the CSS properties that we want to
change you could have one or more CSS
properties within that json object the
second parameter is the duration
duration for animation we specify that
in milliseconds this parameter is
optional if we don't specify it the
default value is going to be 400 so at
the moment we are explicitly specifying
the duration as 2,000 milliseconds if we
don't specify that parameter explicitly
then the default is going to be 400
milliseconds that means when we click
the button notice the font size
increases in a duration of 400
milliseconds the third parameter is
easing this parameter specifies the
easing function to use for the
transition the default is swing but we
could also use linear we'll discuss in
detail about this easing parameter in
just a bit
the last parameter is complete this
parameter specifies the function that we
want to call when the animation is
complete so what is easing easing is a
technique where the speed and our
direction of animation are changed while
the animation is in progress
easing can make the animation start off
slow and gradually speed up or start up
fast
and gradually slow down and a whole host
of other effects the difference between
linear and swing easing is very subtle
the URL that we have here are less all
the eases that are available if you're
using jQuery UI so if you visit that URL
you can actually see all the easing that
are available so notice the first one is
linear the second one is swing the
difference between these two is very
subtle in fact to a human I look at that
the difference between these two
animations is impossible and not to find
out with a human eye but if you look at
this easing right here and I look at
that this is going to start off slowly
and then gradually speed up okay so
these are the different teasing's that
are available if you
using jQuery UI now let's look at
another example now here is what we want
to do look at this when I mouse over
this image the height and width slowly
increases and onmouseout it gets back to
its original height and width and that
happens as an animation so let's see how
to do this animation using jQuery
animate function so we're going to make
use of this tulips image for this so I'm
going to get rid of all this HTML let's
use an image element let's give it an ID
let's call this my image let's give it a
height of 100 pixels with also hundred
and let's set the source of the image to
images 4/2 lips and within our jQuery
ready function let's find that image by
ID so my image now we want to associate
mouse over and mouse out even handlers
and I'm going to do that using it is an
object so mouse over you want to call a
function similarly onmouseout we want to
call a different function alright so
what do we want to do one mouse over
onmouseover what we want to set the
height and width of the image to 400
pixels okay now if we want to do that we
could even use the CSS function in fact
let's use CSS function and see what's
going to happen so I'm going to use this
keyword to refer to that image element
and let's use the CSS function now we
want to set two CSS properties height
and width so I'm going to use this JSON
object and the first property is going
to be height we want to set that to 400
similarly width to 400 and we want to do
you know almost a similar thing but we
want to reduce the height and width 200
pixels on Mouse out okay so let's save
the changes reload this page look at
this when I mouse over the height and
width is increased to 400 pixel
and on mouseout it gets back to its
original height and width but that
happens instantly it doesn't happen as
an animation right so if you want to
increase the height in width as an
animation then instead of using CSS use
animate right so animate the increase in
height and width and we want that
animation to happen let's say for
example or a period of three seconds
let's do the same thing on Mouse out and
we want that animation to happen over a
period of three seconds so let's reload
the page look at this onmouseover now it
happens as an animation one Mouse out it
gets back to its original height and
width so at the moment we are using two
parameters of this you know animate
function the JSON object with the
required CSS properties the duration for
the animation the third parameter is the
easing function that you want to use you
could date the use linear or swing and
the last parameter is the callback
function let's say we have this function
here let's call this animation complete
and all we want this function to do is
alert the message when the animation is
complete saying animation completed okay
so this is a callback function we want
to call animation complete okay and we
are associating that only with
mouse-over okay so let's save the
changes reload this page and look at
this onmouseover it increases the height
and wealth and as soon as the animation
is complete look at that we get the
alert animation completed once I click
OK on that and on Mouse out it gets back
to its original height and wealth and
upon completing that animation you know
on mall so we get the alert button Mouse
out we don't get the alert and that's
basically because on Mouse odd we
haven't specified the callback function
right
now let's look at one more example and
here is what we want to do look at this
when I click on this image now we have a
little animation going on so let's see
how to do this animation using jQuery
animate function so we're going to use
the same image for this example so I'm
going to leave that image element there
I'm going to get rid of all this HTML I
mean all the steakley code alright now
when we click on this image what's
happening we're actually changing the
position of the image element now keep
in mind by default all HTML elements are
static and you know we cannot change the
position if you want to change the
position you have to explicitly set the
CSS position property okay either to
relative fixed at absolute so that's the
first thing we need to do so let's go
and set position CSS property to
absolute and we want that animation to
happen when we click the image so when
we click the image we want to call the
function so within this function we want
to animate that image element so I'm
going to use this keyword to refer to
that image element and let's use animate
that will bring this to the next line
and we want to use a JSON object the
property that I want to change is left
property and I want to set that to 300
let's actually make in a couple of more
calls to this animate function okay so
I'm going to remove the semicolon from
here so we are chaining the animate
function together
okay so let's format this a bit so we
want to set left position to 300 and
then top to 300 left to maybe 10 and
then finally talk to 10 okay so to do
that animation this is the code that we
need so
save the changes and look at this in
action so this is our HTML page one
reload this page and look at this when I
click on the image so 300 300 so 300 on
the Left 300 on the top and then when it
comes here now the top is 10 pixels on
the left it is 10 pixels okay so
basically when we click you know it's
going to call this animate function on
the left side it's going to have 300
pixels so that's why it pushes the image
300 pixels to the right and then it's
going to do this animation on the top is
going to have 300 pixels that means it
will push it down and then left 10
pixels so it's going to come back and
then finally on the top 10 pixels that
means it will go up leaving 10 pixels on
the top so on the top now we have 10 on
the Left we have 10 okay so basically in
this example the thing that we have to
notice is you know the calls
there are several calls to animate
function and we have changed them
together so by default what's going to
happen it's going to you know all these
calls are going to be placed in a queue
and they will be executed one after
another in series rather than executing
all of them simultaneously in parallel
that's the default behavior thank you
for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
