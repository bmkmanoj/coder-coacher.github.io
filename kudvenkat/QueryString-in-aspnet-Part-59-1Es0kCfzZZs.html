venket this is Pat 59 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll discuss
about query strings in asp.net before
continuing with the session I strongly
recommend to watch parts 56 57 and 58 of
this video series in asp.net there are
different techniques to send data from
one wave form to another we have
discussed about cross page post back and
context or handler objects in the
previous sessions of this video series
in this session we'll discuss about
query strings the rest of the techniques
which include cookies session state and
application state will be discussed in
the subsequent video sessions now let's
look at a simple example using query
strings to send data from web form 1 to
web form - I have an asp.net web
application project here which has got
web form one and wave form 2 on web form
1 I have two text box controls where the
user can enter their name and email and
once they click this button go to
webform to the user will be navigated to
web form 2 dot aspx and on this wave
form I have to label controls which
display the entered name and the email
now let's double click this button
control to get the event handler
generated and I'm going to use response
dot a redirect technique to move the
user from webform 1 to waveform two so I
want to navigate the user to waveform 2
dot aspx so double quote till the
symbols till the symbol indicates the
root directory of the web application
project within the root directory I have
a webform with name wave form 2 dot aspx
okay now what our query strings query
strings are actually name value pairs
okay that can be appended to the URL of
the page that we want to navigate to and
to indicate the beginning of the query
string you know we use query string so -
the name of the waveform that we want to
navigate to
I am appending question mark so question
mark indicates the beginning of the
query string and then you can give your
query string any meaningful name that
you want since I am using a query string
to move
the name of the user you can call it
name or I'm calling here in my example
username so username is equal to so this
is the name of the query string and the
value where is the value for this query
string variable coming from it's coming
from
txt name textbox dot txt okay so that's
the first query string now it's possible
to have more than one query string send
from one wave form to another
now the first query string is indicated
by the question mark okay and then if
you want to append more query strings to
the URL then you use the ampersand
symbol so plus double quotes again and
percent this indicates the beginning of
another query string variable now what
else I want to send from wave form 1 to
wave form to email as well so I'm going
to say user email is equal to and that's
again the name of the query string
variable and where is the value coming
from the value is coming from txt email
text box that's it so all we have done
until now to the wave form that we want
to navigate to be used a question mark
indicate the beginning of a query string
that's the name of the query string
variable and the value is coming from
txt name textbox and then this is
another query string which is in the we
are appending another query string using
the ampersand symbol and then the value
for that is coming from txt email this
way you can append as many query strings
as you want but then keep in mind there
is a limit on the number of query
strings that we can have in the URL so
there's a limit on the length so
obviously if you have too many fields
that you want to send as part of using
the query strings then we cannot do that
ok alright so that's the URL so once the
user clicks you know he will be
navigated to web form to dot aspx and
then in the URL there will be this
variable username with the value and
then user a email with the value now the
next task is to actually read that value
from the URL and display it on these
label controls on webform to dot aspx
and to read a query string
variable we can use the request object
so we are using the request object dot
there is a query strength property so
request object dot query string and to
read query strings you know there are
two ways you can use the integral index
ax you know look at that or I can use a
string you know the name of the query
string now using the name of the query
string is more readable rather than
using the integral index a so I'm going
to use the name so the name is going to
be user name and what do we want to do
with that we want to display that in the
label name so label name the text is
equal to that and along the same lines
we want to retrieve user email query
string so user email and I want to
display that in label email that's all
it has got okay so now let's go ahead
and run that so now we are moving the
values that we entered on webform one
that's name and email to waveform to dot
aspx using query strings so I'm going to
enter the name for example let us say
Sam is the name and presume at presume
techcom is the email okay so now when I
click go to webform to notes the URL in
the URL along with the page that I want
to navigate to I have the question mark
which indicates the beginning of the
query string that's the first query
string name and the value for that the
next query string with an ampersand
symbol that's indeed that indicates the
beginning of another query string and
then the value for that and then what we
are doing on waveform 2 we are using the
request object query string property to
read the values from those respective
query string variables okay excellent so
now let's look at some of the points to
remember about
query strings query strings are name
value pairs why do we say their name
value pairs because you have a query
string variable name and a value query
string variable name and a value so
their name value pairs query strings is
a very common way to send data from one
web form to another okay in real time we
use query strings a lot for example
there might be a grid view control on
one web form and then we
to displace the list of customers or
employees and then once I click on the
name of the employee you know maybe I
will move to the next webform and then
we load the data I'm in the complete
details of that employee based on their
ID and then display their details in in
the next waveform so we move the
employee ID from one waveform to another
waveform query strings are appended to
the page URL and the question mark
indicates the beginning of a query
string and its value and it's possible
to use more than one query string the
first query string is specified using
the question mark subsequent query
string can be appended to the URL using
the ampersand symbol there is a limit on
the query string length
hence query strings cannot be used to
send very long data query strings are
visible to the user hands should not be
used to send sensitive information
unless encrypted so you know query
strings appear in clear text format so
they should definitely not be used to
send you know confidential information
like credit card numbers passwords etc
to read the query string value use a
request objects query string property
that's what we have done on webform to
dot aspx to read the query string value
on the destination page we are using the
request objects query string property
and then you can either use that the
name of the query string or the in the
integer index for example instead of
user name because we know in the URL the
first query string is username and the
second query string is user email so
here within the code instead of username
I can say you know zero and then one for
the next query string okay so now for
example if we run this as it stands
let's close that browser window let me
run this when the wave form loads you
know we can enter the name and the email
but on the destination now we are using
the integral index instead of the name
of the query string but using the names
of the query strings is suggested
because they are more readable so go to
webform to look at that I get
math expected so we use the request
objects query string property and
ampersand symbol if you look at the URL
here this ampersand symbol in the URL
has got a meaning it is used to separate
query string
you know query strings if you have
multiple query strings ampersand is used
to separate them but then let's say on
my web form I enter the name as let's
say for example Sam and Tom that's the
name of the user now when I say good
waveform to look at what's going to
happen it says Sam and look at that it
displays Tom as the email but if you
look at their form - what did I expect
I expect test as my email but look at
that it displays Tom that's because look
at what's going to happen username is
equal to Sam and then the space that I
entered if you look at that Sam there is
a space space is now encoded to
percentage 20 and then there's the
ampersand symbol if you remember
ampersand symbol indicates the beginning
of another query string and if you look
at our code what we are doing on the
destination page we are saying request
our query string or first one so this is
the first query string and this is the
second query string okay so now it is
considering Tom as the second query
string value because there is an
ampersand and look at that just before
storm there is a slight space and that's
coming as percent age 20 that's how it
is encoded and then Tom so that's
percentage 20 which is nothing but space
and Tom it's treating both of them as
the value for the next query string
parameter which is not true because what
we wanted was we wanted to treat
ampersand as a value as a value for
username query string okay so how do we
properly encode them so to properly
encode ampersand symbol look at that
ampersand symbol is used to concatenate
two query strings so if you want to send
ampersand as a value for the query
string there are two ways one is
basically you can use the server dot URL
encode method let's see how to use that
so when we send them on the source web
form I'm going to say so
/ dot there is a method called URL
encode which will encode the value that
you enter into the text box and
similarly I'm going to do the same thing
for the email so server dot URL encode
and then now let's run the web form and
see what's going to happen now what's
going to happen when we enter you know
ampersand as the value of one of the
query string parameters within the text
boxes look at that I'm going to enter
some Sam and Tom and then maybe email at
email s email so when I click this go to
wave form to look at that now it's
displaying as expected
that's because look at that it's
properly encoding that Sam the space is
encoded as plus and the ampersand symbol
is encoded as percentage twenty six so
that's how you are L encode method is
encoding the ampersand symbol and then
on the destination page it's
automatically decoding that and
displaying it as expected Sam and Tom
email so now it's working as expected so
one way to encode the URL is to use
server dot URL encode the other way is
to simply replace a percentage I mean
the ampersand symbol with percentage
twenty six that's we are manually
encoding the string there so what I can
basically do here is txt name dot txt
dot replace so that's a string function
and what we want to replace we want to
replace ampersand with percentage twenty
six that's the encoded value for M
percent so percentage 26 and we can do
the same thing for the email as well so
instead of server dot URL encode I'm
going to say text email dot text dot
replace and I'm going to replace
ampersand with
percent age 26 so percent age 26 that's
it so let's go ahead and run this as it
stands but personally I prefer using
server dot URL encode over replacing you
know the ampersand symbol with
percentage 26 so let's say Sam and Tom
and email as test I click go to waveform
2 and it works as expected because it's
replacing that ampersand with percentage
26 okay on this slide you can find
resources for asp.net c-sharp and sequel
server interview questions that's it for
today thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
