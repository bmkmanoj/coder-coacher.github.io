venket this is part 75 of asp.net video
series in part 73 of this video series
we have discussed about logging
exceptions to the Windows Event Viewer
in this session we'll discuss about
logging exceptions to a database table
in fact first we'll look at the example
that we used in part 73 that logs
exceptions to the Windows Event Viewer
we will then rewrite that example to
actually log the exceptions to a
database table let's flip to visual
studio I have webform 1 dot aspx and on
this waveform we have a grid view
control here when the webform one loads
up within the page load event we are
creating an instance of the data set
object and then we are invoking the read
XML method which will read countries dot
XML file and then load the data into the
data set the data set is then set as the
data source for the grid view control
and we are calling data bind method
finally but then in this project we
don't have countries dot XML file so
obviously when we run this we get a file
not found exception and we are not
handling this exception within the page
load even procedure so it gets
propagated till the webform level that's
the page level and at the page level we
don't have page underscore error even
handler so it's going to get further
propagated till the application level
and at the application level within
global dot a si X 5 we have application
underscore error event handler which
gets invoked and here within this
application underscore error event
procedure we are getting a reference to
the last exception that has occurred
using server dot get last error method
and if you look at the return type of
this method it is returning an exception
object back and we are storing that in
this exception reference variable and we
are checking ok if the exception is not
null meaning if the exact exception has
occurred then pass that exception object
to this log method this log method is
going to log that to the event viewer
that's what we have discussed about in
part 73 once the exception is logged we
clear the error and then we will
redirect the user to errors dot aspx
page and if you look at errors dot aspx
b it's a
handed aspx page which jet with just
some HTML there which lets the user know
that there is an application error okay
so now let's look at the log method that
we have written in part 73 of this video
series so let me click on go to
definition so this is the log logger
class and if you look at this class its
present in logger dot CS file that's the
class file we added and then within that
class we have the static method log
which takes in the exception object so
the exception object is coming from
global dot a si X okay so what is the
log method going to do with that
exception object now an exception can
have inner exceptions as well and we
discussed about inner exceptions in in
the previous sessions of this video
series so when we have an inner
exception we want to be able to retrieve
that as well that's why we are using a
while loop do-while loop here so what
happens when the exception object comes
in we are creating an an instance of
string builder object and then we are
retrieving the exception type exception
message and the stack trace okay and
then we are appending newline characters
at appropriate places so that the
message is properly formatted alright
now once we have the exception message
appended till this tag trace then what
are we doing we are retrieving the inner
exception out of that exception object
and assigning that to the exception
object itself and then we are checking
okay is there an inner exception because
since we are assigning the inner
exception to this exception object when
we say ok is X is exception not equal to
null we are actually checking if there
is an inner exception yes if it's not
now then what happens it further enters
this loop again and then retrieves the
message stacktrace etc and then it opens
that to the stringbuilder object ok now
if there is no inner exception then it
exits of this loop out of this loop and
then what are we doing here this is the
piece of code that actually logs that
message to the event viewer okay so the
first line checks okay do we have the
source presume techcom if yes
and create an instance of the event log
class and then set the source and
finally invoke the right entry method
and to this method we are passing the
stringbuilder object and we are
converting that to string and then we
are specifying we want to lock that
entry in the intent viewer as an error
so this is what we have seen in part 73
of this video series but in this session
we are going to discuss about how to
lock this exception to a database table
instead of this event viewer so the only
change that we need to do here is we
need to get rid of this code and then we
need to create a database table so
obviously let's flip to sequel server
management studio
so first let's create a table that can
law store the exception information and
this table is going to contain three
columns the ID and if you look at the ID
it's an integer column and it's going to
be the primary key and it's an identity
column again if you don't know what an
identity column as we have discussed
about creating tables creating identity
columns creating stored procedures in
the sequel server video session I'm
going to have that link within the
description of this video so that you
can refer to sequel server video series
okay so we are creating this ID column
and then the date column basically this
tells us when the exception has occurred
and then the exception message itself
and the datatype for that is n we're
care of max so let's go ahead and create
this table execute command completed
successfully refresh the tables folder
and we should see it there alright so
the next step is to actually create a
stored procedure that can then be
invoked by our dotnet application and
pass this exception message to that
stored procedure which can then in add
the exception to this table and to do
that we need to create the stored
procedure so I have the code for that so
let me copy the code for that and again
this is going to be a very simple stored
procedure so if you look at that one
what is the stored procedure doing if
you look at this table this table has
got three columns ID date and exception
message ID is an identity column so we
don't have to supply a value for that we
only need to provide the value for date
and exception message columns
and it's look at this stored procedure
it's exactly doing the same thing insert
into TBL log for these two columns a
date column and exception message column
pass the values for date we don't have
to pass a date from the application we
can compute that within this stored
procedure itself so I'm using this get
date I'm invoking this get date method
that's going to retrieve the current
date and time and then pass that to this
date column and exception message is
coming in as an input parameter to the
stored procedure that's it so let's
create the stored procedure now so
command complete successfully the stored
procedure should have been created now
all we have to do is write the ad or net
code that invokes that stored procedure
okay and obviously this equal
connections equal command classes are
present in system door data dot sequel
client namespace so let's import that
and then within web config file we have
the connection string okay and if you
look at the connection string name it's
DB connection string and the connection
string itself data sources dot
indicating local installation of
sequence server and the database is
sample so within sequel server
management studio the database name is
sample and I'm using integrated security
meaning windows authentication and then
the provider is systems or data dot
sequel client meaning they are using
sequel server okay so we obviously need
to read this connection string from web
config file and to do that we can use
configuration manager class that is
present in system configuration
namespace so using a system
configuration and here we are going to
read the connection string first so
connection string is equal to we are
going to use configuration manager dot
connection strings off and we need to
specify the connection string property
the name of the connection string and
then use the connection string property
to retrieve the connection string from
web config file the next step is to
create the sequel connection object so
sequel connection con is equal to new
sequel connection and we need to pass in
the connection string so we are going to
pass that and then next create the
sequel command object so sequel command
CMD is equal to new sequel command
and to this constructor we need to
specify the command text in our case the
command text is going to be the stored
procedure SP insert log so let me copy
the name of that and then the next
parameter that we have to specify to the
command object is the connexion upon
which we want to execute this command in
this case it's going to be connection
object and then the most important thing
here is this command is actually a
stored procedure so you'll have to tell
that to the command object and how do we
tell that using command type property so
command type is stored procedure and the
next thing is we have to create the
parameter because this stored procedure
actually expects an input parameter and
the name of the parameter is at
exception message so let's copy that and
let's create the parameter and how do we
create a parameter using sequel
parameter class and we are going to call
that parameter is equal to new sequel
parameter and the constructor of this
class requires two parameters the name
of the parameter and the value for it
the name of the parameter is going to be
at exception message and where is the
value coming from the value is actually
coming from this string builder
exception message object so we are going
to pass that and since that is a string
so let's convert that to string so we
have the parameter next we need to
associate this parameter to the command
object using parameters collection so
commander parameters that add the
parameter object that we have just
created and finally open the connection
and since this stored procedure is an
insert stored procedure we can use
command dot execute non query again we
have discussed about ad or dotnet in
detail within the ad or dotnet video
series again I'll have the link for the
ad or dotnet video series within the
description of this video so if you want
to check back you do dotnet video series
you can use that link so let me close
the connection now that's it we are done
so now all we have done here is written
some ad or dotnet code to take that
exception message pass it to the stored
procedure SP insert log and this SP
insert log will add that to this TBL log
table that's it we have logged the
exception to a database table let me go
ahead and run the set at this point as
you might expect when the page loads it
tries to read that XML file which is not
present so we get a file not found
exception within global dot is ax we are
retrieving that exception logging to the
database and redirecting the user to
this error page application errors dot
aspx you can't see that in the URL
because we are using server dot transfer
server dot transfer will not update the
address in the URL okay so let's go
ahead and check if the exception is
actually logged in the table so I'm
going to say select star from the table
name is TBL log look at that I have the
exception object so let me copy that
open a notepad and paste it so you can
see that so we have the exception there
HTTP unhandled exception and there
should be a file not found exception as
well okay so we have seen how to log the
exceptions to a database table now if
you look at this we are handling
exceptions you know we are logging the
exception in global dot AS ax it turns
out that depending on what you are
trying to do with within your
application you may want to handle
exceptions where they have occurred and
display meaningful error message to the
user in which case you'll just put a try
block and then within the catch block
you can actually log the exception and
then display a meaningful error message
to the end user instead of redirecting
him to the generic error page for
example maybe if the file is not present
my application requirement is that I
want to show the error message to the
user on that file itself in the label
control so if you look at this webform
one along with the grid view control I
have a label here label errors now I
want to display a message you know
saying that the file is not present so
that the user can put the file at the
required location and then try to access
that okay if that's the requirement I
can handle the exception within the
catch block so within the catch block
I'm ik catching the exception and then
I'm checking ok if the exception is file
not found exception then what are we
doing we are setting the text of that
label errors two countries dot X M
is not found okay otherwise if it is any
other type of exception we're actually
saying an unknown problem has occurred
please contact the administrator now
irrespective of whatever is the
exception let's say I want to log the
exception before we display we can use
the logger class so logger dot log and
to this method all you have to do is
pass that exception so here they're
handling the exception where it has
occurred rather than allowing it to
propagate till the application level and
then handling it that they're at that
level so it again depends on your
application requirement what exactly you
want to do depending on that you know
you either handle it where it has
occurred or you will allow it to
propagate till the application level and
handle it there so let me go ahead and
run this now as you might expect now it
wouldn't be redirected to errors dot
aspx page instead on webform one dot
aspx it's going to show that message
within that label control and then now
if we go back to the database table it
should have logged that exception again
so I see that file not found exception
here okay so in this video session we
have seen how to log exceptions to a
database table in the next video session
what we are going to do is we are going
to modify this logger class and then in
such a way that the user can configure
where they want to log the exceptions
within web config file and depending on
that it will automatically log the
exceptions either to the Event Viewer to
the database table or to both it all
depends on user configuration let's see
how to do that customization in the next
session of our video on this slide you
can find resources for asp.net c-sharp
and sequel server interview questions
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
