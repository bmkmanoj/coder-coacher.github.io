tutorial in this video we'll discuss how
easy it is to calculate running total in
sequel server 2012 and later versions
will use this employees table on the
left for the examples in this video
based on this table we want to write a
query which is going to retrieve name
gender celery columns in addition to
these three columns we also want this
running total column which is going to
keep track of running total of the
salary column notice this running total
columns thoughts are for the first
salary which is 5000 when we add 4,500
to that it is 9500 when we add 5500 to
9,500 it is 15,000 and it goes on like
that now let's see how easy it is to
compute this running total column using
sequel server some aggregate function
along with the over Clause let's flip to
sequel server management studio so from
this employees table we want name gender
salary and then the running total to
compute the running total let's use the
sum aggregate function we are going to
use this function on salary column and
then let's use the over Clause followed
by that order by and then let's sort the
data by the ID column and then I'm going
to call this running total now the first
question that comes to our mind is why
am I not using salary column in the
order by Clause there is a specific
reason for that which we'll discuss in
just a bit
for now let's execute this query and see
what we get notice we get the running
total column and look at the values in
this column it starts off with the first
salary which is 5,000 when we add 4,500
to that it is 9,500 when we add 5,000
planned it to that it is 15,000 and it
goes on like that at the moment we are
not using partition by Clause so the
data in this table is not partitioned in
any way we have this gender column
so let's partition the data by gender
column to do that I'm going to use
partition by gender let's execute this
query and see what we get the first
thing to notice here is that we
get two partitions the first one is
female employees partition and the next
one is male employees partition and look
at what happens to the running total
column within these two partitions so
within the female employees partition
the first salary is 5500 so it starts
off with that when we add photos into
that it is 9500 when we add 5,000 to
that it is 14,500 and when we add 7,000
to 14,500 it is 20 1,500 and look at
what happens when the partition changes
from female to male it calculates
running total for the male employees
partition separately so the first salary
within male employees partition is 5,000
so it starts off with that when we add
photos and find it to that it is 9000
find it when we add 3,500 to that it is
13,000 so it's not easy to compute
running total whether you have
partitions are whether for the entire
table now let's answer this question why
are we not using salary column in the
order by Clause to answer that first
let's look at the raw data that we have
in our employees table so select star
from employees and look at this ID
column this is the primary key column
for this table so the data in this
column is guaranteed to be unique now
let's sort the data by salary column now
if you notice these three roots right
here notice that all these three
employees have got the same salary so
there are duplicate values and if you
look at these two employees you know
they have 5,500 as you know the salary
for both of those employees now let's
see what's going to happen when we use
salary column in the order by Clause so
we know that the salary column has got
duplicate values and if we use that
column which has got duplicate values
with the order by Clause let's see
what's going to happen to keep things
simple I'm going to get rid of this
partition by Clause from here so let's
execute this query and see what we get
so look at the running total column
it starts off with the first salary
which is 3,500 when we had 4,000 to that
it is 7,500 when we add photos and find
it to that it is 12,000 and when we had
5,000 to 12,000 it should actually be
17,000 but look at what we are getting
27,000 how is that possible that's
possible because what it's doing here is
it's adding these three five thousands
that is five thousand plus five thousand
plus five thousand which is fifteen
thousand to twelve thousand and that is
what is giving us this twenty seven
thousand and look at that it gives the
twenty seven thousand for these three
rules where we have those duplicates and
then look at that
next we have two more rules with same
salary which is five thousand five
hundred so five thousand five hundred
plus five thousand five hundred that is
eleven thousand when we add eleven
thousand to twenty seven thousand it is
thirty eight thousand and that's what we
get for these two rows so this may not
be what you want you know according to
your business needs if that's the case
you know it's always better to use a
column that has called unique values in
the order by Clause that's the reason
why I have used ID column along with
order by so when we use the ID column I
get the running total that a expects so
whenever I add in our 4,500 to 5,000 I
get nine thousand five hundred when we
add five thousand five hundred to nine
thousand five hundred we get fifteen
thousand and it goes on like that so it
maintains a true running total so here
we have the partitions example and here
we have the reasons of why we are not
using you know the salary column that
has got duplicate values along with the
order by clause when computing running
total thank you for listening and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
