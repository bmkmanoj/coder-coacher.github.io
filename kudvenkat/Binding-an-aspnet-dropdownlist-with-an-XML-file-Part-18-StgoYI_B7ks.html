am rancor this is part 18 of asp.net
video series in this session we'll learn
about binding a drop-down list to an XML
file before continuing with the session
I strongly recommend to watch part 16
and 17 of this video series in part 17
of this video series we have discussed
about binding a drop-down list to a
database table in this session we'll
learn about binding a drop-down list to
an XML file just like how we can use a
database table to store data we can use
an XML file as well to store data for
example here I have this country's dot
XML file which has got countries route
XML element and within countries we have
got country elements and within each
country element
I have country ID and country name and
if you look at the sample data we have
got four countries India US Australia
and UK and if you look at the drop-down
list on the right hand side we are
displaying all these four countries
within the drop-down list in addition to
these four countries I also have another
list item in the drop-down list which is
select it's not present in the XML file
so where is this coming from how to add
this element to the drop-down list we'll
look at that in a demo let's flip to
visual studio so the first thing that we
have to do is to add the XML file to
arrays B dotnet web application project
to do that go to solution Explorer right
click on your project and select add new
item and from the add new item dialog
box select XML file give that XML file a
meaningful name in our case let's call
that countries dot XML click Add so that
adds the XML file to to your asp.net web
application project but make sure you
right-click on the project not on the
solution because if you right-click on
the solution select add you will get an
option to add a project to a solution
because a solution is a collection of
projects all right so within this XML
file we need to add countries data just
to save some time in typing I have this
in a notepad so let's copy that from
there and paste it here so we have the
XML file ready now we need to display
this XML data within a drop-down list so
let's flip to
the webform let's drag and drop a
drop-down list control onto the webform
right click on the webform select view
code let's go to the code-behind page in
the page load we want to read from that
XML file and display that within the
drop-down list so to read the data from
the XML file the easiest way is to use
the data set object so we have the data
set objects so data set D s is equal to
new data set and by the way this data
set object is present in system data
name space so make sure you use this
using statement alright so once I have
this data set object this data set
object has got a read XML method now
this method is capable of reading the
XML data from an XML file and then it
loads the data into the data set but
then obviously if it has to read data
from an XML file it needs to know the
path of the XML file so if you look at
the intellisense
here you know the parameter that it
expects is the name of the file from
which you want to read the data so in
our case the name of the file is
country's XML so let's copy the name and
pass that and if you look at this
obviously file name is a string so we
enclose that within double quotes ok so
with this line we have the XML data in
the data set now once we have the data
in the data set it's pretty simple to
bind it to the drop-down list all you
have to do is drop down list 1 dot
datasource is equal to data set and drop
down list 1 dot data bind ok cool but
then another important thing that we
have to do is we have to specify the
data text field and data value field
because if you look at the XML data we
have got country ID and country name so
which you know value do you want to show
in the drop-down list and which value
you want to actually hold as the value
of the list item object ok how do we
specify that you saying the data text
field and data
you feel the properties of the drop-down
list object so drop-down list one dot
data text feel is equal to what is the
data text field that we want to display
the country name so let's copy that
let's paste it here and then the next
thing that we have to specify is the
data value field and data value field is
nothing but the country ID so let's copy
that and paste it there that's it now if
we run this it's going to break and I
will tell you why it breaks in a bed so
let's run this so it tries to read the
data from the XML file but then it will
not find that XML file look at this
could not find file if you look at the
exception system dot IO dot file not
found exception now if you look at the
path it's looking at this path do we
have the path I mean file at this path
no where is the file present if you go
to the solution Explorer right click on
the solution and say open folder in
Windows Explorer the file is actually
present the XML file is present at this
path C colon backslash a do domo
backslash a do demo because this is the
name of the solution I mean the solution
folder and this is the web application
folder so at this physical path you have
this XML file ok remember at this
physical path this is the physical path
because this path exists on this
computer ok now let me show you another
way of accessing this XML file if you
want to access this XML file let's close
this browser window first right click on
the XML file and say view in browser
look at this now the XML file shows up
in the browser window but look at the
path ok so this is your URL to access
that XML file in the browser okay so
these URLs are actually virtual paths in
the sense they don't really exist on
this computer this URL is somehow map to
this directory radio demo and then
within that it has got countries wrote
XML okay so if you look at the physical
part of that
it's this one C colon backslash video
demo backslash a do demo backslash
country start XML but this somehow got
mapped to this path so it's capable of
displaying that okay now obviously if
you have to read from that XML file what
you will have to do is you will have to
map this virtual path to a physical path
and to do that we can make use of a
method called map path okay server dot
map path and if you look at the
intellisense you know this method
returns the physical path that
corresponds to a specified virtual path
on the web server so countries dot XML
give me the actual physical part of this
file okay so this one is going to return
that physical path actually to prove
that let's assign this value to a
variable let's create a variable here
string let's call this STR physical path
will pass that there and then we will
use that variable to pass to this method
okay let's throw in a breakpoint here so
that we know what's happening when we
run the project so when we run the
project what's going to happen this
method is going to get the virtual path
and then from that virtual path it
returns the physical path and if you
remember let's go to the solution go to
the solution Explorer when I click on
the project and let's say open folder in
Windows Explorer look at that the
physical path of this file is actually
sequel and backslash a do demo backslash
a do demo backslash countries dot XML so
if you go back to visual studio look at
that it gives me the actual physical
path of that file okay now if I press f5
you should expect you know the drop-down
list shoe to show all the countries as
expected so remember the server dot map
path method is used to return the
physical path for a given virtual path
we will talk about this server dot map
path in a great detail in a later
session alright so the next thing that
we want to do is okay now if you look at
the output we have got all the countries
in the I US Australia UK those are the
four countries that we have in the XML
file and that's what we see here all
right so now let us see how to add this
select element to this drop-down list
okay
now obviously we know that a drop-down
list is a collection of list item
objects so obviously if you want another
list item object in the drop-down list
you will have to create that and add
that to the drop-down list
so how do we create a list item object
we have discussed up about this in the
previous session of this video series so
please check those parts first before
continuing with the session so let's
create the list item object so list item
Li is equal to new list item and the two
important properties I mean
parameters that we have to specify are
the text and a value okay the text that
I want to display is select and value
you know probably minus one because this
is not a country this is just a prompt
to the user to select that country
usually we use minus one later when we
actually talk about you know validation
controls you will understand why we are
using minus one because we use that as
the initial value for the required field
validator
which knows that okay the user didn't
select anything it's still select the
initial value we'll talk about that when
we actually talk about validation
control so don't worry for now this is
the text and this is the value of the
list item object and now I want to add
this to this drop-down list and to do
that simply we can call drop-down list 1
dot items dot I can use the add method
and then pass the list item object and
look at that when I pass that to the
list item object let's see what happens
when I run this obviously this drop-down
list will be bound to that data set and
then we created that list item object
and we added it but then if we look at
this it added that list item object at
the end so that's what the add method
does the add method adds the list item
object you know at the end of the list
we don't want that we want to insert
that at the beginning of this you know
list item collection so how do I do that
instead of using
and method there is another method
called insert so if you look at this
method this method takes two parameters
so obviously you want to insert this
little list item object in the
collection of list item objects you have
in the drop-down list so when you when
you are when you're using this insert
method obviously you'll have to tell at
which location do you want to insert
that I want to insert that at the
zeroeth location meaning at the top of
the collection so I pass in 0 as the
first parameter and the next parameter
is obviously the list item object that
you want to add to the drop-down list
you know items collection that's it so
now if we run this we get the output as
expected you know the Select element
shows you know in the zero x position we
just stopped on the list and then the
rest of the countries here see the only
thing to remember here is how do we read
the data from you know the XML file into
the data set we can make use of that
read XML method and to this read XML
method you will have to specify the file
path where you have the data and to do
that we are using the server dot map
path method what does this method do it
returns the physical path for a given
virtual path and obviously to add to
insert a list item at a specific
location use the insert method on this
