in this video we'll continue our
discussion on controllers in angular in
a previous video we discuss the basics
of controllers the job of the controller
is to build a model for the view the
controller does this by attaching the
model to the scope the scope object
itself is not the model it's the data
that you attach to the scope is the
model so this is the same example that
we worked with in the previous video
session here we have our controller
function to the controller function
we're passing dollar scope as the
parameter and to that Scoop object we
are attaching a message property so in
this example the scope object is not the
model it's the message property that you
are attaching to the scope object is the
model and then this model is available
in the view so within our view we're
using this data binding expression to
retrieve the model from the scope this
means the controller is not manipulating
the Dom directly thus keeping that clean
separation between the model view and
the controller so when you are writing
code for controllers one important thing
to keep in mind is that you are not
breaking that clean separation between
those three components that is the model
view and the controller the controller
should only be used for setting up the
initial state of the scope object and
adding behavior to it so far in this
video series we haven't looked at any
example that adds behavior to the scope
object we'll discuss when and why it
should we add behavior to the scope
object in a later video in this example
right here we are attaching a very
simple property message to the scope
object we can even attach complex
objects like employees customers etc now
let's look at an example of fetching a
complex object to the scope object so
for that what I'm going to do is create
a variable here I'm going to call it
employee so this is going to be our
complex object so this employee object
is going to have let's say first name
property and I'm going to initialize
that to David it's also going to have
lastname property and let's initialize
to Hastings and finally gender and let's
initialize this to male so we have a
complex object right here so what I'm
going to do now is attach this to the
scope object so dollar scope dot
employee equals the employee object so
we have attached this employee object to
the scope object now we want to retrieve
the properties that is first-name
lastname gender of the employee object
and display that within the view and to
do that we use the data binding
expressions the same idea so within our
view I'm going to use the data binding
expression
so let's first include it development so
within the dear we want to display this
literal text first name and then I'm
going to use the data binding expression
now the key that we have used to attach
the employee object to the scope object
is employee so I'm going to use the same
key or property whatever you call it so
we use employee that's our model and
that has got first name property
similarly let's include two more
developments and display last name and
gender so last name is going to come
from employee dot last name
and finally gender gender is going to
come from employee dot gender so let's
save our changes and let's go ahead and
reload this page now look at this the
view displays in a first name last name
and gender of that complex object
employee now let's understand what
happens if the controller name is
misspelled so within our script here we
have a controller and the name of the
controller is my controller and within
our HTML page so within this development
we have used this ng - controller
directive and we specify the name of our
controller again my controller so this
div knows that this controller lives
somewhere and angular is automatically
going to call that controller it creates
this employee object
attaches that to the scoop and then
within the view we're using the data
binding expression to retrieve the data
from that model in this case the
employee so everything is working is
expected now let's see what's going to
happen when I misspell the controller
name so I misspell the controller name
and I'm going to reload this page look
at that you know first of all notice the
data binding expressions they are not
evaluated they are displayed as these
and then you know there's going to be
another thing that's happening behind
the scenes an error will be produced by
angular and to look at that error launch
the developer tools and to launch the
developer tools I'm pressing f12 key I'm
using Google Chrome here and first of
all notice we have caught you know a
cross here indicating that we have
caught one error and then if you go into
the console window the error message
will be displayed so here we have the
error message but this message is not
really very readable we have got a lot
of encoding symbols within that error
message and this is a URL okay so when I
click on this URL it takes me to another
page and then on that page we can
actually see in a much readable error
message so basically it's saying
argument my controller 1 is not a
function got undefined now the first
question that comes to our mind is why
is this error message not readable that
is because we are using the minified
version of the angular script so if you
are in the development environment and
if you want you know more readable error
messages one option you have is to use
the uncompressed version of the angular
script so what you can do is go off to
analogous or click on this download
button and here you have the option to
download uncompressed version of the
angular file which I have already done I
have downloaded the angular file and
within the scripts folder notice that I
have an angular script which says
angularjs without that dot min extension
so this is the uncompressed version so
what I'm going to do now is I'm going to
remove this
script tag from there I'm going to
reference the uncompressed version okay
so let's save our changes and now I'm
going to relive the same page so let's
go here and reload this page and now
again we have that same one error and
look at the error message right now it's
more readable here argument my
controller one is not a function got
undefined so basically this is
complaining that whatever you have this
my controller one here that cannot be
resolved it cannot be found so what
happens if the controller name is
misspelled when the controller name is
misspelled two things happen and error
is raised to see the error use the
browser developer tools and the binding
expression the view that are in the
scope of the controller will not be
evaluated you know they will be
displayed as is now let's understand
what happens if a property name in the
binding expression is misspelled so
basically we misspell the controller
name and as a result of that we get an
error let's put that back to what it is
valid value and let's reload this page
now everything should fall back in place
so we get the property names as expected
no errors now let's see what's going to
happen if I misspell a property name on
the model so here we are using data
binding expression and within the data
binding expression you know gender has
got this letters G and D are now what
I'm going to do is remove the letter R
from gender property so I have
misspelled a property name of the model
now let's go ahead and reload this page
and look at that the first thing to
notice is that we don't get any error
and look at the gender property on the
view you know it's not displaying the
gender value okay so this is one of the
ways to know if the data binding
expressions are working or not you
wouldn't get any errors okay that's the
default behavior so what happens if a
property name in the binding expression
is misspelled expression evaluation in
angular is forgiving meaning if you
misspell a property name in the binding
expression
angular will not report any error it
will simply return null or undefined
that means on the view you don't see
anything and you don't get any error
either now how to create a module
controller and register that controller
with the module all in one line now if
you look at this example right here you
know we are creating a module first and
then right here
we are creating a controller and
attaching the controller to the module
so those two things are happening in one
line right here now is there a way we
can create the module create the
controller and attach that controller
with the module you know all in one line
absolutely you can do that by using
method chaining in angular so what I can
do here is you know this module function
right here is creating the module and
then I can use method chaining like this
so angular dot module is going to create
the module for us and then I'm going to
use another dot here and then use the
controller function so here I can
specify a name for my controller so the
name is going to be my controller and
then we specify our controller function
so I'm going to copy this controller
function and paste it right there let's
throw in a semicolon there and I'm going
to get rid of the rest of the code from
there all right and let's fix this model
property name here so let's save all
these changes and when we reload this
everything should still continue to work
the same way so use method chaining to
create the module create the controller
and reaches to the control over the
module all in one line thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
