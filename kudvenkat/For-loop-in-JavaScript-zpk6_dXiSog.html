in this video we'll discuss for loop in
Java scrap to understand for loop let's
write a simple program that's going to
prompt the user to enter a number for
example if the end user provides number
10 then we want this program to print
all even numbers starting from 0 till
number 10 first let's write this program
using while loop and then we'll see how
to rewrite the same example using for
loop along the way we'll look at the
differences between while and follow
here we have the program already written
using while loop notice that we are
using the prompt function to prompt the
user to enter a target number this
prompt function is going to return the
number in text format we want to convert
that to a number for that we are using
the number function and we are storing
that number in this variable target
number here we have another variable
called start which is initialized to 0
and we have the wild keyword within the
brackets we have the boolean condition
and if this condition becomes true we
are writing the value that is present
within the start variable to the
document and finally we are incrementing
the value that is present within the
start variable by 2 let's look at how
this program works when we enter number
10 so when we run the program it's going
to prompt the user to enter target
number and for example if we enter 10
within this target number variable we'll
have number 10 stored and start will
contain 0 and then it will come to this
line is 0 less than or equal to 10 the
condition is true so it goes inside the
while loop and then prints the value
that is present in the start variable at
the moment start contains 0 so it's
going to print 0 and then it will
increment the value that is present
within the start variable by 2 at this
point start variable contains 2 so it's
going to come back and check the
condition is 2 less than or equal to 10
the condition is still true it's going
to print number 2 and then increment it
by 2 again
so this process will be repeated as long
as this
boolean expression is true the moment
start variable is greater than target
number the condition will become false
and there is nothing else after the wild
block so the JavaScript program
terminates I have this exact same
program already typed within Visual
Studio let's quickly run this let's
enter number 10 as the target number
click OK we should have all even numbers
starting from 0 till 10 now there are 3
things as far as this while loop is
concerned the first thing is variable
initialization notice the initialization
of start variable is done at one place
that is outside of the while loop right
here and then the boolean condition
check the condition check is done at
another place that is within the
brackets of the while loop so here we
are checking the condition and then
updating the variable that participates
in this boolean expression so that this
condition will become false at one point
is done right here okay now what is
going to happen if we don't update this
variable in that case this condition
will never become false because start
will always be 0 and this will lead to
an infinite while loop ok
so all these three things that is
variable initialization condition check
and updating the variable that
participates in the boolean expression
are done at three different places in a
while loop now let's see how this is
going to change with a for loop with for
loop all the three things that is
variable initialization condition check
and updating the variable that
participates in the boolean expression
can be done in one place and here is the
syntax for that also remember all these
3 things are optional in a for loop
we'll look at an example of that in just
a bit first let's look at the syntax for
while loop we'll start with the for
keyword and within the brackets we'll
have all the 3 things that is variable
initialization condition check
and the expression to update the
variable that participates in the pool
in expression and then within the
brackets we'll have the statements that
we want to execute if this condition
becomes true so how does this for loop
execute first the initialization code
runs and then it checks the condition if
the condition is true it will execute
the statements that are present inside
the for loop block and after that
iteration it updates the variable I mean
this statement will be executed and then
it checks the condition again and then
if the condition is true it's going to
execute the statements the moment the
condition becomes false and it's going
to execute I mean skip the for loop and
then execute the statements that are
present after the for loop but let's see
how to rewrite the same program using
for loop so we will start with a for
keyword and within the brackets we'll
have three different things that is
variable initialization so let's move
this variable in Co initialization into
the head section of the for loop
so that's variable initialization and
then we have the boolean condition check
here followed by that we will have the
expression to update the variable that
participates in the boolean expression
so let's take that and move it to the
for loop head section now let's rerun
this one and see if it's going to work
the same way as it did before so it
should prompt us to enter a target
number let's provide 10 as the target
number click OK and we should have even
numbers from 0 to 10 so the program is
working the same way this time we are
using a for loop instead of a while loop
now we also discussed that all these 3
things that is variable initialization
condition check and the expression that
updates the variable that participates
in the boolean expression are optional
in a for loop now if it's optional then
I can remove this I will simply have a
semicolon
in this case notice that we are moving
variable initialization outside of the
for-loop head so we have the
initialization here and then I just have
a semicolon here to indicate that the
initialization is not done here now
after the first semicolon we have the
condition and then after the second
semicolon we have the expression that's
going to update the variable
participating in the boolean expression
now let's run this and see if it still
works the same way so let's enter 10 as
the target number click OK notice that
we get all even numbers starting from 0
till 10 now let's see you know if we
move this condition check elsewhere is
it still going to work just like
variable initialization the condition
check is also optional in a for loop
that means we can move it elsewhere so
I'm going to remove that and move it
inside the for loop block so let's
actually paste that here now I'm going
to use an if statement here if start is
actually greater than target number then
what I want to do is break out of the
for loop now this break statement is
required otherwise this will become a
never ending for loop now first let's
run this and see if it works the same
way as it did before and then we'll
comment this and see the behavior of
this program so let's run this now so it
should prompt us to enter the target
number so let's go ahead and enter
number 10 click OK
so it's printing even numbers from 0 to
10 and the moment start is clearer than
target number you know it's going this
condition will be true it executes this
statement it's going to break out of the
for loop now if this condition is not
here so I have commented these lines ok
now let's go ahead and run this we don't
have the condition within the for loop
now which means when we enter number 10
click OK
the condition will always be true by
default look at this now it's in a
never-ending follow that's why we should
have some way to break out of the for
loop and this is going to ensure that we
will break out of the for loop when the
value that is present in the start
variable is greater than the target
number now even the expression that is
updating the variable that's
participating in the boolean expression
is also optional so let's move this
again inside the for loop okay now if we
look at this for loop we just have two
semicolons the variable initialization
condition check and the expression that
updates the variable all three are at
different places just like a while loop
okay but we are using for keyword here
let's read on this and see if it works
the same way as it did before let's
enter number 10 click OK notice that it
prints even numbers from 0 till 10 thank
you for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
