this video we'll discuss using custom
view engines with asp.net MVC please
watch by 30 before proceeding we knew
that out-of-the-box asp.net MVC supports
to view engines aspx and razor besides
these two there are several other custom
view engines that can be used with
asp.net MVC we can use Park namo sharp
down Braille and there are several
others as well in this video let's
discuss using sparkvue engine so
obviously the first step here is to
install this Parkview engine and the
best way to do that is by using nougat
package manager so let's flip to Visual
Studio and to get to new grip package
manager click on Tools library package
manager manage NuGet packages for
solutions and then let's search for
sparkvue engine we are using MVC for
project here so if we navigate to page 2
we have this parked at Web MD C 4 click
install now this should automatically
install any dependencies as well so it's
installing this path view engine now and
then once that is done click on close
now we have this Park View engine
installed and it's configured for us
automatically by the new bid package
manager now if I go to this index action
method within this employee controller
and then once I right-click and then
select add view from the context menu
so here within this add view dialog box
we have this view engine drop-down list
and notice that at the moment I only
have those two view Indians aspx and
razor if you want this Park View engine
to be displayed within this drop-down
list then we have to navigate to this
path so this is the part where we have
the templates used by that add view
dialog box
so let's navigate to this part so it's C
colon program files microsoft visual
studio 10 common 7 ide item templates
c-sharp web since we our project is of
type MVC 4 so that's the folder and then
within that we have cout templates and
then add view
okay so let's navigate to that path if
you are using an MVC 3
project then instead of you know MVC for
it will be MVC three folder there in
that part I will have this part
available on my blog so let's click on
start and get to the run window let's
navigate to that path and notice that
within this folder we have these two
within this ad view folder we have this
aspx c-sharp and CS HTML this folder is
for this aspx view so when we go to add
view so the the first folder right here
is for that aspx view and the second
folder is for the Rays of view okay so
now we want another folder for our
sparkvue engine so let's go ahead and
create a new folder and let's call it
spark okay and then within this folder
we need to have an XML file that's going
to contain the configuration okay so I
already have that XML file so if you
look at this we have to name this XML
file as view engine dot XML so let me
open this now and if you look at this
it's a pretty simple XML file so here we
have view engine tag and then there are
several attributes display name okay so
that attribute specifies the name of the
view engine so here whatever is the name
that you want to be displayed so since
we want the name as Park I have given
the display name as Park and view file
extension you know if it is a razor view
file then it's going to have C as HTML
whereas if it's an ASP X view then it's
going to have aspx extension sparkvue is
going to have dot spark extension and
then the default layout page and then
partial views if you are creating a
partial view what's the extension of
that so pretty straightforward XML there
okay so now what we need to do is we
need to copy and paste that XML file so
at the moment this XML file is present
in my C C Drive files directory so I'm
going to copy that and paste this into
our spark directory within that ad view
folder okay so once this is done now
let's go back to this controller action
method let's
right click on that ad view and notice
that now I have this Park View engine
listed there okay now look at this once
I select the razor view and then once I
check this box create a strongly typed
view and then if I select a model plus
let's select any of the class look at
this I have a scaffold template here so
where are these templates coming from
these templates so this is a razor view
engine so if we go back to that folder
so if we go to this CS HTML which is for
the Rays views look at this I have these
templates right here and these templates
are Ward is showing that templates
within that ad view dialog box but then
if you look at spot we don't have any
templates there that's why if I come
here if I right-click on the controller
action method select add view and then
if we select spark there and then once I
select this checkbox let's select a
class and look at this I don't have any
scaffold templates there now we have to
copy these park specific templates into
that folder once we do that we'll be
able to use them in the same way as we
are using you know razor and aspx views
okay but that is beyond the scope of
this video series I mean video tutorial
creating spark specific view template
the idea here is you know this is
extensible MVC is extensible so we can
plug in the view engines of our choice
and it's possible with asp.net MVC
alright on this slide you can find
resources face be dotnet c-sharp and
sequence of interview questions that's
it for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
