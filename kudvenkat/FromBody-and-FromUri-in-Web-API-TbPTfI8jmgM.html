tutorial in this video we'll discuss the
use of from body and from your eye
attributes we use this put method that
we have within our employees controller
to update employee details let's usually
put request from fiddler notice the ID
of the employee that we want to update
is in the URI and the employee data with
which we want to update is in request
body let's execute this request
completed now let's quickly verify if
the employee details are updated notice
employee record with ID equals one is
updated as expected at the moment the ID
of the employee that we want to update
is in the URI as part of route data now
let's use a query string parameter to
specify the ID of the employee instead
so I'm going to delete the ID from route
data and then use a question mark to
indicate that you know we are including
a query string parameter the name of the
query string parameter is ID and the
value for this is going to be one and
let's change first name to mark - last
name - Hastings - and salary to 75,000
let's execute this request completed
let's quickly verify the record is
updated now when a request is issued the
data that we have in this request needs
to be mapped to the parameters of this
put method within our employees
controller so the ID of the employee
that we have in the URI either as part
of raw data or as part of a query string
parameter that needs to be mapped to the
ID parameter of this put method and the
employee data that we have in the
request body this needs to be mapped to
the employee parameter of this put
method this process is called parameter
binding and there is a default
convention that web api uses for
parameter binding let's understand that
default convention now by default if the
parameter is a simple
type like integer boolean double etc Web
API tries to get the value from the URI
that is either from raw data or from
query string parameters on the other
hand if the parameter is a complex type
like customer product employee etc Web
API tries to get the value from the
request body this is the default
convention we can change this default
parameter binding process by using from
body and from URI attributes notice the
ID parameter which is a simple type that
is integer is decorated with from body
attribute here so this is going to force
web api to get data for the ID parameter
which is a simple type from the request
body the employee type here which is a
complex type this is decorated with from
URI attribute so this is going to force
web api to get data for this employee
type which is a complex type from the
URI that is a the from query string
parameters are from route data let's
look at this in action now at the moment
web api is using its default parameter
binding process so it's going to look in
the request URI for the value for the ID
parameter and it's going to look in the
request body for the values for this
employee parameter at the moment we have
decorated this employee parameter with
from body attribute which is basically
telling web api to look in the request
body for the data for this parameter
however we know that by default web api
any we are going to look in the request
body for complex type parameters so the
presence or absence of this attribute on
this parameter is not going to make any
difference even if we remove this
attribute from this parameter it's going
to work exactly the same way as before
now what we want to do is force web api
to read employee data from the request
URI to do that I'm going to decorate the
employee parameter with
from URI attribute let's give our
solution and build build succeeded now
Web API is going to look in the request
URI for values for both of these
parameters ID and employee if you look
at this employee class it has got ID
first name last name gender and salary
properties we will have to specify
values for these properties in the
request URI let's make use of query
string parameters to do that let's flip
to fiddler now notice at the moment we
are already using a query string
parameter to specify a value for ID now
in addition to this let's use a few more
query string parameters notice we have
first-name lastname gender and salary
query string parameters the names of
these parameters must match the names of
the properties that we have on the
employee class now since we have
specified the data for the employee
parameter in the request URI there is no
need to include request body so I'm
going to delete the request body now
let's execute this request completed
let's quickly verify if the employee
record is updated notice the record is
updated as expected at the moment Web
API is looking for the data for both of
these parameters in the request URI now
let's force Web API to read the ID value
from the request body and to do that we
are going to decorate this parameter
with from body attribute let's give our
solution a build build succeeded now web
api is going to look in the request body
for this ID parameter value so let's
specify ID n request body since we have
specified it using the request body we
don't have to include it in the URI web
api is going to anyway ignore it so
let's remove the ID parameter from the
request you are
and let's change first name to FN one
last name to ln1 and salary to
fifty-five thousand let's execute RIF is
completed let's quickly verify if the
data is updated notice employee record
with ID equals one is updated as
expected so what is the use of from body
and from uri attributes we use these
attributes to tell web api where to look
in the request for parameter values
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
