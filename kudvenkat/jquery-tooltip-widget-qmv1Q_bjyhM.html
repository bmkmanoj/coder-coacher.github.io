this video we'll discuss jQuery tool to
fidget with examples to get a tooltip
without using jQuery all you need to do
is set the title attribute on this page
right here we've got two elements a
label and an input element of type text
notice both of these elements have got
title attribute at this point if we view
this page in the browser this is how it
looks like and look at what's going to
happen when I hover the mouse over this
name label notice its title attribute
value is displayed as a tooltip
similarly when I have the mouse over
this text box again its title attribute
value is displayed as a tooltip at the
moment we're using the native tooltip we
can also use jQuery to get this tool tip
and the jQuery tool to visit replaces
the native tooltip and it allows a lot
of customization now let's see how to
use the jQuery tooltip widget first
let's find one of these elements by ID
let's find this textbox element by ID so
let's use the jQuery ID selector and the
ID of the text box is txt name so on
this I am going to call tooltip function
so if you want to use the jQuery tooltip
widget
all you have to do is use this tooltip
function at this point then the reload
of a page this text box should be using
the jQuery tooltip widget look at that
that is a tooltip produced using jQuery
tooltip widget where as the name label
still uses the native tooltip now at the
moment on this page I've got two
elements so if we have let's say ten
elements and all of them have title
attribute now if I want to use jQuery
tool to visit with all those elements
then do I have to find each element by
ID like this and then call the tooltip
function not really you can use the
document object so I can use the
document object like that
so selector is the document object and
on that we are calling the tooltip
function so let's save the changes let's
reload our page and look at that and I
have them also a name label it's using
the tooltip widget
similarly the textbox is also using the
tooltip widget
so when you use the document object as
the selector then you know the jQuery
tooltip widget will be used by all the
elements on that page that have got the
title attribute now at the moment here
we're using the title attribute to
specify the content that we want to
display in the tooltip that's one way
another way is you can use the content
option of the tooltip function to
specify the content for your tooltip now
what happens when you specify content
using both title attribute and content
option in that case whatever content you
have specified using the content option
will override the content specified by
the title attribute so let's look at
that in action so here we are saying
your full name as it appears in passport
that is the content for this text box
you know which we want to display using
a tooltip now let's use the jQuery ID
selector so txt name and we are calling
the tooltip function now let's customize
so I'm going to use the content option
here and using this content option we
can specify the content that we want to
display you know using the jQuery
tooltip widget now I have some string
here already typed so let me copy this
and paste it right here so that is our
content okay and let's use you can also
use HTML you know inside the string if
you want let's bold it let's also
underline it just to prove that you can
use HTML
okay so let's save the changes so now
this textbox has in our title attribute
as well as content option at this point
if we view this page in the browser and
when we hover the mouse over this text
box look at what we are getting we are
getting content option tooltip
overriding title attribute tooltip so
the content that is specified using the
content option will overwrite the
content specified by the tooltip now
this content option supports multiple
types string or a function in the in
this example by using string you know
the content for the tooltip you can also
specify a function that returns data so
for example within our document or ready
function or in an external javascript
file you could have a function let's
call this get tooltip data and you know
your function could be returning some
data like tooltip from a function and
now we could use this function with the
content option okay
so let's save the changes reload this
page and look at this when I have the
mouse over now we're getting that
tooltip content from a function so for
this content option you can specify
either a string or a function that
function could even be retrieving data
from the database using Ajax now use
this track option you know if you want
to a tooltip that follows the mouse
pointer okay so at the moment if you
look at the tooltip look at this
wherever you know the hovering happens
the tooltip is displayed exactly below
the textbox now if you want that tooltip
to follow the mouse pointer then all you
need to do is set the track option to
true so let's go ahead and do that
let's save the changes reload this page
and look at what's going to happen so we
have the tooltip there and as I drag the
amounts look at what's going to happen
the tooltip follows the pointer show and
hide options can be used to animate the
showing and hiding of the tooltip both
of these options support multiple types
now for the detailed description of
these two options
please check jQuery documentation at
this URL now here we are using both the
show and hide options so let's go ahead
and use them within our example so I'm
using the show option now this option as
I told before it supports multiple times
now I'm going to use a JavaScript object
and specify the options for the
animation when the tooltip is displayed
let's say we want a delay of 100
milliseconds okay and the duration for
the tooltip animation let's say 500
milliseconds and you can also specify
the effect of animation what animation
do you want let's say we want the
tooltip to slide down similarly when the
tooltip is being hidden
what animation options do you want again
I'm going to specify them using a
JavaScript object so a delay of 100
milliseconds duration of 500
milliseconds and an effect of slide up
okay
so let's save the changes let's reload
this page and look at this when I have
the mouse over it slowly slides down and
it slowly slides up okay
now you can use different effects for
example I can use explode let's reload
this look at this when I have the mouse
over it slowly slides down and when I
mouse oh how it explodes
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
