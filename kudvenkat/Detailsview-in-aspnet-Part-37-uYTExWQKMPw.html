venket this is part 37 of asp.net
grid-view tutorial in this video we'll
discuss about details view in asp.net
just like grid view control details view
is also a data bound control details
view is usually used to display one row
at a time let's understand this with an
example in my sequel server database I
have TBL employee table which has got ID
first name last name city gender etc
there are a lot of columns in this table
now within the grid view control I don't
want to display all of these columns
I just want to display three columns ID
first name and city columns and then
this grid view should also display a
select button now when I select an
employee for the selected employee we
want to display all the columns within
details view as you can see here look at
this at the moment in the grid view
control I have Joan's record selected
number three look at that within the
details we have his ID first name last
name city gender every column from TBL
employee table let's see how to achieve
this obviously we need a grid we control
and the details view control on the
webform so let's flip to visual studio
let's drag and drop a grid we control
let's auto format that let's select
brown-sugar scheme now let's drag and
drop details view control onto the
webform
let's auto format that as well and
choose brown-sugar scheme obviously
since we have two data bound controls
let me drag and drop to sequel data
source controls now first let's
configure sequel datasource one control
which is going to act as datasource
for grid v1 control so configure data
source select your connection string
click Next the table is going to be TBL
employee now I don't want to select all
the rows from TBL employee because you
know within the grid view control I just
need three columns ID first name and
city so I am just going to select those
three columns within sequel datasource
one control because this is going to be
the data source for grid view one
control click next test your query
finish now let's associate sequel data
source one with grid b1 control now look
at this we should allow the users to be
able to select an employee row so
obviously we should enable say
action on grid b1 control so from grid
view tasks enable selection you know
check that box alright so we are done
configuring it could be one control now
let's configure sequel data source to
control obviously this is going to act
as data source for details view control
so let me configure this select your
connection string from web config file
click Next
the table is again going to be TBL
employee now within details view we want
to show all the columns of the selected
employee
so obviously the query will be select
star from TBL employee but when we
execute this query it's going to return
all the columns as well as all the rows
but we don't want all the rows because
we are going to display only one row at
a time within the details view control
so obviously there should be a ver loss
by which we can filter so I click on the
ver class so this is very important
adware Clause so how are we going to
filter the rows that we are going to
retrieve you know for sequel data source
to control based on the row that we have
selected within the grid view control
okay so I'm going to filter that based
on you know the employee ID the ID
column so the column is going to be ID
and that should be equal to a value that
is going to come from a control on this
waveform so the source is going to be
another control so select control as
that and then which control is that it's
going to be grid v1 control look at that
ID is equal to grid v1 dot selected
value click Add click ok so click Next
and we can test our query since there is
a parameter there we need to supply a
value for that for example if I pass IDs
1 and click OK we should get all the
columns of employee ID is equal to 1
finish now let's associate sequel data
source to control with our details of
view 1 control ok there we go all right
let's go ahead and run this
at this point obviously when the
gridview first renders you know Roe will
be selected within the grid we won
control and look at this this this
doesn't look right you know since I
don't have any row selected within the
grid view control look at what howard
details view is rendered it's it's it's
blended as a simple colored box and we
don't want that to be happening but then
look at that as soon as I select an
employee row you know everything is back
to normal but even on the initial get
request you know I don't want that
colored box to be displayed which means
when the page initially loads up you
know we don't want to show details view
control so anytime I select an employee
you know if the selected row within the
grid be one control it's not now then
only then go ahead and render details
you control so obviously the thing that
first comes to our mind is within the
page load event F within the grid view
one control if selected row is not equal
to null meaning if we have a row
selected within the grid view control
then I want the details view one control
to be visible else if it is now then we
don't want that control to be visible so
I'm setting the visibility of that
control to false now with this change
let me go ahead and run this but people
still have the problem and then we will
see how to fix that okay so this is good
on the initial page load we don't have
details you rendered but we have another
problem here when I select an employee
role look at the same time to select
Tom's row but do I have that rendered no
but now when I actually select you know
Pam's record everything is working fine
as expected okay why is that that's
because when I select an employee row on
the page load you know we don't have
anything selected because the selection
happens after the postbag okay that's
why you know it doesn't work as expected
because we are checking it in the page
load event now we have discussed about
you know the events in the page
lifecycle of a web application asp.net
video tutorial
so if you're new to that please watch
that video now obviously to make this
work in the right way I will have to
move this code to page underscore
pre-render event because pre-render
happens after postback event and by that
point you know you have the selected
value of grid v1 populated correctly so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
make a copy of this one and make use of
page pre-render event okay so we can get
rid of the code that's there in page
load so now let's go ahead and run this
obviously in the waveform initially
loads up selected value property of grid
view control will be null so nothing is
displayed now I select for example John
look at that as soon as I select John I
have that there I select on everything
is working fine as expected so I select
Tom so Tom's record is displayed all
right now details you can also be used
to perform insert edit and delete
operations as well we'll discuss about
them in our upcoming video sessions on
this slide you can find resources for
asp.net c-sharp and sequence of
interview questions that's it for today
