tutorial in its video we will discuss
how to read route parameter values in
angular 2 and later versions let's
understand this with an example at the
moment our list employees component
displays the list of all available
employees and when we click on any
employee that specific employee ID is
passed in the URL as a road parameter
now what we want to be able to do is
read the employee ID from the URL and
then retrieve that specific employee
details using our employee service and
then display those details right here
now if we take a look at our employee
service notice we have this get
employees method which returns us the
list of all available employees now we
want another method which is going to
return us employee by ID so let's make a
copy of this and then change the bits
that are required first of all the name
of the method is going to be get
employee and it's going to return a
single employee and not an array and we
want to pass this method the ID of the
employee that we want and then to get
that employee by ID we are going to use
the fine method we want an employee
whose ID equals the ID that we are
passing in and notice here we are using
triple equals to check both for the
value and the type so this completes the
change required in our employee service
next from our employee details component
we want to read this route parameter
value reading route parameters is easy
angular provides a service for that and
that service is called activated route
service so for us to be able to use that
service will have to first import it so
let's import activated route service
from angular router package
now to be able to use this activated
route service will have to first inject
it into a component using the component
constructor so let's create a private
field I'm going to name it underscore
route and the type of this is activated
route which we have just imported now
using this private field underscore
route we can very easily read the route
parameter values we are going to do that
within this ng on a net lifecycle hub we
have discussed lifecycle hooks in detail
in our angular 2 course so if you're new
to lifecycle hooks please check out our
angular 2 course I'll have the link
available in the description of this
video now let's use this private field
underscore route to read the route
parameter values notice when I press dot
on the route object we have this
property params and if I have the mouse
over this params property notice what it
returns it is actually returning an
observable so one way to read the load
parameter values is by subscribing to
this absorber we'll discuss this
observable approach in our next video in
this video we'll discuss the other
approach and that approach is the
snapshot approach notice now when I type
dot on the route object we have another
property and that property is the
snapshot property and on this we have
the params property so now to be able to
read this route parameter value we have
to specify its name remember when we
defined this route in our route module
file that is an AB dot module dot ts
file we specify the name of this route
parameter as ID so we have to use the
same name to read that parameter value
so back in our employee details
component we specify the name of the
parameter as ID right here and by
default this is going to return the
value as a string so we need to convert
that to a number we do that by using the
plus symbol and then let's create a
constant and store the parameter value
in that constant now let's use this ID
and retrieve that specific employee
details using our employee service so we
need to inject our employee service also
into a component class let's do that
within our constructor I'm going to name
the private field underscore employee
service and the type of this is employee
service we don't have this service
imported yet and that's the reason we
see that red squiggle we can take the
help of Visual Studio code editor to
automatically include the required
import statement for us we do that by
pressing the ctrl + period Keys
simultaneously notice now we have this
import option right here when I click on
this the required import statement is
automatically included right here and
also notice the red squiggle has
disappeared now let's use this employee
service to retrieve employee by ID
we know the service has caught ket
employee method we need to pass it the
ID of the employee we have that in this
constant so let's pass that and this
method is going to return us an employee
so within our component let's create a
property I'm going to name it employee
and the type of this is employee again
we don't have this type so let's import
the employee type and we are going to
store the employee returned by our
service in this employee property now if
we take a look at what our employee
details component is doing it's simply
displaying this message an employee
details works at the moment we are able
to read the ID value from the URL and we
are also able to retrieve that specific
employee details all that is left to do
is display the employee details now to
speed things up I'm going to reuse the
HTML and CSS we have in our display
employee component let's paste this HTML
within our employee details component
view template
so instead of employee details works
let's replace that where the HTML we
have just copied and notice it's binding
to the employee property and within our
employee details component class we
already have the employee property now
let's say all our changes and see what
we get
notice the image is too big this is
because we are missing some of the
styles will copy those styles in just a
bit but before that let's quickly test
our application to make sure it works as
expected when I click on mark whose ID
is 1 the ID is passed correctly in the
URL we see my details is expected
similarly when I click on John John's ID
is 3 and we also see John's details now
let's copy those styles let's copy the
styles from display employee component
CSS file and paste them within our
employee details component CSS file
notice now the image size is reduced as
expected
now let's include a footer for this
bootstrap panel and in the footer let's
include back to list button let's open
our employee details component view
template and we have our panel body div
right here after the panel body we want
panel footer suggest after panel body
div let's include another development
and to get a panel footer all we have to
do is include the bootstrap class panel
- footer instead of using a button I'm
going to use an anchor element and style
it using bootstrap button classes BTN
and BTN - primary and the text 1 this is
going to say back to list and when we
click on this link what do we want to do
we want to take the user back to the
list page so let's use the router link
directive and bind it to the list route
notice now we have back to list link
then we click this it takes us back to
the list now one question that might
come to your mind is why are we not
using square brackets when we are using
the arrow telling directive well that's
because if we are binding to a simple
string like this we don't need to use
the square brackets
we need to use these square brackets
when we are binding this directive to
link parameters array like this or if we
are binding to a property within a
component class since now we are binding
to the link parameters array we have to
use the square brackets if we don't use
the square brackets then it doesn't work
so in angular to read route parameter
values there are two options we can
either use the snapshot approach or the
observable approach in this video we
discuss the snapshot approach in our
next video we will discuss the
observable approach if you are using
angular 2 in your project then use
params property as shown right here on
the other hand if you're using angular
for angular 5 or even future versions
they introduced a new property called
param map params have been deprecated
since angler 4 so if you're using
angular for or any version beyond it use
per am map property instead of params at
the moment in our project they using
angular 5 so let's use param map instead
of params so let's replace params with
parameter map has caught get method and
to the get method we passed the name of
our road parameter which is ID notice
even now our application works exactly
the same way as before that's it in this
video thank you for watching and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
