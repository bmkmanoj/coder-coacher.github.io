tutorial we learnt about radius control
searchers in this tutorial we are going
to learn about for loop for loop is
essentially a control structure that
allows you to repeat a certain set of
statements again in again for fixed
number of times so in a way for loop is
allowing you to I trade fixed or no
number of times so whenever you have to
execute a certain series of steps again
and again for loop is something that you
should look for for loop consists of
initialization expression that
initializes the loop then termination
expression that tells the condition when
the loop should terminate when this -
when this condition evaluates itself to
false the loop terminates and then there
is an increment expression increment or
decrement expression that affects the
value that changes after every iteration
and then of course there is the
statement set to repeat let's the
formally what is the syntax of for loop
a for loop starts with for keyboard and
then you have a initialization
expression followed by a semicolon then
a termination expression again followed
by a semicolon and finally you have a
incremented expression and then in the
block you have statements to repeat
let's see this in action if I want to
print numbers from 1 to 20 then I would
start with for loop I would initialize
with an initialization expression which
is 0 and then I will say that continue
evaluating or executing this loop again
and again till I becomes less
they're 20 and then this is the
increment expression and then here I
print
I followed by some space so understand
that when this loop gets executed the
first thing that gets executed is
initialization expression a variable of
type I gets initialized to values zero
and then the execution of loop starts
this statement system dot out dot print
continues to execute and the first thing
that gets printed is zero after that
what things
execute is this increment expression
this increment expression increments the
value of I by one now the eye value
becomes equal to one and then this test
expression gets executed thinking that
if this expression evaluates to true and
continue execution
I repeat first of all this
initialization expression gets executed
I is equal to zero and then if I is less
than twenty then the iteration gets
executed and then after iteration gets
executed the increment expression gets
executed and then again the test
expression gets executed if it evaluates
to true then this execution of block
again happens and this continues there
is an action so you see that since I was
equal to zero and I should be less than
20 for every eye that is less than 20
this statement has printed a value of I
in programming languages generally
people make mistakes by off-by-one
errors that means
if the statement was won and I want to
execute it this still 20 then this loop
is going to execute only for 19 times
although someone would make a mistake of
understanding that this loop will start
from form 1 and continue to 20 if you
really want to executed 20 do not forget
to put equal to sign here and this will
ensure that you print all the numbers
all the way from 1 to 20 this is one of
the very simple and basic examples of 4
statement now let us understand there is
another version of for loop which is
known as enhanced version of our loop we
will learn about collections and arrays
later
immediately after towards the tutorials
but understand that there is a variant
of force loop that works very
beautifully with collection and arrays
let me give you a sneak peek into how
arrays can be initialized errors are
nothing but a set of similar kind of
elements whose size is fixed so if I
have a integer list integer array I am
calling it array and let me initialize
it with 1 2 3 4 &amp;amp; 5 and now I am going
to use the enhanced version of for loop
I will write 4 and then here I need to
write an expression of this kind type
variable colon collection what is the
type of this array it is integer what is
the variable value I can give anything
let let me call it item and what is it
Kyle
or the area that we are looking for its
name is array and then I can simply
print this item it's the execution you
will see that every element in the array
leads to execution of for loop 1 this is
an enhanced version of for loop now
let's quickly visit our early for loop
once again see this carefully here we
are initializing a variable I and this
variable I is not visible outside this
for loop because it is declared as part
of what loop statement so if I write
this out print I and Eclipse will show
error that a variable I cannot be
resolved to a variable for some
scenarios where you want to use the
variables outside it is better to
initialize the value declare the value
value I outside and then initialize it
within the loop note that now there is
no error you can decide to initialize
value outside you can even omit or omit
the initialization expression this is
also a valid for loop and you will
observe that the output continues to
remain the same
note that this last system dot out dot
println leads to printing off 21 why
does this happen as I told you first of
all I gets initialized to 1 and then
this test expression is evaluated since
I that is 1 is less than 20 this
expression system dot out dot println
gets executed and it prints 1 this loop
continues for 20 times and for every
time this increment expression gets
evaluated now when will append for the
last time when I was two when I was 20
at that point of time since 20 was less
than equal to 20 system dot out dot
println printed I is equal to 20 as soon
as the hydration finished I plus plus
was evaluated and then the value of
variable i was incremented to 21 and
then the stretched expression was
evaluated since 21 was less than equal
to 20 which was false therefore no
further execution happens and then the
power loop terminated but this is
standard out dot println I printed 21
I hope this part is clear so this was an
enhanced version of for loop note that
there is infinite version of for loop as
well if you do not provide any test
condition if you do not provide any
increment condition then the for loop is
going to get evaluated forever if you
try out this on your sample program will
observe that that the call stack
completely fails up and you will see
that it turns out to be an infinite loop
also note that we can also have multiple
initializers or incrementals
s it is an example so if I have two
variables I and J
I can say that I is zero and J is equal
to ten and we want that I should be
equal to less than five and J should be
less than equal to five and increment I
and J plus plus in every iteration and
print J so you can have multiple
initializers separated by comma you can
have multiple increment or separated by
comma and then you can have a complex
text expression also which might have
and operator let's see output of this so
what happens here is that I was 0 J was
10 since I was 0 and J was 10 this
expression test expression evaluated to
false and therefore the loop did not
getting secreted even once let me make
it 0 when J is 0 then this loop should
execute and see the number is let me put
space so that you are able to see what
are the different outputs so the output
is 0 2 4 6 8 and 10 and if you really
want to see the values of I and J for
every loop then we can do something like
this
I is AI J is J so let's see this output
and understand it properly initially I
was 0 and J was also 0 the test
expression was true n I plus J was zero
when I got incremented to 1 and J got
incremented to 1 the test expression was
again true and then the loop gets
executed in prince2 then I and J gets
incremented to 10 3 then 4 and then 5 as
soon as I and J or 5 the test expression
gets in it's evaluated to true for the
last time and the ten variable is 10 the
value is printed finally these both I
and J gets incremented to 6 and then the
test expression ice less than equal to 5
and K is less than equal to 5 get
evaluated to false so this was using
multiple initializers and increment or
we can also have nested for-loops what
this means is that if I have a variable
I and I want that the loop should get
executed for exactly 5 times and then
inside I can have another loop and I can
say J is equal to 0 and then J is less
than equal to I and J plus plus and
since out I want to print a strict sign
and for every outer loop I want to
simply print a new line let's see the
expression output in this 2 loops what
is happening is the outer for loop get
executed
for exactly five times and the inner
loop gets executed for J is equal to 0-2
J is less than I that means the first
loop will get executed for for I is
equal to zero the first time the inner
loop will get executed exactly once
for I is equal to one it will get
executed for exactly twice and therefore
on the first line you will see one and
straight on second line two Westrick on
third line three hashtag signs I would
recommend you to do something use for
loop and try to print something of this
sort which is a pyramid this will be
little interesting it will be more
trickier but it will be a worthwhile
experience for you so try to print
something like this so you have to
execute the loop here to take care of
spaces and you have to print a pyramid
of asterisk sign try this out
note that the increment expression can
also be a method name
where will we are writing I or J plus
plus you can substitute this with a
method name as an example I have used
print method as the call in the
increment expression and print method is
a separate method so in this tutorial we
have learnt the syntax of for group we
saw different kind of for loop examples
and you also understood the enhanced
version of our loop hope you all enjoyed
