tutorial in this video we'll discuss
linting type script code angler has
caught a lending tool that checks our
typescript code for any programmatic
errors stylistic errors and non
adherence to coding standards and
conventions if you recollect in one of
our previous videos we discussed about
this file ts Lent dot jason this is the
configuration file for lending our
typescript code and if you look at this
file it contains all the default rules
for lending of a code we'll discuss some
of these rules in just a bit
for the purpose of this demo I've
created a new angular project using this
command ng new my new angular project
and this project has successfully
created as you can see right here and
then I changed into the project and then
open the project that Visual Studio code
so the first thing that I want to do
here is clear the screen and then let's
use the angular CLI to lint our code and
here's command for that ng for angular
CLI itself and then the command is lint
there we go look at the message all
files pass linting so at the moment we
don't have any indicators now if you
look at this angular project my new
angular project this is a brand new
angular project that we have generated
using the angular CLI and all the code
that we have at the moment within this
project is generated by the angular CLI
itself and we know angular CLI follows
the angular teams best practices and
conventions to generate this code so at
the moment we don't have any linting
errors all files pass linting but then
we have got a warning here look at what
the woman says the no use before declare
rule requires type checking this is
basically saying if this rule is enabled
it also requires type checking to do
type checking we use - - type - check
option along with the ng lint command
and we can find this role within our
landing configuration file which is TS
length dot jason and we have that rule
right here no use before declare
and its value at the moment is true
which means it is enabled so when this
rule is enabled it also requires type
checking so we use angel int command and
then this option - - type - check notice
now we don't have that warning anymore
now let's understand what this rule
actually means no use before declare
this rule this allows usage of variables
before their declaration let's
understand this with an example
let's flip over to visual studio code
and let's go to a route component which
is inside this app folder and we have
this file app component or tears we have
our app component class so within this
class I'm actually going to paste a very
simple method the name of the method is
say hello and we have got a variable
here message and be initialized that
with this word hello and then to that we
are appending Pragya on the next line
and we are logging whatever we have
caught in that variable to the console
so a very simple method let's save our
changes and then run the linting command
once again notice no no we have lint
errors so we have a linting error in
this file after component or tears on
line number 12 and column 5 so if we
look at line number 12 and column 5 it's
right here so basically on this line we
are declaring a variable using the VAR
keyword and if you look at what this
linting error says it says forbidden VAR
keyword use let or Const instead now
within our linting configuration file
that is in this TS Lent dot jason we
have a rule called no where keyword and
notice by default that rule is enable so
that's why we are forbidden from using
the val keyword to declare a variable
for a moment let's actually turn off
this rule by changing its value to false
save our changes and then let's go ahead
and run our ng lint command once again
notice now we
have any lending errors all files pass
linting let's make a small change within
our say hello method all I'm going to do
here is move these two lines of code
after console dot log statement so
basically what we are trying to do here
is use this variable message before it's
actually declared on line number
thirteen so let's save our changes and
now when we run ng lint command of a
rule no use before declare should fail
because we are trying to use this
variable before it is declared so now
let's run the ng lint command once again
there we go
notice we have lint errors as expected
look at the error variable message used
before declaration and we know what to
do to fix this error all we have to do
is declare this variable message before
it's actually used by moving these two
lines of code just above our console dot
log statement let's save our changes and
then run the lint command once again all
files parse linting as expected now as
far as this rule is concerned that is
this rule no use before declare it makes
sense to have this rule enabled only if
we have this rule nowhere keyword is
disabled now one important point to keep
in mind is only variables declared with
where keyword are accessible even before
they are declared let me explain what I
mean let's flip back to our say hello
method and if I cut these two lines of
code from this say hello method we get a
red squiggly under the message variable
and if I hover the mouse over we get the
message that we expect cannot find name
message we haven't declared that so the
compiler doesn't know about it but the
moment I paste these two lines back the
red squiggly goes away and look at this
even before we have declared this
variable we are using it and that's
technically okay
with variables declared using the VAR
keyword so variables declared that var
keyword are accessible even before they
are declared is this the case with let
keyword let's look at that now instead
of using where let's use the let keyword
to declare a variable and we still have
the red squiggly there and when I hover
the mouse over that red squiggly look at
what the message says block scope
variable message used before its
declaration so variables declared that
let keyword are not accessible before
they are declared now if I move the
declaration before its usage then we
wouldn't have that red squiggly there so
the summary is since we know only
variables declared with were keyword are
accessible before they are declared and
since we also know this rule know where
keyword is enabled out of the box we can
safely disable this roll no use before
declare and when this rule is disabled
we don't have to use this option type
check always when we use the ng link
command let's quickly look at this in
action let's enable nowhere keyword and
disabled no use before declare rule save
our changes and then run our ng lint
command without the type check option
there we go all files pass lending as
expected and in spite of us not using
this type check option along with the in
Zeeland command we didn't get that
warning we used to get the new use
before declare rule requires type
checking because we have this rule
disabled so to lint code using the
angular CLI use this command ng Lind now
if we look at this
Diaz Lent dot JSON file it has got many
lending rules with a net in our next
video well discuss some of the common
lending rules within this TS length dot
JSON file and we will also discuss some
of the common options that we can use
with this and
Lindt command thank you for listening
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
