tutorial in this video well discus
asp.net chart control sorting this is
continuation to part eight so please
watch part eight before proceeding the
end user should be able to sort chart
data by student name and by total marks
in ascending and descending order to
support this we need to drop down list
one drop down list is going to contain
the sort fails that is student name and
total marks and the other drop down list
is going to contain sort direction that
is ascending or descending let's flip to
visual studio this is the same example
that we worked with in the previous
video session I've made some changes to
the web form one dot aspx HTML basically
have included the chart control inside
an HTML table
let's flip this waveform to the source
mode and notice here we've got an HTML
table I've set font family to Arial and
border to 1 pixel solid black and we
have the first TR here which has got two
TDs and within the first TD I have this
little text sort by and then a drop down
list with ID DDL sort Y I also said auto
post back to true so that whenever the
selection in the drop down list changes
the webform is automatically posted back
to the server and within the second TD
we have this literal text sort direction
and a drop down list with ID DD else or
direction again the auto post back is
set to true for this drop down list as
well and then there is another TR as
well within the table and this TR
contains only one TD way we have set
column span to two and the chat control
is present inside that TD so this HTML
has given us this design
I'll have this HTML available on my blog
in case you need it
now let's go ahead and double click on
the drop down list
to generate the selected index changed
even handler let's do the same thing for
the other drop-down list now let's
modify this code to support sorting so
basically I'm going to extract this
piece of code into its own method and to
do that right-click refactor and select
extract method and let's call this get
chart data
and click okay now notice that we are
calling get char data method within the
page load even handler now I want this
to be called only if it is the initial
get request for the webform so let's put
it in this condition if not is post back
and then I'm going to introduce a
parameter to this function it's going to
be of type string and let's call this
sort expression and let's pass now as
the value for that parameter within the
page load event you will understand that
in just a bit okay now notice that here
we are reading the data from the XML
into the data set and then we are
setting that data set as the data source
for the chart control now the chat
control is going to display the data as
it is you know present within the data
source now we want the data to be sorted
so one way to sort the chart control is
by sorting the data first and then
binding it to the chart control so to
sort the data that is present within the
data set we can make use of data view
and to get the data view we can use
these dot tables of 0 dot default view
and if you look at what this property
returns it returns a data view so let's
do whatever it returns in a variable of
type data view so the data in the state
of Utah tada
as the data that is present in the table
now we want to sort the data that is
present within the data view and to do
that we can use the sort property of the
data view object and this is a string
property and we can specify this sort
expression so let's say for example we
want to sort the data by total marks in
ascending order
so total marks ascending and then what
we are doing you know here notice that
we are setting data set as the
daughter's data source for the chat
control instead of that let's set data
view so now with this change let's go
ahead and run the waveform so now the
data within the chart control should be
sorted by total marks in ascending order
notice that it goes from the least arm
value to the highest value all right now
if you look at the drop down list at
runtime on the web form nothing is
displayed in both of the drop-down list
that's basically because we have not
specified any items there so let's go
ahead and specify the items within the
drop down list so basically in this sort
by drop-down list we want the column by
which we want to sort the data so that
is student name and total marks so let's
go ahead and include a list item there
and the text for that is going to be
student name with a space and the value
is going to be student name without a
space
so the second list item is going to be
total marks and the value is also total
marks but without a space and now within
this second drop-down list we want to
specify the sort direction that is
ascending or descending
so let's include to list items within
the second drop-down list and the text
here is going to be ascending and the
value is going to be ASC and for the
second list item descending and value is
going to be de si all right so we have
what we want within the drop-down list
now whenever the selection within the
drop-down list changes you know we want
to refresh the data that is displayed in
the chart control right we have set auto
post back to true for the drop-down list
so whenever the selection changes it's
going to automatically post back to the
server now if you look at this function
right here we have hard-coded the sort
expression but notice this method has
got the parameter now we can make use of
this parameter to dynamically sort the
data in the data view so instead of
hard-coding the sort expression like
this I'm actually going to make use of
this parameter sort expression so we're
going to check if the sort expression
that is the parameter value that gets
passed if it is null or empty string dot
is null or empty if that is true if it
is null or empty then we want to use the
default sort which is you know we want
the data to be sorted by total marks in
ascending order else we want the sort
expression to be whatever gets passed to
this function okay and then look at this
in the page load event when the when I
first request is made to the wave form
be a passing null so in that case it's
going to use this
expression right here so the data will
be sorted by total marks in ascending
order that is the default sort order
because on the initial page load you
know the end user will not have the
opportunity to specify by which field he
wants to sort or in which direction so
the default sort is going to be by total
marks in ascending order and then
whenever the selection in the drop-down
list changes we want to call this get
chart data method and specify our sort
expression so let's call the method get
chart data now if you look at the
drop-down list the first drop-down list
contains the field names and the second
drop-down list contains whether we want
to sort the data in ascending or
descending order so we can you know use
the selected value properties of both of
the drop-down list and then dynamically
form the sort expression so within the
code-behind file DDL sort by dot
selected value that is going to give us
the column by which we want to sort data
and then space and then whether we want
to sort data by that column in ascending
or descending order and how are we going
to get that from the other drop-down
list DDL sort Direction dot selected
value and we need to do the same thing
in the other drop-down list selected and
exchanged email handler method so that's
all there to it let's go and run this
and then see if the chart control works
the way we expect it to work so first of
all the drop-down lists are showing the
fields and saw Direction notice that the
default sort is by total marks in
ascending order let's actually select
total marks and it's already ascending
let's select descending
notice that the chart control is sorted
in descending order by total marks
let's select student name and look at
the student names they are sorted by
student name in descending order let's
try to sort it in ascending order notice
that it's sorted in ascending order it's
that simple
so this is one of the way you know we
sort the data and then bind the sorted
data to the chart control there is
another way as well to sort the chart
control we can use the sort method of
chart dot series class we'll discuss
that in our next video thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
