this video well disk is using cliff
icons with bootstrap bootstrap icons are
provided by cliff icons there are over
250 cliffs as cliff icons are fawn based
the color and size automatically adjusts
to the element color and size on which
it is being used if this statement is
not clear at the moment don't worry
we'll look at an example and it will
make it clearer here is the URL where
you can find the list of all available
glyphs for use with bootstrap so when we
navigate to that page we can see all the
glyph icons here so how to use these
glyph icons with bootstrap let's
understand that with an example let's
say we want to display a search icon on
a button element as you can see here
doing this is very easy all you have to
do is nest a span element inside a
button element and then the value for
the class attribute of that span element
will be the name of this icon so if you
look at the list of icons we have got
notice here we have this search icon and
its name is glyph I can cliff I can -
search so basically these are class
names so we will set these classes on
the class attribute of the span element
that is nested inside the button element
let's look at that in action so let's
flip to visual studio so let's include a
button element and the text on that
button is going to be searched so let's
save this and when we reload this page
right here we should get a button
element and on the left hand side we
want the search icon so I'm going to
include a span element nested inside the
button element and the class attribute
value will be the name of the item and
let's copy that name from our list right
here so the name is cliff icon glyph I
can - search
let's save the changes and when we
reload this page notice now we have a
search icon on the bottom but then if
you look at the search icon and this
text there is no space between that icon
and the text to include the space all
you have to do is include space between
this pan element and the text save the
changes reload the page and we get the
space at the moment the icon is on the
left hand side if you want it on the
right hand side all you have to do is
move that span element to the right hand
side of the text and you will have the
search icon on the right hand side let's
reload this page notice now we have the
search icon on the right hand side now
if you want only the icon and you don't
want the text all you have to do is
remove that text from the button element
and you'll get just the icon we just
said that glyph icons are phone based so
the color and size automatically adjust
to the element color and size on which
it is being used let's prove this notice
here on this button we have black text
on a grey background and look at the
color of the search icon it's also black
which matches the font color what if we
have a different font color what if we
have a button like this notice here the
font color is white on a blue background
also notice the color of the search
taken it matches the color of the font
let's look at this in action let's flip
to visual studio I'm going to apply the
button classes on this button element
I'm going to apply BTN and BTN primary
so this PDN primary class should give us
a blue background with white font color
I am also going to include that search
text on the button let's save our
changes and when we reload this page
notice we get the icon color matching
with the font color as expected let's
now discuss how the size of an icon
automatically changes depending on the
size of the element on which it is being
used right here we've got three
with three different sizes and look at
the search icon its size also
automatically changes depending on the
size of the button on which it is being
used let's look at this in action I'm
going to make two more copies of this
pattern on the first button I am also
going to use BTN LG class along with the
rest of the two classes so the speedy
and LG class is going to give us a large
button on the second button I'm going to
use BTN SM which gives us a small button
and on this final button let's use BTN
XS which is going to give us an extra
small button let's save our changes and
when we reload this page notice we get
three buttons with different sizes and
look at the search icon its size also
automatically changes thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
