venket this is pad 49 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll discuss
about the validation summary control
before continuing with the session I
strongly recommend to watch parts 46 47
and 48 of this video series validation
summary control is used to display a
summary of all validation errors
occurred in a web page at one place in
general in a real-time application it's
very common to display a red asterik
next to the input control that has
failed the validation and the detailed
error message associated with that input
control is then displayed at the bottom
of the page as you can see here this can
be achieved very easily using the
validation summary control let's see how
to do this let's flip to visual studio I
have the webform already designed here I
have four text boxes here with their
respective labels a button control and
the label control at the moment we don't
have any validation controls whatsoever
the idea is that we want four required
field validator controls because all the
fields are required here and then in
addition to them email is going to have
a regular expression well data to make
sure we have the right format for the
email and confirm password is going to
have the compare valid data to make sure
the password and confirm password
matches so let's flip to visual studio
let's get the required field validators
first so starting with email we'll have
the required field validator for every
input control that we have so let me
drag and drop the required field value
data run it is equal to server let's
give a meaningful error message we will
say email is required okay and another
required property is control to validate
in our case this is going to be text
email and I want the message to be
displayed in red color so I'm going to
set that to red okay so let's copy and
paste this for the other input controls
that we have so username is again a
required field so let's copy and paste
it here error message we are going to
say
user name is required control to
validate its text user name so we are
going to specify that here for color red
and let's copy this and use the same
thing for the password field okay so
error message password is required the
control to validate is going to be text
password for color red and finally let's
get this for the confirm password field
here confirm password is required and
control to validate is text confirm
password okay so we have all the
required field validator
controls now let's go ahead and get
regular expression validator for the
email so let me drag and drop the
regular expression validator so again
for regular expression validator
the error message is going to be invalid
email and we want control to validate
which is going to be txt email and the
most important thing here is the
validation expression before that let's
also set the full color to red okay so
let's flip to the design mode and then
set the validation expression so we want
to match that to intern app email
address so that's the validation
expression and since we have two
validation controls here next to each
other if we want the error messages to
be properly displayed then for both the
validation controls I'm going to set the
display property to dynamic look at that
I'm selected both I've selected both the
validation controls I'm going to change
that together so I said they display to
dynamic okay and then finally for
confirmed password
I also want you know the compare
validator
so let's go ahead and drag and drop it
compare
data to make sure not custom validator
it's going to be compare valid data it's
going to ensure that both the password
and compare password are going to match
with each other
okay so error message password and
confirm password should be same okay and
we also need to specify control to
validate which in our case is going to
be txt confirm password and control to
compare with which control we want to
compare we want to compare that with dxd
password
okay so let's that set that to control
to compare and let's also specify the
type so the type here is going to be a
string and operator of course how do you
want to the comparison they have to be
equal okay and let's set the full color
to red all right so let's flip to the
design mode and again since we have two
validation controls here for the error
messages to be displayed properly set
the display property to dynamic okay so
with that in place let's go ahead and
run this and see if all the validation
controls are working as expected so when
the page loads if I don't enter anything
and try to click Save look at that I get
all the error messages as expected and
if I enter an invalid email address
invalid email and if I enter the
password which doesn't match and then
look at that password and confirm
password should be the same but our
requirement is that we want to display a
red as trick next to the input controls
and then the detail error messages using
the validation summary control
so let's see how to do that all we have
to do is first let's get rid of this
detail error messages here I want
instead of the detailed error messages I
want to read astrick how do I do that
select all the validation controls
and then go to the properties of that
and I'm going to set the text property
to all these controls asterik okay so
now the first problem is solved instead
of the detail error message we are
getting the red asterisk symbols and the
next thing is we want the detailed error
messages and all you have to do for that
is to drag and drop a validation ballade
ation summary control so before that
let's get another table draw right click
on one of the table rows insert row
below and then here I'm going to drag
and drop a validation summary control
okay so we have the validation summary
control let's flip to the source mode so
we have the validation summary control
and I want the color of the validation
messages to be red in color so I'm going
to set that to red okay so these are the
two properties that I mean that's the
only property that I have set at the
moment I dragged and drop the validation
summary control and set the full color
to red so that the messages appear in
red color now let's go ahead and run
this and see if we are anywhere close to
what we want to achieve okay I click
Save look at that okay I get the red
asterisks as expected and the error
messages as expected email is required
user name is required password is
required etc on the other hand if I
enter a password here I click Save look
at that password and confirm password
should match if I enter an invalid email
I click that so the error message just
changes as expected okay cool but then
if you look at the slide we have a
header text as well page errors or
validation errors whatever we want so
how do you set the header text again
this validation summary control has got
a header text property all you need to
do is to set that property so I'm going
to set the header text here and that's
going to be validation errors so header
text let's set that to validation errors
okay I look at that now we get that
header text so obviously if we run this
you should expect a header text there
and if you look at the display you know
at the minute if you look at these these
validation errors are shown using a
bullet list but then on the slide we
don't have a bullet list so how do we
customize that now that's again very
simple you have another property so if
you go to the properties of the
validation summary control there is a
display mode property at the moment it's
bullet list but you can change it to a
list which will display there are
messages like that and if you set it to
single paragraph you know the error
messages will be displayed like that
okay
let's select less just to match up with
what we have on the presentation slide
so that's about display mode property
and display mode can be lists belittle a
single paragraph etc and at the moment
we are looking at the summary of the
validation control validation summary
control which is displayed on the page
on the other hand it's also possible to
get a message box and all you have to do
for that is if you flip to visual studio
there is a property called
show message box which is false by
default but you can set that to true and
the moment I said that to true and when
I run the project along with the summary
control we will also get a message box
okay so when I click this you know look
at that I get these validation summary
as well as the message box but in real
time it's it's it's unusual to use
message box because it will be little
annoying to the users it's it's a common
practice to use validation summary
controls but you have the flexibility of
choosing how do you want to display
error messages to your users do you want
to use a summary box or a message box or
both of them so that's about validation
summary control on this slide you can
find resources for asp.net c-sharp and
sequence of interview questions that's
it for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
