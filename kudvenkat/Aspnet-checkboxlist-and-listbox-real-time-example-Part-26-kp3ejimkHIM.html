venket this is part 26 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll learn about
a very simple real time example using
asp.net check box list and list box
controls before continuing with the
session I strongly recommend to watch
parts 23 24 and 25 of this video series
so the example that we are going to look
at is I'm going to have this check box
list control which displays the levels
of education as I make my selections
within the check box list those
selections must be displayed within this
list box control and the number of items
that I have selected should be shown in
a label control here so here I have two
item selected so two items selected and
that message should be in black color
whereas if I don't have any of the items
selected then the list box should be
empty and zero items selected should be
shown and that should be in red color
let's look at this in action let's drag
and drop a check box list control and we
want to display you know the list item
objects so let's add the levels of
education to this list box to this check
box list so we have the levels of
education by default the repeat
Direction is vertical so let's change it
to horizontal
so repeat Direction horizontal all right
so now as soon as I select something I
want to display those selections in the
list box control so let's drag and drop
a list box control onto the waveform so
I have this list box control let's
adjust the size so that all the items
get displayed properly and then we also
want to label control so let's drag and
drop that and let's change the text
property of this label control to be
empty okay
all right so whenever I make selections
you know as as soon as I make selections
those selections should be added to this
list box control and when do we do that
obviously how do we know if a selection
has changed for a checkbox in list
control the check box list control has
got the selected index change the event
okay which gets fired when you check or
uncheck these list item objects of this
check box list control okay so we can
make use of that event so when I double
click the check box list control the
event handler for selected index changed
get generated and here we write the code
so what do we basically want to do you
know as soon as the selection changes we
want to add the selected items to the
list box control and keep in mind both
of these controls our list controls
meaning both of them are actually
collections of list item objects okay so
now what I want to do is to loop through
all the list item objects within this
check box list control check which of
them are selected and then take that
list item object and add it to the list
box control okay so let's do that let's
loop through each list item object
within the check box list control so
check box list 1 dot items collection
and then if that list item is selected
okay if the list item is selected then
what we want to do we want to add that
to the list box so list box is also a
collection of list item objects so list
box 1 dot items dot add and if you look
at this add method it is expecting a
list item object to be passed in do we
have the list item object yes I do have
that so let's go ahead and pass that
there okay so that's it now let's go
ahead and run this and see how far we
have thought now at the minute as soon
as you make a selection you know they
should be added to this list box but
then look at that it's not adding them
why is that because the selected index
change the event of the checkbox list
control is a cached even it will not
immediately post back to the server if
you want to do that you have to set the
auto post property to true for that
checkbox list control so set the auto
post back property to true so now if we
run this it should add you know as soon
as I select my item look at that that is
added to the list box control now when I
select this item the next item within
the check box list control we are going
to get an exception okay cannot have
look at the exception cannot have
multiple items selected when the
selection mode is single now we have
discussed about list box control in the
previous session of this video series
now this list box control can have a
single or multiple selection mode okay
to solve this error all you have to do
is to set the selection mode property to
multiple okay because if you set the
selection mode property to single and
then if you look at the code you know
you're looping through each list item
object of the checkbox list control and
then you are fetching each selected item
of that checkbox list control and adding
that to the list box control and the
list box controls selection mode is
single but then if you select more than
one item in the check box list control
both of the list item objects within the
check box list control will have
selected property true and then your
list box control selection mode is
single so obviously to a list box
control whose selection mode is single
you cannot add you know more than one
list item object whose selected property
is set to true okay so now if we run
this what's going to happen let's
actually cancel that one that once again
so now the error should go away so I
select diploma okay diploma is selected
I select graduate there is a slight
problem here look at that when I
selected graduate diploma is headed
twice and graduate once that's because
every time I select what's going to
happen this even get fired and then it
loops through again and adds the items
that we have selected so it already had
diplomat the first time and then when I
selected graduate it's going to add
diplomat graduate again so that's why we
have this duplication so how do we solve
that to simply solve that you can just
say I terms of I mean list box 1 dot
items dot clear so every time you come
into this event clear the existing items
from the list box and then loop through
the check box list and then see which
other items are selected add them to the
list box control ok so now when I select
this I have diplomatic post graduate ok
so it's working as expected now ok now
but then if you look at this these items
are also selected in the list box and if
you look at the presentation here
they're not selected in the list box
here so I I don't want these items to be
selected in the list box and how do I
you know prevent that from being
selected it's very simple if you look at
let's close this now if you look at the
add method of the list box okay there
are two overloaded versions of this
method one method which takes in a list
item object and all these list item
objects that are being added to the list
box has their selected property turned
on that's why they are also selected
when added to the list box and we don't
want that but there is another
overloaded version which takes the text
of that list item object so I am just
going to pass the text of the list item
object so now if we run this since we
are not passing in the entire list item
object ok look at that I should get only
the items that I have you know selected
here and that to their text is added
since we are not passing in the selected
property for that list item object which
will be defaults by default hence they
will not be selected there all right now
what else we want to do we want to show
the number of items that the user has
selected and how do we do that
you have a label control that is capable
of displaying that and if you look at
this list box control it has the number
of elements okay so you can use the cone
property of that list box so I'm going
to say label one the text is equal to I
mean how do I get the number of items
selected I can just say list box 1 dot
items dot count that gives us the total
number of items that are present in the
list box can where that just string and
then we can say you know I terms
selected okay so let's run this now and
see if we get what we expect so diploma
so one item selected and it's changing
okay but then if I uncheck them zero
item selected okay we have the message
as expected but then the other thing is
we want to show the right color okay so
how do we do that if you know in the
check box list if we don't have any
items selected okay if checkbox list one
dots selected index we know that it will
return minus one if no item is selected
so if the selected index of the checkbox
list is minus one then what we want to
do we want to change the color of the
label so label dot for color and if you
look at the intelligence here the for
color property expects system dot
drawing dot color okay so system the
drawing dot color and we want that to be
red color else what we want we want to
change the color of that label to be
black
okay and one last thing you know it's
bolded as well so we can do that in the
HTML I want the text within the label
control to be bolded so we can set the
font bold is equal to true okay so let's
run this now
so one item selected two items selected
if I uncheck them you know zero items
select then that two in red color as
expected on this slide you can find
resources for asp.net c-sharp and
sequence of interview questions that's
it for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
