this video well discuss jQuery droppable
which yet let us understand this with an
example here we've got three boxes with
the first box we have got a list of
countries and cities what we want to do
is from the first box we want to be able
to drag and drop countries onto
country's box and cities onto CDs box if
I try to drop a country onto a CD box or
a CT on to a country box that should not
be allowed and the element should revert
to its original position so let's see
how to achieve this in the interest of
time I have already typed the required
HTML to produce this UI and here is that
HTML so here the first development is
going to produce the first box here and
if you look at that development notice
that we are applying a style class div
class and here is that style class if
set the border to three pixels solid
black font size 25 pixels background
color light gray with 250 pixels padding
5 pixels display style inline - table so
this display style is going to render
these three developments side by side
okay and within that development we have
that literal text countries and cities
and then we have got an unordered list
and within the unordered list we have
the countries and cities the important
thing to notice here is the data - value
attribute for countries the data - value
attribute is set to country and for
cities it is set to city and here we
have the div for the second box so the
idea of that is diffic entry's and we
have an unordered list there with ID
countries so this is going to produce
the second box and the third div for the
third box so within the third day we
have an unordered list with ID equals
cds okay so that's the HTML and we have
another style class here a lie so
basically this style is applied to the
list item so we have set the font size
to 20 pixels so that's the HTML and
styles and I have the exact same HTML
and styles here and when
you the page and the browser this how it
is rendered now we want to be able to
drag these list items from the first box
so what I'm going to do is the ID of the
unordered list within the first dev is
source so within our jQuery ready
function I'm going to find that
unordered list element so the idea of
that is source I am going to make that
draggable so let's save the changes and
let's reload this so now these list
items should be draggable look at this
when I make the unordered list draggable
that's the idea of the unordered list
right so now I am able to drag the
entire unordered list but that's not
what we want we actually won't be able
to drag the list item so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to say I want to be
able to drag list items that are present
within that element with that ID so
let's save the changes reload this page
now we should be able to drag and drop
each list item okay now look at this
when we are dragging the item we are
actually dragging the original item now
let's say instead of dragging the
original item we want to drag a copy of
the item so we want to leave the
original item there and drag you know
the clone of that item
to achieve that I am going to use one of
the options of this draggable widget and
that is helper so the helper the drag
helper should be a clone of the original
item that's what we are saying here so
let's save these changes let's reload
this page and look at this now when I
drag I'm actually look at that the
original item is still there I'm
actually dragging a clone of that
alright so now we want to make the list
items that are present in the countries
and cities boxes that is this list item
I mean this are not a list and this or
not unless droppable so we want to be
able to drop those list items you know
onto those unordered list elements okay
and they have got IDs for the
countries are knotted listed as
countries for cities cities cities so
what I'm going to do here is make both
of them droppable so again let's use the
jQuery ID selector so we want to find an
item with ID countries that is the
unordered list countries unordered list
and let's make that droppable
similarly I am going to do the same
thing for the cities unordered list okay
now when we drop an item what happens is
an event is triggered and that is drop
event and we want to handle that event
so I'm going to specify this javascript
object and we want to handle the drop
event and this is the function that is
going to be called when that event is
triggered okay and this function is
going to receive two parameters the
event object itself and the UI element
that trigger the event okay so this UI
parameter has a property called
draggable so this property is going to
reference the item that we dragged and
dropped okay so what do we want to do
with that item we actually want to add
it to the unordered list itself now look
at this here we made the unordered list
in or droppable but if you look at you
know this box that is actually a div
element we want that entire development
to be dropped in the sense when I drag
and drop a country I should be able to
do it on the development I should be
drop able to drop it anywhere on the
development and it should be appended to
the unordered list that is present
within that countries development right
so what I'm actually going to do is use
the ID of the development instead of the
ID of the unordered list so I'm going to
take this ID the ID of the development
and make that droppable so let's make
the div element droppable and when the
drop event is raised what we want to do
is find the unordered list within that
development which has got an ID of
countries and to that
we want to append the item that we have
just dropped and we want to do the same
thing you know with this city's
development so we actually want to make
let's actually paste it here so here the
idea of the unordered list is going to
be cities and we want to make the cities
div droppable so basically I'm going to
copy the IDS of the city div and specify
that here okay alright so let's go ahead
and reload this okay look at this when I
drag and drop I am able to drag and drop
countries under the countries box let me
drag and drop a CD look at that I am
also able to drag and drop a city onto
the countries box and if I drag and drop
a country onto the cities box I am able
to do that but that's not what we want I
should only be able to drag and drop
countries onto the countries box and
cities onto the cities box so there are
elements which we want to reject okay
and those are nothing but cities the
only elements that this countries box
should accept is those elements which
have got this data - value attribute set
to country so I have to tell it somehow
and that is using accept option so this
droppable widget has got another option
accept and you know the city is box the
city's development it should accept only
the list items so this is a selector by
the way so we can specify a selector
here so accept only the list items which
have data - value attribute equals city
okay and if you look at the HTML here
for all these city list items data -
value attribute is set to City and
similarly the countries div should
accept only those list items
where the data - value attribute is set
to country okay
so let's go ahead and save our changes
reload this page and look at this I'm
able to drag and drop country it accepts
that if I drag and drop a city on to
countries look at that that's not a
loved to be dropped there it immediately
disappears so now on to the cities box
I'm able to drop a city if I try to drag
and drop a country look at that it
immediately disappears
instead of making that element
immediately disappear if you want you
know a an animation then you can specify
the revert option on draggable so
basically what we are doing here we are
dragging and dropping an item if that is
not the right choice for the drop
destination then we want that element to
slowly revert back to its original
location instead of immediately
disappearing like that so if you want to
do that you can use the revert option of
draggable widget so here I am going to
specify revert and what items do we want
to revert we want to revert invalid
items okay so let's go and save the
changes reload this page and look at
this when I drop a country city on to
the country it slowly our reverts to
original position cities accepted if I
drag and drop a country on to CT look at
that it slowly reverts back so here we
have the HTML and CSS and here we have
the jQuery code that we just looked at
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
