banquette this is Pat 47 of a speed
water grid-view tutorial in this video
we'll discuss about sorting a grid view
control that does not use any data
source control at all please watch parts
44 to 46 before proceeding with this
video we'll be using table TBL employee
for this demo to retrieve data from this
table we have implemented employee data
access layer in the previous session of
this video series let's quickly recap
the contents of this employee data
access layer class file so this has got
this class employee with four author
implemented properties this class is
basically used to encapsulate employee
information that's present in the stable
TBL employee and if you notice the
employee data access layer class itself
it has got the static method get all
employees which is going to return list
of employees this method has also got an
input parameter sort column basically
this parameter is used by this method to
determine the column based on which to
sort employee data and if we look at the
implementation of this method it's
pretty straightforward ad or Ted Kord
first of all we are creating a variable
of type list employee but then using the
configuration manager class to read the
connection string from web config file
we are then using that connection string
to build our sequel connection object
and then look at the sequel query select
star from TBL employee this is assigned
it to a variable of type string and then
if the input parameter sort column if it
is not null or empty we are then
appending this order by Clause to our
sequel query and then using that sequel
query we are building our sequel command
object opening the connection executing
the command and then looping through
each you know row and then building an
employee object adding that employee
object to the list once we are done
looping through each row we then finally
return that list so that's our employee
data access layer now let's flip where
from one or aspx to the design mode
let's drag and drop our crib view
control let's sort of format that to
choose brown sugar scheme now I don't
want to use any
sort of data source control so within
the page load event of our webform one
dot aspx okay if not is postback meaning
if this is the initial get request of
this webform then I want to invoke you
know get all employees method of
employee data access layer now this
method takes an input parameter sort
column so we can specify the column
based on which we want to sort the data
if you don't want to sort the data by
any column then simply pass null but I
want to sort the data based on employee
ID and this method returns list of
employee so I'm going to set that as the
data source for our grid view control
and then invoke data bind method at the
moment for our grid view control sorting
is not enabled let's go ahead and enable
sorting and to do that get to the
properties of the grid view control by
pressing f4 and then click on this
properties icon by default allow sorting
is false but let's set that to true all
right so now let's run this as you might
expect when the grid we control renders
it's going to sort the data based on
employee ID column all right let me
click on this column and notice that I
get a runtime error grid b1 fired
event sorting which wasn't handled so
let's handle this event
so first let's generate the event
handler so let's get to the properties
of the grid we control click on the
events icon and then double-click on
this event sorting to generate the even
handler and notice this this even
handler method receives an object
grid-view sort event arguments object
okay and if you notice this object has
got you know two properties which are
very useful to us sort expression so
this property is going to contain the
column on which the user has clicked so
that will tell us by which column the
end-user want to actually sort the data
and then I have another parameter
which is sort direction this is going to
tell us whether to sort the data in
ascending or descending order okay and
if you look at this sort of direction
this is actually an enum so that's an
enum if I right-click on that and go to
definition so look at this ascending and
this is descending all right so let's
use those two properties of that object
to actually implement sorting so I'm
going to call employee data access
layers get all employees method and
notice this this method expects a sort
column to be passed in so how do I get
the column based on which the end user
want to sort I can use this object sort
expression that's going to give me the
column name but then I also want to
specify but that I want to sort the data
in ascending or descending order and to
do that so that's our sort expression
and then we need to give it a space and
then I want to specify the sort
direction whether I want to sort it in
ascending or descending order and then
we are going to set that as the data
source for our grid view control and
then invoke the data bind method okay so
let's run this and see what's going to
happen okay so let me click on this
column and look at what is happening
it's saying incorrect syntax near
ascending okay so let's see what what is
actually happening here so if you look
at this what's going to happen we pass
in sort expression basically sort
expression will be you know the column
name employee ID and then we are saying
space and then sort direction sort
direction will either be ascending or
descending so obviously our query will
be something like this select star from
TBL employee order by maybe employee ID
and then it will either specify you know
the sort direction is either ascending
or descending so when I say ascending
and then when I execute this query I get
you know this error in correct syntax
near ascending you can actually put the
breakpoint and then when you actually
you know get into this method employee
data access layer you can actually see
that sequel query it will be exactly
similar to something like this select
star from TBL employee order by this
will be a sort expression and this or
Direction ascending or descending and to
make this query work all we need to do
is instead of ascending we can spit I
mean we need to specify a SC and instead
of descending we need to specify de SC
okay so those are the keywords that that
are recognized by sequences were not the
complete words okay so now what we
basically can do here is a small trick
that the North code behind file instead
of passing the sort direction like that
I'm going to create a variable here and
then do the conversion so string STR
let's call this sort direction and then
I'm saying okay this variable should be
equal to e dot sort direction okay if
that one is equal to sort Direction dot
ascending okay if that is ascending then
I want to set that to a SC for ascending
if it is not ascending then we know it's
going to be descending in which case I
want to set it to de sá so basically we
are saying you know set this variable if
this expression evaluates to true then
use this value otherwise use this value
and then finally I will pass this to
this method that's it okay so now we
should be receiving you know ascending
or descending so let me run this
okay so it's sorted by employee ID in
ascending order let me click on name so
it's sorted in ascending order let me
click on the name once again look at
this is it sorting in the descending
order no matter how many times you click
it's not going to sort that in the
descending order and why is that let us
understand why is it not sorting in the
descending order
that's because let's actually comment
this lines and then let's say the spawns
dot right then I'm saying sort
expression is equal to e dot sort
expression then let's say response dot
right put an HTML break there and then
let's say what are we getting is the
sort expression so
sort expression sort direction not
expression e dot sort direction let's
actually convert that to string as well
all right now let me run this and see
what's going to happen what values am I
getting for that sort expression and
sort direction let's examine that so I
click on employee ID the first time it's
a sort expression is employee ID and so
our direction is ascending I click on
that once again look at that no matter
how many times you click the sort
Direction is always going to be
ascending and if sort a direction is
going to be ascending then what we are
saying if short direction is ascending
said that to ascending ok so since it's
always - is ascending we are always
going to get ascending within this
variable and that's what is getting
passed to this method that's why we only
have the data sorted in ascending order
ok so if for example if I click on name
look at that sort expression its name
and this odd direction is ascending and
no matter how many times I click it's
always going to be ascending that's why
it's not sorting the data in descending
order in our next video tutorial we will
see how to correct this so that this
bi-directional sort works as expected
