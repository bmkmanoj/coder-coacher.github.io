venket this is part 44 of asp.net video
series in this session well discuss
about the required field validator
control in asp.net in general validation
controls are used to ensure if the data
entered by the user is valid Microsoft
asp.net framework provides six built-in
validation controls these validation
controls can be found in the visual
studio toolbox under validation tab you
can see the validation controls here
compare custom range regular expression
required field and validation summary
controls in general these validation
controls can be used to perform both
decline side and server side validation
now browsers understand only client
scripts and HTML in the past to perform
the client-side validation developers
themselves had to write the custom
JavaScript with validation controls in
place we don't have to do that anymore
all we have to do is drag and drop these
validation controls on the web form
configure some of the required
properties and that's said when the page
renders these validation controls are
going to emit the required JavaScript
which is going to perform the
client-side validation for us but then
keep in mind these client-side scripts
can spread viruses and cause security
concerns because of each users may
disable JavaScript on their browsers and
if that happens client-side validation
is kept that's why it's always a good
practice to perform the server-side
validation irrespective of whether
client-side validation is done or not in
this example in a bit we'll discuss
about how to do both the client-side and
server-side validation using these
validation controls as part of this
example we need to design a form where
the user can enter his name and select
his gender and then a button to submit
the form to the server for processing so
first let's go ahead and design this
webform just to save some time and
typing I have this HTML already typed in
so let's flip to visual studio here I
have a simple asp.net web application
project let's go in and paste that
copied HTML here okay so if you look at
the design it's exactly what we have
seen on the screen there is a text here
on name and then a text box for the user
to enter their name
and then text gender a drop-down list
which shows the genders so here if you
look at the drop-down list we have three
items within the drop-down list the
first item is like a prompt for the user
select gender and the value for that is
minus one and the next item is male
value is male and the final item is
female and the value is female and then
finally we have this button control
whose ID is set to button save and text
is set to save the width of the button
is obviously hundred pixels there and
then finally we have a label control
which is used to display the status if
the data is properly saved to the
database or if there are any validation
errors okay so that's a simple waveform
design there so obviously when I
double-click this button the even
handler for the button click gets
generated and that's when we want to
save the data to the database but before
that we want to perform the validation
on the client side okay and to do the
validation on the client side we can
make use of the validation controls that
asp.net framework provides for us now
what we basically want to do is I want
to ensure both these fields are are
entered by the user before they try to
submit this form okay so to do that we
have a validator control required field
validator control as the name suggests
this validator control ensures that the
user has entered some data into the
controls before he submits the form for
processing so let's see how to use that
validator control so let me flip to the
source mode here and then the first
thing I want to validate is the name of
the user so to capture the name of the
user I have this text box txt named so
let me drag and drop a validation
control onto the webform the required
field validator control and if you look
at this validator control just like any
other standard asp.net control it has
got the ID and run at is equal to server
attributes let give let's give this idea
require a meaningful name required field
validator name because this is going to
validate the name textbox and then
obviously error message is the message
that we want to display when the control
fails the validation the message that I
want to display here is name is required
all right and the next property that we
want to configure that's most important
is the control to validate property this
is the property which is going to tell
the validation control all right this
validation control you have to validate
this control or some other control now
we want to tell that to the validator
control how do we do that using control
to validate property here we have we
specify the ID of the control that we
want to validate in this case the text
box text box ID is txt name so I'm going
to take that ID and specify that as the
value for the control to validate
property of the required field validator
control that's it so now save this and
if we run the project and if we try to
submit the page without entering a name
then it's going to prompt the user to
actually enter the name so I click Save
so name is required I get that and the
webform is not submitted to the server
for processing all this validation at
the moment is happening on the client
side and if you look at that message
that's in black color so obviously if
you want to change that you can specify
the for color just like any other
control so for color let's say I want
that we read and I do that there okay
that's good now we have another control
that I want to validate that's drop-down
list in this case so let me drag and
drop another control or let's copy and
paste this so I want another required
field validator control to validate the
selection within the drop-down list so I
have pasted that here and this is going
to validate the gender so I'm going to
call this required field at gender and
then the error message gender is
required and for color is going to be
red and the control to validate and this
is what is very important so this
validator control should validate the
drop-down list and the ID of the
drop-down list is DDL gender so pick up
that ID and specify that as the value
for control to validate property that's
it now let's go ahead and run this and
try to you know submit the form without
selecting the name and gender and see if
we get the validation error messages
okay I haven't entered the name and
selected the gender click Save look at
that
name is required but where is the error
message for gender it's not coming and
that's because we have the select gender
item already selected in the drop-down
list so the required field validator is
thinking that okay there is a selection
within the drop-down list which means
the user has applied a value but we know
that that is the initial value in the
drop-down list and not a value that the
user has selected okay
so if that's the case we need to specify
that to the required field validator and
how do we do that the required field
validator has got a property called
initial value and you need to specify
what is the initial value so do you
specify select gender or minus one we
need to specify minus one because that's
the drop-down list selected value item
when the when select gender is selected
the value is minus one so we have to
specify the value which is minus one
here so now if I run and if I try to
submit the form without selecting the
gender you know we get the error message
as expected say so name is required
gender is required as expected
now the validation is happening on the
client side without even submitting the
form to the server for processing okay
and all this is done by the JavaScript
that is emitted by these validation
controls okay now in general these
validation controls you know for example
the control to validate is common to all
validation controls
similarly error message is common to all
validation controls as far as required
field validated control is concerned the
only property that is specific to this
control is the initial value property
okay now there are other properties
which are common to every other
validation control for example there is
a property called text okay if I specify
text as for example star here look at
what's going to happen if I flip the
form to design mode now look at this
instead of the error message it's using
the text so when I run this form and try
to submit without prodding a value for
the gender you know the text property is
used so the star is displayed here and
not the error message now there are
reasons why we use this error message
and text properties when when we talk
about validation summary control we'll
understand
that but for now understand that when we
specify both text and error message
properties then text property will be
shown by the validation control by
default okay and there is another
property called display again we'll talk
about that just in a bit Anil in a later
session so don't worry about that
property for the time being okay now
when I run this and then try to submit
the form without providing the values
for the required fields obviously I get
validation errors okay but then remember
users can disable client-side validation
by disabling JavaScript so if it's
Internet Explorer I can go to tools
internet options and go to the Security
tab and then on local intranet go to
click on custom level scroll all the way
down and somewhere at the bottom you
should see something called scripting
and by default that's enabled click on
the disable radio button click OK you
will get security 1 and click yes and
click ok now the javascript is disabled
on the browser okay now before we do any
processing let's change the code here so
when I click Save button we want to save
the data to the database now I'm not
going to save the data to the database
but then we are going to just you know
when we we know that when the user
clicks this button and if the form is
posted back to the server we are going
to save the data to the database so we
have this label label status on the
webform this particular label I want to
display a message their label status dot
text is equal to data saved successfully
ok that's fine so now if we run this
remember we have disabled JavaScript on
the client browser window ok so I
haven't selected anything here I click
Save button look at that it is showing
that message data saved successfully and
I still get my validation error even
upon post back you know on on the server
side you know the server has detected
these two fields are required and and
they are not popular
so I get the errormsgs back but then the
code in the button click is also
executed meaning if we had a do dotnet
code here to save the data to the
database it would have saved an empty
field into the name column and you know
select gender into the gender column
which would have been I mean we didn't
expect that to happen
okay so how do we validate the page on
the server-side you know I want to check
okay did every validation control pass
validation if that's the case only then
save the data to the database otherwise
display a message you know just like how
it is showing here display this message
here but don't save the data so how do
we determine that on the server side all
you have to do is use one property there
is a property called if page dot is
valid property so this is a boolean
property which is going to return a true
or false this property will return true
if all the validation controls has
passed you know validation otherwise
this property is going to return false
so if page dot is valid we know that all
the validation controls has passed
validation which means the user has
provided the required data and then it
is safe to save data in which case you
write the ad or dotnet code here to save
data to the database otherwise if the
page is not valid that means at least
one of the validation controls has
failed validation in which case we want
you know display a message to the user
stating that data is not saved so label
status dot text we can say you know
validation failed
data not saved okay and then probably if
you want to give you know some color so
label status that full color is equal to
system dot drawing dot color dot red
okay on the other hand you know if it
successfully saves maybe I want to green
color or whatever okay so now let's put
a breakpoint here let's run this one and
see what is this property going to
return when we actually submit the page
without entering at least one of the
required fields so let the form load
okay so we have the form loaded let me
click the Save button so we hit that
breakpoint there and look at this page
what is valid that returns false and
then if it returns false it's going to
come to the else block and I press f5
and as you expect validation failed data
not saved
now client-side validation is not done
now because the client has disabled the
JavaScript so the JavaScript will not
run on the client browser and the web
page will be submitted to the server for
processing and in that case on the
server we are still checking okay is the
page valid if s then submit the data
otherwise display this error message
okay now on the other hand let's apply
everything for example name let's say
presume and let's say gender as male and
now I click Save button look at that
page dot is valid true okay I press f5
and data saved successfully so keep in
mind if all even if one validation
control fails validation look at that
this property is going to return false
if all the validation controls on the
page passes validation only then this
page dot is valid property is going to
return true in which case we want to
save the data otherwise we want to
display a message to the user on this
