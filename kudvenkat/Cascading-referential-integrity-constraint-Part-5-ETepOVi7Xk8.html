am venket this is part 5 of sequel
server in this session we'll understand
what is cascading referential integrity
constraint it's all about now to
understand this session properly I
strongly recommend watching parts 3 &amp;amp; 4
in part 3 we have seen how to create
tables and add primary and foreign key
constraints and in part 4 we have seen
how to add a default constraint if you
remember we have been working with
tables TBL person and TBL gender in
parts 3 &amp;amp; 4 and we have marked the
standard ID column as a foreign key
column within this TBL person table so
if I ask you what is the gender of Jade
what will you do you will check the
value of this gender ID column go to TBL
gender table check ok number two is
female so Jade's gender is female now
let's imagine what's going to happen if
I delete this female record from TBL
gender table obviously Jade and Mae
records will have no meaning so if I ask
you what is Jade's in Mae agenda
number two we don't have a corresponding
record here so we will not be able to
tell their gender so these two records
Jade and Mae will become orphan records
that's why by default sequel server
doesn't allow these kinds of deletes
okay let's flip back to sequel server
management studio and if you look at the
sample data that we have within these
two tables now if you look at Simon he
is I mean the gender of Simon is 2 which
is female now let's imagine what's going
to happen if I delete this female record
from TBL gender table mind you in TBL
person there are still rows referring
that value so obviously when I try to
delete I get an error okay look at this
the error says there is you know the
delete statement conflicted with the
reference constraint TBL person gender
FK okay so what is this TBL person
gender FK if you remember in part 3 of
this
Cirie's we have created a foreign key
constraint with this name TBL person
gender FK so what is this constraint
saying this constraint is basically
saying so if we expand this table tables
and column specifications so in TBL
person in TBL person the gender ID
column is referring to ID column in TBL
gender so that's what we have said
using this foreign key constraint okay
now if you look you know if you scroll
down a little bit in this foreign key
relationships window there is this
insert and update specification and by
default if you look at the delete and
update rule it is set to no action so
the default is no action so if it is set
to no action and when you try to delete
any of the existing rows when you try to
delete any of the existing rows for
which there are references in TBL person
obviously if we allow that row to be
deleted these rules will become orphan
records and they will and that kind of a
delete will not be allowed by default
okay which is no action so if you
remember for specifying the cascading
referential integrity you know you have
four options
the default is no action in which case
you get an error and the statement will
be rolled back okay but you can also
specify cascade set null and set default
first let's look at set default now if
you remember in the previous session we
have seen how to set a default it using
a default constraint so if you look at
the constraint that we have already on
TBL person table so it's called default
on TBL person on gender ID column and we
specified that if somebody doesn't
supply a value for the gender ID column
then we want to use a default of 3
that's what this default constraint us
and if you're not sure how to set up a
default constraint I strongly recommend
watching the previous session in this
video series okay now what you can
basically do
is in this file foreign key constraint
vendor can insert an update
specification section let's say if
somebody tries to delete a row I want to
set it to a default click OK save the
changes now if somebody tries to delete
ok we already have a female record I
mean we have this female record here if
somebody tries to delete this female
record from TBL gender table we said any
dependent rows you know set it to
default and the default that we have
here is it it's gonna set that to 2 to 3
ok so now let's try to delete this and
see what's going to happen and we select
the data back you should see Simon
gender ID set to default which is 3 okay
and along the same lines you have other
options as well
you can either cascade the delete and
update operation or you can set to now
ok let's see how set null works so
obviously if you want to change the
update and delete cascade operation so
you come to the insert and update
specification in the delete rule let us
say I want to set null instead of set
default close and save it now let's go
let's go back to the tables
so in TBL person table if you look at
this there are let's say John and rich
they are the gender is male now let us
say I want to delete this male record so
what did we specify in cascading
referential integrity we said you know
use set null okay so when I delete this
male record from this table from the
primary key table what's going to happen
for the dependent rows the gender ID for
the dependent rows will be set to now so
in this case John and rich fros will be
set to now so let's execute that now
let's select the data back so John and
Ray
gender ID is set to now okay and a final
option that we have is cascade okay as
the name suggests we want to cascade the
update and delete operation to the
dependent table okay so how do we do
that go into the foreign key constraint
window and insert and update
specification section instead of set now
we will say cascade close that save now
if you look at in TBL gender we have
number three unknown and there are three
people Simon Sarah and Johnny whose
gender ID is unknown now if I go ahead
and delete this record from TBL gender
table all the dependent rows will also
be deleted from TBL person table so in
this case these three rows will be
deleted okay so gone all you know those
three rows are gone now okay
so basically you know there are four
options available for you when setting
up cascading referential integrity
constraint the default is no action you
know if you said this option by default
you get an error and the update and
delete statements will be rolled back
otherwise you can cascade the updates
and deletes or you can set null you know
the dependent rows can be set to none or
they can be set to defaults here you can
