this video we'll discuss how to keep
draggable element always on top of other
draggable elements on the page let's
understand this with an example here
we've got four developments and we
applied the style class to each of those
div elements as a result those
developments will be rendered like this
with no jQuery ready function we are
finding those developments and calling
the jQuery white trackable function as a
result these developments will now be
draggable I have this exact same code
already typed and when we view this page
in the browser this is how those
developments are rendered and notice I
can drag these developments and read
there is the first element to be
rendered as a result look at this this
always stays below the other draggable
developments and this brown div is the
last element and when we drag this
notice it stays always on top of the
other draggable developments but if we
look at this Greendale this stays on top
of red there but below the blue and
brown there that's the default behavior
now what we want to do is any element
that we are dragging we want that
element to be on top of all the other
draggable developments on this page to
achieve that we use the stack option of
this draggable widget so basically we
are saying here we want to stack this on
top of any development that has this
class applied div class so that's a
selector so let's save our changes
reload this page and now notice an I
dragged red there it stays on top of all
the other developments if we start to
track blue there now it is on top of all
the other draggable developments
similarly green div now is on top of all
the other draggable div elements so how
is jQuery doing this
behind the scenes what jQuery is doing
is changing the z-index value of the
element that we are dragging so
basically it is setting that Z index to
a value greater than the Z index of any
other L
on this page as a result that comes on
top of all the other elements okay we
can actually see that using browser
developer tools
so let us reload this page and let's
launch browser developer tools and let's
start to move this red div and let's
actually see let's click on this
magnifying glass so I'm dragging this
red div and look at the z-index of that
red dev at the moment it is 5 and let's
start to drag the screen there and look
at these z-index of that green there it
is 5 greater than 4 and greater than the
z-index of any other developments on
that page so blue divs that index is 2
Brown DeWitt is 3 now let's go and drag
blue div and look at the z-index of blue
div now it is 6 greater than any other
draggable development on this page so
that's how it is doing but we have a
problem here the problem is you know
only when we start to drag the element
that's when you know it appears on top
but if I simply click on that green tea
without dragging look at that it does
not come on top I'm actually clicking
now similarly when I click on blue div
it doesn't come on top now let's say as
soon as I mouse down you know I want
that blue div to immediately come up so
whatever
div on which the mouse down event is
triggered we want that element to be on
top of all the other draggable
developments on this page page so let's
see how to achieve that so we don't have
any option for that we have to write our
custom code first of all since we are
going to write our custom code we don't
need this stack option anymore so I'm
going to find first of all we need to
associate that mousedown
event with these developments that has
the style class applied so let's find
all those developments using the class
selector and I'm going to wire up Mouse
down event handler
and within this even handler I'm going
to create a variable which is going to
keep track of maximum z-index value and
let's initialize that to zero now dollar
this so this refers to the element that
has received mousedown
event and I'm going to find all the
siblings of that development the
development on which we trigger the
mouse down event we want to find the
siblings of all those siblings of that
development and I don't want to find all
siblings I want to find those siblings
which have this class div class and I'm
going to loop through each of them using
jQuery each function and inside this
each function I'm going to create a
variable let's call it current Z and X
so we are going to retrieve the Z index
of each of the development that we are
looping through and to get that I'm
going to use this keyword here so we are
writing this within the context of this
each function so we will be looping
through each development and I'm going
to use the CSS function and ask for Z
index value and let's convert that to a
number using the number function and max
Z index equal to I am going to check if
current z-index value is greater than
max set index if that is true then
within this max Z index variable we want
to store the value that is present in
current Z index else retain what we have
caught in max Z index so by the time
this loop finishes it's going to get the
maximum Z index value next what we are
going to do outside of this each
function we are going to use this
keyword so outside of that each function
this
keyword refers to the element which has
received mousedown
event right so that's the even that
that's the element that we want to drag
so on that I'm going to call the CSS
function and said said index and I'm
going to set it to this max Z index plus
1 okay that's it so let's save our
changes reload this page and look at
that in action look at this let's stack
these on top of each other now when I
simply Mouse down on red developers I
didn't drag on that but it is on top of
all the other developments similarly I
simply click on blue there mouse down
you know it's on top of all the other
draggable div elements so here is the
stack option we have used and here is
that custom code which is going to bring
the development on top just on Mouse
down event thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
