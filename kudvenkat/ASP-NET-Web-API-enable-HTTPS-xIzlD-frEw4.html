tutorial in this video we'll discuss how
to enable HTTPS for asp.net web api
service after HTTP is enabled if a
request is issued using HTTP it will be
automatically redirected using HTTPS
let's look at this in action let's flip
to visual studio now the first thing
that we want to do is add a class file
to a Web API project so let's right
click on this employee service project
ad and we want to add a class file let's
name this file require HTTPS attribute
this class is going to inherit from
authorization filter attribute class
this class is present in a different
namespace which is system dot web dot h
TD p dot filters let's bring this
namespace n the first thing that we are
going to do here is override a method
that is present in this class so let's
type the keyword override and then when
we press space we can see all the
methods that we can override so we want
to override this method on authorization
notice this method has got a parameter
action context this parameter provides
us with access to both the request and
the response object so the first thing
that we are going to check here is F
action context dot request dot request
URI so the scheme of the request URI if
it is not equal to URI scheme HTTP so
this basically means if the request is
not issued using HTTPS then we are going
to write code which is going to
automatically redirect that request
using HTTPS else so if the request is
issued using HTTPS then we don't want to
do anything special we simply want to
execute the base class on
authorization method so if the request
is not issued using HTTPS then we are
going to use the action context object
again dot response equals we are going
to use the action context object dot
request dot we are going to use create
response method this method is present
in a different namespace which a system
dotnet dot HTTP so let's bring that
namespace
so basically if a request is issued to
this resource using HTTP protocol then
we want to send back okay we have found
the request but then whoever has issued
the request we have to use HTTPS instead
of HTTP so action context dot response
dot content is equal to new string
content and we are going to simply
include the string use HTTP instead of
HTTP so what are these two lines telling
these two lines are telling okay we have
found the URI that you are looking for
but you will have to use HTTPS instead
of HTTP and then what we are going to do
is we are going to automatically
redirect the request using HTTP and for
that we are going to use your eye
builder class let's call the instance
also URI builder equals new URI builder
and we are going to build the URI from
the request object from the original
request object so let's use the action
context dot request dot request URI so
everything that we have in the original
request we we need that we are going to
create a new URL using all that
information now what we want to change
is the protocol so instead of using HTTP
we want to use HTTP and obviously with
HTTP will have a different port number
so we are also going to change the port
number so URI build a dot scheme equals
your I dot your I scheme HTTP so we are
changing this scheme to HTTPS and
similarly URI build
dot port equals the port number the HTTP
port number for our project so let's go
to the project properties window by
pressing f4 and here we see the HTTP
port number which is 4 4 3 5 2 and then
finally we need to set this URI within
the location header so let's use the
action context object again dot response
dot headers and the head of hereafter is
the location header that is equal to URI
builder dot URI so we have a filter here
now we need to register this filter so
let's go to our web api config and in
here let's use this config object which
is coming into the function as the
parameter config dot filters dot add new
require HTTP attribute right so now
let's give our solution a build builder
succeeded
now let's issue a request using HTTP
protocol look at this as soon as I hit
enter it automatically redirects it to
HTTPS let's understand what's happening
behind the scenes let's launch browser
developer tools by pressing f12 Kay and
let's click on this network tab
now let's issue the request once again
so let's try to issue a request using
HTTP protocol as soon as we hit enter we
are redirected to HTTPS and look at this
here we've got two requests now look at
the first request with that we got three
zero two status code and there is
another request to the same URI and we
get 200 look at this if we inspect this
so we first issued a request using HTTP
protocol and look at what we have caught
back
we have caught back 3:02 found status
code so basically we found it and then
within the response that we have caught
back we have also this location header
so this is basically telling this is
where they actually where is so we have
to issue the request using HTTP so
browser found this status code 3:02
and within the location header we have
the URI where we have the resource so
the browser automatically reissued the
request using this HTTP URL so here is
that request so we should a request
using HTTP and the response that we got
is 200 ok the data from the server
whatever happens in the browser the same
thing also happens inside la notice
those two requests are captured by
fiddler with the first request
we got status code 3:02 and with the
second status code 200 let's inspect the
first request if we look at the raw
request notice the request is issued
using HTTP protocol and if we look at
the raw response we got status code 3:02
found and the location header is set to
HTTPS and look at the message use HTTPS
instead of HTTP here we are missing the
closing P tag that's basically because
we're missing the closing P tag right
here
so fiddler has seen the status code 3:02
and it also has seen the location header
so it automatically reissued the request
using HTTPS
since the request is issued using HTTPS
we can't see the request and response
that we got to be able to see the
request and response we will have to
enable decryption notice the message
right here HTTPS decryption is disabled
click to configure so we can either
click on this message right here to
enable decryption or we can click on
Tools telluric fiddler options and then
click on HTTP
stab check this checkbox decrypt HTTP
traffic
let's also ignore server certificate
errors click ok now let's close Google
Chrome browser window browser relaunched
now notice within fiddler we've caught a
lot of traffic logged let's go ahead and
delete all these requests now let's
issue a request using HTTP protocol
notice it is redirected to HTTPS and now
if we look at fiddler these are the last
three requests that are issued so this
is the one which is issued using HTTP
notice we got status code 3 0 2 location
header and it automatically redirected
to HTTPS notice we can't see the
encrypted data here both within the
request and response
so what fiddler has done here is
reissued the request using its own
certificate and here is that request
again with that request we got status
code 200 notice here we can see that URL
to which we have issued the request and
now we are able to see the data that we
got from the server at the moment if you
look at the constructor of the string
content class that we are using we're
using the overloaded version which takes
only one parameter but there is another
overloaded version which takes three
parameters and here we can also set the
media type which sets the appropriate
headers on the response now if you look
at the response that we have got here
for the status code 3:02 notice within
the response the message that we have
here use HTTP instead of HTTP this is
actually HTML because the message is
present inside a paragraph element but
if you look at the content type here it
is set to text slash plain the content
type should have been text slash HTML
because that's what we have here and to
set the correct header we can use this
overloaded version which has got three
parameters so let's go ahead and set
encoding
encoding is present then system dot text
namespace so make sure you have that
using declaration and end coding is
going to be utf-8 and the media type is
going to be text slash HTML let's give
our solution a build build succeeded
now let's reissue the request using HTTP
redirect it to HTTPS and if we look at
the request so here we have the 3:02
request and if we look at the raw
response notice first of all we have the
closing P tag and the content type is
also set to text slash HTML as expected
at the moment we are using the register
method of the web api convict class to
register this require HTTP filter this
enables HTTP for the entire web API
application that is for all the
controllers and action methods now if
you want to enable HTTPS only for
specific controllers within your web API
application then don't reduce to the
filter using register method instead
decorate only those controllers for
which you want to enable HTTPS using
this require HTTP attribute so this
enables
HTTP only for the employees controller
all the action methods within this
controller will use HTTP now if you want
to enable HTTPS only for specific action
methods within a controller then
decorate those action methods with this
attribute require HTTP so this require
HTTP filter provides us with that level
of flexibility here is the code that we
just discussed thank you for listening
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
