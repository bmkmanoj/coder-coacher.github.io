in this video we'll discuss inheritance
in JavaScript with examples
object-oriented programming languages
support inheritance since javascript is
also an object-oriented programming
language it supports inheritance in
object-oriented programming languages
like C sharp in Java to implement
inheritance we make a class inherit from
another class in JavaScript we don't
have the concept of classes so
inheritance in JavaScript is said to be
prototype paste this means to implement
inheritance in JavaScript an object
inherits from another object let's
understand this with an example let's
flip to visual studio so first let's go
ahead and create a constructor function
to construct an employee object so at
the moment you know we have an employee
object and it has got one public field
that is named note this employee object
let's add a function get name is going
to be the name of the function and this
function is simply going to return the
name of the employee
now let's create another constructor
function which is going to create a
permanent employee
all right so at the moment we've got two
constructor functions employee and
permanent employee this constructor
function is going to construct an
employee object and this one is going to
construct a permanent employee object
now this employee object is going to be
the base type so all the properties
common to different types of employees
will be present in this constructor
function and then here you know this
permanent employee object will have only
the property specific to permanent
employee for example annual salary is
specific to permanent employee that's
why that field is present here whereas
name is common to all types of employees
that is permanent employee contact
employee etc now what we want to do is
associate the employee object has the
parent for permanent employee and to do
that we use the prototype property so
first let's go ahead and create an
employee object so where employee equals
new employee so basically we are using
this constructor function to create an
object of type employee and then let's
pass marked as the name of the employee
now we want this object to be acting as
the parent for permanent employee so
permanent employee dot prototype equals
employee so now employee is going to be
the parent for permanent employee so now
let's go ahead and create an instance of
permanent employee
so we're let's call this PE equals new
permanent employee and then look at this
this constructor expects annual salary
let's pass 50,000 as the annual salary
now look at this permanent employee and
employee are related through inheritance
so permanent employee objects should be
able to access
the methods that are defined in employee
constructor function so basically
employee object has got get name
function but look at the permanent
employee doesn't have get name function
but I should still be able to call get
name function using the permanent
employee object that's because permanent
employee and employee type are related
to each other through inheritance and
this is where that relationship is
established so now let's write this to
the webpage so let's save the changes
load the page and it should print mark
now we can also check the type of you
know this object so for example let's
alowed this alert be instance of
employee now keep in mind permanent
employee is derived from employee right
so here is that association so this
should actually return true let's reload
the page notice that it says true
because in a permanent employee is a
type of employee and similarly when we
say PE is instance of permanent employee
the actual type of that permanent
employee is permanent employee right so
even this is going to return true so
notice that it again returns true and
this is the same example which we just
discussed now if you add a new method to
the parent object it becomes
automatically available in the derived
object so at the moment look at this
within the parent type that is our
employee object we have one function now
if I'm going to add another function
let's say employee dot prototype dot
let's call this get name length
basically we want to find the number of
character
in the name of the employee so this is
going to return this dot name dot length
and here let's go ahead and call B dot
look at that the intelligence
immediately shows the name of the
function which is cat named length which
we have just added to the employee
object and it's automatically available
within the derived object that is
permanent employee object so let's save
these changes and let's reload this and
notice that it prints for that error
that is there are four characters in the
name of the employee and there is this
method called has own property which we
can use to determine if a property is
actually defined on the actual object or
its prototype so if you look at for
example this name property this is
defined on the employee object whereas
annual salary property is defined on
permanent employee now if you look at
permanent employee object it has access
to both name and annual salary now for
some reason if you want to determine
whether if you know the properties
belong to permanent employee or to its
prototype you can use this method has
owned property method so let's actually
try to document dot right now we have
the employee object so let's actually
print this text employee dot name : plus
employee dot has on property name so
basically if this method returns true
then we know that that property is
defined on the employee object otherwise
it's not it belonged to the prototype so
now let's include another line here so
similarly we have annual salary so
employee dot annual salary is that
defined on the employee type and let's
include another HTML break here
so now let's reload this and see what
output we get so look at that
name property is defined on the employee
object so it returns true whereas annual
salary belong to the prototype that is
the parent so that's why it returns
false on the other hand if we say ok is
P that is permanent employee object does
it have
so let's create an instance of permanent
employee we don't have that instance
already so where PE equals new permanent
employee and let's pass five thousand
and now when we use this P dot has on
property annual salary this should
return true let's update this label as
well here so now when we reload this
notice that permanent employee dot
annual salary is defined on that so
that's why it's a is true so basically
the way this works is when we call you
know get name function on the derived
type that is when we say you know P dot
get name so basically this function is
not defined in the permanent employee
object so it's first going to check that
object okay do I have get name function
if it doesn't find it then it checks if
there is a prototype involved if there
is a prototype it checks you know the
prototype is the employee object so it
goes to the employee object and checks
ok do the employee object has get name
and it finds it there so that's why it
invokes it if it is not found even in
the employee object then you know it
throws an undefined error so for example
if we comment you know this line right
here so get name function cannot be
found now within the permanent employee
object as well as within the employee
object so when we actually load this
it's going to throw an error look at
that object isn't support property or
method get name so basically throws an
undefined error if you threw in a break
point here and then run this in debug
mode you can actually see that you know
get name is undefined thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
