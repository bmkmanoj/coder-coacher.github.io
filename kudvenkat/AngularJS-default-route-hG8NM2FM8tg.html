this video we'll discuss how to
configure a default route in angular
this is continuation to part 27 so
please watch part 27 before proceeding
we will continue to work with the same
example that we worked with in part 27
at the moment look at the route here we
are at slash home so the partial
template home dot HTML is injected into
our layout template which is index dot
HTML similarly if we navigate to slash
students then students dot HTML is
injected into the layout view now let's
see what's going to happen if we
navigate to the root of the site at the
moment if you look at our script dot J's
file and if you look at this conflict
function these are the three routes that
we have configured slash home slash
courses and slash students now let's see
what's going to happen when we navigate
to the root of the site so let's get rid
of the slash students from here so at
the moment we are on the root of the
site so when I hit enter look at what
happened none of the partial templates
is injected into the layout view we have
the same problem even if we try to
navigate to a route that is not
configured that's a for example I try to
navigate to route slash ABC and if you
look at our script our J's file we don't
have slash ABC route configured here so
when I hit enter look at that we have
the same problem no partial template is
injected into this layout template and
the reason angular is doing that is
because it doesn't know for the root of
the site or for this route slash ABC
which is not configured what partial
template to inject into this layout
template now what we want to do here is
whenever any user navigates to the root
of the site or if they navigate to a
route that is not configured then we
want angular to automatically route that
request to slash home meaning we want
home dot HTML to be injected into our
layout view so we have to configure the
default route to configure the default
route we are going to use another
function of this dollar route provider
service which is otherwise function so
we have these when functions chained so
at the end here I'm going to use another
function and that is dot otherwise and
then here we specify redirect to and the
route that we want to redirect to so we
won't redirect to slash home so if the
requested route is not slash home or
slash courses or slash students then
redirect the user to slash home so let's
save these changes and let's go to the
home page in a reload our page and then
look at this when I now navigate to the
root of the site look at that it
automatically redirected us to slash
home similarly if I try to navigate to
XYZ look at that it automatically
redirects to our default route which is
slash home on the other hand if I try to
go to courses look at that it allows us
to go to slash courses so in this case
it has injected courses dot HTML into
our layout view so that's how we
configure the default route in angular
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
