in this video we'll discuss what is a
CDN CDN stands for content delivery
network CDN is a network of computers
that exist all over the world for
example if a web application relies on
jQuery for its functionality then there
are two ways we can make the jQuery
library available for that web
application option one we can host the
required jQuery files within our own web
server and we can reference them within
our application in fact if you recollect
the application that we have been
working with in the previous session of
this video series this application
relies on jQuery for its functionality
so this is a very simple application if
you enter a number and then click the
button it's going to tell you whether if
that entered number is even or odd here
number four is even so number is even on
the other hand if I enter number three
click the button number is odd so
basically for this functionality we are
relying on jQuery okay and if you look
at the way this application is working
at the moment we have hosted the jQuery
file within our own web server and we
are referencing that within this view
now instead of referencing you know the
version of jQuery from our own web
server we can reference that from a CDN
Google has its own CDN Microsoft has one
and similarly jQuery also has one so
these companies have you know the
servers spread across the entire globe
okay and we can reference the required
jQuery file from any of the CDN and if
you look at this URL here this is
referencing jQuery version 1.7.1 from
Google CDN if you actually navigate to
jquery.com
for slash download look at this here we
have a URL for the jQuery CDN okay and
look at this URL this URL is referencing
jQuery version 110 dot
now our application requires 1.7.1
version let's actually copy this URL
let's open up a browser window let's
paste it there we require 1.7.1 so let's
try to navigate to that URL look at that
we get the required jQuery file so this
is the minified version so what we can
do is we can simply copy this URL and
then within our application instead of
referencing the local copy of the jQuery
file I'm going to get it from jQuery CDN
okay
so let's go ahead and run this
application now so now at the moment
this application should be using the
jQuery file from jQuery CDN let's see if
the application continues to work in the
same way because that it still works but
the difference here is we are
referencing the jQuery file from a CDN
similarly you know Google has a CDN and
Microsoft also has a CDN and there's
another CDN call CDN jas so if I click
on Google CDN and then Microsoft CDN
look at that if you want to use Google
CDN this is the water and you just
change the version number okay so here
are the different versions and similarly
here we have Microsoft CDN so there are
here are the waters
depending on the version of jQuery that
you require you use that URL in your
application alright so there are several
benefits of using CDN and here are they
so the number one benefit is the caching
a benefit so what do we mean by caching
benefit let's say for example now here
if you look at this our application you
see is using jQuery version 1.7.1
version from jQuery CDN now let's say
you know CNN website is also using you
know similar jQuery file
and if I have visited CNN website so the
jQuery file from the CDN is already
downloaded and then if I visit this
application our application then since
the required jQuery file is already
downloaded and cached you know when we
visit our website the file it need not
be downloaded once again so the
application is going to much be much
faster because there's one less thing to
download because it's already cached you
know our application is going to use
that cached version of the jQuery file
so we we get that benefit when we use
CDN and we also get the speed benefit
now CDN is nothing but it's a network of
servers that are spread across the globe
now let's say for example our web server
is in North America and now let's say we
have a user from India trying to access
our website so when he opens up a
browser types the water.if via hosting
liquidy file within our own web server
then that jQuery file need to be
downloaded from our web server in North
America to decline to browser in India
so it's a long way now on the other hand
if we are using CDN then there could be
a CDN within India itself so if there is
a user accessing your application from
India the jQuery library will be
downloaded from the nearest to
geographical server that's basically in
India so obviously that is going to
increase the speed of your application
as well and it's also going to reduce
network traffic to your web server now
the jQuery files are not downloaded from
your web server instead they are
downloaded from a CDN so it's going to
reduce the network traffic to your web
server and the other greatest benefit is
the parallelism benefit now there is a
limitation on how many components can be
downloaded in parallel and this
limitation is per hostname now let's say
for example we have a web page and this
web page you know requires 4 components
for it to function properly and we say
components it's basically resources
something like you know jQuery images
etc let's say there are four components
that your webpage requires and let's say
the limitation is that the browser can
only download two components in parallel
from a given host ok now since there are
four components and let's assume in our
example all these four components are
hosted on our own server on a single
server and the browser allows only two
components to be downloaded in parallel
and let's say um you know two components
take one second to download so when we
request that page what's going to happen
first two components will be downloaded
in parallel so the other two components
have to wait until the first two
components or download it and they're
going to take one second let's say so to
confidence downloading once again the
next two components are going to take
another one second so for the four
components to download to the client
machine we're going to take two seconds
in total if all of the components are
hosted on a single server on the other
hand let's say for example we are using
a CDN and two of the resources are
coming from a CDN ok so that's a
different host now CDN is one host your
web server is another host so now when
we request the web page two components
are going to be downloaded from our web
server and two components are going to
be downloaded from the CDN web server
and remember the limitation is that only
two components that are loved to be
downloaded in parallel from a given host
now we have two hosts and you know both
of these as they are different hosts now
you know two components from our web
server will be allowed to be downloaded
in parallel and at the same time the two
other components will be downloaded from
the CDN in parallel so all the four
components will be downloaded in one
second so that is parallelism benefit
and we get that by using a CDN that's it
for today thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
