one of the in speed or netcode tutorial
in this session we will discuss what is
a speed or netcode important features of
a speed or net core and advantages of
using asp.net core in the application
development lifecycle let's see what is
asp.net core asp.net core is a free and
open source web framework used to
develop the next generation of asp.net
applications asp.net core is developed
and powered by Microsoft as well as
community user base it is a modular
framework that has the capability to run
on legacy dotnet framework which runs on
Windows as well as on cross-platform
systems originally it was called asp.net
next version and then later it was
supposed to be called as asp.net 5 once
it is ready however Microsoft later
changed the name to is p.net code during
the first release and the first version
was released on 17th May 2016 at this
time of video recording is p.net core to
rot o is being used and it was released
on 14th August 2017 the first question
that comes into your mind when do we
need to use asp.net core as we have the
legacy is p.net applications if you take
a look at the comparison table given by
Microsoft it's fairly listed out when do
we need to choose is p.net core against
a speed or net now if you take a look at
the comparison table it's easy to
understand that we need to choose a
speed or Ted core when we want to build
applications for Windows Mac or Linux
machines we choose a speed or net when
we need to host the applications only on
is and it's only built for Windows
Microsoft do recommend using razor pages
in asp.net code applications whereas if
we need to build web forms or any other
traditional web pages it's recommended
to use asp.net
we definitely need to use asp.net core
then we need to run multiple application
versions on a machines also we can
develop applications using Visual Studio
Visual Studio for Mac or Visual Studio
code using c-sharp
whereas for traditional asp.net we can
use only Visual Studio with C sharp VB
or F sharp for any Windows hosted
applications Microsoft also states that
dotnet core gives higher performance on
ESP dotted of course with this statement
we're not degrading the traditionally
speed audit performance however dotnet
core has an added advantage of
performance which is better than any
traditional is p.net web applications
applications developed on asp.net core
can run on is or any other operating
systems and they are also compatible to
run on latest dotnet framework now after
this comparison you might be wondering
YZ is p.net core replacement for asp.net
the answer is certainly not in spite of
these points we can say that his speed
or net core is not a replacement for
dotnet framework and we still need to
use the dotnet framework applications
when we need to use third-party
dotnet libraries where nougat packages
are not available for any dotnet core
apps also SP dotnet signal art isn't
available for asp.net core at this
moment and of course signal R is
scheduled for asp.net core 2.1 release
as per the roadmap of microsoft releases
we still need to use asp.net as we don't
have capability of WCF service
implementations using asp.net core at
this point of time however the in speed
or net core web applications can consume
the WC of services and they should not
be a problem in the application
development from the front-end windows
workflow foundation related services the
of data services and windows
presentation foundation is still running
on the asp.net and there are no plans to
put them to the dotnet core now if
you're wondering why we need to choose
asp.net core then I would like to
mention and stress a point that cloud
based application development is
speaking up in these days and using
asp.net core along with a blend of cloud
is an additional advantage for any
developer to learn asp.net core
applications also Microsoft is moving
towards community based application
development rather than their
traditional application development
which brings the changes faster to the
asp.net core and gives an advantage over
the traditional asp.net applications
hence from our perspective we believe
learning asp.net core is a key thing not
only in the current era but the future
application development is mostly
dominated by community based development
to bring in rapid and easy changes in
the development lifecycle now with this
you might be still wondering why
Microsoft has taken this direction
towards flat form independence and
inclining towards Mac and Linux
community and why is Microsoft investing
so much money in attracting non-windows
developers first we need to understand
that in the application development
lifecycle it is unlikely that any
developer or a company will use
Microsoft sequel server in their
projects and also there is a very high
chance that these web applications will
end up somewhere on a linux box or in
Azure or in Amazon Web Services or on
Google cloud platform
hence to enable the hosting of these
applications Microsoft is promoting the
flat form independent hosting along with
the help of open source community
development and this process gives a
bigger edge to Microsoft applications so
that they can be developed using a
speedo
at core leveraging on angular react
razor or any framework as well as micro
services which can be hosted on any
platform
I hope this clarifies why Microsoft is
proceeding towards the direction of
asp.net core hence we recommend to learn
asp.net core web applications as this is
the direction of future application
development from Microsoft let's now
take a look at the key features of
asp.net core asp.net core gives an
improved support for cloud development
and it gives a greater facility with the
new gate base support you get based
approach support easy updates on the
packages and whenever a new version of
the package is released it's easy to
integrate or update the package this
gives a bigger engine development cycle
as there is no need to upgrade the whole
framework of the application
hence we believe this is a very
important feature of a speed or net core
high performance is one of the greatest
feature of asp.net core with a modular
framework then we talked about modular
framework asp.net core ships entirely as
nougat package which improves security
and performance of the solution and
reduces servicing cross-platform
compatibility is one of the best feature
of SP dotnet core along with the
flexibility of being an open source and
of course as we discussed earlier we
have an hosting independence for the
asp.net applications it has got a
built-in support for dependency
injection as well along with the support
for JSON based configurations unit
testing is one of the important feature
as well that is being covered in the
asp.net core which is implemented using
xunit dotnet I hope now you got a good
understanding about asp.net core and
when we need to choose a speed or net
core versus traditionally a speed audit
framework for the application
development in the next session we will
discuss how to create and
a web application using asp.net core
till then thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
