venket this is part 14 of a speedrun in
MVC tutorial in this video we'll discuss
mapping asp.net request data to
controller actions include parameter
types please watch part 13 before
proceeding with this video in part 13 we
discussed using form collection object
let's flip to visual studio so here we
have this create controller action
method which responds to HTTP POST
operation and this method has got this
parameter form collection object now
from path 13 it should be clear that
form collection object will
automatically receive the posted form
data okay so here we have this create
view and we have some data here for name
gender city and date of birth when I
click on this button create you know
this data will be posted to the server
and this form collection object is going
to receive you know the values from that
posted form and look at what we are
doing here we are retrieving name gender
City date of birth from this form
collection object populating the
respective properties of this employee
object this employee object is then
handed over to the side employee which
will save that employee to the database
table and finally we are redirecting the
user to the index action which is going
to list all the employees in the
database table TBL employee now do I
always have to use this form collection
object or do I have another way of
achieving the same we can use parameters
as well instead of using form collection
object for example I can use you know
string name string gender string city
date of birth this date time so date
time date of birth and now instead of
using form collection here I can use the
parameters that are coming into this
function so name
gender c'était and date of birth
all right and then the rest of the
process is same we are handing that
employee object to add employee and then
redirecting the user to the index action
okay so now let's go ahead and run this
and see if it's going to work as
expected so let's fill the form with
some data so that's the create action in
the mail city and date of birth okay now
before we hit create button let's see
how many rows to be happy at the moment
we have five rows in this database table
let's go ahead and click on this create
button look at that all the columns are
populated as expected let's quickly
check in the database table so we have
the sixth row there now how is the data
automatically
you know mapped these parameter names
now here if you look at this create view
we have you know several text boxes here
how did MVC map you know correctly name
to name parameter gender to gender city
to city and date of birth to date of
birth you know who has done this for me
in MVC that's the model binder you know
it has automatically mapped the form
data the posted form data with the
parameters here so how did the model
binder to do that mappings automatically
for us that is with the help of you know
the control names and the parameter
names they have to match now if you look
at this create view form if I right
click on that and view page source every
control on this form has got a name for
example there is a textbox here which is
capturing the name of the employee
there's a drop-down list here which is
capturing gender and then another
textbox to capture city so all these
text boxes and drop-down lists on this
form has got a name so if you look at
the name textbox here I look at that
input type is equal to text that's the
text box and look at the name value here
name is name so the name of the textbox
is name and if you look at gender here
you know this is a select list a
drop-down list is nothing but a select
list and look at the name of that select
list its gender and similarly if you
look at the city text box look at that
name is city
so here the names of these controls on
the form matches with the names of these
parameters and that's how the model
binder is able to map the control values
with these parameters automatically so
we can either use form collection object
or we can use these parameters but the
important thing to keep in mind is that
these parameters names must match with
the names of the controls on the form
otherwise model binding will not work as
expected okay so notice that this create
action method has got parameter names
that match with the names of the
controls on the form and obviously to
see the names of the form controls
simply right-click on the webform and I
mean on the form and then view the page
source now do we need to do this
mappings manually every time not really
I mean look at this here if you look at
this employee object it has got just
four properties so I'm using four
parameters there so which is fine you
know but on the other hand let's say I
have an object which has got like 20 or
25 properties or 20 or 25 controls and
if I have to map all the data to a
controller action method do I really
need to have 20 to 25 parameters no
there is another way of doing that in a
later video session we'll see how to do
that okay and another thing to keep in
mind is that the order of these
parameters is not you know it doesn't
really matter you can have gender first
name next and then date of birth and
then city you know they can appear in
any order as long as the names of these
parameters match with the names of the
form controls you know they are going to
receive the posted data all right so the
order doesn't matter what matters is the
name all right

interview questions that's it for today
