this video we'll discuss sorting a list
of complex types using comparison
delegate this is continuation to part 78
so please watch about 78 from the scene
shop tutorial before proceeding with
this video one of the overloads of the
sort method in list class expects a
comparison delegate to be passed as an
argument so at the moment if we look at
this list customers this is a list of
type customer objects and if you look at
this sort method there are several
overloaded versions of this method and
in the previous session of this video
series we've discussed using this
overloaded version which doesn't take
any parameters we also discussed using
this overloaded version which expects an
object of type icomparer in this video
we're going to discuss this overloaded
version which expects an instance of
this comparison delegate so what's the
delegate in c-sharp a delegate is
nothing but a function pointer meaning a
delegate will be pointing to a function
and then when you invoke that delegate
it's going to automatically invoke the
function to which it is pointing to and
if you want a delegate to point to a
function then the signature of that
function must match with the signature
of the delegate which it is pointing to
so that's the reason why these delegates
are called type save function pointers
and now if I have to use this overloaded
version first of all I have to create a
function to which this delegate will be
pointing to and the signature of that
function has to match with the signature
of this delegate so first of all let's
look at the signature of that delegate
so comparison of type customer let's
right click on that and go to the
definition and if we look at this
delegate it is returning an integer and
then it expects two objects of type T
okay so let's copy the signature and
then within our class let's include a
method so this is going to be a static
method and it's going to return an
integer and then
we are going to pass two instances of
our customer object okay and basically
let's give this method a meaningful name
maybe let's call this compare customer
okay so basically let's say we want the
list of customers to be sorted you know
based on their ID okay so we have to
tell that to the customer class and how
do we do that basically using this
method okay
so return so we have two instances of
customer class here x and y so return X
dot ID and ID is an integer property and
this integer type has already provided
the implementation for compareto method
so we're going to make use of that
implementation so compare the ID of this
customer object X with the ID of
customer object Y and what is this
method returning it is returning an
integer back and our function is also
returning an integer back
so basically this is the method which
will tell how we want these customer
objects to be sorted now the next step
is to create an instance of comparison
delegate so maybe let's call this
customer compare and to the constructor
of this delegate we need to pass the
name of the function to which we want
this delegate to point to so basically
we want this delegate to point to this
function look at this this delegate
expects you know a function to have an
integer
I mean return type as integer and that
function should have two customer
objects as parameters so here the
signature of this method matches with
the signature of this delegate so we can
pass the name of this function to this
constructor
okay so the next step is to basically
pass this instance to our sort method so
list customers dot sort and then we are
going to use this overloaded version
which expects an instance of comparison
delegate and we have an instance here so
let's pass that and then let's print the
customer list using a for each loop so
for each customer
let's call it say in our list of
customers let's print their IDs so
seedot ID and basically this is before
we have sorted so let's say before
sorting and let's copy these lines of
code and then print the customer list
once again after sorting okay so let's
go ahead and run this now look at that
that's before sorting and this is after
sorting okay basically we want to change
this text after sorting all right so
basically what we have done so far three
steps we create a function and the
signature of that function has to match
the signature of the delegate the
comparison delegate basically and then
we create an instances of the instance
of the delegate and that instance is
pointing to that function and then we
passed that instance as an argument to
the sort method on the list instance
okay now there's lot of you know steps
there do we really have to do all these
steps not really we can achieve that
using delegate keyword in just you know
one line like this so let's look at that
in action so instead of you know
creating a private function here and
then creating an instance of a delegate
and then passing that instance to the
sort method instead of doing all that
basically I can get rid of this function
all together and I can also get rid of
creating an instance of the delegate
here and all I'm going to do here is you
know what is this method expecting it is
expecting a delegate so I'm going to
pass a delegate here and then this
delegate expects to customer objects
maybe let's call it C one and another
customer object C two okay and then
let's include the body for this delegate
and what should this delegate do this
delegate basically should
and integer using this delegate we have
to tell the sort method how to sort our
list of customer objects so we want to
sort our list of customers using their
ID and we have two customer objects here
so we are going to tell the sort method
how we want them to be compared so
return C 1 dot ID dot compare to with C
2 dot ID so it's as simple as that so
let's run this control f5 and look at
this we have the same output but again
there's a quite a bit of code and it's a
little bit confusing okay
usage of this delegate keyword now
instead of that I can still simplify
this by using a lambda expression like
this okay so let's look at using lambda
expression so instead of that so
obviously what we need here we need to
customer objects so you can give it any
meaningful name you want maybe c1 c2 or
X comma Y give it any meaningful name
you want so I have two customer objects
such that X dot ID dot compare that with
y dot ID so it's as simple as that a
simple lambda expression so now we run
it and look at that we have the same
output
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
