tutorial in this video we'll discuss the
purpose of multiple watch windows in
visual studio in part 6
we'll discuss the basics of watch window
so please watch part 6 before proceeding
let's understand the purpose of multiple
watch windows with an example let's flip
to visual studio here I've got a very
simple console application
I'll have this code available on my blog
in case you need it
first let's inspect this customer class
so this customer class has got five
public properties that is ID first name
last name gender and salary this class
also got the static method get all
customers and this method is returning
list of customer objects as you can see
here so what are we doing within the
body of this method first we are
creating a variable of type list of
customer objects and then we are
creating five different customer objects
customer one through customer five and
then we are adding each customer object
to that list and finally we are
returning the list so a very simple
customer class there and then within the
main method we are invoking this static
method of the customer class get all
customers which is going to return the
list of customer objects so we are
storing that list within this variable
customers and then we are using a for
each loop to loop through that
collection of customers and then
printing each customers first and last
name so a very simple program now let's
place a breakpoint on the for each
statement right here and then run this
application in debug mode so the
application execution has stopped at
that breakpoint now if we go to debug
windows and then watch notice that we
have got for watch windows watch one
through watch for now have you ever
wondered the use of these multiple watch
windows these multiple watch windows are
extremely useful when we want to compare
two object properties during debugging
let's understand what we mean by the
statement with an example so let's flip
to gel studio so we have already invoked
the get all customers method so this
variable right here contains notice the
count variable it says 5 meaning this
collection contains 5 customer objects
okay now let's say I want to inspect the
values of customer one object and
customer 5 object ok now let's open a
watch window so we go to debug windows
and then we select watch watch 1 so that
opens up the first watch window so now
look at this this is the collection
which contains 5 customer objects so I
want to look at the value of the first
customer object first of all we also
have intelligence here so if I press
control space we get the name of the
variable that we are interested in
customers of 0 and when I press enter
notice that it displays the customers of
0 object and you know we are basically
able to see the first name gender ID
last name and salary now I can open
another watch window so go to debug
windows and then watch watch two so we
have another watch window here now let's
actually undock you know watch one
window and place it right here and let's
inspect the values of the fifth customer
object so customers of four so in the
fourth location of that collection we
have the fifth customer object okay so
notice that again we are able to view
the first name gender ID last name and
salary of that fifth customer object now
look at this I can place these
side-by-side and inspect their values so
here first name is Valerie your first
name is mark so very useful during
debugging now you know some people may
say that ok instead of using multiple
watch windows like this I can simply put
the fifth customer object right here
so here simply type customers of 4 and
then plus enter so obviously now here we
have customer I'm in fifth customer
object and here we have the first
customer object but the problem with
this is first of all you know this
customer object has got only five
properties but in reality
you may have an object with maybe 2025
properties and you know if you have both
objects in the same watch window you
know scrolling up and down makes it
really you know complex basically you
know when you are debugging a complex
issue you know it's much better if you
have the watch window side-by-side and
if you're looking at the properties you
know that way it will be much easier
rather than having both the objects in
the same watch window and then moving up
and down since it is only five
properties here it's very easy but if we
have a complex object with 2025
properties for example you know it
becomes a little difficult to manage
that now is it possible to get a copy of
the object window from one watch window
to another watch window yes and what you
can do is simply drag and drop it from
one watch window to another watch window
so let's open the other watch render
again you have keyboard shortcuts for
each of these watch windows so let's
open watch window too so here we have
watch window too and here we have watch
window one let's actually remove this
customers of for object now let's say I
want this customers of zero object you
know in watch two window so what I can
do is I can simply click on that hold
down the left mouse drag it and drop it
on watch window to notice that now I
will in watch window two I have
discussed
I mean first customer object as well
okay now what do you think is going to
happen if I change the value in one of
the watch windows let's change marks
name to mark M for example and then once
the press Enter
look at that that change is immediately
reflected in the other vendor okay is it
possible to replace the current object
instance with a new object instance
again during your debugging you may want
to replace the object that you have
already loaded with a new object
instance is it possible absolutely but
we'll have to make use of immediate
render now if you notice and at the
moment customers of zero we have
you know first name as mark em gender as
male you know all the other properties
now let's say during debugging I want to
you know create a new customer object
and store it in thus location maybe
because I am troubleshooting some issue
which requires that now do I have to
read in my application from the scratch
again you don't have to you can change
the object you know here while the
application is still in debug mode but
to do that we need to make use of
immediate window and to get to the
immediate window click on debug vendors
and then there you should have immediate
window or you can use the keyboard
shortcut control di so what do we need
to do we want to replace the object that
is present in customers of zero location
okay so what I'm going to do is look at
this customers of zero equals let's get
to the immediate render so customers of
zero equals new customer now look at
what's going to happen the moment I
press enter so here basically we are
creating a new customer object notice
that all the reference type properties
are set to null and the value type
properties that is integer properties
are set to their defaults which is zero
and if you look at what happened to the
object that is stored within customers
of zero location look at that they got
their defaults whatever we have
specified right here and if you look at
the other watch window let's actually
look at watch to notice what happened
and watch window two as well the same
case here that's it for today thank you
for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
