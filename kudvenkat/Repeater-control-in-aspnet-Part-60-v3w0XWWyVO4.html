am Frank eight this is part sixty of
asp.net preview tutorial in this video
we'll discuss about the similarities and
differences between grid view and
repeater controls and when to use could
be control over repeater and vice versa
let's first understand the similarities
with an example let's clip to visual
studio the first thing I want to do here
is create an HTML table just to speed
things up I have you know some HTML
already typed so let me copy and paste
that you know within this waveform and
then we'll go with that so all we have
here is a table with one table draw
which has got two TDs in that in the
first TD I'm going to have a grid view
control so let's a drag and drop a grid
view control and then in the second TD
I'm going to have a repeater control so
let's drag and drop a repeater control
all right now within the code-behind
file what I basically want to do is
write some ad or net code to retrieve
data from the stable TBL employee and
then display that within the grid view
and repeater controls okay and again we
have discussed about ATO dotnet in
detail in a Teodor tech video series so
please watch those videos first if
you're new to a dotnet so let me copy
this method which is going to connect to
this database table retrieve the data
and return that data in the form of a
data set so let me paste this method
here so if you look at this method this
method is returning a data set so what
we are doing here using the
configuration manager class we are
reading the connection string from web
config file and then using that
connection string we are building our
sequel connection object and notice the
sequel command select star from TBL
employee so we are creating our sequel
data adapter object with this command
and then we are creating a new data set
filling the data set with the data by
invoking the fill method which will
automatically execute this command as
well and then once we have the data set
filled with data we are returning the
data set back because the return type of
this method is data set okay so within
the page load event what I'm going to do
I'm going to create a data set object so
data set D s is equal to and I'm going
to call this method
data which is going to return the data
set and then what I am going to do here
so we have a grid we control and a
repeater control on this waveform so
grid view one dot data source is equal
to that data set and then I am going to
invoke the data bind method as well okay
similarly let me actually copy those two
lines and then instead of grid v1 I am
going to specify repeater 1 so repeat a
1 data source is equal to that same data
set and then I am going to invoke the
data bind method on that repeater all
right so let's save everything that this
code in place let's go ahead and run so
on this waveform we have a grid view
control and a repeater control we are
retrieving data from the table TBL
employee and we are trying to display
that within a grid view control and a
repeater notice this I have this grid
view control rendered but look at the
repeater control I don't have the
repeater control rendered at all so let
me right click on this page and let's
say view page source and if you look at
the page source look at that in the
first TDA the data is rendered and this
data is rendered using the grid view
control and look at this the grid view
control has rendered an HTML table here
but look at the second TD it's empty
the repeater control didn't render any
data at all and if you look at the code
they are using the same data set as this
data source for the grid view control
and for the repeater control okay and
look at this the via binding data to a
grid we control and a repeater control
it's exactly similar okay so now let's
go back and look at the similarities so
just like a grid we control a repeater
is also a data bound control you do this
you know data binding in a similar
fashion and to bind data we use data
source property and invoke data bind
method you know very similar to a grid
we control and the following the three
events are supported by both the control
so if you look at grid view grid view is
a much richer control so let's go to the
design and then you know if I select
grid view and if I go to the properties
and then I click on this events I can
look at this grid we control supports a
lot of events you know but
whereas if I in open this properties you
know window there and then I select the
repeater look at this I don't have too
many events here okay but the common
events between grid we control and
repeater are these three item command
item created and item data bound in our
repeater control has them as well as
your grid we control has them okay so
obviously these are the three similarity
is just like grid view a repeater is
also a data bound control to bind data
we use data source property and invoke
data bind method and the following of
the three events that are supported by
both the controls now let's look at the
differences okay so by default a
repeater control will not render
anything if templates are not specified
and we have just seen that look at this
when we ran this webform you know we
have data for the grid view control but
for repeater control I don't have any
data display okay
because when you use a repeater control
you have to define templates okay where
you specify how you want the data to be
rendered unless and until you specify
that by default the repeater control
will not render any data but that's not
the case with good view control by
default a grid view control will render
its data in a tabular format okay so
that's the first difference by default a
repeater control will not render
anything if templates are not specified
but whereas for the grid we control the
data from the underlying data source
will be rendered in a default tabular
format all right so grid view is more
suitable and designed for displaying
data in a tabular format whereas a
repeater is used when you want to have
complete control on how you want the
data to be rendered for example let's
say this is our TBL employee table from
the database and look at it it has got
like you know five columns employee ID
name gender city and photograph photo
path now obviously at this part you know
I have some photos you know mock photo
John Mary and Mike's photo so what I
want to do is I want to display those
photos something like this on the right
hand side look at this I want the output
like this you know I want the photo the
employee photo and then their ID name
gender and city should be displayed on
the right
side okay so if I want to do something
like this then probably I can make use
of a repeater control because by default
grid view control renders data in a
tabular format something like this okay
but here you know though it is in a
tabular format look at this these
columns employee name gender and city
all of them are displayed as rows in
this first you know in the second column
in the first column I have the employee
photo so if I want something like this
you know I can make use of repeater
control now let's see how to actually
achieve the output that you see on the
slide with the help of a repeater
control okay so obviously the first
thing to do is I want to define a table
which which is going to have two cells
okay the first cell should contain a
photo and the second cell should contain
ID name gender and city so first let's
go ahead and add a table so first of all
you are repeater control you know look
at this between the opening and closing
tags of the repeater if I open the
angular back bracket look at this you
know you need to define your templates
okay so let me go ahead and select an
item template and then within this item
template first we need to create a table
so first let me go ahead and create this
table with the two TDs so what i'm doing
here let me copy this and then we'll
format this properly and then look at
this so within the repeater we defined
an item template and then I have a table
here on an HTML table I have set you
know a border of one pixel solid and the
color is this one and the background
color is this one okay and then if you
look at the table it has got one TR with
two TDs
the first TD has got an image element
okay so I have used an asp.net image
control here and then obviously I have
specified an image URL look at this I'm
saying you know bind this image URL
property with photo path column from
this TBL employee table so these are the
data binding expressions that we have
been you know the same data binding
expressions that we use
the gridview control so we are binding
the image URL property with the photo
path column from the stabile employee
table okay so that this TD within within
the first row should display the
employee photo okay and then the second
TD should display ID name gender and
city columns so what I'm going to do
here is within the second at TD so here
within the second TD I'm going to create
another table obviously with one two
three and four rows so I'm going to
create another table with four rows to
display ID name gender density and again
to speed things up I have that HTML
already type so this is straightforward
HTML you know a table contains a table
row and the table row contains a TD so
let me copy and paste that HTML here and
then let's format that by pressing ctrl
K and D after we select the entire HTML
and now look at this so here within the
second TD I added another table and then
look at this I have it TR here and
within that TR I have two TDs okay why
do I need to Dedes one at TD to display
the ID the column name and the other TD
to display the column value so here I
have the hard coded text ID that's in
bold tag and then in the next TD I have
a label control and then I am binding
the text property of that label control
with you know the employee ID column
okay so similarly I am doing it for name
gender and then city so it's as simple
as that
so now if I flip this waveform to the
design look at this at the moment if you
look at the grid we control we didn't
define any templates there by default
the grid view has this auto generate
column set to true depending on whatever
data we have in the underlying data set
it's going to generate the rows and
columns for us automatically and the
data will be rendered you know in a
default tabular format that you can see
here okay but for a repeater we have to
define you know how we want the data
to be rendered using a template okay and
that's what we are doing here so at this
point if I flip the waveform to the
design mode
look at my repeater control it has got
you know that design so here on the left
you know I have an image control and
then on the right you can see ID name
gender and City now with these changes
let me go ahead and run this and see if
it's going to work okay so here I can
see ID name gender City okay but then I
don't see the photo why is that because
look at what we are binding the you know
photo path property we are binding this
image to the photo path property and
look at this what do I have here I have
the image element and we are you know we
are saying image URL is equal to you
know whatever is the value that is
present in photo path so photo path has
this path images for slash mark dot PNG
so at that location you need to have
those photos so let's flip to a visual
studio let's add a folder to this
project and let's call that images and
then let me copy and paste the required
images so I have these images on my hard
disk so mark photo Mike Photo John maybe
all the photos I have here and then I
also have a one by one pixel image here
so if you look at this first image that
I have highlighted it's a one by one
pixel image it's a white image now why
am i using this image anywhere if I want
a space of one by one pixel then I can
use this image in a bit we will see how
we are going to make use of the same age
so let me copy these photos and then
let's flip to visual studio let's paste
them into this images folder so we have
all the required images there so let's
go ahead and run our application now
since the major images are present in
the folder they should be rendered
within the repeater control look at that
I get the output as I expected now
everything is fine but if you look at
you know between the first row and
second
there is no space at all okay the
borders of the first row and second row
they are like joined together and it is
a little bit bold I don't want that I
want a separation between both of these
rows so how can I achieve that within
the repeater control we have just used
an item template okay
now between each item that is between
each row within the repeater control I
want to separate them and to do that you
can make use of a separator template so
I have a separator template here and
then here what I'm going to do I just
want a 1 by 1 pixel space between the
first row and the second row now if you
look at the rows themselves how are they
displayed they are displayed using this
table elements okay
so between each row which is being
displayed using a table so technically
you know this is a table the first row
is a table second row is a table third
row is a table so I want space between
these two tables and to do that I'm
going to make use of a separator
template and here all I'm going to do is
I'm going to use an image control so
let's drag and drop another image
control and then I'm going to set the
image URL property scroll down and then
click on that pick URL button so you
know that within the solution Explorer
we have this images folder and from that
I'm going to pick up this 1 by 1 pixel
image okay I'm going to click OK
so now if I flip this waveform to the
design mode look at that I got some
space now there okay so let me run this
now and see you know if we get that 1 by
1 pixel space look at that I am not sure
if you can see that in the video but
there is a space between each item of
the repeater ok so now if I want a
flexible layout like this not the
default you know tabular layout then
probably a repeater is my choice okay
now but you know does that mean I can't
do the same thing using a grid we
control now now if you remember
discussed about grid view control grid
view control has got different types of
columns like bound feel the template
field etc so you can make use of the
template field and within the template
field you can define your custom you
know templates and then you know
possibly we can achieve the same thing
even with grid view control as well and
to do that what I need to basically do
is so here within the grid view control
at the moment you know by default auto
generate columns is true meaning what
it's going to do for all the columns and
rows that we have within the grid we
control you know basically it's going to
auto generate columns for us which means
it's going to render everything that's
present in the data set within the grid
we control I don't want to do that so
I'm going to set Auto generate columns
is equal to false for now and then I'm
going to specify what columns and how I
want them to be displayed using these
columns here and then instead of using
the bound fields I am going to use a
template field now when we use a
template field then we can specify you
know how we want the grid we control to
render using templates so obviously
again I have item template here okay so
all I need to do here now is copy and
paste this HTML there so within the item
template whatever HTML you have so I'm
going to copy this and paste this within
the item template of a grid view control
and let's see if it's going to display
you know similar to that of a repeater
so I copied that exact same HTML that's
present within the item template of the
repeater and I'm going to paste that
within the grid view okay so let's save
it now let's flip the webform to the
design mode look at that the grid view
control is also very similar now okay
now let me go ahead and run this so the
output should be similar look at that I
have you know a similar output but then
the grid view has got some lines here
first of all the top one is the header
so I don't want the header to be shown
in the grid view control so
I'm going to do here is select the grid
we control go to the properties and then
there is a property called show header
so I'm going to set that to false okay
so that should get rid of the header now
let's run this and then on on top we
should not have those blank lines that's
fine
but then look at this there is one more
border surrounding the data that's
displayed so to get that border out you
know
grid-view have got this grid lines you
know show grid lines property or it's
called grid lines now which is both by a
default here I'm going to set that to
none now let's run this and see if the
output between the repeater and the grid
control are exactly the same look at
that they're absolutely similar so I can
say that whatever you can achieve with a
repeater control you can also achieve
that using grid view control using you
know template files okay but then grid
view is a richer control you can also
use it for example if you want paging
sorting editing capabilities then grid
view should be preferred over repeater
control you know repeater is a very
lightweight control all right now let's
go back to a slide so by default the
repeater control does not offer editing
paging and sorting capabilities but
whereas a grid we control does however
with a bit of effort and code it is
possible to implement these features
using a repeater control as well
remember whatever we can do with the
grid view control we can also do with
repeater control but it requires a
little bit of effort and programming
okay but out of the box grid view
control offers these features editing
paging and sorting but repeated doesn't
okay so I mean both of the controls we
can achieve exactly the same things but
with one you may require more effort and
custom code to do it but for the other
you don't have to okay so obviously if
you want to have complete control on
what is rendered then repeater should be
your choice obviously again keep in mind
repeater doesn't support this
capabilities editing paging and sorting
out of the box
so obviously when to use grid view
control over repeater and vice versa the
answer is very simple a repeater is very
lightweight control and if you want to
have the complete control over how the
data is rendered and if you don't want
this capabilities of editing paging and
sorting then repeater should be your
choice on the other hand if you want the
data to be displayed in a default
tabular format and you also need editing
paging and sorting capabilities then
grid view should be your choice all
right on this slide you can find
resources for asp.net c-sharp and
sequels of interview questions that's it
for today thank you for listening have a
