this video well discus bindings in WCF
before we understand what bindings are
first let's try and understand what a WC
of service endpoint is to understand the
WC of service endpoint let's look at an
example so here I have a simple hello
service first of all let's look at the
service contract itself the service
contract name is a high low service and
it is present within hello service
namespace and this service contract has
got one operation contract that is get a
message and the service contract is
implemented by this hello service class
so this hello service class again this
is present in that same namespace and if
you look at the implementation of this
get message method it's straightforward
all we are doing is concatenated the
name that gets passed into this method
with this word hello and then we are
returning that string back okay so a
simple hello service and that this hello
service is present in a class library
project and to host this holo service we
are making use of a console application
okay and if you look at the
configuration within this B host project
look at this we are making this service
available hello service which is present
in hello service namespace and look at
the service has got an end point so what
is an end point an end point is where
the service is available for the clients
of the service to consume and a WC of
ends service endpoint consists of three
things the address the binding and the
contract these are sometimes called as a
b/c of a service endpoint so what is the
address going to tell to the client the
address is going to tell to the client
where is the WCF service available so
the complete address of the service and
if you look at the address here we are
simply saying hello service so what is
this address you know this is not the
full address this is just the relative
address
and if you look at this host section
here we've got base addresses element
and within the base address you know
notice that here we have net TCP colon
four slash four slash localhost colon
1890 so this is the base address and
then the service address is hello
service so the fully qualified address
where the service is available is net or
TCP colon four slash four slash
localhost colon 1890 forward slash
hollow service okay so the address of an
endpoint is going to tell to the client
where is our service available binding
we'll be talking about that in detail in
just a bit and then contract the
contract is going to tell to the client
what operations are available for that
client to consume ok so basically this
service endpoint implements you know
this contract I hello service and if you
look at a hollow service it has got one
operation contract get message so this
is the method that will be available for
the clients to invoke at that service
endpoint ok so we have got an endpoint
at the WCF service side okay and then if
you look at this you know there's
another base address HTTP colon
localhost colon 8080 so what is this
base address for this base address is
basically for the clients to generate
proxy classes using the metadata so
basically again here look at this we
have a behavior section we are making
you know the meta data available over
HTTP okay so that the clients can use
that metadata to generate the proxy
classes okay but then the basic thing
that we have to understand here is a
service endpoint contains three things
that is the address binding and the
contract okay now for the clients to
consume you know this service they have
to use you know a similar endpoint
otherwise they wouldn't be able to
communicate with our service ok and to
speed things up I have already created a
client for the service
so basically the client looks like this
and then all I have done is added a
reference to the hello service and then
when we click this button you know we
are creating an instance of the hello
service client and in working that get
message passing to that method whatever
the user has typed into the text box
okay so let's go ahead and run this so
let's say for example we enter this word
presume and click get message so we get
that message back hello play Jean okay
so we are invoking the service all right
now if you look at the application
configuration file of this client notice
that this client now notice that we have
a client section here within the
application configuration file by the
way how did I get this configuration
file when we have added a reference to
the service you know it has
automatically generated this
configuration for us okay so within this
configuration file we have the client
section and then we have this endpoint
here okay and again look at this this
endpoint has got an address binding and
a contract okay now there are other
things here as well but then we can
safely get rid of them
so let's go ahead and get rid of this
binding configuration and you look at
this binding configuration it says net
TCP binding
hello service so where is the binding
configuration coming from you know from
right here net TCP binding underscore I
hello service so this is the name of
that binding and we are referencing that
name right here okay now you may be
wondering why did we get so much of the
configuration we didn't specify all this
configuration for net TCP binding within
the WCF service so if you look at the
service endpoint here the binding that
we have specified is simply net TCP
binding and we are telling you know the
clients to be using all the defaults of
net TCP binding now if you look at the
client itself you know there are several
attributes here what is the open timeout
receive timeouts
endtime out what transaction protocol to
use okay and what is the max received
message size so there are several
attributes here and all of them here are
basically they are set to default okay
so as they are the default you know
maybe we didn't really customize
anything within the service as far as
this nest TCP binding is concerned so we
will we are saying you know we want to
use the defaults but then when we added
a reference to that service within the
client application it has automatically
provided all the values you know default
values basically for these attributes
okay since they are defaults we can
safely get rid of the section altogether
so we can get rid of this bindings
section and we can also get rid of this
binding configuration and the name as
well
so now if you look at what we had this
identity as well if you look at the end
point here it is very much similar to
what we have in the service look at this
this is the address now here we have the
full address okay so net dot TCP :
four slash four slash local host 80 94
slash
holo service that's where this service
is available so if you look at this
service address here its hello service
and the base address is this one so that
it's the same address that the client is
using to communicate with the WCF
service and then look at the binding net
TCP binding and within the WCF service
the binding is again net TCP binding and
the contract is a hollow service
similarly within the WCF service the
contract is a hollow service within
hollow service namespace okay now the
client is going to communicate with with
an endpoint that looks like this
at the service end okay so now let's go
ahead and run this and see if it's going
to work let's close this
application that's running let's pass
this pro team look at that it still
works
okay so basically a service endpoint
consists of three things that is the
address binding and the contract so what
is a binding then a WC of binding
defines how the client needs to
communicate with the service the WCF
binding that we choose determine these
three things for the communication
between the client and the WCF service
so basically when you have a client and
a service and if you want them to
communicate with each other then we need
to decide upon what protocol I mean what
transport protocol do we want to use for
the communication between the client and
the WCF service do you want to use HTTP
DCP named pipes or MSM queue and what
message encoding now when the message is
being transmitted over the wire so how
do you want to transmit it in what
format they want that to be in you know
plain text or XML so that it can be
interoperable or do you want it in
binary format for performance reasons
okay
so what message encoding you want and
what protocols you want for example do
you want reliable messaging support do
you want transaction support okay
so a binding and abusive basically
dictates these three things for example
if you choose basic HTTP binding the
transport protocol will be HTTP and the
message format will be XML and you don't
get reliable messaging and transaction
support by default okay on the other
hand if you choose net TCP binding the
transport protocol is going to be TCP a
message encoding by default is going to
be binary and you know again the label
messaging and transaction support you
can customize them if required
so basically the binding that you choose
determines the underlying transport
protocol the message encoding format and
whether you want to label messaging and
transaction support okay so that's why
binding is very important and in WCF
there are several system provided
bindings you know out-of-the-box
UCF has got several bindings available
okay and that complete list can be found
at this link so if you visit that link
here I look at this you can find all the
bindings that are available we have
basic HTTP binding ws HTTP binding you
know different types of binding net tcp
binding alright so there are several
bindings available now the next question
that we have to ask is so there are
different bindings available which
bindings do I have to use now that
depends on your application requirement
you know basically what transport
protocol you want do you want you know
your WCF service to be interoperable or
do you want your WCF service to be you
know performing use performance the most
important criteria you know the client
is also going to be dotnet so in that
case probably you would choose net TCP
binding behind the firewall for because
net DC be binding uses a proprietary
binary format so the application is
going to be a little faster okay so
basically depending on your application
requirement you can choose the binding
that you want now if you are not sure
which binding to use then at this length
there is a flow chart which can be very
handy
so let's actually visit that link and
see that flow chart so this is that URL
on the slide look at this here you have
a WCF service and the client for that
WCF service is it going to be WCF if it
is not a WCF client then the next
question that you would ask is that an
MS MQ client and if the answer is yes
then you would choose MSN queue
integration binding so within this land
so we have among these system provided
bindings there should be MSM queue
integration binding somewhere so this is
the binding that I use if the client is
MSN queue client okay if it's not an MSN
queue client then the next question that
you would ask is it a legacy ASM X web
service client okay if the answer is yes
then you would use
basic HTTP binding the answer is no then
you would use WS HTTP binding okay so
basically this flowchart can help you to
pick and choose which binding you want
and obviously here you can find a
complete list of the binding where if
that binding is interoperable what kind
of security you get by default okay and
you know sessions transaction support
whether if it is two Plex now basically
you have wealth of information about
bindings at this link right here but the
bottom line is a binding determines what
transport protocol you want to use what
message and coding format you want to
use and what protocols like that you
want reliable messaging and transaction
support etc now we know that there are
several system provided bindings and you
know depending on your application
requirements you pick and choose the
binding that best suit your needs but
for some reason if none of the system
provided bindings suit your needs then
WCF is very extensible in that case you
can create your own binding and the
application is going to work ok you just
plug in that binding and then you can
use it the same way as the system
provided bindings now look at this here
the WCF services you know it is making
this service available at this binding
net tcp binding and the client also has
equivalent configuration the binding is
net tcp binding and this the end is
where the service is available and this
is the contract so now when we run it
you know the client is working as
expected so when we pass pledging so it
works now let's say we change you know
binding from net tcp binding to basic
HTTP binding let's go ahead and run this
and see what's going to happen so when I
passed regime we will get an exception
and obviously you know there's no
binding that's available at the service
and obviously you know it doesn't
support that protocol you know and that
message format because the service has
got just
one service endpoint okay so this is
that service endpoint and if you want
you know if you have another client who
wants maybe text messages that is XML
messages or HTTP protocol you can always
add another endpoint and specify the
binding as basic HTTP binding so
basically you can expose as many
endpoints as you want alright that's it
for today thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
