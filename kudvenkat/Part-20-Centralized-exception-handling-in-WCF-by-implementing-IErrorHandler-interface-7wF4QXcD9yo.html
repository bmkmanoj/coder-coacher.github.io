this video will discuss how to
centralize exception handling in WCF by
implementing a error handler interface
this is continuation to part 19 so
please watch part 19 before proceeding
how to handle all WCF service exceptions
in one central location this is a very
common interview question in case of an
asp.net web application we can make use
of the application underscore error
event handler method within the global
dot a si X file to log all the
exceptions and even redirect the user to
a custom error page in WCF to centralize
exception handling and to return a
general fault reason to the client we
implement I error handler interface
there are three steps to centralized
exception handling in WCF let's look at
those steps in detail step one is to
implement a error handler interface if
you look at the class here global error
handler class this class is implementing
a error handler interface so first of
all let's go ahead and add a class file
with name global error handler dot CS
let's flip to visual studio we'll be
working with the same example that we
worked with in the previous session
so first let's add a class file and
let's name it global error handler dot
CS
now we want this class to implement i
error handler interface and this
interface is pleasant in a different
namespace and if you want to know the
namespace after you have typed the fully
qualified name of the type simply press
control dot and you will have the
options look at this this interface is
present in system dot service model door
dispatcher namespace so let's go and
bring that in and we want to implement
this interface again press control dot
you will get the option to implement the
interface so select that option and if
you notice this interface has got two
methods handle error and provide fault
so what is this provide fault method now
whenever there is an unhandled exception
or a fault this method gets called
automatically so this is where we have
the opportunity to write code to shield
that exception that has occurred from
the client so basically what we do here
is if at all if there is a dotnet
exception you know we're going to
convert the dotnet exception into a
general fault
and then return that fault to the client
we don't want to be sharing the actual
dotnet exceptions with the client for
two reasons number one if we return a
dotnet exception then the client for the
WCF service should also be dotnet so
there your service is not going to be
interoperable with other technologies
like Java and - if there is an unhandled
exception then what is going to happen
to the channel the communication channel
is going to fall as a result the client
proxy will become useless
so we don't want that to happen so we
will be converting that unhandled
exception into a soap fault a general
tso fault and then return that to the
client if it is a fault exception then
that's fine because you know if you look
at our service here here you know we are
trying to divide two numbers if the
denominator is zero then what we are
doing we are throwing a fault exception
now if you want to return the same fault
to the client then that's fine otherwise
what you can do you can
can with this fault to a different fault
if you want to so you have that
opportunity within this method so you
can write code to do that and to speed
things up I have already typed this code
in a notepad so let's go ahead and copy
that code and paste that within provide
fault method so what are we doing here
we are checking if first of all let's
get rid of these compilation errors now
let's bring in the namespaces that are
required so Fault exception is present
in system dot service model namespace
message fault is present in system dot
service models of channels namespace all
right so if the error that has occurred
if it's a fault exception in this case
we are simply returning but if your
application requirement warrants that
you don't want to share the actual fault
with the client then you can shield that
fault
you know with another generalized so
fault like this but to keep things
simple you know I'm simply returning the
actual fault exception that has occurred
in this implementation here okay now if
it is not a fault exception then what we
are doing we are creating an instance of
a fault exception object and look at
this we are returning this general error
message that's stating that a general
service error has occurred and then we
are creating an instance of message
fault we are calling this create message
fault method on the fault exception
object which is going to create message
fault object for us and then finally we
are calling this static method on the
message class that is create message and
then passing in diversion so basically
this version is coming into this method
as a parameter so what does this message
version going to contain basically it's
going to specify whether we want soap on
one or soap one two okay so we are
passing it as it is to this function and
then the message fault object that we
have created and the third parameter is
action at the moment we are passing it
as now okay and what is this create
message method doing it's creating a
message object and if you look at this
fault you know where is this coming from
this is nothing but the parameter for
provide fault
okay and notice you know this parameter
is of type you know it's a reference
parameter so all we are doing is we are
storing the message within this variable
which gets returned to the client who
called the service okay and keep in mind
this provide fault it gets called before
handle error so whenever there is an
unhandled exception or a fault provide
fault gets called first and then handle
error gets called asynchronously so what
are we going to do in handle error
basically in this method we write the
code you know to log the actual
exception that has occurred either to a
database table or to an XML file to an
event viewer so that the IT team can
investigate what is that exception why
has it occurred and if the team has to
fix it they will go ahead and fix it so
basically we need to log the actual
exception that has occurred so we do
that within handle error so basically we
want to log the exception to a database
table we write the area dotnet code to
log that exception in the interest of
time and to keep this example simple I
am NOT going to write that a do dotnet
code okay and if you look at the return
type of this method it's pooling and
meaning this method will either return
true or false
so let's simply return true to indicate
that we have logged the exception and
another important thing to keep in mind
is that this method gets called
asynchronously so whenever there is an
unhandled exception when the client
tries to call our service you know and
obviously this method gets called and
there is this message which is get which
get returned to the client and
asynchronously this method also get
called the exception gets logged to the
database table now you may be wondering
why can't we do you know the same thing
but then provide fault
why can't the log you know basically
write the ad or dotnet code within this
provide fault method to log that
exception to the database table for
example that's basically because you
know if we write logging code within
provide fault you're going to make the
client wait while you are logging the
exception either to a database tea
or to an XML file okay we want the
service to be responsive to the client
application we don't want to be doing
lengthy you know processes within this
provide fault you know as soon as the
user clicks a button and cause this
service you know if there is a fault we
want to return that fault message to the
client as soon as we can that's the
reason why we do that logging
asynchronously within this handle error
method all right so that's about AI
error handler interface that's the first
step
and step two so basically with an AI
error handler interface we got Wade
fault and handle error methods provide
fault this method gets called
automatically when there is an unhandled
exception or a fault in this method we
have the opportunity to write code to
convert the unhandled exception into a
generic fault that can be returned to
the client and the sprite fault gets
called before handle error method handle
error this method gets called
asynchronously after provide fault
method is called and the error message
is returned to the client this means
that this method allows us to write code
to log the exception without blocking
the client call step two is to create a
custom service behavior attribute to let
WCF know that we want to use the global
error handler class that we created in
step one whenever there is an unhandled
exception okay so here we have a class
called global error handler behavior
attribute you can give this class any
name that you want okay
so global error handler behavior
attribute class and this class is
implementing you know AI service
behavior interface and this class is
also inheriting from attribute abstract
class first of all let's go ahead and
add this class file to the project if
you look at the slide it's a little busy
here but then it looks um you know in
code it's much easier than it looks on
the slide so let's flip to visual studio
and add a class file so to this project
let's add a class file
and let's call it global error handler
behavior attribute
and we want this class to inherit from
attribute base class
I mean abstract class and then implement
I service behavior attribute interface
and this interface is present in system
dot service model description namespace
so let's go ahead and bring that N and
we want to implement this interface so
let's implement this interface and if
you look at what it has done this
interface has got three methods okay now
we don't have to provide implementation
for these two methods I mean we can
leave the implementation blank for now
for add binding parameters and validate
methods now we have to provide
implementation for apply-dispatch
behavior this is where we write code to
associate of a global error handler with
WCF okay so basically what we are going
to do here is loop through each channel
dispatcher and then associate global
error handler as the error handler for
WCF we'll look at that in just a bit but
first of all let's go ahead and provide
a constructor for this class and again
to speed things up I have already typed
it so let's copy and paste that within
this class
think we got the spelling incorrect so
let's copy and paste it right there all
right now if this code here doesn't make
sense it'll be clear in just a bit don't
worry and let's also write code to
attach the global error handler with WCS
and again I have the code type so let me
copy and paste it now this code if this
code is not clear at the moment don't
worry we'll come back to that in just a
bit and it should be clear again let's
bring in the namespaces that are
required so let's press control dot and
that should bring in the namespace
that's required alright so step two is
to basically create a custom service
behavioral attribute to let WCF know
that we want to use the global error
handler class that we created in step
one whenever there is an unhandled
exception and step three is to decorate
this calculator service with global
error handler behavior attribute and
look at what we are passing to the
constructor of that class we are passing
of a global error handler class that we
created in step one okay so let's go and
do that now so here we have a calculator
service we are going to decorate this
calculator service class with global
error handler behavior attribute and
then tooth constructor we are going to
pass the type of our global error
handler class all right now so this if
you look at this global error handler
behavior class it has got one
constructor which we have provided and
if you look at the constructor
implementation straight forward we are
passing in a parameter of type type okay
and then look at this here we have a
private variable within the class called
you know error handler type again you
know it's type is type so basically we
are saying okay this variable equals
whatever we are passing into this
constructor
and if you look at our service what are
we passing into the constructor of that
class you know the type of global error
handler class okay and then what else is
this class doing so now within this
variable we have the type of our global
error handler class and if you look at
apply dispatch behavior function
implementation what are we doing here we
are creating an instance of the type
that is stored in the class variable so
here what do we have in this variable we
have global error handler class type so
based on that type using that type we
are creating an instance of that class
and that is stored in this handler
variable and what are we doing next we
are looping through each service channel
dispatcher and then to that dispatcher
we are attaching the error handler to
the error handlers collection property
okay so now after the step three we are
all hooked up okay so whenever there is
an unhandled exception or a fault
obviously you know the error handler the
global error handler that we have
created
you know this provide fault will get
called first and then handle error okay
so to test it let's put in breakpoints
within you know this global error
handler let's run this and then one more
thing that we need to do to test this at
the moment
within our calculator service we have
this try catch so let's go and comment
these try catches so that it's going to
throw you know divided by 0.8 exception
and then we can test it so let's go
ahead and run the client I mean the
service itself and then let's go and run
de client again within the client you
know at the moment we are catching
divided by zero fault
so let's simply catch the fault
exception the base type
and then let's display the message
within the label control and if you look
at our service so within global error
handler we have you know break points
within provide fault and handle error
methods so let's go ahead and run the
client so let's try to divide 10 by zero
so obviously an exception should be
thrown so the service should divide by
0.8 exception it's taking a bit of time
here look at that here you know we get
divided by zero exception and that is
unhandled okay now let's continue
debugging look at that this provide
fault method is called automatically and
when I press f10 look at that it is
checking if the error is a fault
exception now it's not a fault exception
so it's going to come you know into this
piece of code and what are we doing here
we are creating an instance of fault
exception creating the message fault and
we are setting that message as the value
for this reference parameter plus f10
and look at that now the control has
come to handle error and if you look at
the client now look at that the client
is now responsive okay so basically this
method is now called asynchronously okay
look at that
a general service error occurred you
know whatever message that we are
sending back that's what is displayed
within the client okay and press f5 so
that's how we do you know error handling
a centralized location in WCF so
implement provide implementation 4i
error handler interface you know create
a custom attribute to associate that
global error handler with WCF so that it
gets called automatically whenever there
is an unhandled exception and finally
decorate your service with that
attribute class and specify you know
what is the type of your global handler
so three simple steps to centralise
exception handling in WCF
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
