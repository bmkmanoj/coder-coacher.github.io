am venket this is part 52 of asp.net
video series in this session we'll
discuss about response dot redirect
technique in asp.net in part 51 of this
video series we discussed about
different page navigation techniques
specifically we discussed about
hyperlink control in this session we'll
discuss about response to redirect
method the rest of the page navigation
techniques will be discussed in the
subsequent video sessions response dot
redirect is very similar to clicking on
a hyperlink control the hyperlink
control does not expose any server-side
events so when the user clicks on a
hyperlink there is no server-side event
to intercept the click so if you want to
intercept the click event in code and if
you want to do some processing before
you actually redirect the user to a new
page then we can make use of response
toward redirect method this response dot
redirect method can be invoked in the
click of a button and that button could
be a push button link button or an image
button let's actually look at that in
action so here I have a simple asp.net
web application project with one web
form let me go ahead and add another web
form to this project so we have two web
forms now on web form 1 dot aspx let's
drag and drop a button control and on
the click of this button control
I want to redirect the user to web form
2 dot aspx so response object has got
the redirect method and this redirect
method expects a string parameter which
is nothing but the URL of the page that
we want to redirect the user to in this
case I want to redirect the user to the
web form 2 dot aspx so let me use the
till symbol which indicates the root
directory of the web application so in
the root directory I want to go to web
form 2 dot aspx
okay so let's run this page now now an
important thing to keep in mind is that
when we use response toward redirect
there are two request response cycles
going on so currently we are on webform
one dot aspx page so when I click this
button the web I mean a postback request
for webform 1 dot aspx will be sent to
the web server and on the web server
what are we doing we are having this
cool response dot redirect so as soon as
the web server encounters this response
to at redirect what's going to happen
it's going to send a response header
back to the client and then the client
will then initiate a get request for the
new page automatically and then the web
server will receive that request it's
going to process the get request for the
new page and then send the HTML response
back for that back to the client so
obviously there are two you know request
response cycles ok so obviously now if I
click this button look at that I am on
webform one dot aspx as soon as I click
this button it changes to webform two
dot aspx so it post back to webform one
that's one request and I get request to
webform two that's another request
obviously to request response cycles and
this is very important to keep in mind
because when we compare response dot
redirect with other page navigation
techniques like server transfer you know
server transfer doesn't involve to
request response cycles so that's one of
the important differences between
response toward redirect and server dot
transfer depending on the requirements
of our application we'll be able to pick
and choose the right technique if we
understand all these differences
properly not only that this will also
help us clear the interview okay so
that's one point to keep in mind and
another thing this response dot redirect
method can be used to navigate to an to
a page or a website on the same web
server or on a different website just
like the hyperlink control because you
know for example if you take server
transfer
using server transfer and server dot
execute you can only transfer two pages
or websites on the same web server if
they are hosted on a different web
server we cannot use those techniques
but with hyperlink control and response
tort redirect we can navigate to any
site or any page whether they are
present on the same web server or on a
different web server and another point
to keep in mind is that when we use
respond stored redirect the history is
maintained so I am on waveform 2 but I
click on the back button in the browser
I am able to go to the web form 1 so the
URL changes the browser maintains the
history of the page is visited on this
slide you can find resources for asp.net
c-sharp and sequel server interview
questions that's it for today thank you
for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
