this video we'll discuss how to download
set up and create our first bootstrap
web page to get started with bootstrap
the first step is to download bootstrap
to download bootstrap navigate to get
bootstrap comm on this website you can
also find all the documentation that is
required to get started with bootstrap
I'm going to click this download
bootstrap button notice there are three
variations that are available for the
download we can either download the
compiled and minified version or the
source code or the SAS version I've
already downloaded the compiled and
minified version with the download what
you get is a single zip folder I'm going
to right click on this extract the
contents now let's drill down into the
folder and see what we have got notice
we have got three subfolders CSS fonts
and J's now let's examine the files that
we have got and the purpose of each of
them folder by folder first let's look
at the CSS folder notice we've got
bootstrap dot CSS this is the core CSS
for bootstrap which defines all the
styles for various controls and
components and then we have bootstrap
dot CSS dot map when debugging the
minified code the line numbers do not
refer to the original files the file
that has the dot map extension which is
also called as source map file fixes
this problem by allowing the web
debuggers to refer to the original
context from where the code was
generated this file is useful during
development and then we have bootstrap
dot min dot CSS this is the compressed
version meaning all the white spaces
line breaks and any of the extra
characters have been removed as a result
the size of the minified file is smaller
than the non minified file minified
version is usually used on a production
server for efficient download whereas
the non minified version is used in
development environment as it is more
readable and easy to debug if there are
issues now let's see how the minified
and non minified files look like so i'm
going to open them with WordPad
first let's open the non minified file
let's navigate over CSS folder and first
let's open the non minified version
notice we've got in our white spaces
line breaks everything and this file is
readable this is very useful during
development because it's easy to debug
if there are issues now let's look at
the minified version so here we have our
minified version bootstrap admin dot CSS
notice with the minified version all the
white spaces and line breaks have been
stripped out as a result the size of the
file get reduced and it's obviously
going to be efficient on a production
server because it's going to you know
reduce the time it is required to
download the file because of its smaller
size and then we have bootstrap dot min
dot CSS dot man this is the source map
file for bootstrap of mint dot CSS and
then we have bootstrap theme dot CSS as
the name suggests this is the theme for
bootstrap adding the core bootstrap dot
CSS is enough for bootstrap to work the
theme file is optional and is usually
used for a visually enhanced experience
for example if you want 3dfx
gradients shadows etc and then we have
bootstrap theme dot CSS dot map this is
the source map file for bootstrap theme
dot CSS and then we have bootstrap theme
dot min dot CSS which is the minified
version of bootstrap theme dot CSS and
finally bucho theme dot min dot CSS dot
map which is the source map file for
bootstrap theme dot min dot CSS now
let's look at the files in fonts folder
notice within fonts folder we've got
five different files these are the files
from glyph icons this five different
files are just different format of the
glyph icons font to support different
now let's look at the files in Jai's
folder these JavaScript files optional
these are required if you want to use
bootstrap widgets like picture carousel
drop-down menus collapsible accordion
etc one important thing to keep in mind
is that bootstrap javascript has a
dependency on jQuery so a reference to
jQuery must also exist on the page where
you want to use bootstrap bootstrap dot
J's this is the non minified readable
version that is usually used during
development bootstrap Minn dot J's
minified version of bootstrap dot J's
optimized for fast download this is the
version that is usually used in a
production environment and then finally
we have npm GS NPM is a file from
node.js and is useful for NPM installing
bootstrap if you are new to node.js
don't worry this is not going to come in
the way to understand bootstrap for this
course I'm going to use Visual Studio
2013 as the editor but you can use any
editor of your choice now let's look at
the steps involved to create our first
web page with bootstrap let's flip to
visual studio here I have an empty
asp.net web application project the
first step is to add folder that
contains the three subfolders fauns CSS
nsj to the root directory of our web
project so I'm going to go to the folder
and I'm going to change the name of this
folder to bootstrap to keep things
simple and I'm going to copy this folder
and paste it within the root directory
of our web application project so that's
our first step and the next step is to
add an HTML file so I'm going to add an
HTML file and I'm going to name this
index dot HTML and now I'm going to go
back to our get bootstrap comm website
so on this page you also see a link here
which says basic template
on that link and notice here we have a
basic HTML template to get started with
bootstrap so I'm going to copy all this
HTML and paste it within our index dot
HTML now at the moment bootstrap will
not work and I will explain why so we
have our index dot HTML and notice here
we have an h1 element which says hello
world so what I'm going to do is
navigate to our index dot HTML and see
how the web page looks like now would
strap is not in action and that is
because if you look at the links right
here look at this here we have a link
which is pointing to bootstrap dat min
dot CSS but it's looking for that file
within CSS folder in the root directory
of a web project but then you know that
CSS folder is actually present in a
different folder which is bootstrap so
we have to change that path to bootstrap
and let's do the same thing for the
JavaScript script tag that we have here
and notice here we are referencing
jQuery CD and link as well and now
notice here we have viewport tag so this
viewport meta tag ensures proper
rendering and touch zooming on a mobile
device so now you know we have bootstrap
in action let's actually prove that so
I'm going to save the changes and I'm
going to reload this page look at what
happened to the font the font has
changed so now it's using bootstrap
defaults now I'm going to apply one of
the bootstrap CSS classes to this h1
element so I'm going to set the class
attribute and I'm going to set this to
text - primary let's save our changes
and let's reload the page look at that
you know the text primary CSS class is
applied to the h1 LM
and let's change this to for example
text danger and see how it looks like
look at that now the color changes so so
we have wired up everything that is
required to use bootstrap with a web
application project thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
