am venket this is part 61 of c-sharp
video series in this session we'll
discuss about what are partial classes
the advantages of using partial classes
and the places way we use partial
classes today
partial classes allow us to split the
class into two or more physical files
all these physical parts are then
combined into a single class when the
application is compiled the partial
keyword can also be used to split a
structure or an interface over two or
more physical files let's understand
these partial classes with an example
let's flip to visual studio here I have
a very simple asp.net web application
project let's add a simple class file to
this project
right click on the project add new item
and let's add a class file and let's
call this customer dot CS I want to
create a very simple customer class and
this customer class is going to have two
private properties so private string
underscore first name and another
private property private string
underscore last name okay to expose
these two private files I'm going to
have two public properties so public
string first name get
return underscore first name and set
underscore first name is equal to value
and similarly if I want to generate you
know the property for the last name I
can simply right-click on that refactor
and capsulate feel click ok that should
generate the property for us
automatically so if you look at this
class so far we have two very simple
private fields and to expose those
private fields we have two public
properties let's also have a simple
public method which returns the full
name of the customer so public string
let's call this get full name and all
this method is going to do is
concatenate the first name and last name
together so return underscore first name
to that concatenate a comma with a space
and then last name ok so it's a very
simple class with two private fields two
public properties and one public method
and this is how we have been creating
classes all this while okay but then if
you look at this class this class is
present in a single physical file that's
customer dot CS now is it possible to
split this class into two or more
physical files absolutely we can do that
and that's what is the partial keyword
used for okay so let's actually split
this class into into two or more
physical files actually we'll split this
into two files in this example so let's
add a class file and I'm going to call
this partial partial customer one I'm
going to name this as so and click Add
so that adds that file partial customer
one but then I want to call this class
as partial customer class and along the
same lines let's add another file to
this project so add new class I'm going
to call this partial customer
two dots es okay
click Add so that should add that file
and I'm going to call this public class
partial customer now if you look at this
one this class doesn't have the partial
keyword now the first thing the idea is
basically we want to split this customer
class into two physical files so if
that's your intention we have to use the
partial keyword so the first thing that
I have to do here is I'm going to use
the partial keyword so public partial
class partial customer so this class is
a partial customer class how do I know
that because I'm using the partial
keyword okay so I'm going to use this
even in partial customer to dot CS file
so in both the places we said this is a
partial class using this partial keyword
now in this first piece you know in
partial customer 1 dot CS I'm going to
have just the private fields and the to
public property so let's copy them
together and paste them here so if you
look at this this part of the partial
class is containing my private fields
and my public properties and partial
customer two that is this physical file
which contains the rest of the partial
customer class is going to contain get
full name the the public method that we
have so let me copy and paste that here
now look at this this underscore first
name and underscore last name are these
fields defined anywhere within this file
no but then I'm able to use those fields
here and look at this when I try to
compile this project by right clicking
and build look at this build succeeded
so where are these fields coming from
the fact that we have marked this class
with the partial keyword the c-sharp
compiler knows that okay this is only a
part of the class these fields should be
maybe they could be present in the other
part and that's true if you look at
partial customer one dot C s file though
they are private fields as they belong
to the same
plus you know the other partial class is
able to access them so when we actually
compile the solution what's going to
happen these two physical files are now
combined into one class called partial
customer class the key thing to remember
here is that you have to use the partial
keyword specifying your intention that
you want to you know physically divide
this class into two or more files and
that's what we have done here okay and
to use this class we use it exactly the
same way as we do with the customer
class for example let's say I want to
create an instance of this customer
class and then you know use that so
let's go to the code-behind file of the
web form so let's say on the page load
this customer class if you look at this
it's not a partial class it's a regular
class okay
so if you want to create an instance of
that class all we do is customer c1 is
equal to new customer so c1 dot first
name let's say that is equal to prison
and maybe c1 dot last name is equal to
technologies and then if I want to print
out the full name or if I want to
retrieve the full name let's say string
a full name and let's call this full
name one is equal to c1 dot get full
name method and then probably we can
print that out on to the response stream
so response dot right we can say full
name is equal to c1 dot get full name
okay now I can do the same thing with
our partial class as well if you look at
this partial customer class this is
spread across these two files but then
you know when after we compile them you
know it will be formed as one class so
now look at that I'm going and to create
an instance of this partial customer
exactly the same way as I have done this
customer class look at this I am able to
extract the first name property as usual
let's call this pregame and similarly I
am able to access the last name maybe in
this case we'll call it tech and look at
that see two dot get full name I am able
to access that method as well though
it's defined in a different physical
file let's call the string full name too
and if I want to write this out we can
just say response dot right see two dot
instead of using that we can use the
full name - you know variable the same
is the case here because we have already
retrieved the full name into this
variable and then just to have the
output in separate lines let's put an
HTML break there and let's do the same
thing here okay so now if we run this as
you might expect the output will be the
exact same thing you know so full name
is equal to presume technologies and
projected because we haven't specified
that string here full name
okay so partial classes basically allow
us to split a class into two or more
physical files and that's what we have
exactly same so what are the advantages
of using these partial classes the main
advantage that you know of using partial
classes is that visual studio today uses
these partial classes to separate
automatically generated system code from
the developers code let's understand
what we mean by that you know for
example when we added this web form
look at this this web form has two code
files one is called web form one dot
aspx dot CS this is the code behind file
where we actually write our code the
custom code that we write for this page
but then there is another page web form
one
dot aspx dot designer dot CS what is
this file this file is going to contain
the system generated code what do we
mean by that for example let's flip to
the web form if I drag and drop a text
box control on to this web form okay so
I have this text box control and if I
flip to the source the ID of the text
box is textbox one so where is this ID
stored okay if I go to the code-behind
file and if I say text box one dot text
look at that I am able to retrieve that
object so where is the declaration for
this object present if you look at the
code behind itself you don't have the
declaration for that text box anywhere
so where is that present that is present
in the design of fire so text box one
here we are able to use that there okay
so when we added the text box control on
to the web form visual studio you know
has actually generated the code for the
Declaration of the text box and put that
in the design of file so this designer
file is used to store all the system
generated code whereas this web form one
dot aspx dot CS code behind file is used
for the developers custom code so we
have a clean separation here from the
system generated code and the developers
code so that's how the partial classes
are actually used today okay but
Microsoft also claims that if you are
working on a large project spreading a
class or with separate files allow
multiple programmers to work on it
simultaneously for example if you look
at this we have split the customer class
into two files partial customer one and
partial customer two maybe one developer
can work on this file partial customer
to file you know implementing all the
methods of this plus and the other
developer can work on the private fields
and public properties that this class
exposes you know so dividing a class
into multiple files here is actually
allowing two or more developers to work
on that class okay but in reality I
haven't seen anybody using
you know partial classes just to work on
them simultaneously not only asp.net web
applications even the windows forms
applications use you know this technique
to separate the system-generated code
from the developers code for example
let's add a Windows application to this
solution so on the solution right click
add and select new project I'm going to
select Windows have windows forms
application here click OK that's going
to add the windows application and if
you look at this I have a form here and
then on to this form if I drag and drop
a text box control so I have a text box
control here and then if I go to the
forms code file look at that again I am
able to access the textbox 1 or text
property so there should be a
declaration for this textbox somewhere
okay but then if you look at this file
itself the code file here it doesn't
have the declaration for the textbox
anywhere so where is this present again
this form has a designer file form 1 dot
designer dot CS and if we scroll down
you see a declaration for the textbox
control there okay so these web
applications and Windows applications to
separate the system-generated code from
the developers code you know we use
these partial classes in the next
session we'll talk about the rules to
keep in mind when creating partial
classes you know one of the very
important rules to keep in mind is that
when we create these partial classes you
know it's very important that you use
the partial keyword otherwise you know
the system will not know your intention
of dividing that class into two for
example we have two partial classes here
partial plus one I mean partial customer
one dot c s partial customer two dots
it's es for example if I remove the
partial keyword from this then it's like
a regular class now there is already one
a class with partial keyword and you are
creating another class partial customer
here and if I try to compile this as you
might expect we get a compiler error
stating you know missing partial
modifier
on Declaration of type a do demo dot
partial customer so on this class you're
missing the partial keyword because
there is another partial declaration of
this time we're in partial customer one
dot c-- s file okay so there are several
rules that these partial classes should
follow we'll talk about them in the next
session on this slide you can find
resources for asp.net c-sharp and sequel
server interview questions that's it for
today thank you for listening have a
