this video we'll discuss how to issue a
post request using jQuery and the
difference between get and post requests
this is continuation to part 58 so
please watch about 58 before proceeding
to issue a get request we use the jQuery
get function jQuery load function can be
used to issue either a get a post
request depending on whether the data
parameter is specified or not if the
data parameter is specified a post
request is issued otherwise a get
request is issued another method that is
available in jQuery to issue a post
request is post method and here we have
the syntax for post method notice the
parameters of this function are similar
to get function you know previous video
session we discussed an example of using
get function I have this page already
running and I also have the fiddler tool
running now when any of these textboxes
receives focus we are issuing a get
request and along with the get request
we are also sending data to the server
and what data are we sending to the
server here we are sending the key for
which we want the help text let's go
ahead and inspect this request in
fiddler so here we have the request and
look at the request header we are
issuing a get request since we are
issuing a get request and since we are
also sending data to the server the data
will be appended to the URL so notice
the URL here get help text or aspx
question mark help text key equals
first-name now if we want to issue a
post request instead of Ghat then
instead of using gate function use the
post function and if you look at this
post function notice the parameters they
are very similar to get function the
first parameter is the URL the URL to
which we want to send the request the
second parameter is data the data that
we want to send to the server third
parameter is callback function the
function that gets called when the
request completes and the last parameter
is the type of data that we are
expecting from the server in this case
we are expecting XML data so let's go
ahead and save this changes
let's reload this page and now when any
of these textboxes receives focus they
issue a post request the behavior should
be exactly the same except that the
request type now is a post request let's
go ahead and inspect this last request
in fiddler so here we have the last
request you get the request header it's
a post request and even with this post
request we are sending data to the
server the same data the key for which
we want the help text but notice the URL
right here the data that we are sending
to the server is not part of the URL so
where is that data present then it's
present in the message body and if you
want to see that click on this text view
tab and look at this health text key
equals first-name so if you are making a
get request and sending data to the
server the data will be part of the URL
if you are making a post request and
sending data to the server the data will
be part of the message body so to issue
a get request use the get function and
the issue a post request use the post
function so what is the difference
between get and post request
there are several differences in general
get is designed for getting data from
the server whereas post is designed for
modifying data on the server
both get and post can be used to send
data to the server when you are sending
data with a get request the data is
appended to the URL as query strings
with post request the data is included
in the message body there is a limit on
how much data can be sent using a get
request because there is a limit on the
length of data that can be passed as
part of the URL the size limitations
associated with get are different
depending on the client and server
software so if you are sending large
amounts of data then use post or will
get if it's just a small amount of data
then you may use care but in general a
get request should have no side effects
in the sense that it shouldn't modify
data on the server usually if we are
using a get request to send data to the
server it should be to retrieve an item
with a specific ID for example
if we have a URL like this get customer
dot aspx question mark ID equals one you
know we are sending ID equals one to the
server and it's a get request basically
we would do that to retrieve customer
with ID equals 1 in this case you know
we are issuing a get request right and
we are sending the key for which we want
data to the server similarly if you have
a page like get customer dot aspx
question mark ID equals 1 0 2 then you
are sending that ID equals 1 0 2 to the
server to retrieve a customer with ID
equals 1 0 2 ok so in general you know
get is designed for getting data from
the server whereas post is designed for
modifying data on the server that is to
perform inserts updates and deletes a
lot of people keep asking what is the
difference between get and post in Ajax
whether you make get and post requests
using Ajax or by some other means it's
irrelevant
the differences are still the same
between get and post thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
