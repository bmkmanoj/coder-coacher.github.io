in this video we'll discus strictmode in
JavaScript with examples just like Java
and c-sharp JavaScript is also an
object-oriented programming language
however javascript is not very strict in
reporting or throwing errors let's
understand what we mean by the statement
with an example notice here we're trying
to assign this value to this variable my
strain but my string variable is not
already declared if we try to do this in
c-sharp c-sharp compiler would raise an
error saying the name my string does not
exist in the current context let's look
at this quickly in action
so within this code behind file here
we're trying to assign a value to this
variable my string but my string
variable is not already declared because
that we already have a red squiggly and
when I have the mouse over it says the
name my string does not exist in the
current context whereas the same code in
JavaScript is not going to raise any
error javascript in this case is going
to automatically create a global
variable with name my string that's the
default behavior this kind of a behavior
may lead the developer to make more
mistakes so when we execute this code
it's going to print this is a stranger
to the webpage so have this exact same
code here notice that we have a variable
that variable is not already declared
what we are trying to assign a value to
that and we are writing its value to the
webpage using document or tried so when
we run this it's going to print that
this is a string on the webpage just
like Java and c-sharp if you want
javascript also to throw an error then
use strict mode so the obvious next
question is how to enable strict mode to
enable strict mode all you need to do is
use this use straight statement so
within this HTML page at the top of the
script section I am going to use use
strict statement so let's save the
changes let's reload the page and notice
that we don't have the output and we get
and error it says variable undefined in
strict mode so basically it says my
string is undefined and if you want to
view this error in Google Chrome then
use developer tools so let's browse this
page with Google Chrome so notice Google
Chrome does not display anything now
when we press f12 it's going to launch
the developer tools and within the
console window we get an uncaught
reference error my string is not defined
now let's discuss how to enforce
JavaScript strictness in a specific
function so if you look at the example
here we used the statement use straight
at the top of the script section so all
the script in this section you know it's
going to adhere to JavaScript strictness
now for some reason if you want to
enforce strictness only within a
specific function then use that
statement inside that function so let's
remove that from there and then let's
create a function let's name this my
function and inside this function I'm
going to create another variable so
let's call this other string equals this
is another string and then let's use an
HTML break there
and let's read the value of this other
string to the webpage and then let's
call this my function and now we want to
end for strictness only inside this
function so I am going to use that
statement you straight you know at the
top of this function so strictness now
will be enforced only within this my
function so when we run this it's going
to print both the strength this is a
string and this is another string now
notice here we are assigning a value to
a variable it's not already declared but
we don't get an error but if we try to
do that inside this function then it's
going to throw an error look at this
when I reload the page you know it
prints the first line without any
problem but then when it calls this
function you know here inside this
function we're trying to assign a value
to variable that's not already declared
and we are using you strict statement
there so it's going to raise the error
variable undefined in strict mode now
let's look at another example in c-sharp
if you assign a value to a read-only
property then you get a compiler error
so in the example right here we have an
employee class which has called this
private field underscore name we have a
constructor that takes name parameter so
we are using this constructor to
initialize that private field underscore
name and then we have a property here a
public property but notice this probably
property has only the get accessor it
lacks set accessor so this property is a
read-only property of this employee
object and within the page load event
we're creating an instance of the
employee class and to the constructor
via passing mark as the name so this
will be used to initialize this name
field and then we're using the name of
property to change the name of the
employee but look at this name property
it's a read-only property because it
only has got the get accessor so we're
trying to assign a value to a read-only
property so this is a compile time error
in c-sharp and it's going to raise this
error property or index
demo dot employee dot name cannot be
assigned to it is read-only so let's
look at this quickly in action so I have
already typed that employee class so
let's copy that and go to the
code-behind file here and I'm going to
paste that employee class there's the
same class that we have seen on the
slide so employee class with a play
Whitefield constructor and a public
property at read-only property so within
the page load event let's create an
instance of the employee and to the
constructor let's pass mark as the name
and I'm going to use the name property
of the employee object which is a
read-only property and then assign it a
value so I'm going to say mark M and
look at this we have a red squiggly
right away under employee dot name and
when we hover the mouse over we get a
compiler error saying property our index
ax
demo dot employee dot name cannot be
assigned to it is read-only
in JavaScript if you assign a value to a
read-only property javascript silently
fails without raising an error so here
we have an employee constructor function
so to deconstruct a function we are
passing name parameter we're using the
parameter to initialize this private
field
underscore name and then here we are
creating name property on the employee
object okay we discussed properties in
detail in part 458 of this video series
so I'm not going to go into the
specifics of properties here but this is
a read-only property because we only
have the get accessor it doesn't have
this set accessor so it's a read-only
property and then here we are creating
an instance of the employee constructor
function you're passing mark as the name
for the employee and then notice here we
are trying to assign a value to this
name property which is a read-only
property now JavaScript is not going to
raise an error by default it's going to
silently fail
and then the name of the employee would
remain mark it will not be changed to
mark M so when we execute this code it's
going to print the name of the employee
s mark you know this line will silently
fail without raising an error so let's
quickly look at that in action so let's
copy that piece of code go to the HTML
page so we have the employee constructor
function we're creating an employee
object the name of the employee's mark
we're changing marks named mark M using
the name property but that property's a
read-only property and then finally we
are writing the name of the employee so
this is going to print mark because this
line will silently fail without an error
so when we run this notice that it still
says mark okay but this line is not
throwing an error so just like C sharp
if we want JavaScript to throw an error
then use strict mod so I am going to
enable strict mode by using you strict
so now when we reload this page notice
that at that line we get an error and it
says assignment to read-only properties
is not allowed in strict mode so now we
know that we cannot change the name of
the employee using this property because
that's a read-only property ACMA script
version 5 introduced strict mode to
JavaScript with strict mode on it is
easier to detect JavaScript silent
errors as they would throw an error now
this makes debugging much easier and the
chances of developers making mistakes is
reduced most modern browsers support
strict mode for the list of most
important restrictions that apply in
strict mode please refer to this MSDN
