am venket this is part 67 of asp.net
video series in this session we'll
discuss about application state
variables before continuing with the
session I strongly recommend to watch
part 64 65 and 66 of this video series
in the previous sessions of this video
series we have discussed about different
techniques to send data from one wave
form to another in this session we'll
discuss about application state
variables let's look at a simple example
first let's flip to visual studio I have
an asp.net web application project here
with two web forms on web form one I
have two text box controls where the
user can enter the name and email and
once they click on this button go to
wave form to the user will be navigated
to wave form to dot aspx and on this
wave form I have two labeled controls
which will then display the name and
email that we have entered on webform
one dot aspx and to do that we are going
to make use of application state
variables so when I double click this
button the even handler gets generated
I want to retrieve the name from the
name a text box txt name dot text and
then I want to store that in an
application variable so application off
and I'm going to use the key s name okay
and along the same lines I want to
retrieve the email from the email text
box and store it in the session in the
application variable so txt email the
text will give me that and I'm going to
use the key as application of email and
finally we want to redirect the user to
wave form to and I'm using response
toward redirect for that till that
character to indicate you know within
the current web application root
directory I want to go to webform to dot
aspx okay so this should navigate the
user to wave form to dot aspx on the
page load event of webform to dot aspx i
want to retrieve you know the name from
the application variable so application
of name and look at that in an
application variable just like session
variable you can store anything into it
and that's why when you try to retrieve
you know anything out of application
variable it's going to return that as an
object type okay now you have to
typecast it to the type that you are
expecting in our case we are expecting a
string
so I'm going to convert that to a string
using two string method and we are going
to assign that to LVL name label okay
and along the same lines I am going to
retrieve the email from the application
level variable so application of email
and then I'm going to store that in LBL
email text box that's it now let's go
ahead and run this application so when
the webform loads we should be able to
enter the name and email so let me enter
test as the name and test email has the
email so I am able to send the data from
webform one to wave form two and we are
using application level variables for
that now one important thing to keep in
mind is application state variables are
available across all pages and across
all sessions so application state
variables are like multi-user global
data whereas if you look at session
state variables session state variables
are available across all pages but for a
given specific session session state
variables cannot be shared between
sessions the session variable belonging
to a specific session cannot be read by
another session okay but whereas
application level variables are
accessible across all pages and across
all sessions that's why we see
application state variables are like
multi-user global data and whereas
session variables are single user global
data application state variables are
stored on the web server just like
session state variables application
state variables are stone on the web
server but for session state variables
we have other options as well we can
store session state variables either in
a state server or we can also store them
in a sequel server database or or we can
also provide our own custom session
storage provider and we have discussed
about that in part 62 63 64 65 and 66 of
this video series but various
application state variables are always
stored on the web server and application
state variables are only cleared when
the process hosting the application is
restarted that is when the application
ends but whereas session state variables
are cleared
you know whenever the timeout of that
session is
reach okay which means at certain point
of time the session variables are going
to be cleared
but then application state variables are
cleared only when the process hosting
the application is restarted let's
quickly look at an example so now I'm
going to run this so when we run this
look at this application state variable
so if I navigate to waveform to dot aspx
as it stands now look at that that is
still being shown so how long are these
name and the email are going to stay on
the web server they are going to stay on
the web server until the process hosting
this application ends or restarts and
what is the process that you know runs
this application the asp.net worker
process which is nothing but W 3 w PT
exa so if I go to the task manager and
click on this show processes from all
users we should see W 3 w P dot exe so
when I end this that's when you know the
application state variables lost so now
if I make a request for that ok and this
is another important thing look at that
I am accessing I'm trying to access an
application variable and this is not
pleasant because that's not at the
moment ok and it's it's drawing a null
reference exception why because you're
calling to string method on a null
object so that's why
just like session variables it makes
sense to actually check if the
application variable is null before
trying to access that and then use to
string or any other method on that
application level variable so first for
example something like this if
application of name not equal to now
something like that so when you do a
null check if it is null then that piece
of code will not be executed do the same
thing for email as well application
state variables are not shade across a
web form on a web car and now if you
look at this the application state
variables are actually created on the
web server
now in a web form is a situation where
the web application is hosted on
multiple web servers and then there is a
load balancer when
different clients make requests to your
web application they will go through the
load balancer and the load balancer will
identify the web server that is least
busy and it will redirect the request to
that web server yeah that's a web form
whereas web Garden is a situation where
you have deployed a web application on a
server which has got multiple processors
okay
now in a web form or a web card and when
a when a client makes a request and when
when the request
you know first goes to web server one
let's say the application state
variables are created on that web server
and then if the subsequent request is
made by this client and if the load
balancer redirects redirects that
request to another web server maybe to
web server to then on this web web
server we don't have those application
state variables so they are basically
not shared between web servers but
whereas if it's the case with session
state variables you know if you want to
deploy your web application in a web
format web garden situation and you want
the session state variables to be
available across all web servers then we
have the choice of choosing an out of
process session state mode which is you
know either state server or sequel
server but with application state
variables they're always stored on the
web server you don't have an alternative
there okay so the application state
variables are not available on a web
form or a web garden application state
variables are not thread safe so
application state variables have global
access and all sessions can read and
write to them so there are there could
be concurrency related issues that's why
you have to synchronize access to an
application level variable that's why
application object provides a lock and
unlock methods now before you try to
modify you know an application level
variable you you call the application
lock which ensures that in a
multi-threaded environment you know when
multiple threads are trying to access
that variable you know only one thread
can enter you know this piece of code
and change that variable if at that
point of time if there are other
requests you know try to commit coming
and you know those will be queued until
the unlock method is called by the
current thread which is modifying the
value this way we can ensure that only
one thread is able to modify that
variable at any given point of time so
make sure you always use this lock and
unlock methods to ensure you know thread
synchronization so that we can avoid
race conditions deadlocks and access
violations and it is an example if you
look at this we are using application
state variables in the wrong way you
know if the purpose is just to send data
from one waveform to another you know
you can use any of these techniques from
one from one to five application state
variables should not really be we
shouldn't be using application state
variables for the you know sake of just
sending data from one waveform to
another because they will be there in
the memory for a very long time and then
the application state variables are
multi-user global data so one user
session can change those values you know
the value is belonging to another
session okay so if the requirement is
just a send data from one waveform to
another waveform consider other
alternatives
don't use application state variables
you know but in an interview they could
ask you what are the different
techniques to send data from one
waveform to another we can say
application state variables and it's
possible to send data using application
state variables from one waveform to
another but we shouldn't really be using
application state variables for that
purpose so use application state
variables only when the variables need
to have global access and when you need
them for entire time during the lifetime
of an application from when the
application starts to when it terminates
now if you want in a global access for
certain variables and for certain
duration then we have another object
called cache object we'll be talking
about cache object in a later video
session but cache object can be used for
that purpose because what I you you
stored in a cache object has global
access it can be access to anywhere but
then cache a cache object can have an
expiry set so it's so skerin T to be you
know cleared at a certain point of time
depending on the expiry time
on this slide you can find resources for
HP dotnet c-sharp and sequence of
interview questions that's it for today
thank you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
