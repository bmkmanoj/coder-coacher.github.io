in this video we'll discuss creating a
WCF service hosting the WCF service
using a console application exposing two
service endpoints and finally creating a
windows and a web client applications
this is continuation to part two so
please watch part 2 from the WCF video
series before proceeding with this video
we've got two clients the first client
is using a java web application to
communicate with our service for him
interoperability is the main requirement
so he wants XML messages over HTTP
protocol to satisfy this client
requirement we have written the service
using asp.net web services technology
the second client is using Windows
application to communicate with our
servers Windows application is also a
dotnet application for him performance
is the main requirement so he wants
binary messages so TCP protocol to
satisfy this client requirement we have
rewritten the same service using a
different technology that is dotnet
remoting and in part 2 we have seen how
different these two technologies are
just because these different clients one
different protocols and different
message formats we had to implement that
service using two different technologies
with WCF we don't have to use a the
dotnet remoting or asp.net web services
anymore we implement a single WC of
servers and then we expose two end
points the first end point is going to
exchange XML messages over HTTP protocol
so the interoperability requirement of
the first client is Matt the second end
point is going to exchange binary
messages over TCP protocol so the
requirement of the second client is also
Matt so here we are just using a single
service all we are doing is configuring
two endpoints to satisfy both the client
requirements in case if we had a third
client and if you want a different set
of protocols and message formats we are
going to expose another endpoints for
him but the service doesn't change in
any way it's just gone in the
configuration file we are going to
introduce another endpoint
now let's go ahead and implement a WCF
service let's flip to visual studio
first let's create a class library
project so file new project let's add a
class library project and let's call
this hello service let's delete this
class 1 dot CS file that is
auto-generated for us and to this
project let's add a WCF service add a
new item and search for WCF so here we
have the WCF service and let's name our
WCF service as hello service
look at this adding a WCF service did
two things here the first thing is it
has added a reference to system dot
service model assembly system dot
service model assembly is the core to
WCF all the attributes and classes that
we use with WCF are present in this
assembly and the second thing is it has
added two class files I
hello service dot CS and hello' service
dot CS if you look at this I hello
service dot CS file it has got an
interface I hello service and that's
decorated with service contract
attribute just by decorating this
interface with the service contract
attribute we are turning this interface
into a WCF service and the notice that
this interface has got one method to
work and that is decorated with
operation contract attribute so by
decorating a method with operation
contract attribute you're making that
method available as part of this service
to the client so if you have let's say
ten methods and if you want all those
ten methods to be available for your
client then you decorate all those ten
methods with operation contract
attribute all right now we want our
method to be named as get message and
the return type should be string and
this message is going to have a
parameter of type string and let's call
the parameter as
name all right now if you look at this
hallow service dot CS file we have a
class here hollow service and this class
is actually implementing that I
hello service interface okay now we have
changed the name of the method so let's
delete this one and when I click on this
interface look at this I get an option
to implement the interface a hollow
service so let's click on that so it
will automatically generate the method
signature for us to get that the name of
the method is get message written type a
string and it has got a parameter of
type string so all this method is going
to do is return hello plus whatever
string that we get into this method ok
so basically we have an interface here
the interface is decorated with service
contract attribute so this is a service
contract and within the service contract
we have got one operation contract
meaning one operation that the client
can invoke and then within this file
hello service dot CS file we have
provided the implementation for the
interface method for the service
contract method which is get message all
right so that's it we are done
building a WCF service now the next step
is to actually host this WCF service for
hosting this WCF service we are going to
make use of a console application to
keep things simple
but then at WCF service has got lot of
hosting options meaning we can host a
WCF service using windows forms
application windows service or iis we'll
discuss all these hosting options in a
later video session so let's go ahead
and add a control application to the
solution and let's call it hello service
host click OK now to host a service we
need to add a reference to the service
model assembly so let's add a reference
to system dot service model it's a
dotnet assembly so make sure you have
dotnet
selected and system dot service model
let's click OK and then we need a
reference to the service itself so let's
add a reference to that hollow service
project so click on the projects tab and
then select hello service and then the
most important thing is we need to
specify the configuration so we have the
service ready so we created this WCF
service now within the configuration
file we are going to specify two end
points for this WCF service and we are
going to do that within the host when we
host the service that's when we specify
the end points so to this host project
let's add a configuration file and to do
that right-click on the project
add a new item and we want to add
application configuration file so app
config click Add so to this console
application it should add app config
file so here we need to write some
configuration basically to expose these
two endpoints so let's specify the
configuration so we use a system dot
service model element and within that we
are going to have services so let's
specify a service the first thing here
we need to specify the name of the
service what's the name of our service
the name is hello service and then it is
present in the namespace hello service
so the fully qualified name of our
service is hello service dot hello
service so this is the name of the class
and that's the name of the namespace and
then this service that is our WCF
service is going to have two endpoints
so let's go ahead and specify those
endpoints here so endpoint now an
endpoint needs to have three things that
is the address binding and the contract
okay
so let's add them first address so this
address specifies to the client where
your service is available
ok now we are going to make use of
relative addresses in a bit we'll talk
more about this address if it's not
clear
at the moment so for now let's call it
hello service and then the next thing is
we need to specify the binding and this
is the most important thing in WCF there
are several bindings and if you want to
have a look at all the bindings that are
available with WCF open this bindings
element so under service model so we
have this bindings element and within
bindings you know when I open that
angular bracket look at this desire
several bindings which supports
different protocols and message formats
will discuss these bindings in detail in
a later video session now here with the
first end point we want to use HTTP
protocol and the messages should be in
XML format and the binding that support
you know this message format and this
HTTP protocol is basic HTTP binding so
here look at that we have got basic HTTP
binding so let's copy that and specify
as the binding name and then the next
thing is we need to specify the contract
itself that is the service contract okay
and that's how the client will come to
know what are all the operations that
are available within the contract and
what is our contract is nothing but the
interface so the name of the interfaces
I hello service and that's present in
this namespace
hello service so let's specify that as
the contract hello service dot I hello
service that's the contract okay so
that's the first end point now this end
point is going to satisfy the
requirement of this client but you need
another end point to satisfy the
requirement of this client this client
wants binary messages or TCP protocol so
we have another binding called net TCP
binding so this binding uses TCP
protocol in the message format will be
binary by default so let's use that
finding so let's make a copy of this
endpoint
and here again the address is going to
be hello service and the binding is
going to be net TCP binding and contract
again remains the same hello service dot
I holo service all right now we need to
expose another end point here that end
point is basically for exchanging
metadata now to consume a web service
what do clients do you know they will
invoke the URL with an ad reference
dialog box they specify the URL of the
Vistal document even with WCF we use
Vistal that is web service description
language files to exchange metadata
regarding the WCF service now we need to
allow the service to exchange metadata
and we need to specify an endpoint for
that as well okay so let's specify the
endpoint for metadata exchange so
endpoint the address for this one is
going to be max again
all these addresses are relative we'll
talk about them in just a bit and the
binding for metadata exchange is going
to be a different binding and that is
called max HTTP binding so let's specify
that as the binding name and then the
contract is going to be I metadata
exchange that's the name of the contract
to exchange metadata so this is the
endpoint that the users will have to get
the Vistal document in a bit we'll see
how the clients are going to use this
endpoint to get the vestal document
using which the client will generate the
proxy classes all right let's get rid of
these bindings now all right so we have
specified the endpoints here another
thing that we need to specify here is
the base address now we have specified
this address is a relative address so
let's specify a base address here and to
specify the base address we are going to
use the host element and within that we
are going to use base addresses element
and within that we are going to add two
base addresses
so the first base address is going to be
HTTP colon four slash four slash
localhost colon 8080 you can give any
available port on your machine so
basically this is one best base address
now to invoke the hello service using
HTTP protocol they're going to issue
HTTP colon 4 / localhost local 4 / 4 /
localhost colon 8080
/hello service that's the complete
address to invoke the hello service
using HTTP protocol so our service will
be available at port number 80 80 and
now for this end point we are going to
have another base address now this one
is for use with TCP protocol so the
protocol here is going to be net dot TCP
colon 4 / 4 / localhost and let's use a
different port number 1890 so if
somebody wants to use the TCP protocol
and our I hello service what they do is
net dot TCP colon four slash four slash
localhost colon 1890 /hello service all
right so that's the base addresses now
we need to do one more thing that is we
need to specify service behaviors and to
specify service behaviors we use
behaviors element and we want to specify
service behaviors and let's add a
behavior now for a be a behavior can
have a name so let's call it max
behavior basically this behavior is to
allow the service to exchange metadata
okay in a bit you will understand how we
are going to make use of this one
behavior you can give it any meaningful
name that you want
and within this behavior here we are
going to specify service metadata and we
want to allow HTTP cat you know somebody
request you know the metadata of this
service using HTTP GET we want to allow
that so HTTP GET enabled equals true so
they're going to use the get request to
request the service metadata okay and
then the final thing that we need to do
is associate this service behavior with
our service itself okay and to do that
look at the name of the behavior it is
max behavior so let's copy that name and
then to link up this behavior with this
service we are going to use behavior
configuration and then specify the name
there that's it we are done now let's
set our service host as the startup
project so set a start a project and
then let's run this now and before we do
that we actually need to open the
service host so let's get to the program
dot CS file so the second sole
application and we have the main method
here so within the main method we need
to open the service host for
communication so let's use system dot
service model namespace and within the
system dot service model namespace we've
got service host class so service host
let's call it host equals new service
host now we are going to make use of
this constructor way we need to specify
the service type okay so how do we get
the type of a class or an interface by
using the type of keyword so type off
and what is our service type it's
nothing bad
hello service within hello service okay
so let's copy hello service type of
hello service dot hello service
and then we are going to use hosts open
so this should open the service for
communication all right now just to make
sure that the service has started let's
print a message to the console so
console dot write line let's just say
host started at whatever time the host
has started let's use date/time dot now
dot to string and then finally this is a
console application so when we run it
you know it's going to print this line
and it will automatically close so in
order to prevent that from closing
automatically let's use console dot read
line all right we are done so let's go
ahead and run this we have said this as
our starter project so let's run it by
pressing control f5 so if we have done
everything correctly we should get no
exceptions look at that who started at
that time and that date all right now
all that is left is to build the client
applications so let's start another
instance of Visual Studio and then first
let's arm satisfy the requirement of the
first line so let's build an asp.net web
application so file new project and
let's use a web under install templates
and let's create an empty asp.net web
application let's call this hello web
client but actually before we do that
let's create this project but before we
consume the service if you recollect
within this service we have specified
three endpoints okay and this endpoint
is for metadata exchange
okay so basically if I want the Vistal
document of this service you know if I
visit this base URL and then specify
this four slash max we should be able to
get the visceral document associated
with the service so let's fire up a
browser
let's copy this URL and then specify it
there so now look at that the service is
running and then we visited that you are
a localhost colon 8080 look at that we
have a Vistal document now when we click
on that look at that it's very similar
to the Vistal document that we have used
with web services basically this Vistal
document is used by the client to
generate the proxy classes using which
we can communicate with the service okay
all right now let's go back to our web
application and then we need to add a
reference to the service itself so right
click on the references folder add
service reference option and then
specify the address so that's the
address which is going to give us the
Vistal document click go so this should
you know connect to that service look at
that we have the hello service and then
within that service we have this get
message operation all right let's give
it a meaningful name space let's call it
hello service and click OK so this
should add a reference to that service
look at that it has automatically
generated you know the proxy classes for
us here
hello service and then within the web
config file it has generated a lot of
configuration for us if you remember we
have specified two endpoints look at
that you know this one is using HTTP
protocol that's the URL to invoke the
service and this one is using TCP
protocol and that's support number okay
and then here we've got two bindings the
first one is the basic binding basic
HTTP binding and that's the name of that
binding and here they've got net TCP
binding and that's the name of the PCP
binding okay all right now let's get to
look at this it has also added a
reference to system dot service more
assembly now let's right-click on this
project and add a web form and on this
waveform we need a textbox control first
of all let's set this style attribute
and let's set font family to area and
let's drag and drop a textbox control a
button control and a label control
so let's include an HTML break here all
right on the button let's say the text
is get message and then let's get rid of
this default text and let's set font
bold equals true
all right let's flip this to the design
mode let's double click on the button
control to generate the click event
handler and here we need to create an
instance of the proxy class and if you
remember the namespace that we have
given is hello service within that we
should have hello service client so that
is client equals new client and then
that client dot get message and then
obviously we need to pass the name where
are we going to get the name from from
textbox1 control and then whatever
response that we get back we are going
to display that within label 1 control
so label 1 dot text equals that now when
we run this this is actually going to
throw an exception we'll fix that in
just a bit okay so let's end up regime
and click get message and look at that
it throws an exception it says an
endpoint configuration section for
contract I hello service could not be
loaded because more than one endpoint
configuration for that contract was
found so within the web config file of
our client application there are more
than one endpoint ok
so we need to basically specify which
endpoints we want to use do you want to
use this endpoint or do you want to use
this endpoint so let's use this endpoint
so basic HTTP binding so let's and then
when we build a client using the client
constructor we can specify the end point
configuration name
all right but this let's go ahead and
run it so now this is going to use basic
HTTP binding so let's say pledging get
message look at that hello presume it
works as expected all right
now let's quickly go ahead and build a
Windows application and use TCP binding
there and it turns out to be you know
the steps are very similar so let's
create a file new project and this time
let's create a vendor's forms
application and let's call this hello
vandals client click OK and then we need
to add a reference to the service itself
and what is the URL of you know the
service way we can get metadata
localhost colon 8080 and then click go
so this should find that service you
have that get message and let's give it
a meaningful name space let's call it a
hello service look at this these steps
are very similar to what we have done
all right again test generated the proxy
class so let's go ahead drag and drop a
text box button and the label control so
we need a text box we need a button and
finally we need a label all right let's
arrange these things a bit
let's quickly change the font size of
the label control so let's set font size
to something 15 so that we can see it
properly
all right let's click the button to
generate the click event handler so what
we need to do here create the proxy
class
hello service dot hello service client
let's call it client equals new hello so
is client and we need to specify which
endpoint we want to use so within web
dot within app config file this is a
windows forms application
so there's app dot config file so within
that there are again two bindings so
which binding do you want to use so the
windows application wants to use TCP
protocol and binary messages so we are
going to use this binding net TCP
binding so let's copy that and specify
that as the binding name and then client
dot get message so where is the message
going to come from from the textbox
control so text box one dot text and the
sket message is going to return a string
which we want to display and label one
control that's it let's go and run this
and see if it works as expected
all right let's pass pro team as the
text and look at that
hello Prejean so now just by exposing
two endpoints our both client
requirements are met all right that's it
for today thanks for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
