in this video we'll discuss regular
expression object in JavaScript there
are two ways to create a regular
expression in JavaScript one of the ways
is by using regular expression literal
all the examples that we have discussed
so far in this video series we have used
regular expression literal to create a
regular expression this is the preferred
approach because regular expressions
created using regular expression literal
are compiled automatically as soon as
the script is loaded so from a
performance perspective use this
approach if you know the regular
expression will not change during the
course of your program execution let's
look at an example so here we have got a
string with four numbers within it now
what we want to do is replace all those
numbers with xxx so we need a regular
expression for that so let's create a
variable and now we are going to create
a regular expression using regular
expression literal backslash d plus so
this regular expression is going to find
any number in a given strain now we want
to replace all the numbers in the string
so we want to do a global search let's
use a global modifier so here we have a
regular expression that's created using
regular expression literal so let's use
document or try it function so we are
going to use the replace method on the
string object so this method has got two
parameters the first parameter is the
regular expression we already have the
regular expression and the replacement
value is xxx so let's save the changes
load the page and notice that all the
numbers in the string are replaced with
that replacement value so in this
example have created a regular
expression using regular expression
lettre the other way is by using the
constructor function of the regular
expression object so notice here were
using the constructor function so
instead of using a regular expression
literal I am going to use the
constructor function
and to this we will pass the regular
expression as a string so the regular
expression is backslash d+ and we want
to do a global search so I'm going to
pass the global modifier as second
argument and we are passing that regular
expression to the replace method so
let's see if these changes reload the
page now notice that the example didn't
work why is that that's basically
because we look at the regular
expression here that's passed as a
string so we need to escape this
backslash with another backslash so
let's save the changes reload the page
now notice that it works as expected
so here we have created a regular
expression using constructor function
here we've got some of the commonly used
properties of the regular expression
object the first three properties global
ignore case and multi-line these are
boolean properties and returns true or
false depending on whether that flag is
set or not so if you look at the regular
expression here we have set the global
modifier so if we call the global
property on the regular expression
object that's going to return true
because that flag is said let's actually
look at that in action so document dot
right we want to print the value of
global so document dot right we have the
regular expression object dot global
property should return true and let's
also append an HTML break
so I am and source so the global
property will return you know whether
the global modify asset or not similarly
there's another property called ignore
case this is going to return true if the
case insensitive flag is set otherwise
falls at the moment we don't have the
case insensitive flag set on this
regular expression so this is going to
return false and the same is for
multi-line and the source property is
going to return the regular expression
as a string
so with these let's save reload the page
notice that G returns true because we
have said the global flag is false M is
false and source actually returns our
regular expression backslash T plus the
additional backslash there is to escape
the backslash so we'll only get one now
if we go and set the case insensitive
flag notice that now ignore case should
return true here we have got some of the
commonly used regular expression object
methods execute method this method test
for a match in a given string and
returns the first match if a match is
found otherwise it's going to return now
test method this method also tests for a
match but it returns a boolean value it
returns true if a match is found
otherwise false to string method this
method returns the string value of the
regular expression so let's look at an
example of using execute method so this
string right here has got four numbers
with a net right so let's go ahead and
use the execute method so what is
execute method going to do it's going to
return the first match so we have the
regular expression object I'm going to
call execute method on that and to the
execute method we pass our input string
which is present in this variable
and whatever value we get let's write
that to the document object let's load
the page notice that we get the first
number maximum so basically this one
looks for a number and within the string
the first number is this one that's what
we get now if you want to retrieve all
the matches and you want to use execute
method then in that case you will have
to call the execute method repeatedly
with a global flag so here we already
have the global flag set case
insensitive flag is not applicable for
this example so let's get rid of that
now what I'm going to do is call the
execute method repeatedly first let's
create a variable to hold the result and
I'm going to use a while loop while
result equals we are going to call the
execute method and what our result we
get we're going to store that in this
and then I'm going to check if it's not
equal to not so until a match is not
found until we get now you know call the
execute method on the regular expression
object repeatedly and then whatever
result we get back we are going to write
that to the document so result what we
actually get back is an array so
whatever value we have at array index
position zero right it to the web page
and also append an HTML break now
execute method returns an array let's
actually look at that array in action so
let's run this in debug mode let's throw
in a breakpoint here and let's debug
this using Internet Explorer so let's
browse with Internet Explorer let's set
that as the default and then run the
application in debug mode
so now so the execute method is you know
executed so if I hover the mouse who
resolves where you will look at what we
get back we actually get an array back
and within that array in the zero eight
location we have the number right and
that's what we want that's the reason
why we have indexed start with zero so
if I + let's remove the breakpoint and +
f5 we should get all the phone numbers
back from the given string so here we
are calling the execute method
repeatedly now test method returns true
or false depending on whether a match is
found or not so let's actually close the
browser window so this regular
expression object also supports test
method again - the test method we need
to pass our input string all I'm going
to do is document dot write string
contain numbers so if the string
contains numbers this test method should
return true otherwise false because this
regular expression looks four in number
right so since this string containing
contains you know four numbers test
method should return true so let's save
the changes reload this page so string
contain numbers it returns true so here
we have constructed a regular expression
using the constructor function now even
if you have created a regular expression
using literal I mean the regular
expression literal you should still be
able to use test and execute methods so
if I have a regular expression created
like this using the regular expression
literal and this variable you know
contains that regular expression so here
we're calling the test method
you know the example should work exactly
the same way so irrespective of whether
you create a regular expression using
regular expression literal or regular
expression object you should still be
able to use test and execute methods you
know for that matter you don't even have
to use a variable you can directly take
that regular expression and then call
test our execute method on that so I
have the regular expression pasted here
and then I'm calling the test method so
now let's save the changes reload the
page it should still read give us the
same output thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
