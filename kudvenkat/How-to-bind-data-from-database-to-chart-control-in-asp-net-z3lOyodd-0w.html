tutorial in this video we'll discuss how
to bind database data to chart control
this is continuation to part 3 so please
watch part 3 before proceeding in part 3
of this video series we discussed
creating chart data programmatically but
the problem with this code is that we
have hard-coded student data within the
application code in real time student
data is stored in a database table in
this video we'll discuss how to retrieve
data from the database table and then
bind it to the chart control so the
first step is to create the students
table so let's flip to sequencer
management studio here I have the sequel
code to create the students table and
then populate it with data I have
already created this table and here is
the data let's flip to visual studio the
second step is to include a connection
string and web config file so within the
configuration section let's include
connection strings section and here we
need to have a connection string that
points to our sequel server database so
let me paste the connection string here
and then within the code-behind file we
need to write ad or net code to retrieve
data from the sequel server database so
let's bring in the required ad or dotnet
namespaces we need system door data dot
sequel client and we need system dot
configuration and let then get chart
data function we need to write code to
retrieve data so the first step here is
to read the connection string from web
config file so let's make use of
configuration manager class and the name
of the connection string is CS so we
have the connection string now the next
step is to create a sequel connection
object so sequel connection con equals
new sequel connection let's pass the
connection string that we have read from
web config file the next step is to
create the sequel command object so now
for the chart we want student name and
total marks so here I have the sequel
query which is going to return student
name and their total marks so let's copy
the sequel command and then specify it
here
and we want this command to be executed
using the connection that we have
previously created let's open the
connection and let's execute the command
so command dot execute Reader and let's
use a sequel data reader all right now
while we are looping through each record
in the data reader we want to add the
student name and total marks to the
chart control now we will be adding data
points to the series one element that is
present inside chart one control so we
need this line as well so before we open
the connection you know let's get a
reference to the series of the chart
control to which we want to add data and
then you know we will be using the
points collection property of the series
element and we'll use the add XY method
so here instead of hard-coding the data
we now need to read the data from the
data reader and then add that data to
the series so to do that we have the
reader object so reader off on the
x-axis we want the student name and if
you look at the columns here the name of
the column is student name so let's copy
that and specify that as the value for x
axis let's convert that to string and
for y-axis total marks is the value so
RDR off total marks that's it
so let's delete that and let's go ahead
and run this code now so now the chart
should actually be retrieving data from
the database table so let's select
column for example notice that the data
is displayed using a column chart and
let's select donut the data should be
displayed using a donut chart thank you
for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
