tutorial in this video we will discuss
select list validation in Angela let's
understand this with an example here is
what we wanted to we want to make this
department field a required field if we
don't have any Department selected then
we want to display this required
validation error message as soon as we
select a Department the validation error
message should disappear notice we have
our department select list right here
validating a select list in angular is
very similar to how we validate text
boxes radio buttons and checkboxes we
already discussed how to validate these
three types of controls in our previous
videos in the series now to validate
this Department select list we follow
exact same steps so let's quickly make
this department field a required field
first we make the Select list required
by including the required attribute next
let's create a template reference
variable notice we have named our
template reference variable Department
we are then going to use this template
reference variable Department in the
class binding notice this bootstrap
class has error is used for styling the
validation error messages next we want
to style this label text Department for
that we are going to use another
bootstrap class and that is this control
label class finally let's include a span
element that displays the required of
validation error message notice these
tabs are very similar to how we validate
the other types of controls like text
boxes radio buttons and checkboxes let's
save our changes and then take a look at
the browser notice now if we touch the
department drop-down list and if we
don't select any option we get the
required validation error message as
soon as we select a department the
validation error message disappears so
at this point our select list
required validation is working is
expected now let's take this to the next
level in most of the real-world
applications in addition to the list of
departments that we already have we
typically have another option and that
option is usually the first option and
that's going to act as the prompt for
the user some
along the lines of select Department
please select etc so let's add select
Department as the first option to our
select list now notice this piece of
code right here we are using the ng for
structural directive to loop over the
list of departments that we have in the
department's array and then add one
option for each department and this
departments array is coming from our
component class so let's quickly take a
look at the component class notice that
departments array is right here and we
have over five departments and we see
those five departments right here in
addition to those five departments we
also want select the department as the
first option
let's close this Explorer window and
then within our beauty unplayed just
about this option loop I'm going to
include another option and that is our
select department option notice I have
set the value of this option to minus
one so we are going to use this value to
validate if the user has selected a
valid department let's save our changes
and then take a quick look at the
browser notice the department select
list we want our first option select
department to be selected by default
when the form initially loads so let's
fix that notice our select department
option its value is minus 1 and we are
binding this select element to the
department property of the employee
object so if we take a look at our model
within the component class here is our
employee object and the department
property at the moment is now that's the
reason we don't have any option selected
within the select list but we want our
option select the department which is
the first option to be selected by
default so I'm going to set this
property to its option value which is
minus 1 notice now we have a first
option select department selected by
default but we have another problem we
have just broken the required validation
it's not working anymore now if I touch
the drop down list and leave it without
selecting a valid department I expect to
see required validation error
because the select Department is not a
valid Department selection we know that
but Anglo validation system does not
know it because if you look at the
department property value within the
model notice its value is minus 1 and
not null anymore so angular is treating
that as a valid department ID but we
know it's not a valid department so if
the user selects this option then we
want to show that required validation
error will discuss how to fix that by
creating a custom validator in our next
video here is the code that we used in
the demo thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
