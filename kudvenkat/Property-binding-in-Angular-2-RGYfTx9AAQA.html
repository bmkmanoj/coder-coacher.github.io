this video we'll discuss property
binding in angular with examples this is
continuation to part eight so please
watch part eight before proceeding in
our previous video we've displayed this
image on a web page using interpolation
if you recollect interpolation is all
about moving data in one direction that
is from our component class properties
to HTML element properties property
binding also deals with the same thing
move component class properties to HTML
element properties so at the moment
notice we are using interpolation so
within our component class we have a
property called image part and we are
binding this image part property to the
image element source property using
interpolation now let's see how to
rewrite the same example using property
binding to use property binding we
enclose the HTML element property name
within a pair of square brackets like
that and then we'll have an equal to
sign and in the name of our property
within a pair of single or double quotes
like that let's save our changes and
reload our web page by pressing ctrl f5
notice we see the image exactly the same
way as before so the point to keep in
mind is both interpolation and property
binding flows a data value in one
direction that is from a continents
class property to an HTML element
property both these examples does
exactly the same thing bind image part
property of the competent class to
source property of the image element
have seen both these examples in action
chest now so the obvious question that
comes to our mind at this point is
what's the difference between
interpolation and property binding and
when to use one over the other
keep in mind interpolation is a special
syntax that angular automatically
converts into a property binding
interpolation is just a convenient
alternative to property binding now
let's look at an example where we must
use interpolation instead of property
binding at the moment the entire path
for prism tech logo is within this image
part property and what we want to do is
within this image part property we want
to include just this part images for
slash logo DVD the domain name that is
present at com we want to hard-code that
within the source property of the image
element so within our image path
property we will have just this part of
the path and within the source property
we want to hard-code
the domain name regime techcom for slash
and to that we want to append whatever
we have in this property image path so
angular in this case is going to
retrieve the value we have in this
property which is images for slash logo
dot jpg and then append that to the
domain part that we have here presume
techcom which gives us the full URL for
the presume tag logo and if we have to
do something like this we will have to
use interpolation instead of property
binding since we are using interpolation
here we don't have to include our
property name in a pair of square
brackets so let's remove both of them
save all changes and reload of web page
notice we see the image exactly the same
way as before and here we have that
example which we have just seen in
action now let's look at an example
where we must use property binding
instead of interpolation to set an
element property to a non string data
value we must use property binding let's
understand this with an example within
our view template let's include at
button element and we want to bind
disabled property of this button element
so within our component class let's
include a property let's call it is
disabled and this is going to be of type
boolean and for now let's include a
default value of true and we're going to
use property binding to bind this
property to disabled property of our
HTML element
let's close the button on the button
let's include this text click me
let's save our changes now since we have
said is disabled property to true we
expect the button to be disabled when we
reload this page notice on the page we
have the button and at the moment it is
disabled now let's change the value of
this boolean property to false and
reload our webpage now we expect the
button not to be disabled so the button
is now enabled and we can click on it
now let's see what's going to happen if
we use interpolation instead of property
binding now when we use interpolation we
don't need to include the property name
within a pair of square brackets but the
component class property has to be
within double curly braces and at the
moment disabled is disabled property
value is true so we expect the button to
be disabled let's see what changes
freeload of web page notice the button
is disabled as expected now let's change
this value to false in this case we
expect the button to be enabled let's
reload of a web page one more time
notice the button is still disabled so
irrespective of the value that we have
caught in this property the button
element is always disabled so it's not
working as expected so keep in mind
anytime you want to set an element
property to a non string data value we
must use property binding instead of
interpolation
now let's discuss some of the important
points to keep in mind when using
property binding with property binding
we must always remember to enclose the
property name within a pair of square
brackets like this now the obvious
question that comes to mind is what
happens if we don't include the brackets
let's look at that in action let's flip
to visual studio within this page header
property let's include this value
employee details and now let's bind that
page had a property to span elements in
a HTML property and notice now at the
moment I'm not using square brackets and
within quotes let's specify our property
which is page header and then let's
close the span element let's save all
changes and let's reload this webpage
notice we don't see anything on a
webpage let's launch browser developer
tools by pressing f12 and see what's
happening so on the elements tab we have
over directive my app and if we scroll
down here notice it has set inner HTML
to page header and if you look at what
page header is that's the name of our
property because we have not included
square brackets now angular is treating
this as a constant value and assigning
that value to inner HTML property of the
span element and that's not what we
expect we expect the value within that
property page header to be binded to
inner HTML property of the span element
now let's see what's going to happen if
we include the property name within a
pair of square brackets like that let's
reload our web page and see what happens
now when we scroll down on the page
notice we see employee details as
expected and when we look at the
rendered HTML here notice within the
span element we have employee details as
expected with property binding we can
also use its canonical variation so far
with property binding we have been using
a pair of square brackets like this if
you're not a great fan of using square
brackets you can also use its canonical
variation with its canonical variation
we use this syntax bind - and the name
of the property - which we want to bind
so in this case we want to bind to inner
HTML property of the span element let's
save our changes and reload this web
page notice we see employee details
exactly the same way as before so with
property binding you can use either a
pair of square brackets or its canonical
variation bind - and then the name of
the property to which you want to
find here is another example for
canonical variation from security
standpoint
Anglet data-binding automatically
sanitizers the malicious content before
displaying it on the browser let's
understand this with an example
but in our component class let's include
a property let's call this bad HTML and
the data type is string notice within
the string you have this malicious
script tag now let's see how
interpolation is going to deal with this
script tag so within our view template
let's include a development and let's
bind this development with this property
bad HTML first let's do that using
interpolation let's see what changes and
reload this web page notice the
malicious content is sanitized and it is
rendered on the browser harmlessly now
let's see how probably binding is going
to deal with this so instead of using
interpolation let's use property binding
let's bind inner HTML property of the
element with this class property bad
HTML let's save our changes and reload
this web page one more time
notice the content is sanitized slightly
differently but the important point to
keep in mind is both the techniques
interpolation and property binding
automatically sanitizes the malicious
content before rendering it on the
browser harmlessly thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
