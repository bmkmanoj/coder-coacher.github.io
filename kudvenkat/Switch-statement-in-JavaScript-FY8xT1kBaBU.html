in this video we'll discuss which
statement in JavaScript this is
continuation to path 13 so please watch
part 13 before proceeding when should we
use switch statement if you'll be the
example here notice that we have
multiple if else if statements this is
the same example that we worked with in
the previous video session let's flip to
visual studio I have that exact same
code here so what are we doing we are
prompting the user to enter a number we
read that and convert that to a number
and then we store that number in this
variable user input and then we are
checking if user input is equal to 1 if
this condition is true then execute this
piece of code else if this condition is
true then execute this piece of code so
on and so forth now the readability of
this program can be improved by
replacing these if else if statements
with a switch statement so let's see how
to do that we use the switch statement
we use the switch keyword and we are
going to switch on this variable so we
pass that to the switch statement so
here we are actually switching based on
the value that is present in this
variable and the value that is present
in this variable is a number so we use
the case keyword and if that number is 1
so case 1 so if the number is 1 then
what you want to do so the piece of code
that you want to execute when the number
is 1 that goes you know after that case
statement so all we want to do is alert
a message saying number is 1 now that's
all we want to do so as soon as we
finish doing that we want to break out
of this switch statement so we use the
break keyword for that so as soon as
this break keyword is encountered
you know the control will immediately
jump out of the switch statement now if
you know this piece of code will be
executed if it is number 1 on the other
hand we want this piece of code to be
executed if the entered number is 2 in
which case the alert message should be
number is 2
and then if it is number three then the
alert message should be number is three
now if the number is not one two and
three then we want to print a message
saying number is not between one and
three that's when we use the default
case so if the entered number does not
match any of these cases then it will
automatically fall to the default case
so this is similar to the last else
block that we have in you know in the
previous program where we had multiple
if else if statements and then finally
we had the else block here which will be
executed if none of these conditions are
true in a similar fashion in the switch
statement if none of these conditions
are true then it's going to fall to the
default case and in that when it falls
to the default case we want to alert the
message saying the number is not between
one and three and then we want to break
out of the switch statement so we use
the break keyword so let's run this and
see if it works the same way as it did
before so we enter number two click OK
so number is two let's reload this
program let's enter number five which is
not between one and three and we should
get the message number is not between
one and three so the program behaves
exactly the same way but this is much
more readable than having multiple if
else if statements in general we need to
have a break statement after each case
statement to ensure that the program
breaks out of the switch statement after
executing the statements belonging to a
specific case what happens if there is
no break in a switch statement if there
is no break statement the execution will
fall automatically to the next case
until a break statement is encountered
or end of the program has reached let's
look at an example here we have an
example notice that of the case one we
don't have the break statement
immediately after that alert statement
we have case two and then again we have
an alert statement and then after case
two we have the break statement so now
when we run this
program and if we enter number one you
know this case will be true so it will
execute this line of code and then since
there is no break statement there it is
going to automatically fall to the next
case and it's going to execute this
piece of code as well so when we enter
number one it first displays this alert
your number is one and then once you
click Okay on that it's going to display
again another alert saying your number
is two and then after that we have the
break statement so at that point it is
going to break out of the switch
statement now what is going to happen if
we don't have a break statement here
also then it is going to fall
automatically to case three and then
execute this alert again and if we don't
have break statement within the entire
switch statement then if we run this
program and enter number one you get
four alerts and then it reaches you know
the closing brace that's when it's going
to break out of the switch statement
so in general we need to have break
statement after each case statement to
ensure that the program breaks out of
the switch statement after executing
these statements belonging to that
specific case let's look at this example
in action so let's get rid of this break
statement and then let's run this
program so now we don't have the break
statement after case one so if we enter
number one and click OK notice that
first we get this alert number is 1 and
then once I click OK on that it is going
to execute the code belonging to case 2
and that's the reason we get this alert
number is 2 and after that we have the
break statement so once I click OK at
that point it is going to break out of
this switch statement and after that we
don't have any piece of JavaScript so
the program terminates when would you
combine multiple case statements
together if you want the same piece of
code to be executed so multiple cases
you can combine them together case
statement with no code in between
creates a single case for multiple
values a case without any code will
automatically fall through to the next
case so notice in this example between
case one and case two we don't have any
code and between case 2 and case 3 also
there is no code
so now when we run this program and
enter number one it is going to
automatically fall to case two and then
it will fall to K is three and then
execute the code that belongs to K is 3
and then we have a break statement there
so that's when it's going to break out
of the switch statement now we want this
piece of code to be executed when you
know it is case 1 2 or 3 so that's the
reason why we are combining all these
cases together so what are we doing here
when we run the program is going to
prompt us to enter the number let's say
for example we enter number 1 so it
comes here and then it executes this
piece of code your number is whatever is
present in the user input and that
variable is going to contain value 1 so
we get the output that we expect so
let's look at this in action now so I'm
going to get rid of this line from here
so now at the moment there is no code
between case 1 and case 2 there is no
break statement as well so it's
automatically going to fall from case 1
to case 2 when you enter number 1 and
let's get rid of this code as well and
now let's run this program so let's
enter number 1 so what it is going to do
is it will fall automatically to K is 3
and execute the code that is there and
look at this it says number is 3 that's
not what we expected we want it to say
number is 1 that's basically because we
have hard-coded that value so
irrespective of whether you enter 1 2 or
3 this piece of code will be executed
that's because we're combining these
cases together so to make this program a
little more meaningful let's get rid of
this hard-coded value from here and then
print the value that is present in this
variable so I am going to take that
variable and copy it right there so when
you enter 1 you know it says number is 1
and even to 2 it's going to say it's 2
and when it is 3 it's going to 3 so this
is going to produce the output that V
expect so now when we enter number 2
click OK so number is 2
so you combine multiple cases together
when you want the same piece of code to
be executed for those multiple cases
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
