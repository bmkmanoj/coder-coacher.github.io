technologies
my name is lavash and this is part three
of the design patterns tutorial in this
session we will do a quick recap of
singlet inversion which we have
discussed in the previous session and we
will focus on why we use TD keyword and
why we need to see in the singleton
class please refer to part 1 and part 2
of this tutorial before proceeding let's
switch to visual studio and bring up the
example that we have discussed in the
last session if you recap our previous
session we have discussed why we need to
create a singleton class and how we can
apply singleton design patterns to this
class we have changed the class to
restrict external instantiation by
changing the public constructor to
private and then we provided a public
property to access this class and named
it as get instance we have proved that
adding private constructor we will
prevent us instantiating this class
outside this class we have further
sealed down this class to avoid any
inheritance you might be wondering why
we need to see in the class when a
private constructor is present let us
first remove the sealed keyword just to
prove that why we are using the sealed
keyword in this class let's create
another class of like class desired and
we're done let's inherit this class from
singleton at this moment we are not
creating any methods or property inside
this derived class let's just compile
this class and look at that
error dialogue it has shown an error
saying it's the single turn is
inaccessible due to its protection level
the error is not because of removing the
scene class are all adding the field
property it's just because of the
private constructor now you might be
thinking that when a private constructor
is restricting the inheritance then why
do we need to apply seal keyword to the
class let's do one thing let's just move
this class inside the singleton class by
moving this guys inside the singleton
gas it has now become nested or change
class of the main singleton class what
is a nested class a class within another
class is called a nested class at this
moment we will skip any further
discussions related to nest a class as
it is out of scope for this tutorial
however for more details please refer to
MSD an article about nested classes and
types now that we have moved the derived
class to the nested class let's just
compile the program and check look at
that we are able to compile this
successfully now let's switch to the
main program and see how we can access
the nested class that we have created
say singleton dodged look at that we are
able to see Drive sing it in along with
that get instance let's create right obj
equal to new sing it and let's say grad
obj dot look at that we are able to see
the print details method now let's just
invoke this method by passing some
string param from derived let's just
separate this using a console dot write
line and add a separate
let's compile this program look at that
compliation succeeded let's run the
program look at the output the counter
value has increased to two proving that
we are able to create multiple
canister derived class this violates the
principles of single term design pattern
let's close this output let's go back to
the singleton class if you observe the
derive singleton class is responsible
for creating the private constructor or
rather invoking the private constructor
which internally has incremented the
counter value further this has violated
the principle of singleton pattern and
created multiple objects now that we
have proved that a nested class can
create multiple objects of singleton
instance let's just put back the field
keyword now let's compile this program
look at that it says we cannot drive
from sealed type singleton that means
the seal keyword is preventing any
inheritance even in the nested classes
let's remove this master class let's go
back to the main program and remove this
design singleton class instantiation as
well let's just compile this program
look at that the compilation succeeded
with this we have proved that private
constructor helps in preventing any
external instantiation of objects and
seed will will prevent the class
inheritance in the next session we will
discuss how to handle thread safety in
singleton as the current version can
create multiple instances in
multi-threaded environments thank you
for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
