this video we'll discuss customizing the
auto-generated index view please watch
part 25 before proceeding with this
video from part 25 if you recollect this
index view is auto-generated I want to
make a few customizations to this index
view first of all I want to change the
font to area and set a border to this
table let's quickly make those two
changes let's flip to visual studio
let's get to index view and then to
change the default style I'm going to
use a div tag and set the style
attribute and specify font family as
area
okay so this should change the font
family and then we also want to set the
table border so here is the table tag
let's use the border attribute and set
that to one so these two changes let's
run this so there we go we have you know
Arial font and then we have a border for
the table now look at the column names
here here on this view we are displaying
employee name gender City and department
name but look at the column headers you
know for the employee name it's using
name and for department name also it's
using name now instead of name as the
header for Department column I actually
want to change to department name first
of all let's understand how these column
headers are generated so let's flip to
visual studio so this is the index view
and look at this this is a piece of code
that's rendering the column names for
example if you look at you know the
employee column header its name for the
first column so here we are saying model
dot name so what is the model object for
this view so if we look at that it's
actually employee object now if you
remember we have not written this
employee class this employee class is
auto-generated for us from this table
TBL employee and if you look at the
column names here you know we have
column names this employee ID name
gender City and department ID but then
if you look at the column names here you
know the exact column names are
appearing on the view as well okay so
basically this employee class is
auto-generated the column names on the
table are used as properties of this
class so let's right-click on this
employee class and select go to
definition so this class definition is
actually in this employee data model
designer dot CS and where is that file
present look at this the file is right
here so this is auto-generated okay so
if you navigate up the file look at this
it's auto-generated for us and we have
the employee class there and you can
notice all the properties within that
employee class
so that's the employee class right here
and then we have you know several
properties in this employee class
employee ID name and then gender we have
all the properties and notice the
property names they match the column
names and then this class has also got
department property look at how the
department name is generated so if we go
back to index view the department column
name you give us this model object which
is nothing but the employee object it
has got a department property which is
going to return a department object and
that department object has got name
property okay so with an employee class
we should have department property so do
we have that department property within
that employee class let's find that out
so we have gender there and then we have
city and then look at this we have a
section called navigation properties
within the employee class and then there
we have the department property which is
returning a department object so again
you know in this file we also have a
department class if I right click on
that and go to definition so I have a
department class here which should
contain properties for ID and name so if
you look at the department table it has
got two columns ID and name so those two
columns will be created as properties
within that department class so here is
the ID property and then if we scroll
down they should be named property as
well okay so since we have the column
names with an employee and department as
name you know for both employee name and
Department name within the
auto-generated class also the properties
are generated as names and that's what
is being used on this index view okay so
obviously now there are several ways we
can fix this you can change the column
name and regenerator you know the
classes the employee and department
classes let's say I don't want to do
that okay the other way is to actually
customize the employee class now can I
apply customizations to this file in
novi can't why because this file is
auto-generated
so if we do any customizations to this
file if this class is auto-generated in
the future it's going to lose all those
changes that's why we have to do you
know our customizations in a separate
file and if you look at the way these
two classes are implemented that is the
employee and department class look at
that they are implemented as partial
classes so we can create another partial
department class and apply our
customizations there so to this models
folder I'm going to add a class file and
name that department dot CS and then
this class is going to contain all the
customizations okay and to speed things
up I have this already typed so let me
copy and paste this right here and then
this metadata type attribute is present
in a different namespace system dot
component model dot data annotations
namespace ok so what are we doing here
look at this we are creating the
department class and notice that we have
decorated that partial attribute so this
is another piece of department class so
now this class is decorated with
metadata type attribute and we are
saying type of Department metadata so
where is this class present right here
so I have created you know department
metadata which is going to contain all
the customizations so here look at the
property within this department metadata
I have the property name as name ok
which is exactly the same property
within in this auto-generated class so
if you look at this department loss in
this auto-generated file we have this
name property okay so that's the
property name the return type string and
that's what you know look at the
signature it's exactly the same thing
but then here I am using this display
attribute and setting the name
specifically to department name ok so
we're going to apply this customization
to you know the department class so now
instead of using name you know as the
proper column name it's going to use
department name so let's compile the
solution and run our project and see if
the department name is actually changed
so look at that we get the column header
as department name similarly if you want
to change this to employee name you can
apply the same customization to another
employee partial class on this slide you
can find resources for is p.net c-sharp
and sequence of interview questions
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
