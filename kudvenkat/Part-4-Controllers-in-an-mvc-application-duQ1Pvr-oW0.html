am venket this is part 4 of asp.net MVC
tutorial in this video we'll discuss
more about controllers in an MVC
application please watch part 3 before
proceeding with this video because we'll
be continuing with the example that we
started in part 3 now if you notice this
URL right here this URL invokes the
index action method within the home
controller class so how are these URLs
mapped to the correct controller action
methods how does the application know to
do that
the answer is asp.net routing let's
practically understand this let's flip
to visual studio now let me actually run
this project we started this in part
three of this video series and notice
you know the URL at the moment it
doesn't even have the name of the
controller and the action method all we
have is the server which is localhost
and then the name of the virtual
directory which is MVC demo I don't have
the controller name and the action
method name but still the application
successfully invoked the index function
within the home controller class so does
so how does the application know to do
that if you look at global dot is ax
notice that we have this even handler
method here application underscore start
this event gets executed when the
application first starts okay so we
discussed about you know events within
global dot asex in or asp.net video
tutorial so if you're new to them please
watch that video okay so within this
event we have a call to register routes
method that's present in route config
class and if you look at this folder
here app and let's go start it has got
this class route config if I actually
right click on that register routes and
then go to definition look at that it
comes to route config class which is
defined within our you know this file
route config dot CS which is present in
a pandas for start folder and within
this class we have this register routes
method pay attention to this line right
here so here I look at the name it says
default meaning this is the default
route and look at the URL pattern right
here okay so we have a controller
forward slash action /id
okay but then if you look at the URL
right here it doesn't have the
controller name and the action method
name so how is it invoking the index
function of the home controller class
that's because we have defaults
specified within this default route so
if I don't pass in a controller name
then it's going to invoke the home
controller by default and then if I
don't specify an action method it's
going to invoke the index function low
so look at this here at the moment we
didn't specify the controller name and
the action method name so by default
it's going to use the home controller
and the index action method so look at
this I am now passing just the
controller name and then when I press
Enter look at that it's going to pick up
the default index function within that
home controller class so now if I pass
index then it clearly knows what
function to execute okay now look at
this if I don't pass anything and then
when I press ENTER obviously it works
because we have default specified here
now what is going to happen if I rename
this index function to index one and
then if I run this application what do
you think will happen obviously we will
get a 404 because if you don't define a
controller name it's going to assume
home controller so obviously we have
home controller and then within that
home controller it's going to look for
index function but my home controller
doesn't have an index function so
obviously I get an HTTP 404 status code
meaning the resource cannot be found
okay now let's change it back to index
now obviously the default route right
here is the controller action method and
the ID at the moment if you look at this
URL let's actually pass the home and
index as well okay let's read on that
after we change the name here we dint
compile it so let's run that and then
let's specify our controller as home and
the index action method now look at this
I am NOT passing an ID parameter but
still my application works because if
you look here
you know the route config lasya ID
parameter is optional you may or may not
pass it now let's say I am passing an ID
value of maybe 10 for example and then
plus enter
you know I passed in in the URL this
value of 10 for ID parameter okay but
then let's say I want to retrieve that
within this function and do something
with that okay is it possible absolutely
hard and how do we do that it's very
simple to harvest those values all you
need to do is maybe I'm going to say
string ID okay and then let's say I want
to display a message here ID is equal to
whatever is the ID that we are going to
pass in okay so now let's run this
so since at the moment we don't have
anything past here default and ID is
optional so it just displays an empty
string there and then obviously it is
executing the home controller's index
method there so home index and I'm going
to specify a value of 10 and then when I
press enter look at that ID is equal to
10 so that value is automatically passed
into this controller action method and
then you can do whatever you want with
that value and here basically we are
returning back ok all right so if it's
one value that's fine let's say for
example I want to pass something in the
URL like this a query string maybe I
want to pass maybe name is equal to you
know play gene and then obviously I want
to be in a position to retrieve that
value ok from the URL and how do we do
that
ok with web forms it's very easy I mean
we basically use request or query string
request objects query string property so
I can simply say you know there are two
ways to do that I can use the very old
method of using the request objects or
request dot query string off we can pass
in the name of the query string there so
I get the quit you know
the value that's passed in the URL here
for name which is present regime
okay let's actually format the string
right here so ID is equal to ID plus
name is equal to whatever we are you
know retrieving from the URL so let's
run this now and then let's pass in our
home controller index function and name
is equal to let's say protein look at
that ID is equal to ten name is equal to
prison so I am able to retrieve that
values okay so one way is to actually
use the request objects but in MVC
another way that you have is you can
simply use it as a parameter within this
function so string you know name
notice that this parameter name matches
with the name of the querystring
parameter here okay so now simply I can
say instead of using this request
objects query string name alright so now
let's go ahead and run that and see
what's going to happen okay so let's
power invoke the home controllers index
action method and then we are passing 10
for ID name is equal to presume look at
that ID is equal to 10 name is equal to
presume we get it as expected so asp.net
MVC will automatically pass any query
string of form post parameters name the
name to index action method when this
URL that you see here is invoked okay so
that's how we are printing those values
are you can use request or query string
request objects query string property as
here as shown here okay and if you look
at this register routes function within
this load config class this one more
class here okay so it is roads dot
ignore route and then it says anything
any name here which is it could be
anything
dot ax stays so if there is a file
request for which has an extension of
dot ax day then ignore that that's what
it's saying what does it actually mean
let's understand that
you know basically for example if we
enable tracing for this application okay
again we discussed about tracing in
asp.net so asp.net concepts are still
applicable for MVC okay so please watch
videos on asp.net racing from asp.net
video tutorial if you are new to that
concept so I'm going to enable tracing
within web config file so under system
dot web I can enable tracing so trace
enabled is equal to true and then I
don't want the trace messages to be
returned to the end of the page so I'm
going to say page output is equal to
false so when we said page output to
false and then trace enabled is equal to
true the trace messages will be returned
to a trace file called trace dot ax day
so let me actually go ahead and run so
that you know a trace messages are
generated for few of these web forms so
let's invoke the home controller index
function ok all right so now look at
this obviously there will be a trace
file for this application and now if I
want to you know see the trace
information I can simply say trace dot a
X day and then when I press ENTER I get
the trace file and I can see the trace
information you know for these requests
which is well and good ok so now look at
this the request for this file is
ignored you know it's not basically
passed to this default route okay I am
served with that rule I mean with that
file now what's going to happen if I
comment this and let's comment that and
let's rerun this application and then
let me try to request the traced or dxd
file and see what's going to happen ok
so I'm going to request something like
trace dot exe look at that it says the
resource cannot be found okay
that's why we need to have this line
right here to handle request for a XD
files you know something like trees Tata
XE or ax T or script resources dot ax
day all right
this slide you can find resources face
be dotnet C sharp and sequence of
interview questions that's it for today
thank you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
