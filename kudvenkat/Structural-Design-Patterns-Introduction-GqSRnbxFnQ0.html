16 of the design patterns tutorial in
this session we will discuss
introduction to structural design
pattern and we'll see different types of
structural design patterns please refer
to the previous parts of the tutorial
before proceeding in the previous
session we have discussed and understood
the creational design patterns in
details we have also learned which
design pattern need to be applied based
on the project requirements if you are
not gone through them we strongly
recommend you to refer to the previous
parts of the tutorial before proceeding
further let's now take a look at the
structural design patterns structural
design patterns are design patterns that
ease their design by identifying a
simple way to realize relationships
between entities from this definition we
can say that structural patterns define
how each component or entity should be
constructed so as to have very flexible
interconnecting modules which can work
together in a larger system a structural
design pattern also describes how data
moves through the pattern structural
patterns describe how classes and
objects can be combined to form larger
structures these patterns describe how
objects can be composed into larger
structures using object composition or
the inclusion of objects within other
objects Ganga 4 has identified seven
structural design patterns which are
adapter bridge composite decorator
facade flyweight and proxy patterns
let's now look into the definition of
these patterns as per the Gang of Four
definition adapter match interface of
different classes to simplify this
definition we can state that an adapter
allows two incompatible interfaces to
work together which means the adapter
design pattern
Loes incompatible classes to interact
with each other by converting the
interface of one class into an interface
which is expected by the end clients
love raging on adapter improves
reusability of older functionality we
will discuss this in detail in next
coming sessions let's now focus on
bridge pattern as per Gang of Four
definition bridge pattern separates an
object's interface from its
implementation to simplify this
definition the bridge pattern uses
encapsulation aggregation and can use
inheritance to separate responsibilities
into different classes
bridge pattern decouples an abstraction
from its implementation so that
decoupling and abstraction can vary
independently the bridge pattern can
also be thought of as two layers of
abstraction the bridge pattern is useful
when we want to avoid a permanent
binding between an abstraction and its
implementation rich pattern enables us
to separate the interface from the
implementation and improves
extensibility also it hides
implementation details from clients
let's now look into the composite
pattern as per Gang of Four definition
composite design pattern constitutes a
tree structure of simple and composite
objects in object-oriented programming a
composite is an object designed as a
composition of one or more similar
objects all exhibiting similar
functionality the composite pattern
enables us to create hierarchical tree
structures of varying complexity while
allowing every element in the structure
to operate with a uniform interface the
composite design pattern describes that
a group of objects are to be treated in
a same way as a single instance of the
object the intent of a composite is to
compose objects into tree structures to
represent part-whole hierarchy
implementing the composite pattern let's
client rate individual objects and
compositions uniformly if this is
confusing at this point of time don't
worry we will take a look at this
integrator details with simple examples
in the coming sessions let's now switch
to decorator pattern as per Gang of Four
definition the decorator pattern adds
responsibilities to objects dynamically
to simplify this we can state that the
decorator pattern enables us to add or
remove object functionality without
changing the external appearance or
function of the object which means the
decorator pattern attaches additional
responsibilities to an object
dynamically to provide a flexible
alternative to changing object
functionality without using static
inheritance let's now switch to facade
pattern as per Gang of Four definition
in facade design pattern we have a
single class that represents an entire
subsystem which means the facade pattern
provides a unified interface to group of
interfaces in a subsystem the facade
pattern defines a high level interface
that makes the subsystem easier to use
with only one single interface this
unified interface enables an object to
access the subsystem using the interface
to communicate with the subsystem facade
design pattern reduces coupling between
subsystem provided if every subsystem
uses its own facade pattern and other
parts of the system use the facade
pattern to communicate with the
subsystem let's now focus on the
flyweight design pattern as per Gang of
Four definition flyweight is a
fine-grained
instance used for efficient sharing
which means the flyweight pattern
reduces the number of low-level detailed
objects within a system by sharing
objects the flyweight
pattern defines a structure for sharing
objects and focuses its capabilities for
space efficiencies applications that use
lot of objects must pay careful
attention to the cost of each object
substantial savings can be achieved by
sharing objects instead of replicating
them leveraging on flyweight pattern
reduces in number of objects to handle
we need to use flyweight pattern when
the application uses a large number of
objects and the storage costs are high
because of the quantity of objects and
when the application does not depend on
object identity let's now focus on proxy
design pattern as per nganga for
definition in proxy design pattern we
have an object representing another
object the proxy design pattern provides
a placeholder object to control access
to the original object we should use the
proxy design pattern when we need a more
versatile or sophisticated reference to
an object than a simple pointer remote
proxy and virtual proxy are some of the
implementations of the proxy design
patterns with virtual proxy being the
most common used implementation a remote
proxy can hide the fact that an object
resides in a different address space a
virtual proxy can perform optimizations
such as creating an object on demand in
the next session we will discuss each of
these structural design patterns in
detail with simple examples thank you
for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
