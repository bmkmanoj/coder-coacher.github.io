in this video we will discuss creating a
new employee using the create employee
form this is continuation to part 30 so
please watch part 30 before proceeding
and here's what we want to do using our
create employee form we want to provide
the information of the new employee that
we want to create and once we click the
Save button we want to add this new
employee to the list of employees that
we have and then redirect the user to
this list page where we can see that
newly added employee in the moment we
are on the list route and as you can see
we've got three employee objects here
and if you recollect from a previous
video these three employee objects are
coming from our employee service notice
within this employee service we've got
this private field list employees which
has got those three employee objects in
addition to this private field we also
have this get employees method and this
method returns that list of employees
and then our list employees component is
calling that method and that's how we
see the list of employees right here now
when we add a new employee using this
create employee form we want to add that
employee to this private field within
our employee service so for that let's
go ahead and create a save method and
this method is going to receive that new
employee object that we want to add and
obviously the type of this object is
going to be employee now all we want
this method to do is push this employee
object into this private array that we
have
so this push method pushes the employee
object to the array at the moment all
our employees data is within this
employee service this means when we
refresh the browser we are going to lose
the new employees that we have added in
our upcoming videos in the series we
will discuss persisting this employee's
data to a database table now when we
click the Save button on our create
employee form we want to call the save
method in our employee service so let's
open our create employee component and
then import our employee service in
addition to this employee service we
also need angular's router service
remember after we saved the new employee
we don't want to be on this create route
we want to redirect the user to the less
drought so we can see that newly added
employee so to redirect the user to the
list route we are going to make use of
the router service navigate method so
let's import angular router service from
the angular router package next let's
inject both these services employee
service and anglers router service into
this create employee component using its
constructor the constructor is right
here so let's create a private field for
our service I'm going to name it
underscore employee service the type of
this is employee service now let's
create a private field for the angular's
router service I'm going to name it
underscore router and the type of this
is router finally let's modify the save
employee method within our component so
they save employee method is right here
now there is no need to pass the new
employee object that we want to save as
a parameter to this save employee method
that's because the model for this create
employee component is this employee
object and notice at the moment all the
properties are initialized to null so
whenever we type the values within these
form fields angular's two-way
data-binding
is going to keep the values that we type
within the form fields
and the values in these properties in
sync so we already have the employee
object that we want to save available
within our component class so there is
no need to pass that object as a
parameter to the same employee method
from the view template so let's go ahead
and delete this parameter this method is
already bound to ng submit event within
our view template so when we submit the
form we are calling the save employee
method and passing it the employee
object if you want to save now there's
no need to pass this employee object
because it's already available within
our component class so let's remove that
so all that is left to do is save the
new employee and redirect the user to
the list route to save the new employee
we are going to make use of the employee
service that we have injected and on
this service let's call the save method
and to that let's pass the employee
model object that we want to save and
then let's use the injected router
service and then use its navigate method
to navigate to the list route so that
route that we want to navigate is list
let's save all these changes and then
take a quick look at the browser now
let's provide the details of the new
employee that we want to save
and then click the Save button notice
how our new employee is saved and we are
redirected and we see our new employee
Robert right here now if you take a
close look at this data there is a small
inconsistency here notice the Department
of this new employee that we just added
we are showing the department ID and
look at the existing employees we are
showing the department name the reason
we have this inconsistency is because
for the existing employees within the
department property we are storing the
department name and for the new employee
we are storing the department ID now
let's go ahead and fix this existing
data our existing employees data is in
the employee service in this private
field at lists employees notice at the
moment we have the department name
instead of the department name let's
include department ID to get the
department ID let's look at the
department object within our create
employee component so here we have the
department names and department IDs
notice for HR it is - and for ID it is
three so let's change the department
property in each of the objects
notice now we only see over three
existing employees what happened to the
new employee that we have just added
well that's because at the moment we are
not storing this employee's data to a
database table
we are only storing it in memory in our
employee service so this means when the
application restarts all our new
employees will be lost now if you're
wondering why did our application
restart
well that's because when we made the
department changes within our employee
service and when we saved those changes
since our application server is running
in watch mode it automatically restarted
and as a result they lost the new
employee that we just added in our
upcoming videos in this series we will
discuss saving this employee's data to a
database table when saving data storing
department ID is fine but when we
display the data to the end user
this department ID does not make any
sense to him so we should actually be
displaying the department name instead
of department ID we're discuss how to
fix this in our next video that's it in
this video thank you for watching and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
