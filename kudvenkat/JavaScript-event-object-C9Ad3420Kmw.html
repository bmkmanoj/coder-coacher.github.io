in this video we'll discuss JavaScript
event object and its properties in
JavaScript we've got several events
click mouse over Mouse out etc when
these events occur the relevant data
about the event is placed into the event
object for example the event object
contains even data like the x and y
coordinates of the mouse pointer when
the event occurred the HTML element that
fired the event which mouse button is
clicked etc obtaining the event object
is straightforward now if you have an
event handler associated with the event
when that event occurs the handler
method is automatically called at that
point the event object is also passed to
that even handler method so we can use
that object properties to retrieve the
relevant information that's useful for
us let's look at an example let's say we
have a button on the web page now when
we click the button we want to retrieve
the name of the event which is click the
x and y coordinates of the mouse pointer
relative to the vendor and then the
element on which the click event
occurred in this case it's button and we
also want the element tag name for
button we use input tags so the tag name
is input so we want to capture all this
information about the click event so
let's see how to achieve that the first
thing we need to do is include the
button control input type equals button
value equals click me let's give it an
ID of BTN and now let's write a function
let's name it get event details now this
is going to be of a click event handler
method so on click of the button call
this function so when click event occurs
this function gets called and at that
point the event object is automatically
passed into this object
so this function is receiving event
object so inside this function we can
use the properties of this event object
to retrieve the information that's
useful for us now what we want to do is
display the event name x and
y-coordinates target type and target tag
name so let's create a variable here
let's call that event details and the
first thing that we want is the even
name so we have the event object type
property of the event object is going to
give us the event name and then let's up
in an HTML break so that the
x-coordinate of the most pointer will be
on a separate line x equals event dot
client x property is going to return as
the x-coordinate of the mouse pointer
relative to the vendor and then we want
the y-coordinate so let's include an
HTML break and then y equals event dot
client Y property should return as the
y-coordinate of the mouse pointer and
then we want the target type that is the
element type on which the event occurred
and to get that we are going to use the
target property of the event object so
basically the target property of the
event object returns the HTML element
which raised the event now we want the
type of that HTML element so I'm going
to use type property on the target
object which should return us button in
this case and then we also want the tag
name so target tag name equals event dot
target dot tag name property should give
us that so now this variable contains
all the even data that we need now let's
display this even data within a div
element so let's include it develop
let's give it an ID result dev so within
this div tag we want to display the even
data so within our function document dot
get element by ID we pass the ID of the
div tag which is result there dot in our
HTML equals whatever we have in this
even details variable so let's run this
now now look at this when we click the
button notice that the event name is
click x and y-coordinates of the mouse
pointer target type is button and target
tag name is input let's bring the target
tag name to a separate line and to do
that let's include this HTML break here
so when we reload this and click the
button we should have target tag name on
a separate line okay now let's also
retrieve mouse over and mouse out even
details and to do that we need to
associate an event handler for on mouse
over so on mouse over we want to call
the same function and similarly on Mouse
out we want to call the same function so
let's save the changes let's reload this
page and look at this as soon as I mouse
over we get the even name as mouse over
x and y-coordinates
you know the target type and target tag
name as soon as I mouse out look at that
the event name is mouse out when we
click the button so that's the the event
name is click event and look at this
depending on where I click the button
the x and y coordinates changes all
right
so this is the same example that we
discuss just now now this piece of code
will not work in ie8 and earlier
versions at the moment I'm using Google
Chrome browser so it works fine in
Google Chrome and all the other browsers
but as far as Internet Explorer is
concerned it's going to work in Internet
Explorer 9 and later versions let's
actually browse this page with Internet
Explorer at the moment on my machine
I have ie 11 installed so now look at
this when we click you know everything
works as expected but if we change the
browser mode to IE 8 so let's change the
mode to 8 and look at this when I mouse
over we get an error and what does it
say it says type you know unable to get
property type of undefined or null
reference so where are we using type we
are using type right here to get you
know the target element type now it says
unable to get property type of undefined
or null reference so basically here the
target property is not supported in ie8
and earlier versions now target property
is going to return us the element that
triggered the event okay so if we want
to retrieve the element that triggered
the event in ie8 and earlier versions
you will have to use a different
property of the event object that is SRC
element okay so let's write this code in
such a way that it's going to work in
all browsers including IE 8 and earlier
versions so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to do it check if this event
object that gets passed in if that
supports SRC element property so IE 8
has SRC element property on the event
object okay now with IE 9 and later
versions and all
the modern browsers in our SRC element
on the event object is going to retain
return undefined okay so if that returns
you know the source element then we are
going to actually create a variable here
let's name it source element that is the
element which triggered the event so
source element is going to be event dot
source element so this is going to work
for IE 8 but IE 9 and later versions and
all the other browsers they support
target property so source element is
going to be event dot target so now we
are going to use this source element
variable so take the source element
variable and then here we are going to
say source element dot type and source
element dot tag name so let's save these
changes let's go back to google chrome
first let's reload the page now look at
this it still works mouse over mouse out
click event everything works now let's
go back to Internet Explorer and at the
moment this is running in IE 11 so it
still works mouse over works mouse out
works click works ok now let's go to
developer tools change the browser mode
to IE 8 now look at this mouse over
works Mouse out works click works so now
here we have a cross-browser solution
now let's also retrieve mouse move even
data now let's get rid of all these
events
and include chest on mousemove save the
changes reload the webpage look at this
as we hover the mouse over the button
look at the X&amp;amp;Y coordinates they change
dynamically thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
