tutorial in this video we'll discuss
enabling client-side validation in
asp.net MVC asp.net MVC offers several
validation attributes
examples include string length attribute
range attribute regular expression
attribute etc all of these validation
attributes provide both client and
server-side validation in the previous
sessions of this video series we have
discussed using these attributes and
server-side validation in action in this
video we'll discuss enabling client-side
validation and there are two simple
steps to achieve that step one
enable client validation and unobtrusive
javascript and web config file well this
is what we mean by unobtrusive
javascript in a later video session for
now understand that both of these
options need to be turned on within web
config file and by default when we
create a new asp.net MVC for application
these options are already turned on for
us so let's flip to the MVC demo project
that we have been working with so within
the root directory of your project they
should be web config file and within
that look at this we have this app
settings element and we have these two
options here client the validation
enabled and unobtrusive javascript
enable both of them are turned on okay
so that's the first step the second step
is to reference these three jQuery files
so where am I going to get these jQuery
files from we can either download them
from jQuery website or if you create a
new Internet and new MVC application
using Internet application template then
you will get scripts folder and all the
jQuery scripts will be there okay so if
you're wondering how do we create an MVC
application using Internet application
that's very straightforward so here when
we actually go to file new project and
when we select asp.net MVC for
application once I click OK look at this
you have the option to select the
template now when we created this MVC
demo project we have selected a
empty template and that's the reason why
at the moment we don't have scripts
folder there but then when I created
this MVC application one I've chosen
Internet application template so I got
scripts folder as well so let me open
this in Windows Explorer copy all these
script files and then let's go back to
our MVC demo project let's add a folder
to this project and let's call this
scripts and let's paste a work script
files into that folder alright so we
need three script files okay jQuery
jQuery dot validate and jQuery dot
validate dot unobtrusive so on whichever
view we need to do client-side
validation we can reference them there
but in real time we actually reference
the script files within the master page
and the advantage of doing that is that
this avoids the need to reference them
on each and every view where we need
validation but at the moment we don't
have a master page here so I am directly
going to reference them within the Edit
view so let's navigate to the Edit view
but before we reference them look at
this at the moment you know 301 age you
know that's not a valid age look at that
I don't get any validation until I click
the Save button so when I click Save
that's when the form will be posted and
the validation is done on the server
side okay so let's enable client-side
validation and see how it's going to
work all right so let's reference the
required script file so the first one is
jQuery script file so let's drag and
drop it right there and we need a jQuery
validate file and we need jQuery
validate unobtrusive okay and let's use
the tilde four slash syntax so tilled
so basically the still character
indicates a root directory so from the
root directory navigate to scripts
folder and within them files are
required within that folder find the
required scripts all right let's save
everything and let's reload this view
so at this point the JavaScript files
should also be loaded and look at this
the moment I type three zero one and
then once I click away I get the
validation error message immediately
without me having to post back to the
server okay look at this name cannot
contain numbers the moment I enter and
number there and click away I get the
validation message immediately without a
round-trip to the server so obviously
this means the application is more
responsive you get better user
experience and this also improves the
performance of your application because
there are less round trips to the server
so the load on the server is going to be
reduced so just for getting a validation
error message like this there's no point
in posting back to the server okay so if
possible always perform client-side
validation and another important thing
to keep in mind is the order of these
scripts is also very important because
jQuery dot validator unobtrusive this
JavaScript is dependent on jQuery dot
validate and that's dependent on jQuery
so jQuery files you know basically they
need to be in this order if they are not
in this order then the client-side
validation doesn't work so if you want
to look at that in action look at this
if I move this unobtrusive as the first
file save that and let's actually reload
this and let's try three zero one
I click away look at that I don't get
any validation so the order in which you
have referenced the files is also
important all right another thing
actually let's put that back to the
right order and let's reload this few so
that the script files will be loaded and
then look at this this client-side
validation will not work if the end user
has disabled Java Script within the
browser so within the browser we can
disable JavaScript so at the moment
client-side validation is working but
then if I go ahead and disable
JavaScript run by
the way to disable JavaScript within
Google Chrome you click on the Settings
button and then within the search box
type JavaScript so click on content
settings and look at this there is an
option do not allow any side to run
JavaScript so once I select that I click
done so at this point javascript is
disabled in this plaza
so let's actually close this and fire up
another browser instance so we have
javascript disabled so now when I you
know type 3:01 as they age tab away and
look at this I don't get a validation so
the client validation doesn't work in
case at the end user disables JavaScript
but the server-side validation will
continue to work so when I click Save
the form will be posted and the
validation of the server will still be
performed all right that's it for today
thank you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
