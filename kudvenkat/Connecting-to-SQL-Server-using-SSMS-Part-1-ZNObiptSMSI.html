am venket this is part 1 of sequence
server in this session we'll understand
how to connect to sequel server using
sequence of a management studio
what is sequence of a management studio
and the different authentication methods
that can be used to connect a sequel
server now you need to have sequence of
a management studio already installed on
your machine if not there are several
articles on the web which can help us
how to do that so once you have signal
server management studio installed on
your machine to open that go to the
Start menu select all programs and
depending on the version of the sequel
server that you have installed you
should see a respective folder here for
example if you have installed sequel
server 2005 you should see a folder for
that here Microsoft sequence over 2005
on my machine
I have Microsoft signals over 2008 so I
see a folder for that expand that and
within that folder you should see sequel
server management studio now select that
once you select sequel Server management
studio you should see a connect to
server window coming up and this is the
place where we specify the information
that is required for sequel server
management studio to connect to a sequel
server database now sequel server
management studio and the sequel server
database are two different things
ok so a database server typically
contains all the tables and the data you
know any sequel server management
objects that you create for example it
could be trigger view tables data
related to those tables etc all of that
will be stored centrally on that
database server and to connect to that
database server the client tools that we
generally use a sequel server management
studio so keep in mind sequel server
management studio is just a client tool
to connect to the database server and it
is not the server by itself so in a
typical development environment the
database server might be installed on
one centralized machine and usually
developers can connect to that using a
sequel server management studio that's
installed on their respect to your
machine in this example you can see that
we have four developers and from each of
the developer machine we can use the
sequels
management studio specify the
information about this database cell for
example from that from this developer
machine one know if I have to connect to
the sequence of a database okay I need
to tell ok this is the server name and
user ID password and how do you want to
connect from this machine to this what
do you want to use Windows
authentication or sequel server
authentication ok the point to keep in
mind secret server management studio is
just a client tool and not the server by
itself and now we will see how to
configure sequel server management
studio to connect to a database server
so if we go back ok so this is the
window that we typically see when we
open up sequel server management studio
for the first time now the first choice
that we have to make is to specify the
server type usually it's the database
engine ok but if you are if you want to
connect to analysis services or
reporting services or integration
services which are also respectively
called as SS s SS RS and SS is SS is
means signal server integration services
SS Rs main sequence our reporting
services and SS es means analysis
services we don't want to connect to any
of them we just want to connect to the
database server so that's why we use the
database engine here ok in a later
module when we talk about sequel server
integration services and reporting
services we will see how to connect to
those you know databases using the
respective options here ok for now its
database engine and you also need to net
specify the server name now if you have
a environment like this in a way you
have a database server on a centralized
machine then you need to specify the
name or IP address of that server ok but
here on my machine
you know the database server and the
sequence of a management studio both are
installed on my machine the database
server is also present on my local
machine so if that's the case then I can
specify the IP address of my computer
itself you know the local IP address
which is 1 to serve
zero dot 0 dot 1 this is also called as
loopback IP address here from a
networking background so to refer to the
local machine I can use the loopback IP
address which is 127.0.0.1 or I can also
just say dot so dot specifies that I
want to connect to the local server or I
can specify local keyword here so any of
these will tell the secrets of a
management studio we want to find an
installation of sequel server database
on the local machine and not over the
network so you can either use local dot
or an IP address 127.0.0.1 so you can
use any of these ok so once we have the
server name specified then the important
decision that we have to make is how do
we want to connect to the database
server do we want to use Windows
authentication or sequel server
authentication now the options available
here for you to connect depends on how
you have configured the sequel server
during installation when we were
instantly when we were when we are
installing sequel server basically it
provides us with two options for
authenticating against that installation
of sequel server
you know thus two options are mixed-mode
authentication or sequel server
authentication so if you choose
mixed-mode authentication then it means
both of these options will be available
for you to connect to the sequel server
if you have gestures and sequences or
authentication then you cannot use
windows authentication so the options
available here for you to connect to the
sequel server are basically dependent on
how you have installed the sequel server
ok for now let's choose sequel server
authentication ok if you choose windows
authentication then you don't have to
provide any of the username or password
ok that's because I mean windows
authentication basically uses the
windows login that you have used to
login to this computer so you have
already authenticated yourself to log
into this computer so basically that
username and pass
the vendors username and password will
be used to validate you against this
database on the other hand you can also
use sequel server authentication so when
you use sequel server authentication
when you are installing sequel server
again you would have specified what is
the username and password that you want
to use to connect to this installation
of sequel server so you specify that
username and password
typically we specify that as s a system
administrator and a password for that ok
so we have to provide that username and
password so let's provide that username
and password and then I can click
connect so now when I click connect it
should connect to a and installation of
sequel server that's locally installed
on that machine and once that's done
look at this it's it it has connected to
the local sequel server on this machine
and then I can basically see all the
databases ok and the security related
stuff now this window on the left-hand
side is called the object Explorer
window ok where you can see the database
objects you can explore through those
database objects that's why it's
basically called as object Explorer now
if I have to write a query then I need a
space to do that and the first thing you
have to do is click on this new query
button at the top left hand corner that
should bring you up and you created a
window where basically we can type and
execute queries ok but again to type and
execute queries we need a database so
what's a database a database is a
collection of tables and all your
database objects ok we will see in the
next session how to create a database
and we will start writing queries ok now
so this is your object Explorer this is
your query editor window and if I just
hover my mouse over there it shows me I
am connected to the local machine and
then there you see something called dot
master that's nothing but the database
context that we are currently in so here
you can switch the database you know
against which you want to write a query
now you might be wondering how did I get
all these databases here for example
system databases if I expand that I have
master model M s DB tmdb
so what are these as the name suggests
these are system databases and how did
they get in here when I installed sequel
server they automatically got installed
and these are required for the
functionality of the sequel server ok
and we can also create user defined
databases you know by just right
clicking on that and selecting new
database which we'll be doing in the
next session ok basically this session
is all about how to connect to sequel
server and the point that we have to
keep in mind is that sequel server
management studio is not a server by
itself as many people get confused by
that it is just a client tool to connect
to the sequel server on this slide you
can find resources for asp.net and C
sharp interview questions that's it for
today thank you for listening have a
