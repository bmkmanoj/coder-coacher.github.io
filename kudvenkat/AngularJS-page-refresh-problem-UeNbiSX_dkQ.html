this video we'll discuss page refresh
issue that may arise when we refresh or
load the same web page again first let's
understand what this page refresh issue
is all about we will continue to work
with the same example that we worked
with in our previous video at the moment
we are on slash home so we see the home
page information let's navigate to slash
students where we can see the list of
student names now when I click on any
student name we can see that specific
student details at this point when we
refresh or reload this web page look at
what's going to happen let's reload this
web page by right-clicking on the web
page and then selecting reload notice we
have lost the student details and we
have also lost the styles of the web
page let's see what errors we are
getting to see the errors that we are
getting let's launch browser developer
tools to launch browser developer tools
I am going to click on the Settings
button and then select more tools and
developer tools this should launch
browser developer tools and look at the
number of error messages we are getting
back we are getting three error messages
and all three error messages say the
same thing uncalled syntax error
unexpected token angular bracket these
error messages does not provide any
useful information at this point I'm
going to reload this webpage by simply
clicking in the address bar and then
pressing enter notice we get a different
message here resource interpreted s
style sheet but transferred with mine
type text slash HTML and this message is
referencing this style sheet styles dot
CSS so basically this is telling this
time sheet styles dot CSS is transferred
with mime type text slash HTML maybe
that's the reason why we are losing
styles on our layout page to fix this
issue all we have to do is move this
base href tag from the bottom to
to below title tag within the head
section of our index dot HTML page this
should fix that issue so let's save our
changes and let's go back to home page
and what I'm going to do is close
developer tools and then press ctrl R
and at this point let's navigate to
slash students we can say list of
students and then I'm going to click on
one of the student names you can see
student details and at this point look
at this when I select reload we don't
have that problem anymore or when I
click in the address bar you know and
reload the webpage again we don't have
that problem
let's also plus control R and control f5
so with any of these we don't have any
hu now either with page refresh or page
load the page is still continue to work
as we expect it to work thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
