this video we'll discuss how to create
an image carousel using the bootstrap
carousel plug-in here is the image
carousel that we want to create for the
purpose of this demo we are going to
make use of these four images that come
with a Windows operating system first
let's create a development let's give it
an ID let's call this image carousel and
on this development I'm going to use
carousel class which is going to create
a carousel when the carousel moves from
one slide to another slide we want
sliding animation effect so to get that
sliding animation effect I'm going to
use slide class along with the carousel
class and the time interval between each
slide transition should be two seconds
so I'm going to specify that using data
- interval attribute and the value for
this is in milliseconds since we want
two seconds as the interval I'm going to
specify two thousand this had to be
desorption 'l if we don't specify that
it's going to use its default which is
five seconds inside this development i'm
going to create another development with
class carousel inner so this development
is going to act as the container for all
our slides within the carousel so inside
this I'm going to create a development
with class item so this slide itself is
encapsulated inside this development so
for example if you want five slides
within your carousel then you are going
to have five developments with class
item and then within this development we
can have text and images so first let's
include an image element and the source
attribute of this is going to point to
the desert image within the images
folder let's make our image responsive
by using IMG responsive class and the
notice on the slide we have got little
caption here to get that caption we are
going to create a development with class
carousel caption and inside this let's
create an h3 element the text is going
to be desert
let's create a paragraph element and the
text is beautiful desert so at the
moment we have got one slide within our
castle and notice we have got four
images here so if we want four slides
within our parcel we are going to have
four developments with class item and
each image element will be pointing to a
different image and the captions will
also be different so in the interest of
time I have already typed the required
HTML so let's copy these three
developments which are going to
represent three slides for us and paste
them within our carousel let's save our
changes
reload our webpage notice we don't get
the carousel at all that's because we
haven't told which slide within the
carousel to be active so let's say for
example we want this first slide to be
active so along with the item class I am
also going to use the active class let's
save our changes
reload this webpage now notice we get
the carousel but we have a problem here
it doesn't move from one slide to
another that's because we haven't
activated the carousel to activate the
carousel we are going to use a different
attribute and that is data - right I'm
going to set that to carousel let's save
our changes let's reload this and at
this point notice the carousel slides
from one image to another we can also
activate the carousel manually using
javascript at the moment we are using
data - attribute let's remove this save
our changes reload of webpage now notice
it won't move from one slide to another
so let's activate the carousel manually
using javascript so within our jquery
ready function let's find our carousel
div we have given it an ID image
carousel so let's find that using the
jquery ID selector and then on this
let's call carousel function
let's save our changes reload this now
notice the carousel moves from one slide
to another and notice at the bottom of
the slide we've got four circles here
indicating that we have got four slides
within the carousel and at the moment
the second slide is active let's see how
to get these little circle indicators to
create the carousel indicators we are
going to create unordered list with
class carousel indicators inside this
let's create a list item and on this I'm
going to set data - target attribute the
value for this is the ID of our carousel
which is image carousel I'm going to use
another data - attribute and that is
data - slide - this first list item
within this unordered list represents
this first circle indicator when we
click on this first circle indicator the
carousel should move to the first slide
so the value for this data - slide - is
going to be the number of the slide and
this light number is zero index space so
if you want to go to the first slide the
value should be 0 if you want to go to
the second slide the value should be 1
so on and so forth so when we click on
this first list item we want the castle
to go to the first slide so the value is
going to be 0 within our castle we've
got 4 images that means we want 4 circle
indicators so let's make 3 more copies
of this list item and then change the
value for data - slide - attribute and
when the page initially loads you know
we want our first circle indicator to be
active so on this first list item I am
also going to use active class let's say
what changes reload our webpage notice
now we've got those little circle
indicators and as the castle moves from
one slide to another the respective
slide indicator is active now if you
look at this slide right here notice we
also have code buttons on the left and
right hand side when we click the button
on the left hand side we want the
carousel to move to the previous slide
and when we click
The Next button we wanted to move to the
next slide so let's see how to get these
two buttons now to get these carousel
control buttons I'm going to scroll down
and just after this carousel in a div
I'm going to use an anchor element set
it's H of attribute pointing to the ID
of our carousel which is image carousel
and the clasp on this is going to be
carousel control since we want the
button on the left hand side I am also
going to use the left class and I'm
going to use data - slide attribute when
we click on the button on the left hand
side we want the carousel to go to the
previous slide so the value for this is
going to be preb standing for previous
and then we want the button itself so to
get the button we are going to use the
bootstrap glyph icon so let's use a span
element with class cliff icon and we
want the Chevron left glyph icon so
glyph I can Chevron left and to get the
button on the right hand side I'm going
to make a copy of this anchor element
and I'm going to change this class to
right and the value for this is going to
be next because we want to go to the
next slide and the image is going to be
glyph icon Chevron right so let's see
what changes a reload of a webpage
notice we get the left and right buttons
and we can use these control buttons now
to move to the previous or next slide so
when I click on the left hand side
button notice we go to the previous
slide when I click on this one we go to
the next slide now let's look at few
other options that are available to
customize the behavior of this carousel
plugin at the moment the carousel moves
from one slide to another slide
continuously it doesn't stop at the last
slide from the last slide it goes back
to the first slide and then it continues
until last slide so it never ends that
now if you want to stop the slideshow at
the last slide then use data wrap
attribute and set it to false so at this
point when we reload this notice that
slideshow is going to
up at the last slide the default value
for data wrap attribute is true notice
the slide show is stopped at the last
slide let's change the value of data
wrap attribute to true save our changes
reload our webpage notice this slideshow
starts again at this point when I hover
over the carousel look at what happens
this slideshow pauses and when we move
the mouse away from the carousel the
slideshow resumes again if you want to
stop the ability to pause on hover then
set data - pause attribute to false the
default value for this attribute is true
let's save our changes reload our
webpage and at this point look at this
when I hover the mouse over this slide
shoe is not paused the value for this
data interval attribute at the moment is
2000 milliseconds if we set it to false
it's going to disable the slideshow
altogether it will not move from one
slide to another slide automatically if
you want to move from one slide to
another slide you can do that either by
clicking on these buttons are using
these little circle indicators at the
bottom so here we have got bootstrap
carousel pluses that we have used in
this demo and on the slide we've got
carousel attributes which we just
discussed thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
