tutorial in this video we'll discuss
generating routing module using the
anglers July this is continuation to
part 19 so please watch part 19 before
proceeding to make angular CLI generate
a routing module all we have to do is
use this - - routing option when
generating a new angular project let's
look at this in action to generate a new
angular project we use this command ng
new let's name or project routing demo
along with generating this new angular
project we also want the angular CLI to
generate a separate routing module so we
are using this - - routing option there
we go the project is successfully
generated let's change into the project
directory we named our project routing
demo and then let's open our project
using Visual Studio code the project
source code is in the source folder we
have the route module file right here
app dot module dot TS in addition to
this route module file we have another
module file right here AB - routing dot
module dot tears this is the routing
module generated by angular CLI notice
it has included the required import
statement to import routes and router
module from the angular router library
and it also has created the routes
constant for us it left the routes blank
because angular CLI does not know what
routes we want for our application it's
for us to do that we have to configure
our routes and tie those routes to the
application menu apart from these two
steps and let's Eli has done pretty much
everything else for us and notice here
within the imports array it has included
the router module and it is also passing
this routes constant to the for root
method of the router module and it is
Reax porting the router module so any
other module that is importing this app
routing module
model features available to it it not
only generated this app routing module
for us it also has included the required
import statement within our route module
app module to import that routing module
and notice here it has made that
applauding module part of the imports
array so as far as floating is concerned
angular CLI has done pretty much
everything it can except configuring
routes and tying those routes to the
application menu in our previous video
we discussed these tabs to manually
implement routing in a separate module
if you have not watched that video I
would strongly encourage you to do so
before proceeding with this video I'll
include the link for that video in the
description of this video now let's
review all those steps and see which of
them angular CLI has implemented for us
and which of them it has left for us to
manually implement step 1 set the base
HTF element in index dot HTML this is
done for us out of the box by the
anglers hill i so if we look at our
routing demo project with an index dot
HTML we have the base href element
already said step to create a separate
routing module file this is again done
by the anglers here live for us
automatically out-of-the-box so here is
that separate routing module file and
let's yell I named it AB dash routing
dot module dot yes it is the name of our
class I brought in module step 3 import
the angular router module in the app
routing module again this is implemented
by the angular CLI for us so if we look
at our app routing module notice it has
included the required import statement
to import the router module and it also
has made it part of the imports array
step 4 configure the application routes
this is something that angular CLI is
not able to implement for us because
angular CLI does not know what routes we
want within our application before we
can configure our routes we need to
create these three components
own component employee component and
page not found component so let's go
ahead and create these three components
so let's switch to the command prompt
and then let's use this command to
generate the component ng for angular
CLI itself
G for generate C for component and the
name of the component that we want to
generate is home there we go the home
component is generated now let's
generate employees component finally
let's generate page not found component
there we go all the required components
are created now let's configure routes
for our application to speed things up
I'm going to copy the routes from the
project that we worked with in our
previous video here is that project
employee management and we have the
routes configured in the app routing
module in that project so I'm just going
to copy this routes array and then let's
place them within our routing demo
project which is right here so within
our routing demo project we already have
this routes constant created by the
angular CLI so let's paste our copied
routes right here so all we have to do
is configure routes and within the
routes notice we are referencing the
home employees and page not found
components so we need to include the
required import statements as well so
let's copy them from our employee
management project here are they
required import statements and then
paste them within our routing demo
project
step 5
import the application routing module a
protic module in the root module app
module this step is already implemented
for us by the angular CLI so if we look
at the root module app module notice it
already has the required import
statement to import a protic module and
it also has made a part of the imports
array step 6
specify where you want the router
components view templates to be
displayed using the router outlet
directive this tab is also implemented
for us by the angular CLI so if we look
at our root component app component
notice within the app component HTML
file we already have the router outlet
directive this is where the routed
components view templates will be
displayed
step 7 create a navigation menu and tie
the configured routes with the menu
using the rotary link directive this is
something endless CLI is not able to
implement for us will have to implement
ourselves so to speed things up I'm
going to copy the menu HTML from the
project that we worked with in our
previous video so within that employee
management project within the route
component template file we have the
required HTML so I'm going to copy this
HTML and paste it within the route
component within our routing demo
project so I'm going to replace all this
HTML including the router outlet
directive with this HTML so here we are
using the bootstrap nav component to
create the navigation menu so obviously
to style this navigation menu we will
have to install bootstrap so let's fire
up integrator terminal within visual
studio code and then execute this
command NPM install bootstrap - - save
there we go bootstrap is successfully
installed now we need to reference
bootstrap CSS file within the angular
CLI configuration file the angular CLI
configuration file is right here Angela
- CLI dot JSON so
in this file we have this Styles
property so we need to reference the
bootstrap CSS file right here so let's
save all these changes and then build
and run our angular project there we go
we have the navigation menu and routing
is working as expected so out of these
seven stands we manually have to
implement just two steps step four and
step seven
configure the application routes and tie
those routes to a navigation menu pretty
much everything else is done for us by
the angular CLI just imagine the amount
of code it's generating for us and the
time it is saving so angular CLI is
indeed a very valuable tool I personally
think every angular developer should
know how to use it so they can be as
productive as possible thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
