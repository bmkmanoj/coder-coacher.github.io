this video well disk is working with
paragraph elements and inline text first
let's look at the global bootstrap
defaults that are applied to the body
element and all paragraph elements here
are the defaults font sizes 14 pixels
line height is 1.4 to 8 let's confirm
this let's flip to visual studio notice
here we have this word hello bootstrap
inside a paragraph element let's view
this page in the browser now let's
confirm this paragraph element is using
the bootstrap defaults to do this I'm
going to right click on this word and
then select inspect from the context
menu this is going to launch the Google
Chrome developer tools and notice here
we have styles as we scroll down notice
the font size is 14 pixels and line
height is 1.4 to 8 now let's discuss
bootstrap inline text elements to
underline text use the U element to
strike through as highlight mark
emphasize or italicize e/m bold strong
subscript SUV and to superscript SUV
let's look at a few examples notice here
we've got a few paragraph elements and
within the paragraph elements we are
also using the inline text elements and
here is the output notice the text that
is surrounded by you element is
underlined the text that is surrounded
by s element is striking through so on
and so forth I have this exact same HTML
already typed within visual studio so
let's uncomment this and let's reload
this page let's first close the browser
developer tools now notice we get the
output that we expect also notice there
is a horizontal line here because we are
using the HR tag right here and the
reason for this red color is within our
custom Styles dot CSS I have overridden
the border color to one pixel solid red
now let's discuss the text alignment
classes made a
by bootstrap the left align text use
text left to Center align use text
Center to right align text right to
justify text justify to not allow
wrapping of words on to a new line use
text no wrap here are the examples
notice along with the paragraph elements
we're also using the bootstrap text
alignment classes and here is the output
I have this exact same HTML already type
in Visual Studio so I'm going to
uncomment this code and reload our page
notice the paragraph that has text left
class applied its left aligned the
paragraph that has text center applied
it is Center aligned and the paragraph
that has text right applied is right
aligned and this is the paragraph on
which we have text justify class applied
to see the text to justification in
action I'm going to resize the browser
notice the first three lines within this
paragraph are properly justified and
this is the paragraph on which we have
text nowrap class applied and because we
applied the class it's not a loving
wrapping of words on to a new line
instead they continue in the same line
and because of that we get this
horizontal scroll bar
now let's discuss bootstrap
transformation classes here are the
bootstrap transformation classes to
convert letters to lowercase use text
lowercase class to convert them to
uppercase use text uppercase to
capitalize first letter of every word
use text capitalized class here are the
examples notice along with the paragraph
elements by using bootstrap
transformation classes as well and here
is the output let's look at this in
action I'm going to uncomment the code
that I have typed within Visual Studio
and reload this page
notice texts lowercase paragraph
converts all the letters to lowercase
text uppercase paragraph converts all
the letters to uppercase text
capitalized paragraph converts the first
letter in every word to a capital letter
let's now discuss lead class in
bootstrap if you got more than one
paragraph and if you want a specific
paragraph to stand out from the rest of
the paragraphs on that paragraph you can
use the lead class let's look at an
example notice here we've got two
paragraphs
on the first paragraph they're using the
lead class this is going to make that
first paragraph stand out from the
second paragraph let's look at this in
action let's uncomment this HTML and
reload our page notice the first
paragraph stands out from the second
paragraph because on the first paragraph
we're using the lead class let's now
discuss how to work with abbreviations
to create abbreviations use abbr element
abbreviations with a title attribute
displays a dotted underline when the
mouse is over the abbreviation the
pointer becomes a help cursor as you can
see here and the title attribute value
is displayed as a tooltip let's look at
this in action so I have an abbr element
right here and it also has got a title
attribute title attribute value is set
to British Broadcasting Corporation and
the abbreviation is BBC let's save our
changes and reload this page notice the
abbreviation is displayed here with a
dotted line when I move the mouse over
that abbreviation look at that we see a
help cursor and we see the title
attribute value as a tooltip now if you
want this abbreviation to have a
slightly smaller font size than apply
initialism class on that abbreviation so
let's apply the initialism class
save our changes and look at this when I
reload this page the font size will be
slightly smaller
thank you for listening and have a great
