in this video we'll discuss how to
handle model changes after the database
is already created this is continuation
to part 4 so please watch but for before
proceeding
based on this employee class entity
framework has auto-generated this table
TBL employees now let's say after the
database is generated we are changing
the model class what do you think is
going to happen by default and the
framework is going to throw an error
let's look at that in action let's flip
to visual studio so this is the employee
class and based on this employee class
entity framework has generated this
table TBL employees now let's go ahead
and change this employee class let's add
a new property of type string and let's
call this job title okay so the model
class has changed so now this model
class and this database sample they are
not in sync so if we build a solution
and then if we try to view the waveform
in a browser window entity framework is
going to detect that the model has
changed since the database is created so
by default entity framework is going to
throw an error look at that
the model backing the employee dbcontext
has changed since the database was
created so you may be wondering how you
know the entity framework is able to
detect the model has changed since the
database was created that is with the
help of a table called underscore
migration history now MD framework has
generated these two tables for us look
at that departments and TBL employees
within the sample database along with
those two tables it has also generated
this table underscore migration history
and if we inspect the contents of that
table notice the context key it's called
employee dbcontext
that is the class that we have generated
in the previous session of this video
series so this employee DB context class
inheriting for
the bass dbcontext class so that's the
context key and look at this model
column this is say I mean there is a
hash value here this hash value is
generated based on this employee class
okay so when the database is created it
is computed a hash for this employee
class now if we change this class in any
way for example if you add a remove a
property you know the class has changed
so the hash for the change the class is
going to be different from what is
already stored in the database and
that's how entity framework is going to
detect that the model has changed since
the database is created and if it takes
that by default it's going to throw an
error so now let's see how to fix that
now to fix the error we have to tell the
entity framework what to do when the
model changes and to tell the entity
framework what to do when the model
changes we are going to make use of this
global dot asex file so to a project
let's add a new item and we want to add
global application class and we
discussed in detail
you know this global application class
in asp.net video series so if you're new
please watch asp.net video series and
within global dot a si X we have this
application just go start even handler
so this method is basically going to be
executed once when the application
starts and this is where we are going to
specify what we want the entity
framework to do when the model changes
okay and to tell that to the entity
framework I am going to make use of a
class called database skipper class and
that class is present in the entity
framework namespace so system dot data
dot entity
and this database class has caught the
set initializer method which we use to
tell the entity framework what to do
okay and we basically have two options
here we can tell the entity framework to
drop create database always or we can
tell it to drop create database only
model changes okay let's select the
second option and to this class we need
to pass our DB context as well and our
DB context is employee DB context
alright so we are basically telling the
entity framework so if you detect the
model change then go ahead drop the
database and recreate it
okay so let's view the waveform in a
browser window and see if that's what is
going to happen so now it's going to
drop the database and then recreate it
why because the model has changed since
the database was created I think we are
going to get a different error here
that's basically because of the fact
that you know the sample database is in
use okay so entity framework will try to
drop the database and then you know it
cannot do that because the database is
in use and that's what I think is there
are we are going to get it's still
trying to drop it look at that cannot
drop database sample because it's
currently in use
so let's actually close sequel server
management studio so that the connection
gets closed now let's try to view the
waveform again in the browser window so
now it should be able to drop it and
look at that you know the processing is
complete and the waveform is not
displaying any data because it has just
created the database so both the
departments and employees tables will be
empty so let's open sequel server
management studio once again and let's
check if the database is recreated look
at that we have departments and TBL
employees tables and if you look at the
columns there
notice that we have got job title and
obviously both of these tables are empty
that's why we don't see anything on the
webform so let's go and add
sample data to our database tables for
now let's actually manually insert the
data using sequel queries in our next
video we'll see how to use entity
framework to automatically populate
these database tables with test data so
to speed things up I have already typed
the required sequel script so let's
paste it here and execute it so there
should be some data now let's see fresh
this page so now we are seeing the data
but we are not able to see job title why
is that that's basically because we need
to add a bound column to this employee's
grid view control so let's go and do
that quickly so within our waveform one
dot aspx so we here we have got the grid
view control which displays the
employees details so let's add another
bounce here we can either do it in the
source mode or in the designer let's do
it in the source mode s that will be a
lot quicker so we want to bind this
field to job title column and header
text let's say job title with a space
between job and title so let's refresh
this page look at that we get the job
title as well so in our next video we'll
see how to populate the database tables
with test data automatically using
entity framework that's it for today
