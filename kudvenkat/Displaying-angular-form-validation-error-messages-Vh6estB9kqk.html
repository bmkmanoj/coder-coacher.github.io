in this video well discuss how to
display validation error messages to the
user styling the error messages using
bootstrap and finally how to disable the
submit button if the form is not valid
so here is what we want to do if the
full name field is not valid we want to
display a red border around the input
field and we also want to change the
label text to red and then display the
validation error message full name is
required just below the input field as
you can see right here on the other hand
when we start typing something in the
full name field and when the field is
valid we want the red border and the
validation error message to disappear
and we also want the label text to
return to its normal black color now to
style the validation error messages
we'll be using the bootstrap framework
from the bootstrap framework these are
the three classes that will specifically
be using to style the validation error
messages has error control label and
help lock we discussed form validation
States in part 23 of bootstrap tutorial
so if you new to bootstrap I suggest
please check out our bootstrap course
before proceeding so take a look at this
text article from our bootstrap tutorial
this is part 23 bootstrap form
validation States now if we scroll down
a bit and if you take a look at this age
field this is how we want to style our
full name field if there is a validation
error message and if you take a look at
the HTML associated with this field
notice on the development that has the
form group class we're using has error
class and on the label that displays age
we're using control label class and then
finally to display the validation error
message we're using a span element with
the help block class so let's do this
for our full-name field here is the full
name field HTML and here is the
development that has the form group
class so on this development we want to
add this class has error but we don't
want to add this class always to this
development we only want to add it
conditionally if there is a validation
error message and how can we find out if
there is a validation error message now
in our previous video we discussed form
validation properties so we can use this
template reference variable full name
control and then check out its invalid
property so we're going to use class
binding here and this is how the class
binding looks like we use the keyword
class and then whatever class we want to
apply we want to apply
has error class and we want to apply
this class
conditionally so within codes I'm going
to use our template reference variable
which is full name control and then we
know it has called the validation
property invalid so if this property
returns true only then this class will
be added if it returns false the class
will be removed if it's already present
so this is going to conditionally add or
remove our has error class depending on
whether there is a validation error or
not next on the label element that
displays this text full name we want to
add this class control label if there is
a validation error the text will turn
red otherwise it will be in its normal
black color finally we need to include
this panel element to display the
validation error message so just below
our full name input field let's include
these panel men and on the span element
we are going to use the bootstrap class
help - block and within the span element
of a validation error message is going
to be full name is required and remember
we don't want the span element to always
be displayed we only want to display it
if there is a validation error message
on this full name input field and to
conditionally hide or remove the
validation error message we are going to
use the ng F structural directive and we
are going to bind this ng structural
directive to the invalid property of the
full-name control template reference
variable so if this property invalid
true then the span element will be added
to the Dom otherwise it will not there
we go
notice the validation error message is
displayed as expected at the moment full
name field is required and since we
don't have anything typed in the full
name field we see the validation error
message full name is required the moment
we type something in the field the
validation error message disappears and
if we delete what we have typed notice
the message appears again now let's
enhance this form validation a bit more
at the moment the validation error
messages are displayed on the initial
form load some users does not like the
idea of having these validation error
messages displayed even before they had
the opportunity to touch the field so
here is what we want to do on the
initial form load we do not want to
display the validation error message
when the user touches the field and if
he leaves that field without typing
anything then we want to display this
validation error message full name is
required now this is easy to achieve you
might have already guessed we could use
touched property so here's what we want
to do if the field is invalid and if it
is touch only then add this has error
class along the same lines if the full
name field is invalid and if it is
touched only then let's play the
validation error message notice on the
initial form load we don't see the
validation error message if I touch the
field and leave it without typing
anything then we see the validation
error message as expected now we can
take this form validation to the next
level by styling the valid fields with a
different color here's what I mean on
the initial form load we don't want to
display a validation error message and
we want the full name input field and
its associated label to be styled it
like this with black color now if we
touch the field and leave it without
typing anything that field is invalid so
we want to style it like this as you can
see on the left right here now when I
type something and when the field
becomes valid we want to apply green
color indicating that the
it's valid maybe something like this
that you can see on this text article
like the password field we want the
label text to be green and the border
around the input field also to turn
green indicating that you know the field
is valid now so to achieve this all we
have to do is conditionally add or
remove this has success clause on the
development that has deform group class
so just like how we are conditionally
adding and removing this has error class
let's add and remove has success class
conditionally so we're going to use
another class binding for that this time
the class name is has success and we
want to add this class only when the
full name field is valid so we're going
to use the template reference variable
and on that we use the valid property so
if the valid property returns true has
success class will be added otherwise it
will not notice on the initial form load
we don't see the validation error
message if we touch the field and leave
it without typing anything we see the
validation error message if we make the
field valid by typing in something it's
styled with green color as expected
finally let's discuss how to disable the
submit button if the form is not valid
now for that we are going to use this
employee form template reference
variable notice and the test variable we
are exporting the ng form directive so
we can use this variable to check if the
form is valid or not if it's not valid
then we can disable the submit button at
the moment notice the submit button is
not disabled even when we have a
validation error the submit button is
still not disabled so to disable that
let's use this employee form template
reference variable and on the button
element let's use the disabled attribute
and bind that to invalid property
notice now the save button is disabled
as expected now when we make the form
valid by typing in something into the
full name field the button should be
enabled but notice the button is still
not enable that's because if you look at
our email input field that field also
has the required attribute and we don't
have anything typed in the field so the
email field is invalid as a result our
entire form is invalid now to make this
form valid we have to type something in
the email field and the moment we do
that notice the Save button is now
enabled as expected as you can see these
validation properties provide a lot of
power and flexibility when validating
and displaying validation error messages
here's the example that this place full
name is required validation error
message and on this slide we have the
code to disable the Save button when the
form is not valid thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
