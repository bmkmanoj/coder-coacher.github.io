venket this is part 35 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll learn about
the multi-view control in asp.net as the
name such as a multi view control is
made up of multiple view controls and
each view control in turn can have
controls inside it to understand this
practically let's create a simple
example where we want to capture
employee information on a step by step
basis for example first I want to
capture employee personal details next I
want to capture his contact details show
summary for confirmation upon employees
confirmation save the data to a database
table so the first step you know ask the
employee to enter his first name last
name gender and then I click on step 2
it then takes me to contact details page
where we ask for his email address
mobile number on step 3 we show the
summary of whatever he has entered and
then if he is happy he will submit
otherwise he can go back and modify the
details that he want to change and when
he submits we want to save the data to a
database table now to achieve this there
are several techniques in asp.net and
one of the easiest ways to achieve this
is to use a multi view control we can
also achieve this using desired control
which we will talk about in the next
video session and another way to achieve
this is to create multiple web forms and
then use state different state
management techniques like very strings
sessions cookies etc okay we'll talk
about each of these in a later video
session so let's flip to visual studio
let's drag and drop the multi view
control so multi view and we know that
the multi view control is actually made
up of multiple view controls so within
the multi view I can drag and drop the
view control so if you look at what we
want to do we want to have three views
so I'm going to have three view controls
within that so let's copy and paste this
three times here and let's give this
meaningful name let's call this few
personal details let's call this few
contact details and maybe the final one
view summary okay now within beach view
control if you look at this screenshot
you know I want to have first name last
name gender and a drop down list text
box text box and the button control just
to save some time and typing I have this
HTML already created okay this assemble
HTML let me copy and paste that within
the first view control okay and if you
look at this HTML that's pretty
straightforward all we have is a table
and then within that we have a TR and
then TD and there is a heading step one
personal detail so if I flip this to
design mode so this is what we have here
personal details first name text text
box text box and the drop-down list and
the button control and the text on the
button control is step two with two
greater than symbols and then once we
double click that there is an even
handler go to step two okay so that's
about the first you know screen design
the personal detail screen design the
next thing that we want to do is design
the screen for contact details so this
is going to be our step two so this is
going to be present in our view - so
let's minimize this so that it's cleaner
okay so I have this view now this is our
second step way we want to capture the
contact details of the user again I have
the HTML typed here it's just a simple
table baby are capturing the employees
email address and mobile number that you
can see here okay so let's copy and
paste that HTML there okay so if you
look at this now we have the second
screen and we have two buttons here one
button to go back to the previous tab
and the other button to go back to the
next step and if you look at the way we
have designed this HTML table it's very
simple to understand the buttons okay we
have two 3ds one TD to go back that's
the text there and the other TD
and the other button to go to step 3 and
the other HTML that we have is for the
email address and mobile number if you
look at each row here we have two PDS
within each row but then if you look at
the first row we have only one TD and we
have used a call span attribute
basically what we are telling with this
call span attribute is that in this I
mean if you look at all the TRS for any
table here there are two TDs
but then this personal details and this
step to contact details whatever is
displaying this heading we are merging
one TD into two DD so one TD should
occupy the entire space of two TDs so
that's why we are using this call span
span the column to two TDs that's what
you are number two is saying here so the
width of this one TD is now going to
occupy the space of two three DS okay
that's why we are using call span is
equal to 2 here and the same on the
first view call span is equal to two but
the idea is very simple we have created
a view to capture personal details
another view to capture contact details
finally we want to create a view to
capture the summary that we can see and
if you look at this all we want this you
know and heading here showing step three
summary personal details contact details
and then you know the text here and the
respective label controls which can
display that data there okay again we
need to have that HTML so just to save
some time and typing I have this pre
type this is a big table here so let's
copy and paste that by the way I will
have this on my blog so you can actually
download or copy it from there so let me
paste that there okay
so now if you look at the design we have
everything that's required so it's a
simple view control a multi view control
that has three views inside that and
within each view we have our respective
HTML okay that we want to show alright
so at this point so if I double click
this button I want to go to that step
similarly if I want to if I double click
this let's generate all the event
handlers
if i double click this i want to go to
previous step and if i double click this
i want to go to step 2 and if i double
click this i want to submit so we have
all they even handlers generated will
write the code in just a bit but now all
we have done until now is we have
designed our form but let's run this
page and see what's going to happen ok
so when I run this page it's not going
to show anything on the webpage it will
basically be be empty because multi-view
control by default will not show
anything on the webform you will have to
tell the multi view control ok when I
load when I get loaded what view you
want to see and how do I tell that the
multi view control has got this active
view index property and you specify that
you know to tell the multi view control
which view to show and this is 0 index
based so if you look at this multi view
control it has got 3 views within that
so if we go to the source we can
actually minimize this okay that's few
one that's view to and that's view 3
basically 3 views so when this view
control gets loaded which view we want
to show first our idea is basically to
show you know the personal details so
when the page first loads so view code
on the page load if it is not a postback
event what do I want to do in the multi
view control the active view index look
at that that's an integer property the
active view index is going to be 0 which
means the first index because it's based
on a 0 based index so when I run this
now first they you know the personal
details view will be shown so I can
enter my personal details here and when
I click step 2 what should happen it
cout it should go to the next view
within that multi view control
okay so all you have to do is and I go
to the design flip to the design mode
when I click step two I want to go to
the next view okay and how do I tell
that so multi view one dot active index
is equal to
that's the second step okay but on the
other hand when I click you know now I
come on to step two but when I click the
step one button I want to go to first
step which means the active index is
zero so let's copy that which button is
that that's that one and then on this
when I click step three I want to go to
the final view okay and then when I
click on step two I want to go to the
first view so copy that so which is that
one double-click this that is that and
finally when I click this we want to
save the data to the database we are not
going to do that here because that
simple ad or net code and we know how to
do it so instead of that what I'm going
to do I'm going to create another page
on this web application project so let's
right-click that add new item select a
webform let's call this maybe
confirmation dot the aspx so all we want
to do is we want to navigate to this
page so confirmation dot aspx and maybe
here we'll have an h1 and we will say
data saved to the database okay so
finally after we are done we will just
redirect the user to that page so
response dot redirect till the fourth
slash and the page that we want to go to
is confirmation dot aspx so let's get to
that page there okay so all the code is
done but then if you remember on the
summary page you know when I am about to
go to step three you know that's the
confirmation page so on the confirmation
page I also want to show the details
like you know we want to show the
details in the respective label controls
okay so those label controls are lvl
first name dot text is equal to where
does that come from
txt look at that this text box and
labels they are present on the same page
so you can actually directly retrieve
them they are not present on a different
page they are present on the same page
but within a multi view control okay so
that is the advantage of using you know
this multi view control for the end user
you know he thinks that there are
different pages but it's actually one
page now rather than asking all this
information on a single page at one time
if you ask the user you know in small
bits and pieces that makes more sense
okay so from a user perspective it's
like multiple pages but you know from
the application perspective in fact look
at the URL here it's all web form one
dot aspx web form one dot aspx web form
one dot aspx yeah but it gives an
illusion that it's happening across
three different pages because because of
the fact that all these controls are
present on the same page you know I can
directly access the label controls and
the textbox controls that are present in
different views within that page okay so
tags
similarly LBL last name dot text that
will come from
txt last name dot txt and similarly we
want lvl gender dot text is equal to DX
D gender or DDL gender dot selected
value and we want LBL email dot text
that comes from text box email dot text
and finally we want LVL mobile which
comes from txt mobile okay so we have
all that there so now let's go ahead and
run this let's close the page here
so it should work as expected now so we
are on webform one notice the URL here
and I'm filling in the details first
name is Mike last name is Hancock male
and when I click step two look at this
you know the view is changed but look at
the URL I am still on web form one and
look at this when I click the back
button it's treating it like a whole
different page okay so it's maintaining
the history there all right email
address let's say my cat Mike calm and
mobile number maybe zero one two three
four five six seven eight nine and when
I click step three it goes to the
confirmation page and look at that step
three summary it showing the details
that we want and finally when I say
submit you know on that click event we
can actually write the ad or dotnet code
to save the data to the database we have
spoken we have we have discussed about
ad or dotnet in a complete video series
please check that if you're new to ad or
dotnet okay look at this I can actually
go back go back to any step I want or I
can use these steps okay so from the
end-user perspective is giving an
illusion that it's happening across
different pages but we know that it's on
the same page on this slide you can find
