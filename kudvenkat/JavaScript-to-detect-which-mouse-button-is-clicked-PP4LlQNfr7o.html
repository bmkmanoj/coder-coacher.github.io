this video we'll discuss how to use
JavaScript and detect which mouse button
is clicked depending on the browser even
dot button or even dot which properties
of the event object are used to
determine which mouse button is clicked
ie8 in earlier versions support even dot
button property even dot button property
returns one for left four for middle and
two for right mouse click ie 9 and later
versions and most of the w3c compliant
browsers support even dot which property
even dot which property returns one for
left two for middle and three for right
mouse click let's write a simple program
we want to design a page with two button
controls and one text area element now
depending on which property of the event
object the browser supports when I
perform a left click on this click Me
button then if the browser supports
which property of the event object then
we want to see the code that is returned
for that left click if we perform a
middle click then we want to look at the
code returned and similarly for right
click if the browser supports even dot
button property then we want to see the
codes that are returned for left middle
and right mouse click so let's see how
to achieve this so first we need to
button controls input type equals button
value equals click me
similarly we need another button and the
text on this is going to be clear let's
include to HTML break elements and then
a text area element let's give it an ID
txt area columns equals three rows
equals 20 and now let's write a simple
function which is going to get us the
most click code so let's call this get
mouse click code and to this function
let's pass the event object if the event
object supports which property then in
that case we want to get the text area
element and set its value to actually be
using plus equals here because we want
to append to what is already there in
the text area element so value equals
event dot fetch this string and whatever
event dot which property returns and
then to this lets append a newline
character backslash R and backslash n
now if the browser does not support even
dot which property in that case we know
that it is going to support event dot
button property and in that case let's
go to and display whatever the button
property displays okay so we have got a
pretty simple function here so let's
call this function when mouse up event
occurs on click Me button
now when we click this Clear button we
want to clear the contents of text area
element
so let's write a simple function here
function let's call this clear text and
when this function is called we want to
set the value of text area element to an
empty string and we want to call this
function on click off this Clear button
all right
now we need to do one more thing now
when we perform a right click on click
new button we want to prevent the
context menu from appearing but
discussed how to do that in detail in
our previous video session so let's
quickly write that function to disable
the context menu from appearing so let's
call this prevent context menu and again
to this function we need to pass the
event object so the event object is the
equal to the event object itself or
vendo dot event if the browser supports
prevent default method then let's use
that method else let's set return value
of the event object to false and then
now let's associate this function with
context menu event of the document
object alright so pretty straightforward
JavaScript code here so let's go ahead
and run this at the moment I'm using
Google Chrome browser and Google Chrome
browser supports even dot which property
now let's see the codes return for left
middle and right mouse click and look at
this text area that's because we have
said columns two three and rows 220 it's
actually the other way around columns
220 and rows two three so let's reload
this page all right now I'm going to
perform a left click notice that even
dot which property returns one for left
click now let's perform middle click it
returns two and four right click it
returns three now let's clear that and
let's run the same page with Internet
Explorer so let's browse with Internet
Explorer
and on my machine I have Internet
Explorer 11 so this is going to behave
the same way as Google Chrome it
supports even dot which property so for
left click it's going to return one form
middle two and four right three now
let's change the mode using developer
tools to ie8 and now let's perform a
left click look at that it supports IE 8
and earlier versions they support even
dot button probably notice that we get
one for left click for middle four and
four right to so with this information
now let's write a JavaScript function
which is going to tell us which mouse
button is clicked and this javascript
function should work in all versions of
Internet Explorer and in most w3c
compliant browsers if not all so let's
write a JavaScript function for that we
need one button control so let's leave
it there let's get rid of the other
button control and the text area element
and we don't need this clear text and
get most click code functions so let's
delete them now let's write a function
let's call this which mouse button
clicked and again to this function we
need to pass the event object let's
create a variable let's call this which
button if the browser supports even dot
which property then we are going to
switch on event dot which property and
we know that this property is going to
return an integer value so case 1 we
know that if which property returns 1
then left button is clicked so we are
going to initialize the switch button
variable with the string left button
clicked
and let's break similarly for case 2 and
case 3 as well so if it is case 2 then
we know it is middle button if it is 3
then we know it is right button and
default if it is any other thing then
let's just display this message invalid
button clicked alright so if the browser
supports even dot which property that's
what we want to do else we are going to
switch on event dot button property so
in that case let's copy this code and
paste it right here
so even dot button property is going to
return one for left and four for middle
and two for right and it's any other
value then we are going to display this
message invalid button flag and then
once that is done
let's alert whatever value we have in
this variable which button and we want
to call this function when most of event
occurs on click Me button alright so we
already have the prevent context menu
function which is going to prevent the
context menu from appearing when we
perform a right click so these changes
let's go and run this so at the moment
is google chrome so when I perform a
left click notice that it says left
button clicked now let's perform a
middle click so middle button clicked
and now let's perform a right click so
right button clicked it's going to work
with IE 8 as well so let's quickly test
that with IE 8 so browse with internet
explorer and let's change the mode of
the browser to IE 8
so left click middle click and let's
perform a right click alright so this is
the same code that we just discussed
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
