in this video we'll discuss assigning
even handlers using these special
methods in part 36 we discussed
assigning even handlers using the HTML
element attributes and in part 37 we
discussed doing the same using Dom
object properties in this video we'll
discuss assigning even handlers using
these special methods Internet Explorer
9 and later versions and all the other
modern browsers support these two
methods add event listener and remove
event listener methods to add and remove
even handlers here is the syntax for
assigning even handlers using add event
listener method we call it on the
element to which we want to assign the
even handler and this method has got
three parameters the first parameter is
the name of the event to which we want
to assign the even handler and the
second parameter is the name of the
handler itself and at the parameter
phase for now let's just set it to false
in a later video session we'll discuss
the use of it so let's look at an
example now this is the example that we
worked with in the previous video
session notice that in this example
we're using this Dom object property
onmouseover to assign this handler
method to mouse over event so instead of
using Dom object property let's see how
to use add event listener method so to
use add even listener method we call it
on the HTML element to which we want to
assign the even handler so the element
that we want to assign even handler is
this button so BTN dot add event
listener and this method has got three
parameters the first parameter is the
name of the event the name of the event
is mouse over and the second parameter
is the name of the handler method so the
handler method is changed color
onmouseover and the third parameter is
phase four now let's set it to false in
a later video session we'll discuss the
use of that now this third parameter is
actually optional so if you don't need
it you can omit it so I'm going to omit
that
in a similar fashion I am going to
assign an event handler for Mouse out
event so on Mouse out we want this
handler method to be called alright with
these changes let's run the page notice
that onmouseover and onmouseout so it
works as expected so in this example
they using add event listener method now
let's see how to remove event handlers
to remove even handlers we use remove
event listener method so the syntax of
this one is pretty much similar to add
event listener it has got the same three
parameters again even for this method
this third parameter is optional so if
you don't need it you can omit it so
what we want to do is have another
button like this which says remove even
handlers and when we click that button
it should automatically remove the even
handlers that are associated with this
button so let's see how to do that so
the first thing that we need is the
second button so let's make a copy of
this and let's change the value
attribute to remove event handlers and
let's get rid of this ID property and
now let's write a function to remove
handlers so let's call this remove
handlers so BTN dot remove event
listener
and we specify the name of the event and
the event handler name similarly for
Mouse out we want to remove its handler
so we have so this is the function which
is going to remove the even handlers so
we want to call this function when we
click this button so on click of the
button
let's call remove even handlers method
all right so let's run this now so look
at that onmouseover and onmouseout it
works as expected let's click this
button remove even handlers now when I
mouse over and Mouse out nothing happens
so the even handlers are removed using
this approach we can assign more than
one even handler method to a given event
let's understand what we mean by this so
let's get rid of this second button
and here I'm going to have a function
let's name it and la1 and let's alert
the message saying and lo one called
let's make a copy of this function and
let's change the name to handler two and
the message to handler two called now
I'm going to associate both of these
even handler methods to the click event
of this button so the event name is
going to be click and on click of the
button we want to call this handler one
method
similarly on click of the button again
we want to call handler two so for the
same event we are associating two
handler methods so let's run this now
and click the button notice that handler
one is called handler two is also called
so using this approach that is using
addeventlistener method to associate
even handlers you can assign as many
even handlers as you want but one
important thing to keep in mind is that
the order in which these handler methods
are executed is not defined attach event
and detach event methods work only in an
Explorer 8 and earlier version so this
is another way to assign even handlers
you can use a tie event and detach event
attach event to assign and detach even
to remove event handlers but these
methods work only in ie8 and earlier
versions they do not work in IE 9 and
later versions and all the other
browsers and here is the syntax for
assigning even handler using attach
event method so this method has got two
parameters the first parameter is the
name of the event but the name of the
event you should have this word on
prefix so if it's the click event for
which you are assigning the event
handler then the even name should be on
click and then the handler
and the syntax for detach achievement is
very much similar to attach event so
let's look at an example now so we have
the button here instead of using
addeventlistener
let's use attach event so with the event
we should have this on prefix so on
click and let's call this click handler
let's get rid of the second function and
change the name of this handler method
to click handler so now we are using
attach event method and if you look at
the browser that I'm using I'm using
Google Chrome
okay so attach event method is not
supported by Google Chrome so when I
click this part and notice that nothing
happens
now let's browse this page using
Internet Explorer so right-click on the
page and solution Explorer select this
option browse with and then let's select
Internet Explorer now when I click the
button with an Internet Explorer notice
that it doesn't work here either that's
because if you look at the version of
Internet Explorer that I have it is 11
Internet Explorer 11 so in an ni 11
again this attachement method is not
supported this is supported only in ie8
and earlier versions so in IE 11 you
have got this developer tools option so
click that and on the emulation tab you
have this document mode now by default
it is set to edge means it's running in
IE 11 mode but we can make this to run
in IE 8 mode by selecting 8 from here
okay so now this browser is running in
IE 8 mode so when I click this part and
notice that it works
handle one called okay but then it will
not work in Google Chrome or you know in
ie9 and later versions now the example
that we have here
works in all the browsers including ie8
and earlier versions so if you look at
this example this will only work in IE 8
and the earlier versions but I want to
assign click even handler to this button
and such a way that it works across all
browsers so basically I want a cross
browser solution so let's see how to
write this code in such a way that it's
going to work with all the browsers so
if you use instead of attach event if
you use add event listener then that
method will not work in IE 8 and earlier
versions okay attach event this works
only in ie8 and earlier versions but not
in ie9 and later versions and all the
other major browsers so we want to
attach even handlers in such a way that
you know it's going to work in all the
browsers so that's called cross browser
solution so for that what I'm going to
do is use an if-else block F VT n dot
add event listener so if the browser
supports add event listener then use
that option so use add event listener
method to associate the even handler so
to the click event associate click
handler method so this is going to work
for all the modern browsers ie9 and
later versions else if the browser r is
ie8 then button dot addeventlistener
this is going to return false you know
basically so it comes to the else block
and this piece of code will be executed
so now this is going to work in all the
browser's so let's go back to Internet
Explorer reload the page so we are still
running in ie8 mode so when I click the
button notice that handler one called it
works now let's go to Google Chrome
reload the page click the button notice
that handler one call so now this piece
of code works across all browsers so
it's a cross browser solution
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
