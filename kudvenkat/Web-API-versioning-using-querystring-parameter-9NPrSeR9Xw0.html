tutorial in this video we'll discuss
versioning of a DBA service using a
query string parameter so here's what we
want to do notice in the URI I've got a
query string parameter V V stands for
version if the version value is 1 then
we want the baby PA service to the 10
version 1 students tip it is to then
return version 2 students before we
implement versioning using a query
string parameter first let's understand
how a controller selected by BPI when a
request is issued to this URI
API for slash students 4/1 in web api
out-of-the-box they have this class
called default HTTP controller selector
within this class we have this method
select controller method so this method
selects the controller depending on the
information it has in the URI in the URI
here we have got two pieces of
information students is the name of the
controller and one is the student ID
value so it looks at this URI looks at
the controller name students controller
so within our application it tries to
find a controller students controller
and then returns that that's how the
default controller selection works out
of the box in API but this default
implementation will not work for us
because in the first place in our
project we don't have students
controller instance we have students be
one controller and students be two
controller so depending on the query
string parameter value so if the value
for that B is 1 then we want students be
one controller to be selected if it is 2
then we want students V 2 controller to
be selected it's not students controller
as a matter of fact we don't have
students controller in our Web API
project so this default implementation
of controller selector is not going to
work for us so we need to come up with
our own custom controller selection
implementation so let's see how to do
that now this is the same project that
we worked with in our previous video to
this project let's add
new folder let's name it custom between
the planes our custom controller select
a file in this folder so let's add a new
class file to this folder let's name it
custom controller selector notice the
class is also named a custom controller
selector the first thing that we're
going to do here is make this class
derive from this default HTTP controller
select a class provided by the Web API
framework this class in turn implements
a HTTP controller selector interface so
let's make our custom controller
selector derived from default HTTP
controller select a class this class is
present in a different namespace system
not web dot H TV dispatcher so let's
bring that namespace in the next thing
that we're going to do is provide a
constructor for our custom controller
selector this constructor is going to
have a parameter of type HTTP
configuration and this class is present
in system locks web dot HTTP namespace
let's name the parameter config and
let's also create a private variable of
type HTTP configuration with another
class let's name the private variable
underscore config and let's initialize
the private variable with the
constructor parameter another thing that
we want to do is pass this HTTP
configuration object to the base class
constructor and to do that we are going
to use the base keyword and then pass
the config object to that now we want to
override the default implementation
provided by this default HTTP control
selector to do that we are going to
override this select controller function
within the space class default HTTP
controller selector so let's type the
keyword override and when we press space
we can see select controller method and
when we select that they have the method
stub generated notice this method has
the request object coming in as a
parameter the first thing that we want
to do here is retrieve all the
controllers that
we have another web API project to do
that we're going to use this method get'
controller mapping and listener that
returns us all the controllers and look
at this controllers folder we've got
five controllers but this method is
going to return only four controllers
that's because if you look at this home
controller this is not a baby API
controller it's an MVC controller and
this method is going to return only by
BPA controllers the rest of them are by
BPA controllers we know every baby a
controller derives from this base class
API controller so let's store all the
baby PA controllers in a variable let's
call the variable controllers and we
also want to retrieve route data so
that's create a variable called route
data
now if a user issues that equestria you
or I that looks like this within the URI
we have two pieces of information the
name of the controller VK students and
student ID value which is one so let's
retrieve that route data to do that be
able to make use of the request object
that is coming into the method as a
parameter and on that let's call get
route data method and we know within
this variable we have the name of the
controller so let's create a variable
here let's call it controller name
equals route data it has got values and
we have this key controller which is
going to give us the name of the
controller
let's convert that to string so in this
variable now we have the name of the
controller if a user issues a request to
this URI the name of the controller is
going to be students which is what will
be saved in this variable controller
name now if we issue a request to a what
I like this then we know that we're
going to have this query string
parameter V so we want to retrieve that
query string parameter value so let's
create a variable of type string let's
call this version number and initialize
it to a value of 1 let's create another
variable let's call this version query
string and we won't read just the query
stream part of the URI
V equals 1 or V
first two to do that they're going to
make use of this class HTTP utility
which has got this method parse query
string and to that they're going to pass
the request to object request URI dot
query property and now we want to check
if the version query string has got a
parameter with the name V and if it is
not equal to null and what we want to do
we want to initialize this variable with
the value that we have in this query
string parameter V so at this point in
this variable we will either have one or
two depending on to which you are right
the user has issued the request now
depending on this version number we want
to select a the students V one
controller or students V 2 controller so
if version number equals one then we
want the controller name to be students
with one at this point right here the
controller names will be students
because when we issue a request to this
URI to any of these your eyes look at
this the name of the controller these
students so that's what we will have in
this variable but if the version number
is one then to that controller name we
want to append V one else the version
number is two then we want to append V 2
so at this point depending on to which
URI the user has issued the request if
the creation parameter value is 1 then
the name of the controller will be
students we 1 if it is 2 then the name
of the controller will be students we -
so all that is left to do is to return
the respective controller if you look at
the return type of this method it is
HTTP controller descriptor so let's
create a variable of this type
let's call it controller descriptor now
if you look at this variable
this contains all their bb-8 controllers
in a web EPA project and if you look at
its type it's a dictionary of string
HTTP controller descriptor so within
this dictionary we will have to find the
controller that we are looking for and
return that respective controller to
find the controller within the
dictionary we're going to use this
method try get value and this method has
got two parameters the first parameter
is the key that is nothing but the name
of the controller that we are looking
for and the second parameter is the
output parameter so let's use the out
keyword and look at its type
it is HTTP controller descriptor and we
already have a variable of that type so
let's pass that as this second parameter
so what does this method do this method
tries to find a controller with the key
that we have specified if it finds it
it's going to initialize this variable
with the respective controller and this
method will return true if it doesn't
find the controller that we are looking
for then it's going to return false
it doesn't throw an exception and it's
better to use try get value because when
a user issues a request to a web api
service they can specify anything is the
controller name in the URI if they
specify ABC as the controller name then
in this controller's collection we don't
have a controller Betrayal ABC so in
that case we don't want this method to
throw an exception that's the reason why
we're using try get value so if try get
value returns true then that means we
have found the controller that we are
looking for in that case simply return
the controller if it has not found the
controller that we are looking for then
it doesn't come inside this if block in
that case simply return now and if every
VI pipeline is going to do whatever it
has to do so that's our first step
implement a custom controller selector
the next step is to replace the default
controller selector with our custom
controller selector this is done in very
PA config dot CSV file so within our Web
API config dot CS file
use this config object so config dot
services dot replays we won't replace I
HTTP controller selector this type is
pleasant in a different namespace so
let's bring that namespace in so we want
to replace this I HTTP controller
selector with our custom controller
selector the namespace for our custom
controller selector is Web API dot
custom we will have to bring that
namespace in as well so let's first
bring in Web API doc custom namespace
and our custom controller select a
constructor X text config object and we
already have the config object coming
into this method as a parameter so let's
pass that config object so we have
replaced the default controller selector
with our own custom controller selector
that's our second step the third step is
to include this default route in our Web
API config dot CSV file at the moment we
don't have any default routes
so let's include a default route let's
uncomment this and let's name it default
route we can give it any name we want
and the default route is going to be API
and then we are going to have a
placeholder for controller and an ID
parameter that's our default route and
we don't want the controller to be
initialized at 2v1 the ID parameter is
optional that's our default route that's
our third step and the final step is to
remove all these out attributes from the
respective action methods within
students v1 and students v2 controllers
so let's go ahead and do that so let's
first do that in students v1 controller
let's get rid of the route attributes
and let's do the same thing within
students v2 controller
so those are all the steps required
let's run our application now by
pressing ctrl f5 we are on the home page
let's navigate to slash API slash
students notice at the moment we are not
specifying the version query string
parameter so by default here by getting
student version 1 object that's because
if you look at the version number
we have defaulted it to 1 now if we
specify a specific version using the
query string parameter we get that
specific version so here they're getting
student version 2 objects if I specify
the version s1 and then we get student
version 1 objects as expected thank you
for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
