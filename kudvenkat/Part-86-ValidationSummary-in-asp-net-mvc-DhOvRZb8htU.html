in this video we'll discuss displaying
all validation errors at one place using
validation summary HTML helper we'll be
working with the examples that we worked
with in part 85 so please watch part 85
before proceeding with this video but
the end of this video this is what we
want to achieve we want to display the
validation errors as you can see in the
image right here at the moment if you
notice the state of our application if
there is a validation error look at that
it's displayed in black color we want
that to be displayed in red color and
then instead of the detailed error
message we want a red asterisk next to
the field that has failed the validation
and then we also want a border around
that field and then the detailed error
message that is associated with that
field should then be displayed when
validation summary okay and then we also
need a heading for the validation
summary something like this please fix
the following errors and then sub in the
form let's see how to achieve this the
first step here is to add a reference to
a style sheet called site dot CSS and if
you look at the MVC demo project that we
have been working with we don't have
that style sheet and that's basically
because when we created this MVC demo
project we have created this using a
blank template but then if you create a
new asp.net MVC for application using
Internet application template then you
would get content folder and within that
content folder you will have the
stylesheet site dot CSS so let's copy
the contents of this content folder and
then move them into our MVC demo project
so let me open this folder in Windows
Explorer and then copy the contents and
then let's move to the MVC demo project
let's add a new folder and let's name it
content and let's place the copied
contents into this project so at this
point we have site dot CSS now we need
to include a reference to the stylesheet
in real time we include references to
sheets and JavaScript files in master
page but since in this MVC demo product
we don't have a master page we'll
include the reference to the style sheet
in the edit view so let's drag and drop
the style sheet here and then let's use
the still that syntax so tilde indicates
the root directory of the project or
within the root directory we have
content folder and within that we have
site dot CSS that's what this index
right here states
alright let's save this changes and then
let's reload this view and see if
there's going to be any changes to the
validation messages that are displayed
look at that first of all the look and
feel of the view itself is changed
that's basically because of the style
sheet now notice that if there is a
validation error we get the validation
error in a different color
and then there is also a border around
the field that has failed the validation
okay now this is nearly red color but
not exactly red color okay now there are
three classes within the stylesheet site
dot CSS that control the display of
these validation errors so those are the
these three classes so this field
validation at a class that control the
look and feel of the validation message
itself and input validation error that
control the look and feel of the border
around the field and validation summary
errors class control the looking field
of the error messages that are displayed
in validation summary
okay so let's tweak them so that the
error message is in exact red color
okay so let's navigate to this class
field validation error so let's go to
the MVC demo project open site dot CSS
file control F and then let's paste a
class name and look at this the color
here you know there are six characters
within the color code two for red color
two for green color and two for blue
color all the colors in this universe
are made up by mixing these three colors
that is red green and blue in different
proportions okay now if we want a pure
red color
then the color coders ff4 red zero zero
four green and zero zero for blue okay
so that would give us a pure red color
so let's save the changes to our style
sheet and then let's reload this view
and see if the color changes to exact
red look at that this is exact red but
the border around the field is not exact
red okay so let's change the border also
the exact red color and to control the
display of the border we change this
class so let's copy that and then find
that within the style sheet and then
change the color so let's copy the same
color code and use it right here and
let's also change the color of
validation summary errors
okay so we have tweaked the three
classes now let's go in and reload this
view and look at that this is pure red
and the border is also pure red all
right
now let's display a validation summary
control so how do we get the validation
summary does it display all errors at
one place we use validation summary HTML
helper all we need to do is invoke that
HTML helper and that's it we should be
done so let's navigate to our edit view
and then above the submit button let's
include another paragraph element and
then within that HTML dot validation
summary HTML helper and this helper
expects two parameters okay one exclude
property errors so basically it's asking
us whether if we want to exclude these
individual property errors no we want
those property errors to be displayed
within the validation summary so
basically it's asking me if I want to
exclude them I would say no which means
let's pass false and then this message
here is the message that we see right
here the heading for our validation
summary errors okay so we want this
message please fix the following errors
and then submit the form so let me copy
that and then pass as the argument for
this validation summary that's it let's
save the changes and then let's reload
this feel
okay
so I get the validation error but then
look at this when I click Save deform
doesn't get posted to the server but we
get the validation errors in the
validation summary but then look at this
the other change that we want is we
don't want the detailed message next to
the field that has failed a validation
we want the red asterisk and to achieve
that all we need to do is you know
there's a call to this validation
message for HTML helper for each of
these properties name email confirm
email so all we need to do is include
the message that you want to be
displayed you know as an additional
parameter for that helper method so
let's actually do that so let's do it
for all the properties right here so we
have to do it for name so validation
message for so here there is another
property parameter I mean validation
message so let's include an asterisk
there and then let's do the same thing
for all the properties for email for
confirm email for age gender and finally
for the hire date property all right
let's save them and let's reload this
view okay so look at that we get the red
asterisk and then let's include some
numbers here so confirm email and email
doesn't match so we have a red asterisk
there and that's not a valid email so we
get a red asterisk there as well name
cannot contain numbers but there is a
number so we get a red asterisk there so
once I click Save look at that all the
validation I mean the detailed error
messages that are associated with these
fields are displayed here we have a
heading and red asterisk next to the
field and then a border around the field
right
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
