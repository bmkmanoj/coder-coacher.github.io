this video we'll discuss non action
attribute in MVC in an interview an
interviewer may ask you questions
related to known action attribute in
many different forms for example they
may ask you what's the use of non action
attribute or how do you restrict access
to public methods in a controller let's
try and understand the concepts related
to non action attribute so that we can
answer these interview questions as
efficiently as possible we know that an
action method is a public method in a
controller that responds to your URL
requests so by default if you have any
public method in the controller then it
can be invoked using a URL request for
example here within the home controller
we've got two public methods method 1
method 2 to invoke this method 1 we
simply issue a URL request like this
slash home slash method 1 similarly
clean work method 2 we issue a Wordle
request like that slash home slash
method 2 so by default all public
methods inside the controller respond to
your URL requests now let's say for
example this method 2 is for doing some
internal work and we don't want
end-users invoking it by issuing URL
requests so how do we prevent that from
happening
simply decorate that with non action
attribute let's build a solution let's
refresh this view look at that we get an
error stating the resource cannot be
found and that's because we have
decorated that with non action attribute
so we use non action attribute to
restrict access to public methods in a
controller and another way to restrict
access to methods in a controller is by
making them private so if I remove this
non action attribute since this is a
public method it will respond to a URL
request but then to prevent that from
happening
we can simply make that private so let's
build the solution and let's refresh
this fear
look at that we get the same matter the
resource cannot be found but then in
general it's a very bad design to have a
public method in a controller that is
not an action method if you have any
such method maybe for performing some
business calculations then it should be
somewhere in the model and not in the
controller but however if for some
reason if you want to have public
methods in a controller and you don't
want them to be treated as actions then
use non action attribute and this slide
you can find resources for speed or net
c-sharp and sequence of interview
questions that's it for today thank you
for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
