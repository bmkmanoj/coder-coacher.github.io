am venket this is part 26 of signal
server in this session we learn about a
few more date and time functions that
are available specifically we'll be
talking about East 8 they month year and
date name functions and finally we'll
look at a practical example of using all
these functions together before
continuing with the session I strongly
recommend to watch part 25 of this video
series now in the previous part we have
seen the different date time data types
that are available in sequel server
depending on the requirement of our
project we choose the date time data
type that's most appropriate for example
if I want to store just the date part
then I use the date data die on the
other hand if I want to store the date
the time including the offset
information then I will choose the time
offset okay
so basically these are the different
data types that are available in signals
over look at this there is if you look
at the data types here we have one
called date time and the other one date
time too and if you look at the
difference between these two in terms of
seconds for date time - we have more
precision okay and we have also spoken
about various other functions that are
available in sequel server to retrieve
the current date and time okay and we
also have spoken about the UTC date and
time concepts and timezone offset
concepts in the previous session so I
strongly recommend to watch part 25 of
this video series before continuing with
this session in this session we'll talk
about ease date function so ease date
function basically checks if the given
value is a valid date time or date time
this function returns 1 for success and
0 for failure ok so if you look at the
way we are using this function e state
you're passing in something to this
function in this case we are passing in
ProTeam within single quotes and look at
this can we convert this plugging into a
valid date time or date time we cannot
that's why this function returns 0
indicating that this is not a valid data
time okay but on the other hand if you
look at the second example this function
is taking in another function getdata
and we know that get date function
returns the current date and time okay
so as get it returns a valid date and
time we are passing it to e state
function to check okay easy to validate
time obviously it's a valid date time so
the function is returning one here okay
and this is a hard-coded date and time
value you have your month day and then
hours minutes seconds and milliseconds
which is a valid date and time so the e
state function is returning one but in
the other hand look at the fourth
example that we have here it's a valid
date as well the only difference between
the third and the fourth date is that
with a fourth date we have got more
fractional seconds precision here okay
but then each date function returns zero
and if you look at the note here for
data type for date/time values each date
returns zero okay and if you remember
from the previous part anything that has
got you know the long precision for the
seconds it's a date/time to data type
okay this is date/time offset here also
we have the long precision okay so for
these dates each date returns false so
if you look at this example here okay is
date if we execute this this returns
zero okay so keep that in mind each date
function returns zero for day time to
values okay that's about a state
function and these are the examples so
obviously if we execute all of them
together so ease date for presume
returns zero get date returns the
current date and time it's a valid date
so it returns one and this is a valid
date and time so that returns one the
third one and finally this is a date
time to data type date so that's why
each date returns
C
for that pretty simple to understand
okay so next we will talk about day
month and year functions these are very
very simple to understand
obviously the day function returns the
day number of the month of the given
date so for example if you look at the
examples here I have this get date
function so obviously get date returns
the current date and time so if you look
at the current date and time on my
machine it is you know basically first
of September 2012 so the day will return
one here because get date returns
September 1st 2012 and if you look at
this here they where we have the
hard-coded date the date here is 31st of
January 2012 so the day function returns
31 and if you look at the month it
returns the month number of the year so
obviously today is September 1st 2012
so month of get date returns you know
number 9 for September and here this is
January 31st 2012 so month function
returns 1 which is very straightforward
and along the same lines your function
returns the en number of the given date
so get date returns the current system
date and time
so September 1st 2012 so year part is 12
I'm in 2012 so this returns 2012 whereas
the second one also returns 2012 because
the year here is 2012 so basically
depending on which part of the date you
want you can choose either day month or
year functions let's look at them
practically real quick
so obviously select get get date returns
the current date and time so this should
written as 9 so that returns 9 and they
should return that you want because 31
is today and along the same lines
today is September so when we execute
this this the first method call should
return 9 and here the value with the
month value is hard-coded to first month
so it returns 1 and if you look at the
year function
obviously this is 2012 September 1st
2012 so the first one returns 2012 and
the second one returns 2012 as well
because we have it hard-coded here all
right so that's about day month and year
functions date name function this is a
very very useful function okay so date
name function basically returns a string
okay let's quickly prove that so if you
look at this here select date name so if
you look at the function itself sorry
about that okay
so select date night date name if you
look at the function itself this
function returns an N value add a string
okay
now basically there are two parameters
that this function expects the first
parameter is like which part of the day
do you want I mean which part of the
date do you want in string
representation do you want the day or
the week day or the month okay now look
at this I'm saying if you look at the
second example specifically I'm calling
date name function and I'm passing it
weekday you know as the argument for the
first parameter which is in two well
weekday and then I'm okay in this given
date tell me for the 30th of September
2012
what is the weekday is at a Sunday
Monday Tuesday Wednesday okay so if you
won't figure that out you can use date
name function so when I execute this one
it returns a Sunday similarly if you
want to find the name of the month then
you can pass month name for the interval
so basically if you look at this date
name function it expects two parameters
okay the second parameter is the date
upon which this function will operate
and the first parameter you know you use
that parameter to tell which part of the
date do you want
okay now this date part you know look at
this the table here for example if I
want weekday I can use weekday or I can
just say DW now is it mandatory to
remember all these date parts and
abbreviations not really okay because if
you just search MSDN you get it okay
but then these are very easy to remember
as well for example if you want the ear
part you will just specify ear if you
want the month you'll say month if you
want the day you will say day if you
want the weekday you will say weekday
they will give you an integer number
I mean I though this number is
represented in a string format it's a
number
today number okay whereas if you want
the weekday name BB we use weekday
similarly you can have several other
date parts as well for example seconds
milliseconds microseconds etc so
depending on your requirement you choose
the appropriate date pad and I suggest
to use the full date part rather than
the abbreviation because that will be
clear you know when you look at that
it's more readable rather than saying dy
or QQ okay so that's about date name now
let's get a very simple example of using
this date name function okay
now in our database we have a very
simple table select star from TBL
employees so if you look at this table
it has gone just you know three columns
ID name and the date of birth okay just
like this ID name and date of birth now
what I want to do is we want to write a
query which returns an output something
like this I want the name of the person
date of birth and the day they are born
on okay are they born on a Monday
Tuesday Wednesday Thursday so depending
on the date of birth we'll have to
calculate that and I also want the month
number is it twelve month nine month
eight month whatever and the month name
is a December August whatever and
basically the year and obviously you
would have casted by now how to write
this query we use the functions that we
have just discussed and if you look at
the query it's pretty simple we want the
name as it is so we will say name and
then the date of birth as it is will say
date of birth so that's pretty simple
next we want the day okay the weekday is
it a Monday Tuesday Wednesday so I can
use the date name a function Pass
weekday for the date part parameter and
date of birth column work on date of
birth from the date of birth find out
what is the weekday and return that has
day okay and then next we want the month
number okay if you want the month number
in the previous session I mean the
previous slide we have seen
how to use the month function that will
give you the month number okay so we are
basically using that month function and
we are telling okay operate on date of
birth column and return the month number
and similarly I want the month name next
so I am passing in month as the date
part for the date name function and
operate on date of birth and return the
month name and finally I want the year
so we are using the ear function which
is pretty simple and we have that exact
same query written here so if you look
at that this is exactly the query that
we have and when we execute this query
you should see the output that we want
