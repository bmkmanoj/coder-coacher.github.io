vented this is part 16 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll learn about
adding items to the drop-down list
control at design time using the HTML
will also learn about adding items to
the drop-down list control at runtime
using the code let's flip to visual
studio let's drag and drop the drop-down
list control from the tool box now
remember that whenever you know we want
the we want to present to the user a
list of choices from which we want the
user to select only one choice then we
choose drop-down list we can also use
radio button list for that purpose but
in the problem with the radio button
list is that as the number of choices
grow you know the amount of space that
the radio button list occupies will also
grow we will talk about radio button
list in a later video session okay so if
you have you know a lot many choices to
present to the user from which you want
that user to select only one choice then
drop-down list is the control that we
can make use of now if you look at this
I just dragged and dropped a drop-down
list control it doesn't have any items
within that so obviously when I run this
page now the drop-down list will be
empty when the page renders as you can
see it here so we need to add items that
we want to display within this drop-down
list control and to add those items you
can do that at the design time okay at
compile time so how do I do that a
design time right click on the drop down
list select properties within the
properties window there is this items
collection property now one golden point
to always keep in mind is that drop-down
list is a collection of list item
objects we will talk about list item
objects in just a bit okay but at this
point just keep in mind drop-down list
is a collection of list item objects so
when I click this ellipsis button next
to this items property so it's a
collection so when I click this ellipsis
button you see this list item collection
editor so a drop down list is a
collection of list item objects and this
is a list item collection editor you can
add a list item here so when I click add
a look at this these are the properties
of the list item objects that we
commonly use the text is the text that
can
displayed in the drop-down list and the
value is usually the one that gets
stored in the database for example if
you display a list of cities within the
drop-down list you have city name which
appears as a text in the drop-down list
okay
for example exceed name Mumbai you know
New York etc now when I select a city
within the drop-down list and then maybe
submit that form you know in the
database instead of saving the city name
it will actually store the city ID okay
in the integer so if you have a
different value than the text then use
the value that will be behind the
drop-down list okay and you can retrieve
that value using the selected value
property of the drop-down list we will
talk about retrieving the selected
values in a later video session this
session is all about adding items to the
drop-down late' drop-down list at design
time and at runtime okay so obviously I
want to set the text let's say text is
male and the value is 1 okay and then I
want to add you know female is the text
and the value is 2 okay so let's click
OK
so now if you look at this list item
collection editor window I've got two
list items ok now I can move them up or
down using these arrows just in case if
I if I have added them in the wrong
order you can move them up and down
using these arrows here ok so now click
OK now when I run my application as you
might expect it shows both these are you
know list items within the drop-down
list male female now if I actually flip
to the source mode look at that the list
item collection collection editor window
when you added items there it actually
generated this HTML for us so the values
are here and this is the text you can
either you know include it between the
opening and closing braces
you know angular brackets of this list
item or you can actually use the text
property so text is equal to male so you
can do this as well okay and if you flip
to the design you should see male you
know
the same as before but then I'm using
this text attribute here instead of just
wrapping the text between this opening
and closing tag of list item object okay
so this list item if you look at this
the way it looks right now it shows male
and female male is the first option in
the drop-down list so it appears as if
it is selected now let's say when this
drop-down list of renders I want the
female you know list item to be selected
in the drop-down list how do we do that
this list item has got another property
called selected so if you set that to
true then when the drop-down list
renders that list item within that
drop-down list will be selected here we
set the selected property to true for
female so if you look at this drop-down
it it has said that to select it okay so
there is another property called enable
and if you look at this you know for a
drop-down list if you set the enabled
property to false that means you're
technically disabling that which means
that option will not be shown in the
drop-down list so if we run this now
only male option will be shown because
you have disabled female list item by
just setting enabled equal to false so
these are the you know commonly used
properties of the list item object but
then the drop-down list itself is you
know a collection of list item objects
so we have seen how to add list items at
the design time you know you can do that
in the HTML directly or you can use the
list item collection editor window from
the properties ok this window that we
have used okay but then you can also add
items to the drop-down list at runtime
using code so when the act when when the
page actually renders you know I want to
add items to this drop-down list is that
possible absolutely okay
now keep in mind drop-down list is a
collection of list item objects so
obviously if I have to add items to the
drop-down list using code then I have to
create an instance of list item object
and then populate all the properties
that are required at least the text and
value properties and then add that list
item object to the items collection
property of this drop-down list it's as
simple as that let's see how to do that
so let's say when the page loads I want
to do that so we know that drop-down
list is a collection of list item
objects so list item let's call this
mail list item is equal to new list item
object and if you look at the
constructor you know there are several
overloaded constructors of list item
class you know this is one constructor
which is taking text in value so the
text that I want to add is male and the
value is 1 so that's one list item
object so let's create another list item
object for female so let's call this
female list item and let's say female
and obviously the value for that is
going to be two okay and the reason why
you have this red squiggly line here is
because the text and value both of them
should be strings so wrap them in double
quotes and everything should work okay
cool so we have the two list item
objects that we want to add to the
drop-down list so you have just created
those objects so obviously you need to
add them to the drop-down list so the ID
of the drop-down list is dropped
drop down list 1 that's the drop down
list 2 which I want to add this items so
select that dot it has got an items
collection remember this drop-down list
is a collection of list item objects so
how do you get to that collection
property using the items property so
items dot add so to the items collection
you want to add a list item object look
at the add method the intelligence says
it expects a list item object so we need
to pass these list item objects one at a
time to the add method ok so we passed
male list item now I need to pass in the
female list item okay so now when we run
this we are actually adding these list
items in
now at run time during the page load and
remember look at this when you you have
to be extremely careful when you add
list item objects on the page load event
okay the reason is look at this let's
say I have let's flip to the design mode
look at this at the design time I don't
know what items are going to come into
this drop-down list because they are
determined at the run time they're
calculated at runtime and we are doing
that in the page load event so let me
just put a button control there let's
run this page now and as the page loads
because in the page load event we are
actually adding those list items so the
drop-down list shows those male and
female list items within the drop-down
list now look at this we are doing that
within the page load now when I click
this button the page load event will be
fired again right so it's going to add
male and female again okay now we know
that web works in a stateless protocol
so how is it remembering them because
asp.net view controls makes use of the
view state so the view state has
actually remembered the previous values
within this drop-down list and when you
click the button the page load even gets
fired on the web web in the server again
and then another set of male and female
is added so every time you click this
button these male and female list item
objects keep adding to this drop-down
list and we don't want that to happen so
if you don't want that to happen then
add this items only if it is the first
you know initial get request of the web
form and how do we determine that using
if not is post back property okay so now
if we run this no matter how many times
you click the button it only loads it
the first time the web form loads that's
why you will not have that duplication
so no matter how many times you click
this button you only have them once so
be cautious when you add a list item
objects to the drop-down list on page
load event
okay so drop-down list is a collection
of list item objects which we have
talked about the list items can be added
to the drop-down list at the design time
or
one time if you want a specific list
item to be selected in the drop-down
list
set the selected property of the list
item object property object to true to
hide a list item in the drop-down list
set the enable that property to false
now remember not only drop-down list you
know the controls like checkbox list
radio button list all the list controls
checkbox list radio button list you can
see them here checkbox list radio button
list bulleted list list box all these
list item objects are actually
collection of list item objects so if
you know how to add items to a drop-down
list then it's very easy to understand
adding items to these controls because
it's essentially the same you are adding
list item objects okay
but then one thing that is a little
different is this you know enabled
property if it's a radio button list you
know this enabled property if you said
that to false then that choice within
the radio button will be disabled in the
sense you cannot select or unselect that
okay but for a drop-down list it will be
hidden all together okay so to hide a
list item in the drop-down list set the
enabled property to false if you are
adding list item objects to the
drop-down list in the page load event
make sure you do only when the page is
loaded for the first time otherwise
every time you post a page pack for
example by clicking a button the list
items will be added again and again
causing duplication on this slide you
