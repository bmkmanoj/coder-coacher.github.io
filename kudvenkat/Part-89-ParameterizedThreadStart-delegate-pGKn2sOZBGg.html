video we'll discuss the purpose of
parameterize the thread start delegate
this is continuation to part 88 so
please watch but 88 before proceeding so
when do we use this parameterize that
thread start delegate use this delegate
if you want to pass data to the thread
function let us understand this with an
example let's flip to your studio this
is the same example that we worked with
in the previous session at the moment
this program is always going to print
numbers from 1 till 10 now let's say we
want to control this target number we
want to change this program in such a
way that we wanted to prompt the user to
enter a target number and if the Ender
end user enters number 30 as the target
number then we want this program to
print numbers from 1 till 30 now to be
able to control the target number we
need to pass a parameter to this
function so let's go ahead and pass it a
parameter let's call it target and
within the for loop we are going to
check the value of Phi against this
target variable so that's going to do
the trick for us but then notice that
the moment we have changed the signature
of this function we got a compiler error
here and why do we got that compiler
error that's because if you look at this
thread class constructor there are 4
overloaded versions but basically you
know a thread needs to point to a
function you know which we want the
thread to execute and there are two ways
we can do that one way is to use thread
start delegate we discussed using that
in the previous session and another way
is to use parametrized thread start
delegate now what is the difference
between the two when do we use one over
the other now if you want to pass some
data to the thread function here print
numbers is the thread function because
this thread is going to execute that
function so and it is expecting a
parameter to be passed and so obviously
we need to pass in data to this thread
function so if the thread function
expects some data to be passed then use
parametrized thread start delegate if
you don't have any data
to pass to the thread function then use
thread start delegate so let's go ahead
and create an instance of parameterize
the thread start delegate let's call it
parameterize the thread start equals new
parameterize thread start and what is
the delegate a delegate is a function
pointer it points to a function and for
a delegate to be able to do that to its
constructor we need to pass the name of
the function and the name of the
function is print numbers all right so
we have an instance of a parametrized a
thread star delegate let's go ahead and
pass it to the constructor of the thread
class notice that we got rid of that
compiler error but here we still have a
compiler error and what is the error
saying no overload for print numbers
matches delegate parameterize thread
start let's look at the signature of
parameterize thread star delegate with
that it returns wired and it expects a
parameter of type object now let's look
at the signature of the function to
which this delegate is pointing to print
numbers it returns wide and look at the
parameter it is of type integer so the
signature of this function does not
match the signature of this delegate so
obviously that's why we have this
compiler error and why is that because
delegates are types a function pointers
meaning the signature of the delegate
must match with the signature of the
delegate with which I mean to which it
is pointing to in this case pool they
don't match and that's why we have that
compiler error so to get rid of this
compiler error we need to change the
data type of this parameter to object
and the moment we do that notice that
the compiler error goes away but then we
need to fix it here because I is going
to be an integer so you need to typecast
that to integer so let's create a
variable of type int here let's call it
number and initialize that to zero and
then let's use tryparse function to
convert this object type in
in India so try Pass expects that to be
in a string format so let's convert that
to a string and then we need to pass it
an output parameter and let's pass this
variable that we have created number now
look at this try parse function it's
going to return true if the conversion
is successful otherwise it's going to
return false so if the conversion is
successful then go ahead and print the
numbers and you know if the conversion
is successful this variable is going to
receive the converted value so I is less
than or equal to number go ahead and
print it now all that is left is to get
the target number from the end user so
let's use console dot write line and
let's prompt the user to enter the
target number and let's read the value
that the user has entered using console
dot readline function and then let's
store it in a variable of type object
let's call it target and now the
important thing is to pass this argument
to this function okay so how do we do
that
you know just pass that to the start
function and we are calling this start
function on the thread object so this
thread is pointing to this function so
that value gets automatically passed
down to this function okay so if you
look at the start function itself on the
thread object you know that's an
instance method there are two overloaded
versions one overloaded version doesn't
take any parameters the other one
expects a parameter of type object and
thus target is of type object so we are
passing it there that gets passed down
to the print numbers function so let's
quickly run this and see if it works as
expected so please enter the target
number let's enter for example 14 and
look at that it's printing numbers one
till 14 okay so when do we use this
parameterize thread star delegate
it use it if you want to pass data to
the thread function now we can also
change the code in the main function
like this if you look at the code at the
moment you know we are explicitly
creating an instance of parametrized
thread start delegate making it point to
a function and then we are passing that
delegate instance to the thread class
constructor we really have to write this
line of code here not really we can just
copy this paste it right there and get
rid of this delegate altogether let's go
ahead and run this so please enter the
target number let's enter maybe 30 and
look at that it prints numbers one till
30 so it's working so now here we are
not explicitly creating the
parameterised thread start delegate but
how is it working it's working because
the compiler implicitly does the
conversion for us automatically from
this to this one okay so that's what we
have there new thread of number the
print numbers the compiler is going to
do the implicit conversion for us you
know to this syntax so the obvious
question is when to use parametrized
thread start delegate over thread start
delegate if you have some data that you
want to pass down to the thread function
then use parameterize thread star
otherwise use thread start delegate so
one thing to keep in mind is that using
parameterised thread start delegate and
thread dot start method to pass data to
the thread function is not save type
save as they operate on object data type
look at that you know the start method
it expects a parameter of type object so
meaning you can pass any type of data to
this function okay and it's still going
to work but then the problem is we lose
this type safety that we get that
c-sharp programming as a result of that
okay but now you may think okay here we
are operating on object datatype now
I can easily change this to int data
type but the moment we do that we have
seen we get a compiler error why is that
that's because the signature of this
function doesn't match the signature of
parameterised thread start delegate thus
the reason we get that compiler error
right so this is not really good
practice to use parameterize thread
start delegate to pass data to the
thread function because we lose that
c-sharp type safety the programming
language feature so in our next video
will actually discuss passing data to
the thread function without losing the
type safety feature of the C char
programming language that's it for today
