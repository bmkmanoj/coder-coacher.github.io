in this video well discuss some of the
common differences between a development
build and production build in angular in
our previous videos in this series we
discussed that to generate a development
build we use this ng Pearl command you
can also explicitly specify that we want
a development build by using - - dev
option if we want a production world we
use - - prod option so let's discuss
some of the common differences between a
development build and a production well
now by default a development build
produces source Maps
whereas a production world does not so
the obvious question that comes to our
mind is what are source Maps and why do
we use them to improve the performance
the applications JavaScript and CSS
files are combined and compressed it is
extremely difficult to debug those
compressed files a source map holds
information about the original files and
can be used to map the code within a
compressed file back to its original
position in a source file so with the
help of these source maps we can easily
debug our application even after the
files are compressed and combined so by
default a dev build produces source Maps
where as a production build does not but
we can change this default behavior
using the - SM option so with a dev well
if you don't want source maps to be
generated simply set this - as some
option to false along the same lines if
you want source maps with a production
build you simply set that option to true
let's try one of these commands so by
default with a prod bail we don't get
source Maps but let's say we want to
generate source Maps with a broad bail
all we have to do is set this SM option
to true let's quickly look at this in
action so ng pearl - - prod is going to
generate a production bail and by
default it doesn't generate source maps
but we do want to generate those Maps
so I'm going to use - SM option the it's
an alias and it stands for source map so
to set this to true so this command is
going to generate a production build but
it is also going to generate source Maps
there we go
our production build is completed and if
we look at the distal de within our
routing demo project folder notice along
with the compressed and mini find
bundles we also have their respective
source map files generated as expected
with the development build by default
global styles are extracted to a dot JS
file whereas with the prod build they're
extracted to a dot CSS file we have just
done a production well so if we look at
that dist:4 de once again notice the
global styles are present in a file that
has got dot CSS extension so that's the
default behavior with the prod world the
global styles are extracted to a dot CSS
file whereas with the development world
they're extracted to a dot JS file we
can change this default behavior if we
want to
by using this - EC alias EC stands for
extract CSS now with a prod well we know
by default they are extracted to a dot
CSS file but if you don't want that
default behavior use this option so
let's say we want the global styles to
be present in a dot GS file with a prod
well to achieve that all we have to do
is set this option to false so let's
quickly look at that in action let's
execute this build command once again
but this time let's use this extract CSS
option and set this to false so this is
going to generate a prod bail but this
time the global styles are going to be
in a file with dot J's extension
well completed now if we take another
look with the test folder notice the
Styles are present in a file with dot
J's extension next we have minification
and uglification a prod bail is both
minified and a glyph ID whereas the dev
bail is not first let's understand what
both these terms mean so what is
minification it's a process of removing
excessive white spaces comments and any
optional token
like curly brackets and semicolons adla
fication is the process of transforming
code to use short variable and function
names we use both these techniques to
reduce the bundle sizes now to
understand minification and uglification
let's flip over to visual studio code we
have our routing demo project here
that's open the home component and with
no home component class I'm going to
introduce a function and there's a
pretty straightforward function we named
it add numbers as the name implies this
is going to add two numbers the first
parameter is called first number second
parameter is called second number and
this function returns a number that is
the sum of those two numbers within the
body
we have created a constant which holds
the sum of first and second number and
finally we are returning that result and
then I'm also going to introduce a
comment here let's call this my
constructor so let's save these changes
and then let's do a build let's do a dev
build first weld completed now let's go
take another look at that dist folder
this main bundle contains the code that
we have written so let's open that with
notepad and then search for our comment
my constructor notice we still have our
comment there and also notice the code
is very much readable I didn't remove
any of the white spaces and if you look
at our add numbers function look at
these parameters first number and second
number they are not renamed and same is
the case with this variable result it's
not renamed as well so with a terrible
we don't get minification and
uglification but a better prod
we do now let's do a prod bill and see
how things are going to change but
before that let's close this notepad and
then let's go back to our console and
execute this in jebel command
but - - prod option there we go
our production build is complete now
let's take another look at that test
folder let's open our main bundle file
with notepad first of all notice the
code here it's not very much readable
because it has removed all the excessive
white spaces let's see if we still have
our comment my constructor notice we are
not able to find a comment that means it
has been removed and let's look at our
add numbers function so here is our add
numbers function look at the function
parameters first number and second
number are renamed to L and then
respectively and within the function
body notice we don't have our result
variable at all it has rewritten that to
return the sum of L and n that is our
first number and second number so this
proves that with the production build we
get both minification
and uglification next we have
tree-shaking a prod build is tree shaked
whereas a dev build is not so what do we
mean by tree shaking it's the process of
removing any code that we are not
actually using within our application
from the final bundle it's one of the
most effective techniques to reduce our
application size to understand tree
shaking I'm going to create a new
component so I'm going to slip to a
command prompt window and then generate
a new component so let's use this
command ng G C let's name or component X
X X our component is generated
successfully now let's flip to visual
studio code we have a component right
here let's look at the view template of
this component which is right here and
there's the message that the view
component displays xxx works
at the moment we are not referencing
this new component anywhere within our
application first let's do a dev build
bell complete now let's take another
look at that test folder we have our
main bundle here so let's open this with
notepad one more time and let's search
for this message ex ex ex works now we
know there's a new component but we are
not referencing it anywhere within our
application but notice within the final
bundle they still have that new
component code right here
we know a dev Bell is not reshaped so
the code that we are not actually using
within our application is still there in
the final bundle now let's see how
things are going to change with prod
well let's do a production bills now
let's close this notepad first and let's
go back to the console and then do a
prod well bailed complete now let's take
another quick look at that main bundle
here it is let's open it with notepad
and let's search for that message once
again xxx works notice we don't have
that component at all so we know a prod
Bell is tree-shaped meaning any code
that you are not actually using within
our application is removed from the
final bundle there's one of the most
effective techniques to reduce our
application size next we have a ot
ahead-of-time compilation with a
production build we get a ot compliation
that is the angular component templates
are precompiled whereas for the
development build they are not in our
next video we'll discuss a ody
compilation in detail finally let's
quickly summarize the differences
between a dev build and a prod bell with
the dev build we get source Maps whereas
with a prod world we don't with a dev
build we don't have minification and
uglification tree-shaking and ahead of
time compilation with a broad belt we
get all of those in our next video we'll
discuss a OT in detail thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
