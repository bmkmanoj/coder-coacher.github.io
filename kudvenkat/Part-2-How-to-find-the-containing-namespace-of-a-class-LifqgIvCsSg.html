in this video well discuss how to find
the containing namespace of a class
sometimes we know the name of the class
that we want to use but we don't
remember the name of the namespace to
which the class belong in Visual Studio
it's easy enough to find the namespace
to which a class belong simply type the
name of the class and then use control
dot keystrokes let's understand this
with an example here I have a new
console application and let's save it in
the main method we want to use sequel
connection class in general we use
sequel connection class they establish a
connection to sequel server now since we
don't know the namespace to which the
sequel connection class belong and that
being the reason we are not using the
required using declaration right here
and because of that we have a
compilation error and what is the
compilation error saying the type or
namespace named sequel connection could
not be found
are you missing a using directive or an
assembly reference so how do we resolve
this now one way is when I move the
cursor here look at underneath the
letter S you have a blue rectangle and
if you hover the mouse over that you
have options so the first option here is
telling okay this sequel connection
class belong to system dot data dot
sequel client namespace and when you use
this option it's going to automatically
pop in that using declaration at the top
of the file look at that using system
dot data dot signal client and we have
the compilation error gone that's one
way let's look at the other options so
to get that menu you can either hover
the mouse over that blue rectangle or if
you like using keyboard simply plus
control dot and and you'll be present
with the same menu so if you select this
second option what is it going to do it
is going to fully qualify the name of
the class so basically sequel connection
class belong to systems or data or
sequel client namespace so when I select
this it's going to use that fully
qualified name let's look at the other
options that we have so we also have an
option to generate a class so when we
select this option what is it going to
do
it is going to generate a new class with
name sequel connection so let's select
that option and see what's going to
happen look at that it has created a
file called sequel connection dot CS and
within that we have got this class
sequel connection and within the main
method we are actually using that sequel
connection class so keep in mind this is
not the dotnet framework sequel
connection class
it is our custom type okay so let's go
ahead and delete that and let's look at
the last option that we have
so plus control dot again so the last
option is to generate a new type so when
we select this option we will be
presented with this generate new type
dialog box so here you can generate any
type so do you want to generate a class
structure interface or an enum and when
I select a structure so it's going to
automatically create a structure with
that name sequel connection and it's
going to create a new file sequel
connection dot CS so when I click OK so
there will be another file generator and
within that we have that structure so
let's go and delete that so you have
those four options basically so when you
press control dot you know you will
automatically come to know the namespace
to which that last belong but for this
feature to work there are two conditions
that we need to meet the first one is
obviously the name of the class is case
sensitive meaning in sequel connection
class that's present in system data dot
sequel client namespace s and C are
capital now if I use small letter C
instead of capital letter C and then
when I press control dot look at that it
doesn't tell me the namespace to which
the class belong it only gives me
options to generate a class or to
generate a new type okay so it has to be
the correct casing and another thing is
the assembly to which the class belong
must be referenced so now we know that
the sequel connection belong to system
dot data dot sequel client namespace and
that namespace is present in system dot
data assembly and that assembly is
referenced now since that assembly is
referenced a
using the correct casing now when I
press control dot I will come to know
the namespace to which this class belong
okay now if I don't have the reference
to this assembly if we remove that and
now when I press control dot look at
that again it doesn't tell us the
namespace to which this class belong
okay so for this feature to work these
two conditions must be met the assembly
to which the class belong must be
referenced the name of the class is
case-sensitive that's it for today thank
you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
