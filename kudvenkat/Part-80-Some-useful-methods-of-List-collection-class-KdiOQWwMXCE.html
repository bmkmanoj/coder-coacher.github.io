this video we'll discuss some useful
methods of list collection class this is
continuation to part 79 so please watch
about 79 before proceeding with this
video in this video we'll be discussing
these three functions true for all as
read only trim excess let's look at true
for all this method returns true or
false depending on whether if every
element within the list matches the
conditions that are defined by the
specified predicate let's understand
this with an example we'll be using this
customer class that we have been working
with in the previous sessions and within
the main method we are creating an
instance I mean three instances of this
customer class customer one customer 2
and customer 3 and then here we have a
list of customers and then to that list
we are adding the three customer objects
ok let's look at using this true for all
method now let's say I want to check if
all the customer objects within the list
have got a salary of 5,000 how do we
normally do that we loop through each
customer object and then check their
salary but instead of that we can use
this true for all function and then
specify our condition here so true for
all let's pass the predicate X such that
X dot salary greater than 5,000 and if
you look at this true for all method
what is it returning it's returning a
boolean true or false
ok so if all the objects within that
list matches that condition this method
returns true otherwise it returns false
so let's actually print the message
console dot readline or all
salaries greater than five thousand
all right so let's go ahead and run this
and if you look at the customer objects
that we have here this customer one
object has got a salary less than five
thousand so not all objects meeting that
condition
so let's false on the other hand if we
say are all salaries greater than 3000
and then let's change this condition to
3000 so are all these customer objects
having salary greater than 3000 that's
true so let's go ahead and run this now
true for all it should return true okay
so very handy method in case if you want
to check if all the elements of a
collection matches your conditions
alright another useful function is this
as a read-only so this function returns
a read-only wrapper for the current
collection now we use this method if we
don't want the client code to modify the
collection that is we don't want the
client code to add or remove any
elements from that collection so the
Vidonic collection will not have methods
to add a remove items from the
collection you can only lead items from
this collection let's understand this
with an example at the moment if you
look at this list customers okay so this
collection has got add method so
basically you can use this method and
add a customer object similarly if you
want to remove a customer object there
are several ways you can use remove
removal remove it etc so basically this
collection is allowing you to modify the
collection that is you can add and
remove elements okay but then let's say
our requirement is such that we are
going to pass a collection object to you
know some of the client application and
that we don't want that application to
be modifying our collection of thoughts
you are requirement then you can use
this as a read-only method on this
collection and if you look at what this
method is returning it is returning a
read-only collection object okay so look
at that read-only collection of customer
ok and if this read-only collection
class is present in system dot object
collection store table jekt model name
space so make sure you have included
that namespace and so what are we
getting back we are only we are getting
a read-only collection of customer and
maybe let's call this read-only
customers equals that and if you look at
this collection look at that I don't
have ADD method
similarly I don't have remove or remove
all any of those methods which allows
you know to add or remove elements from
the collection okay but then you can
retrieve the items from the collection
using the index look at that I can pass
an index and look at what it is
returning it's returning a customer
object back okay again if you look at
the implementation of this index ax
it has got only the cat access of
meaning you can only retrieve an item
from this collection but you cannot set
an item meaning you cannot replace an
existing item within that collection
okay but then you can retrieve the items
definitely similarly if you want to get
the count you can use the count property
so let's say we want to print the total
count of items within the collection we
can simply say items equals whatever is
the count let's see if we get that you
know the read-only collection should
also have three elements within that
look at that we get that three elements
all right
so very useful function the other method
that we will discuss is trim access so
what is this method going to do it's
going to set the capacity to the actual
number of elements in the list if that
number is less than a threshold value so
basically if you look at this list when
we have created this list we you have
used a constructor you know where we
have set the initial capacity to four
but let's set the initial capacity to
hundred so at the moment we have said
the capacity of this list 200 but how
many elements do we have within the list
we have only three elements now let's go
ahead and print the capacity and to
print the capacity list
customers capacity property will give us
the capacity of that list let's go and
print that using console dot write line
and let's say capacity before trimming
that is before invoking the trim access
function okay so let's go ahead and run
this now and look at the capacity
so what's capacity capacity is 100 at
the moment
okay now let's invoke trim access
function and what is this method going
to do it's going to set the capacity to
the actual number of elements how many
actual number of elements do we have
within the list 3 so it's going to set
the capacity to that number
after we invoke this function so
capacity after trimming let's run this
look at that capacity before to make it
100 but capacity after trimming is 3 so
what is the advantage of invoking this
method this method can be used to
minimize a collections memory overhead
if we know that we are not going to add
new elements to that collection and the
but then one thing that we have to keep
in mind is the cost of reallocating and
copying a large list can be considerable
so basically what is this trim access
function doing here here we have set the
capacity to hundred while we have only
three elements within the list okay so
when we invoke this trim excess what it
has done is it has reallocated and
copied all those elements okay so that
now the list capacity is only three okay
so this can improve the performance of
our application a bit but then if I have
100 I mean if we have set the capacity
to 100 and if we already have 90
elements and then when we invoke trim
access and if it has to do that
reallocation again then that process
will be much expensive than the
performance gain that we get that's why
the threshold value at the moment
according to MSDN is 90% so if the list
has you know the capacity of 90% already
full then invoking
trim access is going to do nothing okay
so that's something that has to be kept
in mind but the threshold of 90% can
change in the future all right that's it
for today thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
