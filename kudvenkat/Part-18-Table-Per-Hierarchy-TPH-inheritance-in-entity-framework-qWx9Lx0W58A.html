tutorial in this video we'll discuss
implementing table pair hierarchy
inheritance in entity framework the
database first approach will be using
this employees table in this demo now
this table is used to store both
permanent and contract employee details
now if we take permanent employee its
usual for permanent employees to have
annual salary hourly pay and hours
worked are not relevant to permanent
employee if it a contract employee they
usually have hourly pay and hours work
but annual salary is not relevant for
them however these columns ID first name
last name and gender are common for both
the employees now when we use ad
identity framework and generate an
entity based on this table by default
it's going to generate one entity as you
can see here let's look at that in
action now I have already created the
employee's table it is the sequel script
that can do it I will have the script
available on my blog in case you need it
now let's flip to visual studio here I
have an empty SP dotnet web application
project to this project let's add a new
item and we want to add a do dot
identity data model and let's call this
employee model we want to generate the
model from the database and let's save
the connection string as employee
dbcontext so this is going to connect to
the database and retrieve all the tables
views and stored procedures so let's
select the employees table and click
finish so this should generate the
employee entity based on that employee's
table and if you notice by default we
get one entity now let's say in our
organization we have two types of
employees permanent employee and
contract employees now what we want is
instead of this one entity we want to
have you know three entities because
from an application perspective you know
when we are working with permanent
employees we want to create an instance
of permanent employee class similarly
when we are working with contract
employees we want to create an instance
of contract employee class
okay so for that purpose we want to
divide this one entity you know this one
employee entity into three entities as
you can see here so the employee entity
that's going to be the base abstract
class so we want this employee class to
be an abstract class because our
organization has just two types of
employees permanent employee or contract
employee okay we don't have any other
type of employees now this base class
here is going to contain the properties
that are common for both the employees
ID first name last name gender so
they're going to be present in this
employee class and this employee class
is going to be an abstract class because
we don't want developers to be
inadvertently creating instances of this
base abstract no base class that's why
let's make it an abstract class and then
you know we make contract employee class
which is going to derive from the
template class and this class should
have only the properties relevant to
contract employee in this case hourly
pay and hours work all the other
properties it's going to inherit from
the base class similarly we need another
entity here permanent employee and this
is going to have properties relevant to
permanent employee in this case only
annual salary all the other common
properties are going to be inherited
from the base class so let's see how to
achieve this hierarchy now in spite of
having you know an inheritance hierarchy
here we still want this data to be
stored in the same table so that's what
table per hierarchy inheritances all
about in tph inheritance that is table
per hierarchy inheritance one database
table is used to store data for all the
entity types in the entire inheritance
hierarchy okay so let's look at this in
action so let's flip to visual studio so
we need two more entities so the first
step is obviously to add an entity and
let's call this permanent employee okay
now for this entity the base type is
going to be employee which is this
entity now look at this as soon as I
have selected that base type all the
other options that
table here because by default it's going
to get the ID which is the key from the
employee entity and similarly all the
other you know properties which are
present in the base class are going to
be automatically derived by this
permanent employee so let's click OK so
there we have the permanent employee
look at that there is this arrow mark
indicating that inheritance relationship
and you know look at this little arrow
right here which is pointing towards
employee so basically this indicates
that this is a derived type from this
employee entity okay and what are the
properties that are specific to
permanent employee annual salary so
let's cut that and paste it within
permanent employee and similarly let's
add another entity and let's call that
contract employee and again for this the
base type is going to be employee so
let's click OK so we have contract
employee here and again contract
employee what are the property specific
to it hourly pay and hours worked so
select both of them cut those properties
and then paste them within contract
employee okay so we have the employee
base entity and permanent employee and
contract employee entities are deriving
from that base entity now at this moment
if we try to validate the model we will
get some validation errors now look at
this entity type contract employee is
not mapped similarly permanent employee
is not mapped all we have done so far is
move the properties to the respective
entities but then you know if you look
at this employee entity if we go to
table mapping option look at this
employee is mapped to basically
employees table
okay so employee entity is mapped to
employees table we have ID first name
last name gender you know columns map to
those respective properties and
similarly discriminate a map to
discriminate a property but annals early
hours Li pey and others work you know
they are not present in this entity
that's why they are not map
to the employees table from there now
annual salary is present in permanent
employee entity so we need to map that
property to a table column so
right-click on the entity and select
table mapping and here we need to map
permanent employee to the same table
which is employees now notice that
annual salary is automatically mapped to
annual salary property okay and
similarly we need to map the contract
employee properties to the respective
columns of the employee table to do that
right click table mapping and select
employees table and notice that hourly
pay and hours work column sum map to the
respective properties ok now at this
point if we try to validate this model
look at that we have an error which says
you know employee permanent employee and
contract employee or being mapped to the
same row in table employees ok
so mapping conditions can be used to
distinguish the rows that these types
are mapped to so now we are mapping all
these three entities to the same
employees table now we need to tell the
entity framework when an employee can
become a contract employee
similarly when an employee can become a
permanent employee the first thing that
we need to do here is we don't want you
know end users to be creating not end
users I mean the developers to be
creating instances of this employee
class accidentally so we want to make
this an abstract class and to do that
let's go to the properties of that
entity and here we have this abstract
property just turn that to true so now
this is an abstract class or nobody will
be able to create an instance of this
class this is just there to act as a
base type for these two you know classes
that we have here now now we need to
tell entity framework when an employee
can become a permanent employee and
similarly when an employee can be
contract employee now if you look at the
data that we have here let's actually
look at that in slides so if you look at
this is the column that determines
whether if an employee is a permit
employer contract employee if the
discriminator columns its permanent
employee then he is a permanent employee
otherwise he is a contract employee okay
so this is the column based on which we
determine whether if an employee is a
permanent employer a contract employee
and that's what we need to tell the
entity framework and the way we do that
is by conditional mapping so we go to
table mapping again so this is permanent
employee so what we're going to do here
is map this discriminator column
so when discriminator equals you know
this txt permanent employee that's when
an employee is a permanent employee
okay and similarly let's go to contract
employee and then map the discriminator
column so when discriminator is equal to
this text contract employee then that
employee is a contract employee okay
so we are using that discriminator
column to determine whether if an
employee is a permanent employee or a
contract employee at this point if we
validate the model we are still going to
get another error that is basically
because we are using this discriminated
column in conditional binding in both of
these entities and we are also using it
in the property mapping keep in mind a
column can be mapped only once since we
are already using the discriminator
column and conditional mapping we cannot
use it again the property mapping an
employee entity so we need to delete
that so let's go and delete it now let's
validate this one and look at that
validation completed okay so now we have
three entities but still the data is
stored in a single table now let us see
how to actually query the data and
display that in a webform now what we
want to do is design a webform like this
we are going to have a radio button list
but these three options load all
employees load permanent and contract
employees now when we select load
permanent employees it should only load
the permanent employees
and similarly when this electrode
contract employees only contract and if
we select load all employees it should
be loading all the employees let's see
how to achieve this so first of all
let's go and design the waveform so to
this project let's add a new item and we
want to add a webform let's quickly set
you know the style attribute here and
let's set font family to the area and
let's drag and drop a grid view control
onto this webform and then we also need
a radio button list so let's drag and
drop the radio button list and for this
radio button list we need those three
options so let's say here text is load
or load permanent employees and let's
say value equals permanent okay
similarly we need to have list items for
you know load all employees and load
contract employees to speed things up I
have already typed the required code so
let's copy and paste it within visual
studio so here I actually have load
permanent employees load contract
employees let's actually change this to
load all employees and let's say the
value is all okay let's format this
probably alright and let's set the auto
post web property to true for the radio
button list so that it cable
automatically post back when we when the
selection changes
let's auto format this and choose the
colorful scheme and when the selected
index changed what we need to do now we
have the employee dbcontext class so
let's go ahead and create an instance of
that class equals new employee dbcontext
and then we are going to use switch
statement here so we are going to switch
on the radio button list one selected
value so case so when the selected value
within the radio button list if it is
for example you know permanent then what
we want to do we want to load only
permanent employees so I'm going to use
employee dbcontext here and then it has
got employees properties which is going
to return all the employees but we don't
want all the employees we want only the
permanent employees so here we can use
this off type okay and then what type of
employees we want we want only permanent
employees and then let's convert that to
list so that is going to be the data
source for the grid view control so grid
view one dot data source equals that and
then invoke data bind method and a break
similarly we need to have case
statements for you know contract and you
know to load all employees and again
just to speed things up I have typed the
code here so let's copy and paste it
right there so here you know if the
selected value is contract employee then
we are loading only contract employees
on the other hand if it's not permanent
or contract then it's going to be all
employees in which case we are loading
all employees and calling the data bind
method
so with these let's save all the changes
and let's go ahead and run the project
and see if we get the output that we
expect ok so when I say load all
employees look at that we get all the
employees and we say load permanent
employees we get only the permanent
employees look at the annual salary
column and when we say load contract
employees we only get the contract
employees look at the hourly pay and
hours work now let's say when I select
load all employees I
all the columns for example you know
hourly pay others booked and you know
even annual salary if that's the case
then we need to write an awesome code
within the code behind file because look
at this when we select all the employees
now it's the list of abstract types it
is returning and if you look at the
employee entity it has got only these
properties ID first name last name
gender and that's what is displayed by
default but if you want other properties
of the derived types that is you know
hourly pay others work from code form
contract employee an annual salary from
from permanent employee then you need to
cast the employee type to those
respective types if they are of that
type and then retrieve those respective
properties and then bind that to the
greater grip you control now to speed
things up I have you know written a
private method which can do that so let
me copy and paste this within the code
behind fire and then we'll quickly go
over the code now this is not entity
frame related to entity framework it's
it's pure dotnet code I mean all we are
doing here is making this private method
return a data table now data table is
present in system dot data in space so
let's go ahead and bring that in
okay so what we are doing here is to
this method convert employees for
display by passing list of employee
objects okay and then we are
constructing the data table so this data
table is going to have all these columns
ID first name last name gender you know
all the columns that are present
basically within this employees table
okay so we are adding all those columns
to that data table and then whatever
list that gets passed into this method
we are looping through each employee
object within that list and then we are
creating a new row based on the data
table that we have created right here
and then we are populating you know
column values for ID first name last
name and gender okay they are common for
both you know permanent employee and
contract employee so we are doing it
here and then we are checking ok this
employee object that we are talking
about is it permanent employee if it's
permanent employee then typecast it to
be of type permanent employee retrieve
the value for annual salary property and
store it in this column of the data that
we have created and set the type of the
employee to permanent ok if it is not
permanent employee then we know it is
going to be contract employee in that
case type gasps the employee type to
contract employee retrieve hourly pay
and hours worked stored in the
respective columns set the type to
contract and then finally add that row
to the data table okay once we have
looped through all the employees you
know all the rows are added to the data
table return the data table so very
simple private function here and what we
are going to do is use this private
function in our switch statement so when
the selection changes if it's default
you are going to get the list of
employees so this list pass it to this
private function so that's the name of
the function
so this expects list of employees and
this is returning list of employees and
once you pass that list this is
and create a data table based on that
list and then return that which is going
to be the data source for the grid view
control now let's run this there are
some build errors let's look at that
that's because of this text let's get
rid of that one there oops
alright let's go and run this now load
all employees look at that now we get
all the columns from the underlying data
base table at this point let's actually
fire up sequel profiler and see the
queries that are generated behind the
scenes so let's run the trace so first
let's select contract employees
permanent employees and load all
employees now let's go stop the trace
and look at the queries look at the
query right here so it's loading all the
columns ID first name last name gender
of alle payables work you know from this
table and look at the way condition
we're discriminator equals contract
employee because that's the column we're
using in order to check whether if an
employee is a permanent employee or not
and this query is automatically
generated by the entity framework ok and
when we selected component employees
look at that there discriminator equals
permanent employee and when we selected
this all button then it has generated
this query look at that
we're discriminator n permanent employee
comma contract employee
alright so that is table per hierarchy
inheritance that's at the tray thank you
for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
