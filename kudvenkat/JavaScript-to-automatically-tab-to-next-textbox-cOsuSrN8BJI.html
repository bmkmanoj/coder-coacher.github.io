asp.net tutorial in this video we'll
discuss how to automatically move the
cursor from one text box to another
using javascript let's understand this
with an example let's say we have a web
page like this to capture credit or
debit card numbers usually there are 16
digits in a credit or debit card number
on this page we have got four text boxes
each text box should allow four numbers
so once I type the first four numbers of
the credit card into the first text box
we want to move the cursor automatically
to the second text box look at this once
I type the first three characters the
cursor is still blinking in the first
text box but the moment I type the
fourth digit look at what's going to
happen to the cursor it will be
automatically moved to the second text
box similarly once we type the second
four digits the cursor will move to the
third text box and from there it will
move to the fourth text box so let's see
how to achieve this using javascript
let's flip to visual studio so here I
have an empty asp.net web application
project which I have added this waveform
on this platform let's include this
little text card number and let's drag
and drop a text box control let's change
the ID of the text box to txt 1 and
let's add the width of the text box 250
pixels and let's set max length
attribute to 4 because we only want to
allow 4 digits
let's make 3 more copies of this text
box let's change the ID of the second
text box to txt 2 and third text box to
txt 3 and fourth text box to txt for now
let's include a section for JavaScript
let's write a JavaScript function let's
name this move cursor and this function
is going to have two parameters from
text box and to text box let's create a
variable let's name this length equals
from textbox dot value dot length let's
create another variable let's name this
max length equals from text box dot get
attribute so basically we want to read
these max length attribute so get
attribute and the name of the attribute
is max length if lend equals max length
okay so what are we telling with this
condition now the number of characters
that are typed into this text box for
example if the length is equal to max
length in this example 4 then we want to
move the cursor to the next text box so
if length equals max length we want to
set the focus to 2 text box so document
dot get element by ID and the ID is to
textbox dot call focus method which is
going to set the keyboard focus to this
two text box and all that is left now is
to call this javascript function on key
up event so on key up event of the first
text box we want to call this move
cursor javascript function and from text
box is going to be you know the this txt
one text box itself so I'm going to use
this keyword and two text box is going
to be txt too okay so let's set this
attribute for the second text box as
well so from the second text box we want
to move the cursor to the third text box
and from the third text box we want to
move it to the fourth text box and we
don't have to set this you know on key
app attribute on the fourth text box
because we don't want to move the text
cursor anywhere from the fourth text box
automatically so we are not going to
call this function on the fourth text
box so with all these changes let's go
ahead and run this page and look at this
the moment I type the first four digits
the cursor automatically moves and
similar their second four digits and the
third four digits and finally the fourth
four digits thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
