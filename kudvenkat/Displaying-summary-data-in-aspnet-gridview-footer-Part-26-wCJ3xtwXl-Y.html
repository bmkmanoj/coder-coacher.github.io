venket this is part 26 of asp.net view
tutorial in this video we'll discuss
about displaying summary data in asp.net
grid view footer row on this slide you
can see a grid view control displaying
some product related information
notice that we have unit price and
quantity sold columns and notice that in
the footer row we have total unit price
and total quantity sold let's look at
how to display the summary information
within the grid view footer row first
let's look at retrieving this data from
the stable TBL product and then display
that within the grid view control that's
a drag and drop in Creede we control
onto this waveform let's sort of format
that let's choose brown sugar scheme
let's drag and drop sequel data source
control onto this waveform now here we
are using sequel data source control to
retrieve data you know it doesn't really
matter how you retrieve your data you
may be using object data source or you
may not be using data source controls at
all you know because we are going to
make use of raw data bound event to
compute totals and then display them
within the grid view footer row so it
doesn't really matter how you retrieve
your data okay so it's going to work
with with all all data retrieval
techniques
so first let's configure the sacral
datasource control select your
connection string from web config file
click Next
let's select our table TBL product let's
click Next test our query click finish
now let's associate this equal
datasource control with this grid view
at this point if we run this page you
know as you might expect you know the
grid view should display product related
information okay so what we basically
want to do is we want to loop through
each row and then sum up the unit price
and quantity sold and then display that
within the footer row of this grid view
control okay
now so to loop through each row which
even of the grid view control can I make
use of this grid view control actually
supports an event called row data bound
so if you go to the properties of this
grid view control there is an event
called raw data bound this event is
fired every time a row is data bound
with the script control ok from the data
source so the data source here is sequel
data
source control so every time a draw from
this data source is bound to this grid
view control you know this event is
raised so for example if I have ten rows
within my sequel data data source
control you know this event will be
raised ten times remember this event is
also raised for the header and footer as
well okay
so first let's generate the even handler
for the Cvent row data bound event so I
have this event handler here now let's
write the code so what do we need to do
basically we need to loop through each
row so that's why we are using this row
data bound event okay so first time when
this row is rendered I mean when this
even is raised it will be raised for the
header okay so we don't want to do
anything when this event is raised for
this header okay but when it comes to
this data row you know that's why we are
checking if a dot Rho dot row type is
data row meaning these data rows then
what we want to do we want to retrieve
this unit price and that's what this
data binder dot eval is doing look at
that retrieve the unit price for that
row and then we are converting that to
an integer and then adding it using this
variable so that we are going to have
this total unit price variable defined
which is going to sum up you know all
the unit price and along the same lines
we are going to sum up total quantity
sold okay so it's exactly similar and we
are doing it only the route type is data
row okay on the other hand you know once
we have finished looping through each
row finally you know we'll come to the
footer and in the footer what we need to
do if the row type is foot up because
remember raw data bound the event is
also raised for footer so if it is a
footer row then we want to display this
word grand total in this cell okay now
this name cell is actually second cell
because I mean first cell because cell
index starts from 0 so product ID is
cell 0
this is cell 1 cell 2 and cell 3 okay so
in cell 1 we want to display grand total
so I am saying Eid or true dot cells of
1 the text is equal to grant order and I
want to bold that so we are setting that
bold property to true and similarly in
this cell we want to
a total unit price since that is an
integer we need to convert that to
string and then we want to pull that and
we are doing the same thing for total
quantity sold in this column okay let's
actually write this code and see if it's
going to work so and just to speed
things up I'm I have this code already
typed so I'm going to copy that and
paste it within our event handler method
obviously now we will have some
compilation errors because we need to
declare these two variables integer
variables which are going to hold the
totals so I'm going to declare them as
integers total unit price let's
initialize them to 0 and along the same
lines let's get total quantity sold
that's also going to be integer and
let's initialize that to 0 all right now
with this change let's go ahead and run
this as you might expect the footer row
should display the totals ok look at
this why is it not displaying the totals
because you know by default the footer
row of the grid view control is not
visible okay so we need to turn on the
visibility of that and to do that all
you need to do is go to the properties
of the grid view control and then there
is a property called @ show Fuda just
set that to true all right let's run
that now look at that the footer is
visible there now and look at this why
is it saying grand total is equal to 0
for both of them ok that's because you
know this is a common mistake that we
usually do because remember Roda bound
event is raised for every row ok and
look at maybe have defined our variables
within that event so what's going to
happen every time this event is raised
these variables are reset to 0 so this
event is raised for footer as well also
by the time it comes to futa you know
what it is going to do it's going to set
that unit price I mean total unit price
to 0 and then within the footer row
there is you know the value is going to
be 0 there's no value so it remains 0 ok
so that's why these variables need to be
defined outside of this event because
this event is going to be raised for
every every time for every data row and
for a four header and footer as well
so every time this event is raised we
are resetting them to zero so now if we
run this it's going to work as expected
okay look at that we have the total unit
price and total quantity sold as
expected all right on this slide you can
find resources for asp.net c-sharp and
sequence of interview questions that's
it for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
