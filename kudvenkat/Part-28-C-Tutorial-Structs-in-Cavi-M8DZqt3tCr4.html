rankled this is part 28 structures and
c-sharp in this session we'll learn
about structs in part 19 of this video
series we had an introduction to classes
and we have learned that a class can
have private fields public drop these
constructors methods just like classes a
struct can also have all of these let's
look at an example to create a class for
example if I want to create a customer
class I use the class keyword let's say
I want to create a customer structure
then I use a struct keyword and create
that customer structure and let me know
that a class can have private fields
similarly as structure can also have
private fields let's say in this example
of a customer structure is going to have
a private integer field and a private
name feel you know string feel so
private and under school ID and private
string under school name okay and to
encapsulate these fields a class can
have you know property similarly a
structure can also have properties so to
create a property for ID private field
how do we do that we create a public
property since ID is an integer field
the property needs to be an integer and
the name of the property may be ID and
then I get accessor which will just
return
this dot on the school ID and we need to
have a set accessor as well which will
set the value for ID field so this under
school ID is equal to value okay so
that's the property for the ID field
now we similarly we need to create a
property for the name field and to do
that we don't have to actually type we
can he use the refactoring capabilities
of Visual Studio and to do that you can
actually right click on the property I'm
in the private field and select refactor
and then here you can select and
capsulate field and when you click OK
you will get you know what do you want
to name the property you know it's
intelligent enough you know to give it
the same name as that of your feel with
a capital N and when you click OK that's
going to give you a preview of how your
property is going to look like so your
property is going to look like has not
generated it's going to generate that
for us so apply and it has generated
that property for us so this property
implements this field and this property
implements I mean encapsulate this feel
okay so our structure now has got
private fields and public properties so
a class can also have a constructor to
initialize the class fields similarly
its structure also can have a
constructor to initialize this structure
fields okay so and we know that a class
constructor will have the same name as
that of a class okay similarly a
structure constructor will have the same
name as that of the structure so public
and we know that a constructor cannot
have a return type so public customer
and we pass in two parameters into this
constructor which can be used to
initialize these two private fields so
we end maybe ID and strained
name so we use those two parameters to
initialize the private fields of the
structures this dot underscore ID is
equal to ID the parameter that is coming
in and similarly this Jordan screw name
is equal to the name parameter that's
coming into our constructor okay and
just like if you know just like how
classes can have methods our structures
also can have methods and let's say I
want a method in the structure which can
print the customer details you know I
want this method to be able to print the
ID and the name of this customer so to
do that let's create a public method
public wide and let's call this print
details and what is this method going to
do it's going to print the customer ID
and the name so console.writeline
ID is equal to placeholder and name is
equal to another placeholder so in the
first placeholder I want to replace that
with an ID and maybe the second place
holder I want to replace that with a
name okay that's it we have created our
structure now if you look at this it's
actually very very similar to a class
the only difference that you can spot
here is that we are using a struct
keyword instead of the class keyword if
it was a class keyword then it would
have been a customer class since it's a
struct key well then this is a customer
structure now let's see how to use this
structure now to create an instance of a
class let's say for example I have
customer class to create an instance
with this customer class I will say
customer c1 is equal to new customer and
to create an instance of a structure you
follow the exact same syntax so we have
a customer structure here and to create
an instance of that I say customer c1 is
equal to new customer so here we are
creating an instance of the structure
and look at this we have
a constructor for this structure which
takes in two parameters and we use those
parameters to initialize these two
structural private fields so let's say
my customers ID is going to be 1 0 1 and
name is going to be mark so we
initialize this structure and if I want
to print the details of this customer
I will just say C 1 dot print details
and if we go ahead and run this it
should print the ID and the name of our
customer now in c-sharp 3.0 you know
they have introduced a new syntax to
actually create an instance your class
and it's called object initializers and
x actually you know this is one way to
create your customer object and another
way is we can say customer c2 is equal
to new customer and we are using the
default constructor now when I say c2
dot print details look at what's going
to happen when I run this c2 customer ID
0 and name is empty because why we have
not initialized this customer feels so
let's go ahead and initialize them and
another way of doing it is we can use
the public properties that we have
created we know that this customer has
an ID public property so let's say 1 0 2
and similarly it has got a name property
and maybe I want to initialize this to
John now if we go ahead and run this
program what's going to happen is it's
going to print the ID and the name of
the second customer as well what's the
difference between these two
instantiations here we are using that
constructor and passing in these two
packages directly into that constructor
and here what we are doing we are
actually using the default constructor
and we are using the properties of the
structure to initialize those fields
okay and then we are printing the
details now instead of having so much
you know you have to create an object
and then again you have to say C 2 dot
ID easy to load name what you can do is
you can use the object initializers and
tags okay
so let's create another customer
to Mercy 3 is equal to new customer and
a semicolon there and then you can say
ID is equal to maybe 1 0 3 and name is
equal to maybe Rob okay you see that
this is you know much less typing rather
than creating the object and then using
object dot you can use this shorthand
notation this is called the object
initializer syntax which has got
introduced in c-sharp 3.0 and then as
usually if you want to print the details
of the third customer you can say C 3
dot print detail so now we have three
customers okay so that's it
so object initialize the syntax
introduced and C in c-sharp 3.0 can be
used to initialize either a structure or
a class so you can use this object
initializer syntax to initialize classes
as well okay so far we have looked at
the similarities between a structure and
a class but do however keep in mind
there are several differences between
classes structures which we'll be
looking at in the next video session now
if you look at this example it's exactly
similar to what we have written okay but
the left one is actually a class a
customer class and then the right one
it's a customer structure if you look at
the cool on the left and compare the
left to the right the only difference
that you'll spot is that here you're
using the class keyword on the left hand
side and on the right hand side you and
using the struct keyword other than that
the code is exactly similar okay but
however as I told you there are several
differences that's very very important
to know the differences between
structure and classes which we'll be
looking at in our next video session
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
