in this video we'll discuss rays views
index this is continuation to about 57
so please watch but 57 before proceeding
to comment something in rays of views we
use the syntax so at symbol and a strict
indicates the beginning of your comment
and then you can have you know as many
lines as you want in your comment it can
be a single line comment or a multi-line
comment and then to end the comment we
use asterisk and at symbol
let's look at that in action so this is
my comment now you know at the moment it
is treated as literal text so if we
refresh this view it's simply going to
print that text there but our intention
here is to actually treat that as a
comment so to indicate the beginning of
a comment we use add symbol and a strict
and then end of the comment as trick and
add symbol okay so we can also use this
icon right here to comment and uncomment
so I select you know the the lines that
I want to comment or uncomment and then
I can click on this icon to uncomment
and then click on this icon to comment
it or we can use this keyboard shortcut
ctrl K ctrl C to comment ctrl K control
u to uncomment so now since this is
commented if we save it and if we
refresh our view nothing will be printed
there all right now they may be
scenarios you know where we want to
transition between c-sharp expressions
and little text and in those cases we
don't have to do anything special raise
the views are smart enough to transition
between C sharp expressions and literal
text without v having to do anything
let's understand that with an example
now here you can see that we have three
variables of type integer
obviously day month India which are
holding the respective day and month and
year numbers let's say using these
variables I want to print the date in
this format so we want this literal text
date is and then we want to spit out the
values that are present in these
variables day month and year and it
between day month
yeah we want that literal text again you
know that - there you know date and
month separators okay so to achieve that
notice what we are doing so here first
of all we have some literal text date is
and then we want the value out of this
variable so we are using this key sub
expression at day and then again we want
that literal text so look at that we are
not doing anything special there okay
we're just putting that you know - there
and then again to retrieve the value out
of month variable we are simply saying
at month and then our literal text which
is - and then at ER and then we'll get
the output that we ask ex back let's
quickly look at that in action so ad and
then we want our variable in today let's
say 31 and let's say int month which is
going to be 12 and end here let's say
2012 and we want to print you know date
a so that's little tags and we want to
print day first so we're going to use at
day and then we want - and then at month
and then another - and then at ear so
save everything and let's refresh our
view we should get the date in the
format that we expect so date is you
know day month and year and then this
explicit code negate is extremely useful
especially when we want to do something
dynamically now let's understand this
example so I have these five images
what's the name of the images in a1 dot
PNG - dot PNG three dot PNG four and
five okay
so we have five images okay and then we
want to display them in a razor view and
then we want the output way like this so
we want to display all the five images
so I have them all today in this
directory in the root directory of our
MVC web application project so within
the images folder all the five images
are there okay so now we have to build
the image tag dynamic
okay so what we are doing here notice
that we are using a for loop from one to
five because the names of the images are
one dot PNG two dot PNG three dot PNG
until five dot PNG okay so we are using
a for loop to loop through you know
until five and then look at that we are
setting we are using an image tag okay
and then obviously we need to specify
the source attribute for the image tag
so we need to tell it where the image is
coming from so this source is going to
be within the images folder so we are
using the tilde symbol that tilde
indicates the root directory the root
directory is MVC demo so within the root
directory we have images folder so
that's the literal text till four slash
image so that's the part okay literally
the text that we are typing there and
then with an image is so we have another
forward slash there and then we have
this I variable which is going to carry
the numbers one two five
okay so first time it loops through it
has to be one dot PNG so one okay so to
retrieve the value out of that variable
they're using that explicit code nugget
here so add open the bracket and then
variable I and then the close the
bracket so this is going to take the
value out of that variable and then to
that it is going to concatenate dot PNG
because the image extension is dot PNG
okay so this code and I get explicit
code nugget here it's extremely useful
to dynamically determine the source
attribute of our image tag so this you
know code here is going to generate this
HTML for us so since we are looping
through five times you know there will
be five image tags generated and look at
the source attribute you know and we see
demo four slash images in our four slash
one dot PNG two three four and five
okay so let's actually look at that in
action so we already have the images
that we need so we're going to make use
of for loop so for int I is equal to 1 I
less than or equal to 5 I plus plus
and we want image tag there so image we
need to specify the source attribute so
source is going to be tilled which
indicates that route directly for slash
that's present in our images folder and
forward slash so we need the name of the
image and the name of the image is going
to be determined by this variable so if
I simply say at I and the dot P and J
okay so what it is going to do here is
it's going to look for a property called
P and G on that I but do we have that
variable no we don't they actually want
to concatenate our intention here is to
concatenate this one with whatever value
that is present in I if it is one in the
variable I then we want that to be one
dot PNG but then what it is doing here
is it is trying to look for a property
called P&amp;amp;J on that variable i okay so
that's not what we want we want to
concatenate the value with that dot P
and J so that's it so let's save it and
let's refresh this view and we should
say all the five images there and then
we right click and view page source
notice that the image tags are generated
as expected and we know that that's at
symbol is used as code delimiter and
race views it's what special meaning
okay but however razor is smart enough
to recognize the format of internet
email address and not to treat that ad
symbol in that email address as a code
delimiter for example let's say my
requirement is I want to print a message
like this this is my email address and
then my email address I want that to be
displayed in bold okay now notice that
obviously it's you know an email address
should have an @ symbol in it okay but
then when we use that statement inside a
razor view we know that that symbol has
got special meaning it's used you know
as a code delimiter to switch between
HTML and C sharp but then if we use that
as part of
internet email address razor view is
smart enough to not treat that as a code
delimiter but to treat that as simply a
printable character okay
let's actually look at that in action so
when I say this is my email address and
then let's put an HTML play and then
when I say could wankered at gmail.com
look at that I don't get any errors so I
simply save it and then i refresh this
view and it displays that email it is
there so razor view is pretty smart
there to identify that it's an email
address and not to treat that symbol as
code delimiter anymore but then there
are certain scenarios where razor view
is not smart enough to treat that as a
printable character when we want to
treat it as a printable character for
example let's say I want to print a
statement like this I will meet you at
office okay so how do we do that we
simply write it like this I will meet
you at office okay but then at this
point here these of you is going to
treat that as a code delimiter and then
when we navigate to the view we get an
exception you know there will be a
compilation error okay so our intention
here is to actually treat that as a
printable character meaning we want to
escape that and then you know print that
symbol there so what is the escape
sequence character for the @ symbol
another @ symbol so you simply precede
that with another @ symbol and then it
will be treated as a regular printable
character and not as a code delimiter
character save it refresh your view and
we get the author that we expect there
we go
I'll meet you at office all right

wintery questions that's it for today
