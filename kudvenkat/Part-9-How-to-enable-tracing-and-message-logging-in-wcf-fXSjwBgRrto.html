this video we'll discuss how to enable
tracing and message logging in WCF this
is continuation to Path 8 so please
watch part 8 before proceeding use the
Microsoft service configuration editor
tool to enable tracing and message
logging in WCF we can enable tracing and
message logging either on the client or
on the WCF service itself first let's
look at enabling it on the client let's
flip to visual studio we'll be using the
same application that we used in the
previous session if you recollect we
have used asp.net web application as the
client for the WCF service since this is
an asp.net web application we have web
config file and when I right-click on
this notice that I have this option edit
WCF configuration when we select that it
opens up the Microsoft service
configuration editor tool now in your
case when you right click if you don't
find that option then click on tools and
then select this option WCF service
configuration editor so this should
bring up the same tool but then it
doesn't open the config file of your
application so we need to point it to
the config file and in order to do that
click on file open and we want to open
the config file and where is the config
file present within this web application
so the name of the web application is
client and we have created the solution
within C Drive so the complete path is C
colon backslash client backslash client
the first folder is the solution folder
and the second folder is the actual web
application folder within that we have
webbed up config file and it should open
up in the tool now once you have open
the configuration editor through tools
option from that point you should have
this option added WC of configuration
when you right-click on the config file
I think that's a bug in Visual Studio
basically the first time when you try to
use it you know it doesn't show up that
option but once you have opened it up
using Tools menu from that point it
should be available when you right click
ok so let's select this option at the
WCF configuration
to enable tracing and message logging
click on the diagnostics folder under
configuration and then enable log Auto
flush option and then we want to enable
message locking so to do that click on
the link on the right hand side enable
message logging and look at what it has
done it has added a file with an
extension dot as we see log with in the
same directory as that of our config
file look at the path here C colon
backslash client backslash client so at
that part we have this Web underscore
messages dot SVC file so this is the log
file for logging the messages ok in a
similar fashion to enable tracing click
enable tracing and the moment we do that
there is another log file with the same
extension basically to log the trace
messages alright we need to do one more
little thing expand this Diagnostics
folder under that you should see message
logging option when you select the ad on
the right hand side log entire message
by default this option is false turn
that to true and then close the tool
itself it will prompt you whether if you
want to save the changes click yes so
what this has done is added the
configuration to the web config file
that's required to enable tracing and
message logging look at this under
configuration we have system door
Diagnostics element and underneath that
we have lot of configuration which
basically enables tracing and message
logging all right with this let's go and
run our WCF service and then let's run
the client
so let's enter an employee ID of one and
then click this button get employee now
if you recollect the message log and
trace log files are present in c colon
backslash client folder backslash client
so here i notice that we have two files
with dot SVC log extension and if you
look at the size you know it's a zero
clue byte so does that mean it didn't
write anything to this log files I think
we need to refresh this folder so let's
go and refresh that and look at that we
have some messages there so let's open
up the message log and to open the
message log you can simply double click
that and then it's going to open that
using a tool called Microsoft service
trace viewer now if you want to open
this tool there are other ways as well
you can click on start get to all
programs go to Microsoft Visual Studio
2010 and under Microsoft Windows SDK
tools you should see service trace
viewer there and if you're looking for
you know something to open it from the
command prompt then get to Visual Studio
command prompt so under Visual Studio
Tools you should see Visual Studio
command prompt there type SVC
trace viewer and then hit enter so that
should bring again the same tool ok or
you can simply double click on the log
file that has got that extension dot SVC
log it should automatically open with
the tool alright so we have the tool
there and then look at this that's one
of the traces and this is the message
log trace ok now let's look at this tab
message tab ok so both the request as
well as the response are logged ok so
this is the request message and look at
what we have sent as part of the request
there is a you know basically these are
soap messages so we have a soap envelope
there and within soap envelope we've got
a soup header
and then a soup body and within the soup
body we have caught the employee ID that
we have sent okay which is number one
and then the next message here is D
response so if you look at the response
again we have got a soap envelope which
contains a soap header basically an
empty soap header and then within the
soap body itself we got the response so
if I D name of the employee gender
basically all the details of that
employee okay so using this technique we
can actually view the messages that are
exchanged between the client and the WCF
service in a similar fashion you can
enable tracing on the WCF service as
well the steps are exactly identical
okay now so with this message logging
option we are able to inspect these
messages that are sent back and forth
between the client and the WCF service
itself so being able to inspect these
messages you know will help us better to
understand message contracts which is
our next topic so in our next video
we'll discuss message contracts that's
it for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
