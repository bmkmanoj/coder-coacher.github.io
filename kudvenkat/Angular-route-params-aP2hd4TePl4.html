tutorial in this video we will discuss
creating a route with parameters and
activating that route so here is what we
want to do at the moment on our list
page we are displaying the list of
employees each employee details are
being displayed by this bootstrap panel
that we have right here and here is what
we want to do when we click anywhere on
this bootstrap panel we want to redirect
to another page which is going to
display that specific employee details
at the moment we don't have this
employee details component so to speed
things up let's use angular CLI and
generate this new component and here is
the angular CLI command to generate our
new component ng for angular CLI itself
G for generate C for component and let's
name our component employee details and
we want this new component to be placed
in this employee's folder along with the
other components
so let's prefix the folder name and then
we want this employee details component
to be generated flat within the
employees folder and we don't want a
dedicated folder of its own so I'm going
to include the flat option and finally
we also do not want any spec files to be
generated so let's also use the no spec
option and let's use the dry run flag to
see what we get if you are new to
angular CLI please check out our angular
CLI course I have the link to the course
in the description of this video if you
want to check that out later now let's
execute this command without the dry run
option so the component is generated
notice the angular CLI not only
generated they required a component
files it has also updated the root
module to import and declare our new
component employee details component
notice in the employees folder we have
the employee details component files now
if we take a look at the root module
file notice we have the import statement
to import employee details component and
it is also included in the
declarations array so here is what we
want to do when we click anywhere on
this employee panel we want to redirect
the user to another route that looks
like this
employees four slash the ID of the
employee for example if I click on this
employee panel and at this employee ID
is one then we want to pass one in the
URL like that if I click on meri and if
her employee ID is two then we want to
pass her ID in the URL like that so
first we need to create this route so in
our route module file which contains all
our application routes let's include a
route with parameters I'm going to make
a copy of this round now we want our
route to look like this employees four
slash and then the ID of the employee
this ID of the employee changes
depending on the employee panel that we
have clicked on so we need a parameter
right here and the wavy include
parameters in angular is like this
employees this is the bit that does not
change and then to specify a parameter
we include a four slash colon and then
the name of the parameter in our case a
passing employee ID so I'm going to name
the parameter ID we can give it any
meaningful name we want at the moment in
this route definition we have only one
parameter but there's nothing stopping
us from including as many parameters as
you want for example if we want to pass
another parameter we include another
four slash another colon and then the
name of the new parameter let's say for
example we want to pass gender along
with the ID we specify the name of the
parameter like that in our case we want
to pass only one parameter and that is
the employee ID so let's remove this
gender parameter now when the user is on
this route we want to go to employee
details component so let's specify that
right here
so when do we want to navigate to this
new route that we have just created
whenever the user clicks on
any of these employee panels and we have
these employee panels within our list
employees component so let's open list
employees component view template file
now we want to redirect the user to a
new route whenever they click anywhere
on this employee panel so to make that
happen what I'm going to do is surround
this display employee component with
another development and then wire up the
click event handler when there is a
click event we want to call a method on
our component class let's call this on
click and this method we want to pass
the ID of the employee notice here we
are looping through the array of
employees and we have the employee
object that is being displayed by this
display employee component so we want to
pass the ID of that employee now let's
create this on click method within our
component class now we know this method
is receiving the employee ID so let's
specify that parameter right here and
the type of this is number now what do
we want to do when we click on this
employee panel we want to redirect the
user to our new route and we are doing
that in code to navigate to another
route in code we use the angular router
service so first let's go ahead and
include the required import statement to
import the router service from angular
router package next let's inject this
router service into a component class
using the constructor
now all that is left to do is use this
router service navigate method to
navigate to a new route so within this
on click method let's use the router
service navigate method now if you take
a look at our route definition it has
got two parts in it this is the path to
our destination component and this is
the route parameter when activating this
route meaning when we are navigating to
this route we need to specify these two
parts so within the navigate method we
are passing an array here this array is
called link parameters array the first
element of this array is the path to our
destination component and that part in
our case is for slash employees and the
second element of the array is the route
parameter we have the employee ID coming
in as a parameter into this onclick
method and that's what we need to pass
right here let's save all our changes
and then start our server notice now
when I click on this employee we are
redirected to a new route employees 4/1
one is the ID of this employee now I
want to do one more change here when I
hover the mouse over any of these panels
we want to change the cursor style to
pointer so the user knows this panel is
clickable so let's open the CSS file of
our list employees component I'm going
to specify a new CSS class here let's
call it pointer cursor and let's set the
cursor style to pointer
now let's specify the CSS class with
Nebu template
notice now when I have the mouse over
any of these employee panels the cursor
style changes to Han when I click on
mark notice his ID is one which is
passed in the URL similarly when I click
on marry her IDs two now all that is
left to do is from this employee details
component we want to read this route
parameter value and then retrieve that
specific employee details and display
them right here we'll discuss how to do
that in our next video so to create a
route with parameter in the route
definition included for slash : and in
the name of the parameter in our case
the name of the parameter is ID to
activate the route in code we use the
angular router service navigate method
notice to the navigate method we are
passing link parameters array the first
element in the array is the path to the
destination component in our case it is
for slash employees the second element
in the array is the route parameter
value in our case it is the employee ID
now what if you want to activate the
route declaratively in the HTML well
that's when we use the rotor link
directive notice we are binding the
rotor link directive to the same link
parameters array let's quickly look at
this approach in action notice in the
navigation menu we have presumed that
link right here let's modify that link
now those links are present within our
root component app component instead of
using this href attribute let's use the
router link directive we want to bind
this routed link directive to the link
parameters array the first element in
the array is the path to the destination
component in our case it is for slash
employees and the second element in the
array is the value for the road
parameter in our case it is employee ID
for now let's hard code that value to be
2 and
nothing let's change the text on the
link to get employee with ID to notice
now when we click on this link we are
redirected to our new route employees
4/2 as expected in our next video we
will discuss extracting the route
parameter values thank you for watching
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
