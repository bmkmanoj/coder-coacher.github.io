interview questions and answers video
series in this video we'll discuss one
of the very common interview question
what is the difference between inner
join and left join we discuss different
joints in sequel server in detail in
part 12 of sequel server tutorial for
beginners video series if you're new to
joins I would strongly encourage you to
watch that video first let's understand
the difference between inner join and
left join using these two tables
departments and employees notice that
department ID is the common column
between these two tables if we have to
join these two tables we will be joining
them on department ID column the first
step here is to create these tables
which I have already done and here is
the sequel script that can do it I'll
have the script available on my blog in
case you need it now let's say we want
to retrieve employee name from employees
table and department name from
department's table if we have to achieve
that we'll have to join these two tables
and to join two tables in a sequel
server there are different types of
joins in a join
left joined right joined full join cross
join so let's use inner join so we want
to select some columns we will populate
the Select list in just a bit first
let's specify the from clause so from
employees table doing an inner join with
departments table and we need to specify
join condition so we are going to use
department ID from both the tables to
join them because that's the common
column between the tables okay and what
are the columns that we want we want
employee name and Department name so
let's specify them in the Select list
all right now let's execute this query
and see the output that we get notice
that we first of all get in our employee
name and Department name and look at the
number of rows that we have got we've
got five rows and if you look at the
rules that we have in the employees
table notice that we've got six rows
okay but we only got five rows you know
in the result and look at the
departments that we have here ID HR and
payroll and look at how many departments
we have got in the departments table ID
HR Payroll
and admin admin Department is not
retrieved and let's understand the
reason why first of all notice that we
are using inner join here so when we use
inner join only the matching rows
between the tables involved in the join
are returned in the result set
non matching rows are eliminated okay so
if you look at Pam record here Pam does
she have a department ID assigned no she
doesn't
so this she she does not have any
matching role within departments table
and similarly if you look at the admin
Department it has got Department ID for
is there any employee with an employee's
table who has got department ID for no
so admin row within departments table
and Pam row with an employee's table
they don't have matching rows okay so
obviously they will be eliminated from
the result set only the matching rows
will be returned so all these five rows
have corresponding matching roles in the
department's table that's why only five
records are returned so that's what an
inner join is going to do inner join is
going to return only the matching rows
non matching rows will be eliminated now
let's understand what is left join left
join is going to return all the rows
from the left table including the non
matching ones so inner join only the
matching ones in left join all the rows
from the left table irrespective of
whether they have matching rows or not
in the right table okay so now if we
were to change this join type from inner
the left join and then once we execute
this query notice that we get time
record as well now since Pam does not
have a matching record within
departments table department name will
obviously be null right so we got all
the rows from the left table that's left
join so that's basically the difference
in a joint is going to return all the
matching rows where as left join is
going to return all the rows from the
left table irrespective of whether they
have matching rows or not
and for non-matching rose you know
obviously for the columns that belong to
the right table null value will be
displayed because there is no matching
row so that's why it will be now and
there could be several other questions
on joins in sequel server interview for
example the interview could ask you what
is the difference between inner join and
right join now let's understand what is
right join first of all so first of all
understand here employees is the left
table because that's what we have
specified first and then the right table
is departments okay and if you look at
the data that we have got within
departments table notice that we have
four records and admin department does
not have any employees assigned meaning
it does not have any matching row now
look at this if we simply change this
left join to right join and then once we
execute this query look at the output
that we are going to get now we again
got six rows okay now look at this time
we did not get Pam record why Pam record
is present in the left table that is the
employees table and we are using right
join here what is right join going to do
right join is going to retrieve all the
rows from the right table including the
non matching ones so from the right
table that is from the department's
table we are going to get all of them ID
HR Payroll admin ID HR Payroll
they have matching records in the
employees table so obviously against all
matching employees the respective
department name will be displayed but
admin department it does not have any
matching row within the employees table
that's why employee name column will be
null for that department okay but look
Pam's record is not retrieved okay but
instead admin record is rated because
that is present in the right table so
now you can see that all rows from the
right table are retrieved including the
ones that does not have matching rows
within the left table okay so that's
what right join is going to do right
join is going to retrieve all the rows
from the right table including the non
matching ones left join is going to
retrieve all the rows from the left
table including the non match
you once whereas inner join is going to
retrieve only the matching rows between
the tables involved in the joint non
matching rows will be eliminated then
what is full join
full join is going to retrieve all the
rows from all the tables that is from
both the tables that is from the left
table and from the right table
irrespective of whether they have
matching rows or not so if we were to
change this join to full join and then
execute this query notice that we get
seven records so the first five are
matching rows between both the tables
this row is the one present in the left
table but that does not have a
corresponding matching row in the right
table that is the depts table and this
row is the row that is present in the
depts table that is the right table
which does not have a corresponding row
in the left table okay so a full join is
going to return all the rows from both
the tables irrespective of whether they
have matching records or not so that's
basically the full join okay so what is
full joins will join returns all rows
from both the left and right tables
including the non matching rows and
there could be other interview questions
as well based on these joints but if you
understand the basics of joins then
answering any joints related into me
questions should be a cakewalk for
example the interviewer could ask you
what is the difference between left join
and right join or what is the difference
between right join and full join or what
is the difference between right join and
left join okay and here is another
interesting question what is the
difference between inner join and join
or what is the difference between left
join and left outer join right join and
right outer join there's no difference
okay it is perspective over the use
inner join or just join you know the
query is going to be executed in the
same way and it is going to perform in
the same manner either from a
performance perspective or from the way
that query gets executed there's no any
difference they're exactly the same
thing okay
the same applies for left join and left
outer join right join and right outer
join and full join and full outer join
you can either use left join
all specifically the full name that is
left outer join okay what you want to
use is up to you it's just your personal
preference some people like to use in
our left joint instead of left outer
join because there are more characters
in it to type whereas other people
prefer to use in or the full name
because it's very explicit okay it all
again boils down to your personal
preference that's what the today thank
you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
