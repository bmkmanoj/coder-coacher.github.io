tutorial in this video well discuss
working with a checkbox control how to
have a checkbox checked by default and
finally how to disable a checkbox so
here is what we want to do on our create
employee form we want to include this is
active checkbox so if an employee is an
active employee meaning he is not
terminated then we want this is active
checkbox to be checked on the other hand
if an employee is terminated then we
don't want this checkbox to be checked
so let's flip over to visual studio code
and then take a look at the HTML
required for this here is our Creed
employee component and this HTML right
here gives us these two radio buttons of
male and female now working with a
checkbox control is very similar to
working with a radio button control so
I'm going to make a copy of this HTML
and then we'll change the bits that are
required so we don't need this label
right here inside a form group we are
going to have a form control and we want
a check box so I'm going to change this
class to checkbox in line instead of
radio in line and then we want a check
box so again I'm going to set the type
to checkbox we don't need the value
attribute so I'm going to get rid of
that and let's set the name to is active
and let's also set ng model to is active
and we want the text to be is active
let's make this eye uppercase and we
don't need another checkbox we just need
one check box so I'm going to remove
this female radio button from here
alright so this piece of HTML is going
to give us this is active checkbox so
let's save our changes and then take a
look at the browser notice we have our
ease active checkbox right here and look
at the angular generated form model it's
an empty object at the moment now when I
check this check box notice is active
property is captured by our
auto-generated phone model and at the
moment its value is true if the uncheck
it it changes to false as expected now
when we click the Save button we want
this exact a property to be logged to
the console so let's click the Save
button we are logging the entire ng form
so let's expand this and then scroll
down and if we take a look at the value
property it's an object and if we expand
that object we should see is active
property so as we scroll down notice is
active a set of false as expected now if
we include checked attribute on this
check box we expect this check box to be
checked by default when the form
initially loads but notice it's not
checked as expected now if we remove
this ng-model directive then it works as
expected so let's remove it save our
changes and then take a look at the
browser notice now the ease active
checkbox is checked as expected now we
use this ng-model directive in angular
for two-way data-binding so the moment
we put this ngmodel directive back in
place this checked attribute is not
going to work as expected so if we take
another look at the browser notice again
this check box is not checked so to make
it work include this is active property
within the component class so let's go
to create employee component type script
file and then within the component class
I'm going to include this property is
active and at the moment I have set its
value to true because we want the check
box to be checked by default if you
don't want it to be checked set this
property to false notice now the check
box is checked as expected so with this
is active property in place even if we
remove this checked attribute from the
HTML it is still going to work exactly
the same way as before so let's save our
changes and then take another look at
the browser notice now we still have our
checkbox checked for our form we don't
want the check box to be checked by
default so I'm going to remove this
active property from the component class
now let's discuss how to disable a
checkbox disabling a checkbox is very
similar to disabling a radio button all
we have to do is include the disabled
attribute on the checkbox that you want
to disable so let's save our changes and
if we take a look at the check box
notice it is disabled when I hover the
mouse over it we get a different style
indicating that the checkbox is disabled
another very important point to keep in
mind is that disabled phone controls are
not included in the angular
auto-generated phone model by default so
when I click the Save button
your login entry form to the console so
if we expand that and scroll all the way
down and then take a look at the value
property it is an object and if we
expand that we see all the properties
like contact preference email full name
gender phone number but we don't see
this is active properly because this
form control is disabled now we don't
want our ez active form control to be
disabled so I'm going to remove the
disabled attribute notice now we don't
have our is active checkbox disabled and
at this point let's click the Save
button and then see if we have the es
active property logged to the console
along with the other properties because
at the moment
is active checkbox is not disabled so we
expect its corresponding property to be
logged within the console notice we have
the ease active property along with the
other properties like full name gender
etc and on the slide right here we have
the HTML required to get this is active
checkbox thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
