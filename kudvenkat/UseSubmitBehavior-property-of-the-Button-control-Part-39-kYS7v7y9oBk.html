venket this is path 39 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll discuss
about the use submit behavior property
of the asp.net button control let's
actually understand this with an example
let's design a webform with a text box
and two button controls and a label
control what this waveform basically
does is it allows the user to enter a
name into the textbox and when we click
the Clear button it has to clear the
text that we enter into the textbox but
whereas when I submit after I enter a
name into the textbox
you know the label message should
display whatever you have entered into
the textbox and with this example we'll
understand the significance of this
property use submit behavior let's flip
to Visual Studio I have a simple asp.net
web application project here let's enter
this little text name I want to bold
that so highlight and control B let's
drag and drop a textbox control onto the
web form which allows the user to enter
a name and let's give the textbox a
meaningful ID let's call it txt ID or
txt name and then we want to button
control so let's drag and drop a button
control onto the waveform I will use the
first button control to clear the
textbox so let's give it a meaningful
name bTW and clear and let's change the
text to clear
let's drag and drop another button
control on the web form and this button
is used to submit the webpage to the
server so that whatever text that we
enter in the text box will then be
retrieved and set as text for the
textbox control so the ID is button
submit and the text is let's say submit
and let's also have a label control on
the webform and this label is used to
display the message back to the user so
let's get rid of the default text that
we have and let's change the ID of the
label to LBL message and then let's
change the font to be bold so expand the
font style and then set the bold
property to true and I also want to
change the full color to dark green so
let's set that to dark green okay so we
have the form design now now what should
happen when I click this Clear button
whatever the user whatever the text that
user enters into the text box should be
set to an empty string so double-click
the Clear button so txt name dot text is
equal to string dot empty so we want to
set that to an empty string but whereas
when he clicks the submit button what we
want to do is we want to set the text
property of LBL message to whatever the
user has entered into the text box so
you entered to this string i want to
append whatever the user has entered
into the text box so txt name dot text
okay a very simple application let's run
this and then when the web form renders
we'll enter the name and then submit the
form for processing now I'm not sure if
you can see this in the video but when I
look at these two buttons clear and
submit the Clear button has a light blue
color you know border around
okay which indicates that the webform is
going to use you know this button this
but this clear button is going to have
the default submit behavior meaning if I
enter something into the textbox I'm
entering the word Pragya look at that
the cursor is still blinking in the
textbox okay
I'm not using the mouse control to click
on any of these buttons okay I'm moving
away the mouse observe that the cursor
is still blinking in the textbox now if
I hit the enter key look at that
you know the Clear button is actually
the Clear buttons event handler is
actually executed that's because all the
asp.net button controls have a property
called use submit behavior property and
that is set to true by default which
means when this property is set to true
then you know that button is going to
use the browser's submit functionality
so I have two buttons here for both of
the buttons in this case you submit
behavior property is set to true so
clear button is coming before the submit
button so when I enter something into
the textbox and plus enter you know the
first button will will have that submit
behavior you know the click event
handler of that button will be executed
okay but here what I want is when I
enter name and hit enter I want the
submit button even handler to be
executed by default so how do we achieve
that
to achieve that all we have to do is in
the source or we can do that in the
designer as well selecting button the
Clear button go to the properties of the
button control and then there is a
property called you submit behavior
which is true by default look at this
for button clear it's true let's spin
this town let's go to submit button and
even for submit button it's true so for
all the button controls by default this
property is true okay all we are doing
right now is selected Clear button and
we are setting that submit behavior to
false and obviously as you might expect
in the source that would have added that
attribute you submit behavior is equal
to false and we are doing that for
button clear
okay so that's the only change that is
required now if I go ahead and run this
now as it stands when the webform
renders you know look at that now the
submit button has that blue border
around that indicating that that is
going to have the default submit
behavior so now if I enter this word
prism into the text box
observe that the cursor is still
blinking in the text box I am NOT using
my mouse to click these buttons okay now
when I press ENTER look at that
the default submit behavior is with this
submit button okay so the only change
that we have made is that we have said
the you submit behavior property of the
Clear button to fall so what has
happened when you said that and what is
this you submit behavior property doing
let's understand that the you submit
behavior property specifies if the
button control uses the browsers built
in submit functionality or the asp.net
postback mechanism okay if this property
is true then it uses the browser's built
in submit function okay because of which
you know if you remember all the button
controls have this property to true so
all the buttons are going to use the
browser's built-in submit function but
if we said that property to false then
those button controls are going to use
asp.net postback mechanism so how does
an asp.net thus a postback with the help
of a JavaScript so when you set the
property use submit behavior property to
false then that button is going to use
the asp.net a postback mechanism to post
the webform to the server when you click
that button and it does that by using
the JavaScript so the asp.net framework
will actually inject JavaScript some
client-side JavaScript which will be
used by the button control to do a post
back when the user clicks that pattern
and to prove that when this page has
rendered if I right click on that and
then when I say view source of the page
let's expand that and look at this I
have to be have two buttons button clear
and button
I made four button clear you have a
little JavaScript injected here on click
there is some JavaScript here so this is
what is causing the post back to happen
when you actually click the button but
various if you look at this
BTN submit its button type is submit
which is using the browser's built-in
submit mechanism so the you submit
behavior property specifies if the
button control uses the browser's
built-in submit mechanism or the asp.net
post pack mechanism this property is
true by default when set to false
asp.net adds a client-side script to
post the form back to the server for
processing and we have just seen that so
this is that little a you know
JavaScript injected by the asp.net to
view the client-side script added by the
asp.net right click on the browser
window and view source and we have just
seen that how to do it on this slide you
can find resources for asp.net c-sharp

slash could rank at kud BE&amp;amp;K T as you
can see on the slide that's it for today
