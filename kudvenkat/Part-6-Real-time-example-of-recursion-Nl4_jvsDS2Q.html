questions tutorial in this video we'll
discuss a simple real-time example where
recursion can be used this is
continuation to part 5 so please watch
part 5 before proceeding so what is a
recursive function that occurs your
function is a function that calls itself
we discuss this in part 5 probably in an
interview an interviewer may ask you to
give an example of where you have used a
recursion in your project you may say no
project there's a requirement to find
all the files in a folder and in all the
subfolders underneath in the hierarchy
this is a very good example of where we
could use recursion let's say we have
this folder structure notice that the
author most folder here is sample within
that we have got two files and a folder
and within that folder we have another
set of two files and a folder again in
that folder to move files and then
another folder and within this inner
folder too we have got only files so
this is the innermost folder underneath
that we don't have any more folders so
basically we want a method which can
loop this folder hierarchy and give us
all the file names this can be very
easily achieved using a recursive
function and here is that function very
straightforward method with four lines
of code and notice what this method is
doing first of all this method has got a
parameter which is nothing but the part
of the folder structure ok so once we
give it that part look at that there are
two for each loops the first for each
loop what is it doing
it's invoking that this get files static
method so this is going to give all the
files within the given folder ok and
only the files nor the folders ok and
what is this forage loop doing simply
printing that file named after it has
printed these two file names it's going
to come out of that for each loop and
it's going to go to the second for each
loop and within this notice what we are
doing we are getting directories within
that folder so it's going to come here
and look for that directory so it's
going to return the directory out
out of folder and then notice what we
are doing we are calling fine files
which is nothing but the same method so
this method is calling itself so it's
going to come again so at this point
it's an outer folder and then it's going
to loop through the files within that
folder and print them and then it's
going to come here again and then it's
going to get a reference to inner folder
one and then we are calling it self
again so it's going to do this until it
comes to inner folder 2 and once it is
an enough older to what's going to
happen it's going to print file seven
file eight it's going to come to this
for each loop and directory dot get
directories it's not going to return any
directory at which point the method you
know returns so the recursion is going
to break and the control is given to the
caller so very straightforward method to
speed things up I have already typed
with this method so let's copy it go
back to visual studio and paste that
here so this is a static method so we
don't have to create an instance of this
class in order to invoke that now this
directory class is present in system dot
IO namespace so let's go ahead and
include that all right now let's prompt
the user to enter the path console dot
write line
please enter path and now on my machine
I have already set up a folder structure
like this so within C Drive sample look
at that I have caught out a folder and
then two files within that another
folder and then two files basically the
same structure alright so once the user
enters a path what we need to do we need
to read it so let's read it into this
variable and how do we read it using
console dot readline method and then we
are going to invoke this method and pass
the path so find
files and let's pass the pot dynamometer
alright so let's go and run this so
let's enter the Part C colon backslash
sample that's where we have the folder
and look at that I get all the files
file one two three four till eight and
that's what is the structure so very
simple example where we can use
recursive function that's it for today
thank you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
