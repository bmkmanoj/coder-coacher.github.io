this video we'll discuss copying data
from one table to another using sequel
bulk copy the source and destination
tables may be in the same database or in
different databases and these databases
in turn can be on same sequel server or
on different servers in the example that
we're going to look at today we'll be
using two different databases and these
databases will be present on the same
server they may be present on different
servers as well we can still use sequel
bulk copy to move data from one server
to another in part 18 we discussed
loading XML data into sequel server
table using sequel bulk copy we'll be
continuing with the same example today
now the first step here is to create the
source and destination databases so
let's flip the sequel server management
studio so let's create our source dB
let's name it source DB and let's now
create the destination database let's
name it destination DB and within our
source DB we want to create departments
and employees tables and populate them
the data and here is the sequel script
that can do it so let's execute this
against the source database so let's
select our source DB and execute the
script let's quickly select data from
this tables to make sure
so we have the tables and the data now
let's create the structure of the tables
within the destination database within
our destination database we don't want
data we just want the structure of the
tables so let's go ahead and execute
this script which just creates the
tables so let's fire up a new query
editor window
select our destination database and
execute this part of the script so we
have the tables but not the data now
let's flip to a visual studio so the
first thing that we need to do here is
within web config file we need to
include two connection strings one for
the source database and the other one is
for the destination database so here
this connection string is going to point
to source DB and let's make a copy of
this one and this connection string is
going to point our destination database
so let's name this destination CS and
this will be pointing to our destination
database now let's get to the code
behind file so this is the piece of code
that we have written to move data from
an XML file into a sequel server table
so let's change the name of this
connection string to source connection
string and let's change the references
of all that variable as well all right
so we want to read the source connection
string and the name of the connection
string within web config file is source
CS in a similar fashion we want to read
the destination connection string from
web config file so this line right here
is going to read the destination
connection string and let's change the
name of the variable to destination
connection string all right now we want
to create a connection to the source
database and read data from departments
and employees tables so this sequel
connection object here is now connecting
to our source database now we don't
require this data set and data tables
code so let's get rid of that
so now let's create the sequel command
object now we want this command to
execute this sequel command select star
from departments and retrieve
departments data from the source
database so we are going to pass the
source connection object
so let's actually change the name of
this connection object also to source
connection okay so here we want to use
the source connection object we are
opening the source connection now let's
use a sequel data reader object so
sequel data reader Rd R equals command
dot execute reader
okay so what have you done we have
created sequel command by opening the
connection executed the command so we
have the source data within this reader
object now so we need to write this data
to the destination database so to write
to the destination database we first
need to have a connection to destination
database so we have to create another
connection object here
so using sequel connection let's call
this destination connection and this is
going to make use of destination
connection string all right so we have
the destination connection of j'tia and
then we are creating our sequel bulk
copy object instance now the sequel bulk
copy object here is going to take this
departments data that is present in the
reader and write the data to the
department's table in the destination
database so this should actually know
about the destination connection object
and not the source connection object so
let's pass destination connection to
this object and the table within the
destination database is going to be
departments now if you look at the
tables within the source and the
destination the column names are the
same so if the column names are same
then we don't have to use column
mappings okay so then they are not
required you may have them there's no
harm but it is just an extra bit of code
there even without them it's going to
work okay so the table name is going to
be departments and now we want to write
to server ok and we want to write to
server with the data that is present in
this redraw object so we are going to
pass that reader to this method now if
you look at this right to server method
okay so there are several overloaded
versions now in the previous video
session we have used data table right
now we are going to pass you know
something that implements a data reader
now using data readers is better for
performance or using data table is
better now data readers are read only
forward only cursors they are going to
be much much better in terms of
moments then you know using data tables
okay and and if you look at you know
this version of the method it is
actually expecting something that
implements a data read about what you
are passing here is sequel data reader
so if we go to the definition on that
one
notice that this class actually
implements a data reader so we can pass
it as an inherited type to this method
now before we write to the server we
need to open a connection as well so
let's open the destination connection
object alright so this piece of code
should actually write you know
departments from this host DB to the
destination DB now the next thing that
we need to do is write the employee's
data as well so what I'm going to do
here is actually make a copy of this
piece of code and then they'll eat this
piece of code and then paste the copied
code okay so we are reinitializing the
command object to retrieve data from
employee's table now okay so it's still
going to use the source connection
because that's from there we need to
read the employee's data and we don't
have to open the source connection again
because we have already open that and if
you look at the source connection you
know this is the using block which means
that source connection will be alive
until this closing brace is reached so
we don't have to reopen the connection
object so we can get rid of that line
right there so we have a new sequel
command that we want to execute and then
here we are executing the command
getting the results into the reader
object and we have the destination
connection which is pointing to the
destination database and we are creating
sequel bulk copy instance using the
destination connection object and this
time the destination table is going to
be employees and not departments and we
open the destination connection and we
write to the server alright so with all
these changes let's go ahead and run
this now
so just before we click the button let's
execute these two lines one more time
just to make sure we don't have data
within the destination database so let's
click this button now so the page simply
refreshes let's come back and then
execute these two commands notice that
the data is now loaded as expected thank
you for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
