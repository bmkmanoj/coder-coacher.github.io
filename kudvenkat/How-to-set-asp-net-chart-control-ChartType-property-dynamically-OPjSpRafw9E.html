control tutorial in this video we'll
discuss setting chart type property of
asp.net chart control dynamic lay this
is continuation to part one so please
watch part 1 before proceeding let's
flip to visual studio this is the same
example that we worked with in the
previous video session on the designer
surface when we click on this button
right here notice that chart type
drop-down list is shown and within this
drop-down list we have all the different
chart types that are available for
example when we select do not notice the
data is displayed using a donut chart
similarly when we select pie the data is
displayed using a pie chart so when we
select chart type from this drop-down
list behind the scenes it's actually
adding this chart type attribute to the
series element of the chart control so
basically with this chart type attribute
we are telling we want these data points
to be displayed using a pie chart so
there are two ways to actually set chart
type property of the chart control one
is declaratively in the HTML using chart
type attribute and the other other one
is programmatically encode now you may
be wondering what is the reason why we
may want to set the chart type
programmatically in code that's because
if you look at this drop-down list this
is only available to developers you know
at design-time once we run this at
runtime on the rendered platform we will
not have the drop-down list now there
may be a reason you know we want to
provide that drop-down list to the end
user so that the end user can change the
type of chart that he wants right so
that's one classic example way we want
to set the chart type property
dynamically in code so if we want to
provide the drop-down list to the end
user we need to first modify the HTML so
let's flip this to the source mode and
let's use an HTML table here so we are
going to include it TR for this table
and this TR is actually going to contain
two TDs
so the first TD is going to contain the
prompt for the user to select the chart
type and let's actually include this
inside a bold tag
and for this table let's actually set
border to one pixel solid black and
let's also set font family to area all
right
so within this second DD in the first
tier we will have a drop-down list and
let's set Auto post bacc property to
true for this drop-down list so that
whenever the selection in the drop-down
list changes it's going to automatically
post back to the server and this table
is going to contain another TR and this
ti is going to contain just one TD and
we are going to set the column span of
the TD to two and inside this TD we are
going to include the chart control so
let's cut this chart control from here
and then put it inside the steady so
let's flip this to the design mode okay
so we don't have a border for the table
for some reason let's actually look at Y
one pixel solid black alright so within
this drop-down list we want to display
the different chart types right and to
achieve that we are going to make use of
an enum called
series chart type and this enum is
present in a different name space that
is system dot web dot UI dot data
visualization taught charting namespace
so let's bring that in and notice this
when I right-click on this and when I go
to the definition so this enum has got
the different chart types you know the
text of each chart type and their
underlying value so the underlying value
here is an integer okay
so basically we want to display all
these chart types within a drop-down
list control so within the code-behind
file let's include a private method
let's call this get chart types
and we are going to make use of this
enum so basically we are going to use a
for each loop for each end chart type so
we are going to get the underlying value
of each enum you know that's present of
each in a member that's present in
series chart type
so in I'm going to make use of enum
class and this class has got a static
method called get values so if we
specify the type of the enum then this
method is going to return all the values
of that you know enum so and to get the
type of an enum we can use type of
keyword specify that type of the enum in
our case it's series chart type so this
variable is going to contain the
underlying enum value that is you know
these integer values so now what we want
to do is add you know the enum to the
drop-down list so basically if you look
at the drop-down list a drop-down list
is a collection of list item objects so
we need to construct list item objects
dynamically here so list item let's call
it Li equals new list item and we are
going to make use of this constructor
you know the text is what the user sees
and the wallet value is what is you know
present behind that displayed value so
we want the enum name so how are we
going to get the enum name here we have
got the enum value in this variable so
to get the enum name we can use enum dot
get name method and then again we need
to specify the type of the 'inna so
series chart type and then we need to
specify the value so where do we have
the value we have value in this variable
so we can pass that as the second
argument so basically this method is
going to give us the value for the list
I mean text for the list item the next
thing is we need the value and where do
we have the value the enum value is
this variable so we can simply use this
variable and convert that to string and
once we have the list item all that is
left is add the list item to the items
collection of the drop-down list and
within the page load event if not is
post back what we want to do is call
this method get chart types so let's go
ahead and run this now and within the
drop-down list it should display all the
different chart types okay at the moment
when we select you know a chart type
nothing is going to happen because we
have to set the chart type property of
the chart control dynamically so let's
now see how to set that so we already
have the drop-down list control here
let's double click on that to generate
the selected index changed even handler
method so we have this drop-down list
one drop-down list 1 dot selected value
is going to give us the value that the
user has selected and selected value is
going to give us the underlying integer
value let's actually run this now and
when we look at the source of the
rendered waveform notice that this
drop-down list has got you know that's
the name of the enum and the value of
the list item is displayed
you know option value is the underlying
integers so selected value is going to
give us that value so drop-down list 1
dot selected value now if we look at the
chart type attribute here where are we
setting this chart type attribute we are
setting that on the series element of
the chart control so when we do it
programmatically we have to go from
chart to series and from series we can
then set the chart type property so we
have the chart control and it's chart
control can contain several series in
our example we only have one series and
if you look at that series the name of
the series is series 1 so we want to
retrieve that series and for that series
we want to set
type property and if you look at this
chart type property it expects an enum
series chart type so how are we going to
build an enum from the value we can use
again enum plus and then it has brought
this parse method so parse we need to
specify the type of the inner we are
going to use type of keyword and then
specify our ena series chart type and
then we need to specify the value so
selected value is going to return the
value of that vinum in a string format
so this should return us the enum but if
you look at this parchment that's
actually returning the T num as an
object but we know that it is going to
return this series chart type in m so
let's typecast whatever this part's
method returns to series Chaput so it
starts simple alright so with all these
changes let's go ahead and run this now
so let's select for example bar chart
notice that a bar chart is displayed
let's select a pie a pie chart and
similarly let's select donut and the
data is displayed using a donut chart
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
