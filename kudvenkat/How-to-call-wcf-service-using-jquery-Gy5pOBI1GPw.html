this video we'll discuss how to call it
WCF servers using jQuery AJAX calling
the WCF service using jQuery AJAX is
very similar to calling a method in a
code behind file using jQuery AJAX here
is what we want to do we want to
retrieve the employee data that's
present in this database table TBL
employee using a WCF service and then we
want to call that WCF service using
jQuery AJAX and display the data as you
can see here so the first step here is
to create this database table which I
have already done and here is the create
table script and here we have the insert
script which is going to insert some
test data i've already executed the
script and here we have a stored
procedure which is going to retrieve
employee details by ID so this stored
procedure has got an input parameter @
ID the implementation of the stored
procedure is straightforward we've got a
single select query which is retrieving
ID name gender and salary columns from
TBL employee wear ID equals whatever
value we pass for this ID parameter so
in case if we pass one is the value for
the ID parameter and when we execute the
store procedure it should return us
employee ID one details so that's it
from the database side now let's slip to
Visual Studio here I have an asp.net web
application project within the web dot
config file I have included a connection
string which points to the sample DB
database and that's the database we just
got our table TBL employee the next step
is to add a class file to this project
so let's go ahead and add a class file
let's name this employee and this class
is going to have four properties and I
have already typed the code required for
those four properties so let's copy and
paste them here so we have got ID name
gender and salary all of them auto
implemented properties these properties
correspond to the columns we've got in
this database table TBL employee the
next step is to add a web service I mean
a WCF service to this project so right
click on the project add a new item
and when you scroll all the way down you
should see two options for WCF service
we want this WCF service to be called
using jQuery AJAX so I'm going to select
this option WCF service Ajax enabled and
let's call this employee service WC if
services have dot SVC extension so this
it should add a WCF service and we'd
also modify web config file so if you
look at web config file now it has added
some configuration specific to our WCF
service so i'm not going to go into the
details of this configuration because
this has got nothing to do with a jQuery
AJAX so if you are new to WCF service we
have a separate you know playlist that
covers all the basics of WCF services
and that playlist is called the beauty
of tutorial so please check that
playlist so this configuration specific
to our WCF service and within our WCF
service itself we've got a service
contract and the name of the class here
is employee service and within this
service contract we've got a single
operation contract and at the moment it
says to work now let's get rid of all
these comments right so let's actually
change the name of the function or the
operation contract to something
meaningful let's call this get employee
by ID so this function is going to get
employee by ID so we need to specify
what is the employee ID so we're going
to do that using a parameter and the
return type of this function is going to
be employee so we give it an employee ID
this function is going to return us the
respective employee object which
contains the details about ID name
gender and salary now within this
function we're going to write ATO dotnet
code to retrieve data from the database
so let's go ahead and bring in the area
dot namespaces we need system
configuration we need system dot data
and system dot data dot
so client okay in the interest of time I
have already typed the required ato
dotnet codes let's copy the code from
the notepad and paste it inside this
function and look at this idiot open it
code is straightforward first we are
creating an instance of the employee
object and then we are reading the
connection string from a web config file
using that connection string we are
building a sequel connection object and
then we are building a sequel command
object we want this command object to
execute the stored procedure since the
command object is executing a stored
procedure we have to tell that to the
command object and we are doing that by
using the command type property this
stored procedure has got a parameter so
we need to create a parameter object and
we are doing that here specifying the
name of the parameter and the value for
it the value for it is coming in the
form of you know a parameter to this
function and then we need to associate
this parameter object with the command
object and we are doing that using the
parameters collection property of the
command object and then open the
connection execute the command
whatever result we get storing in this
reader object and we are looping through
the reader retrieving ID name gender and
salary property values and finally
returning that employee object so this
is straightforward ad or net code it has
got nothing to do either with WCF
services or jQuery AJAX okay so we have
our WCF service contract and the
operation contract now we want to call
this operation contract that is get
employee by ID using jQuery AJAX so I
have already added perform one dot aspx
to this project at the moment we don't
have any HTML here within the form
section so we want to design this web
form so it looks like this and an
interest of time I have already typed
the required HTML so let's copy that
HTML and paste it within the form
section so again this HTML is pretty
straightforward
so we have the literal text ID and then
we have a textbox to capture the
employee ID and then a button which the
and user can click to retrieve the
employee and then a table and the table
contains three TRS within each TR we've
got two TDs in the first TD of every TR
we have name gender or salary and then
within the second TD we have a text box
to display a the name gender or salary
okay so let's go ahead and build this
project and let's view this page in the
browser okay so now the design is
similar to what we have here now we want
to call the WCF service retrieve the
data and display it within the
respective text boxes so within our
scripts section we already have the
ready function wired up and when we
click the button that's when we should
retrieve the employee details the button
has got an ID BTN get employee so let's
use the jQuery ID selector to find that
button and let's associate click event
handler so when we click the button we
want to execute some code so what should
happen when we click the button we first
want to retrieve the ID of the employee
from this employee ID text box and that
text box has got an ID
it is txt ID so let's copy that and use
the jQuery ID selector once again let's
create a variable let's call it EMP ID
equals let's use the jQuery ID selector
and use the Val function to retrieve the
employee ID from the textbox now we want
to issue a jQuery AJAX request to the
WCF services get employee by ID function
so let's use the Ajax function and let's
specify the options for this Ajax
function so first let's specify the URL
so what's the URL we want to call we
want to call this employee service
that's the name of the service and then
WCF services have dot SVC extension
forward slash within that service we've
got this function get employee by ID
that's the operation contract which we
want to call
so call get employee by ID and you can
specify the type of record you know
request that you want to issue we want
to issue a post request so I'm going to
specify that using the method option and
let's specify the content type that we
will be sending to the server will
actually be sending a JSON string so I'm
going to specify the content type as
application for / Jason and let's also
specify the character set
so character set equals u TF - 8 since
we have specified that we will be
sending JSON data so we will have to you
know convert the data that we will be
sending to the silver to a JSON string
so let's use the data option and what
data are we going to send we are going
to send data for this parameter employee
ID right so the object that we are going
to send will have a single property
employee ID and the value for that is
going to come from this variable EMP ID
okay and we want to convert this object
to a JSON string and there are two ways
you can do it you can either literally
convert it by hand by using single
quotes or we can use JSON dot stringify
function okay and the next thing that we
are going to specify is the type of data
that we are expecting from the server
and we specify that using data type
option and the type of data that we are
expecting is JSON when the request
completes successfully we want to
associate a callback function and this
is the function which is going to
receive the data that the WCF service is
going to send and finally if at all if
there is any error we want to handle
that
so let's associate a callback function
to the error option as well so when we
receive the error let's simply alert
that
okay so this is the JSON object that the
WCF service is going to send when the
request completes successfully now one
very important thing to keep in mind is
that the JSON object that the WCF
service returns will have a property D
attached to it by default so if you want
to retrieve property name value then you
know you will have to use data dot d dot
name okay and we want to display that in
the text box right and the ID of the
textbox within which we want to display
it is txt name so let's use the jQuery
ID selector and the value for that is
going to come from the data object that
is going to have D property attached to
it by default from that use the name
property similarly let's go ahead and
retrieve gender and salary so the
textbox ID for gender is txt gender and
the property name is gender and finally
salary txt salary and the property name
is salary all right so let's go ahead
and build this project one more time
let's reload this page and look at this
when we enter employee ID one get
employee we get employee ID one details
similarly let's enter employee ID three
and we get employee ID three look at how
fast it works because it's using Ajax
now instead of a complete page post bacc
so here I have our you know the
operation contract code here we have the
HTML and here we have the jQuery code
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
