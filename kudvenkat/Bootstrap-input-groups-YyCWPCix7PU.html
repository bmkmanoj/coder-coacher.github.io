this video we'll discuss bootstrap input
groups bootstrap input groups extended
input elements by adding text icons or
buttons before after or on both sides of
the input elements input groups are
limited to textual input elements only
try to avoid using select and text area
elements as they are not fully supported
by some browsers let's look at a few
examples now notice within this first
example right here we have placed this
text dollar before the input element and
in this example we have placed this text
dot zero zero after the input element
and in this example we have text placed
on either sides of the input element and
in this example we have placed this icon
before the input element and here we
have a check box and a radio button
let's look at all these in action let's
flip to visual studio the first thing
that we need to do here is create an
input group to create an input group all
we need to do is create a div element
with class set to input group and inside
this input group we want a text box so
let's create an input element of type
text let's set its class to form control
and let's also include a placeholder
let's save our changes and when we
reload this page we get a text box with
a specified placeholder now what we want
to do is place this text dollar before
that input element to do that we are
going to create a span element and then
the class of the span element is going
to be input group add-on and whatever
text you want to place before the input
element just include the text inside the
span element so we want to place this
dollar now when we reload this page
notice this dollar is placed before the
input element if you want it after the
input element all you need to do is
place that span element
after the input element let's change
this dollar 2.00 when we reload the page
notice it's placed after the input
element as expected now if you want text
to be placed on either sides of the
input element then include the span
element with class set to input group
add-on on either sides so before the
input element we want dollar and after
the input element we want dot zero zero
so now when we reload this page notice
we have the text before and after the
input element as expected let's now
discuss using icons with input groups so
here is what we want to do we want to
include the Seiken before the input
element this is a glyph icon you can
find all the glyph icons at this URL
get bootstrap com4 slash components so
this is the icon that we want to use
look at the name of the icon its glyph
icon glyph I can dash envelope at the
moment we are using this text dollar
with the input group so I'm going to
delete that and then to use the glyph
icon with the input group inside the
span element I'm going to create another
span element and the class of this is
going to be the name of the glyph icon
and the name of the glyph icon is glyph
icon glyph icon - and we'll up let's
save our changes and when we reload this
page notice we get the I can placed
before the input element as expected a
check box at a radio button can also be
used as an add-on instead of text or
icons to use a check box as an add-on
all we need to do is replace this pan
element with input type equals checkbox
notice when we reload our page we get a
checkbox is expected if you want a radio
button instead of a checkbox include
input type radio' now notice we get a
radio button
for sizing the controls in an input
group use input group LG or input group
SM classes on the input group let's look
at this in action at the moment we are
not using any of those classes input
group LG your input group SM so the size
that we are getting for this input group
here is the default size let's make two
more copies of this input group so here
we are getting the default size so let's
change the placeholder to default and on
this input group let's use input group
LG class LG stands for large and let's
change the placeholder to large and on
this input group let's use input group
SM SM stands for small let's change the
placeholder here to small
and let's include a break element
between the first two input groups and
another break element between the last
two input groups let's reload this page
notice depending on the classes that we
have used we get different sizes as
expected thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
