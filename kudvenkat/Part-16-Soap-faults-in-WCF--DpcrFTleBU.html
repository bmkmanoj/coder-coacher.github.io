this video we'll discuss hope falls in
WCF this is continuation to part 15 so
please watch part 15 before proceeding
in part 15 we have learned that W CFC
realizes exceptions to Sioux Falls
before reporting the exception
information to the client this is
because exceptions are not allowed to be
passed through a WCF service channel so
Falls are in XML format and hence a
platform independent a typical soup
fault contains fault code fault reason
detail and there are several other xml
elements as well but most of the time as
a developer we are interested in these
XML elements of the Swope fault
the detail element can be used to
include any custom XML we'll discuss
more about this detail element in a
later video session but so now
understand that a typical soup fault
contains fault code fault reason and
detail elements now soap faults are
formatted based on soup 1.1 or soup 1.2
specification so the format of the soup
message depends on the binding that we
have used to expose the server's basic
HTTP binding uses soup 1.1 whereas the
rest of the built-in WC of bindings uses
soap 1.2 for the complete differences
between soup 1.1 and 1.2 you can refer
to this article right here on the slide
the differences are not that important
from a developer perspective because WCF
formats the message is automatically
based on the binding we have used to
expose our WCF servers now to view the
soup fault messages we need to enable
message logging and WCF and we have
discussed how to do that in part 9 so if
you're new to enabling message logging
please watch part 9 so let's flip to the
calculator service that we worked with
in the previous session and let's go to
an enable message logging and to do that
let's right click on the application
configuration file select this option
edit WCF configuration select
diagnostics the first thing that we need
to do is enable
log Auto slash and we need to enable
message logging as well and we want to
log the entire message so let's turn
this option log entire message to true
let's save the changes so within our web
config file we should have some code
basically to log the WCF messages now if
you look at the binding that you're
using notice that we are using basic
HTTP binding okay so since we are using
basic HTTP binding the messages will be
formatted according to soap 1.1
specification and also notice that at
the moment include exception detail and
false is set to true but let's change
this to false so we are basically
telling don't include exception details
in this so for that is returned to the
client these settings let's go and run
the WCF service let's go to and run
decline the application so let's try to
divide number ten you know by two just
to make sure this works as expected and
let's try to divide number ten by zero
so we are going to get an exception so
this is expected and look at what we get
back we get a fold exception back you
know and this is Adi general fault
exception this doesn't tell anything
about the exception that has occurred on
this service but then let's go and
inspect the message log and in order to
inspect that message let's go head to
the visual studio open the project in
Windows Explorer and notice that we have
caught this message log file let's open
this using trace viewer and if we look
at this last message right here now look
at that we've caught a soup envelope and
within that is su body basically I have
already copied this XML into this image
and pasted this in the presentation look
at that basically we've got a soup
envelope which has got a soup body and
within the body we have got a fault a
soup fault and notice that the soup
fourth at the moment contains
fault code and fault string fault code
is something like internal service fall
there and then the fault string you know
gives us that general description of the
error that has occurred okay now we
don't have if you look at this slide
right here we said you know it's going
to contain fault code fall trees and a
detail elements but if you look at this
image right here we only have fault code
and fault reason you know it's actually
called here and so one dot one has fault
string but in soap one or two would call
s fault reason okay but then we don't
have the detail element here that's
basically because we didn't want to
include exception detail within the soap
message so if we said you know include
exception detail and false to true
that's when we will get a detail element
let's actually turn that option and see
how the message changes so let's close
the stress viewer let's go to a
calculator service and let's set this to
true save the changes
let's close the service host rerun it
once again let's actually refresh this
page let's try to divide number ten by
zero so look at that now we get the
exception information again it still is
your fault and if we go back to a
message log and if you look at the last
message look at that now we have got
fault code fault string and detail
elements so it's the same thing that I
have pasted here so we have detail
element and then within that we have got
the exception detail basically you know
if there are any inner exceptions what
is the message look at that the message
is basically attempted to divide by zero
and we have the complete stack trace as
well okay so basically we have those
three elements within soap fault and
this is soap 1.1 and now if we want to
view the soap 1.2 fault message then
there is some setting that we have to do
first of all we need to change binding
to WS HTTP binding instead of basic HTTP
binding so
let's go and do that first so here at
the moment we are using basic HTTP
binding but let's go and use WS HTTP
binding that's another binding will
discuss more about these bindings in a
later video session okay and with this
change let's actually close this service
host and rerun this once again and we
need to update our proxy classes for the
client because we have changed the
binding so let's go ahead and update the
service reference and then let's go and
run the client once again so now let's
try to divide number 10 by 0 so we get
attempted to divide by 0 because if you
recollect within our application
configuration file we are still saying
include exception details and false that
is set to true so that's why we see the
exception information and if we go back
to the trace view let's actually close
this and reopen it again and look at
this now there are several messages
there are twenty-four traces and if I
look at the last one and if you look at
the message we don't see that soap fault
okay that's basically because you know
to view the soap 1.2 fault message we
need to change the binding which we have
already done but by default message
security is turned on with you know WS
HTTP binding ok we need to set the
security mode for WS HTTP binding to
none you know because of that message
security we are not able to see the
actual soap fault so for now let's go
and set you know the security mode for
WS HTTP binding to none and to do that
basically you know we need to include
this bindings element and for WS HTTP
binding we basically need to set
security mode to none so let's go and do
that within the app that config file so
under service model let's include
bindings and we are interested in WS
HTTP binding so binding security so
basically we need to set the mode
attribute of security to none so let's
go ahead and do that and that's it so
let's go ahead close this services
running
let's also close the trace viewer and
let's read on this service host and then
let's also update the service reference
and then let's run the client so let's
divide number 10 by 0 so we get that
exception let's go back and open the
trace log and now when we look at the
last message we should get look at that
you know now the messages are slightly
you know the format of the soap message
is slightly different this is soap 1.2
you know the messages are formatted
according to soap 1.2 specification and
you know so that we can see it properly
this one is when we have set exception
detail include exception detail and
falls to false but this is the one that
we have got right now because we have
set include exception detail and false
to true and look at that we have again
its open will up there is a header there
and within the body look at that we have
caught a soup fault and then we have
code you know default code basically so
here it says receiver and then again the
value there is internal service fault
and then we have you know look at the
reason here there's the fault code and
there's the fault reason the reason is
attempted to divide by 0 and again we
have T
yes element and then the exception
information is there including the stack
trace so basically this is soap 1.2
fault you know when include exception
detail in false is set to true in a
similar fashion this is soap one or two
fault
when include exception detail and false
is set to false basically when we set it
to false you know look at that we only
have a fault code and a reason we don't
have that detail element there all right
so basically if we don't want to display
you know this ello screen of death to
the end users we can actually catch that
fault exception and display a meaningful
information and maybe log this fault too
you know maybe a log file or do a
database table so that we can have a
look at that later and then do whatever
we want to do but for now let's actually
catch that fault exception within the
client application and to do that let's
include a try block here and then
include a catch block and it's basically
fault exception and this fault exception
class if you look at the namespace its
present in system dot service model
namespace so make sure you have included
that using statement there so fault
exception let's actually call this fault
exception and then you know in the label
that we have on this page we want to say
fault exception dot whatever message
that's Pleasant okay
or you know you can write code to log
this fault exception somewhere and then
display a meaningful and from you know
message to the client if you want to
alright let's go to and run the client
application let's try to divide number
ten by zero look at that you know
instead of that ello screen we are
displaying a message to the end user you
are tempted to divide by zero right
that's it for today thank you for
listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
