venket this is part 50 access modifiers
in this session we'll talk about
internal and protected internal access
modifiers in a previous session we
learned about private public and
protected access modifiers and we know
that a private member is accessible only
within the containing class whereas a
public member is accessible anywhere
there are no restrictions whatsoever and
a protected member is available within
the containing type and the types
derived from the containing time okay in
this session we'll talk about internal
access modifier and protected internal
okay a member with internal access
modifier is basically available anywhere
within the containing assembly so to
understand internal access modifier we
need to understand the concept of
assemblies now in.net
if you combine a project an assembly is
generated and end or net basically the
assemblies are of two types executables
and dll's
okay usually a console application
generates it dot exe windows application
generates dot exe but whereas a web
application a class library generates in
dot dll ok now if you look at this
solution it has got a console
application so then we build the
solution a DLL for this project will be
generated now in this solution we only
have one project
so obviously one executable or one
assembly will be generated since the
second Sula plication
and executable will be generated and if
you want to look at that physical
assembly what you need to do is just
right click on that open folder when in
in Windows Explorer bin directory debug
and you see that we have introduction to
c-sharp that's the same name as that of
your project ok so this assembly gets
the name of its project and since it's a
control application it will generate an
exe and not a DLL ok so this is your
assembly so what what does this assembly
contains it contains the intermediate
language of your
project source code so all your project
classes methods structures etc will be
compiled intermediate language is
generated and it is packaged into this
assembly which we have just seen alright
now since we want to understand internal
access modifier here we need to have you
know different assemblies so that you
know we can define an internal member in
one of the assemblies try to access that
from a different assembly and see if
it's accessible own on okay and to do
that we need to add more projects to
this solution so to add it to add
another project to the solution just
right-click on the solution add new
project and we shall see shop as a
programming language I'm going to select
class library the project type and let's
call this assembly one so I'm giving my
project assembly one as the name of my
project click OK so what is this going
to do it's going to generate another
project so if you look at the solution
flat file here you have two projects in
the solution one class library one
console application let's add another
class librarian to do that add new
project I'm going to call this assembly
too so assembly two and when I click OK
so another project is had now if I build
a solution basically all these three
projects will be compiled and for each
project and assembly will be generated
so if I want to find the assembly of
this project just right click on the
project open folder in Windows Explorer
get into the bin directory go into the
debug directory and you see that there
is a DLL this time okay so in.net
assemblies are of two types dot DLL or
not exe now since we have understood the
concept of assemblies here okay now if
you look at this assembly one we have a
file a class file class 1 dot CS let's
leave that name but in reality we give
it a meaningful name okay for example if
I'm creating a customer class I will
name it after the class name maybe
customer
CS similarly if I'm creating an employee
class employee CS since this is just a
simple example I'm going to leave that
as class 1 dot CS so class 1 dot CS
let's get rid of this unwanted using
directories here let's make it the
program as simple as possible ok so if
you look at that we have namespace 1 I'm
going to call this assembly 1 plus 1 so
this is class 1 that is present in this
assembly and in this class I'm going to
create a an internal member so until now
oops not interface until now integer and
let's call it ID and let's initialize
that to maybe 1 0 1 so we have this
internal member here now if it was
public then it's accessible anywhere
there are no restriction since this is
internal ok it's available only to the
classes that are present within this
assembly so if you add another class
look at this to this project you can add
another class if you want ok and even to
that class this member will be available
ok or what I can do in the same file I
can create another class maybe public
class maybe let's call that as assembly
1 class 2
and now within this class let's say I
have a method public word sample method
and if I create you know an instance of
this class here I should be able to
access this member so assembly one class
maybe a 1 is equal to new assembly class
1
and when I say a1 dot I'm able to access
that ID member so if I simply say
console dot readline it just writes that
onto the console and now when we build
this go to the build menu build solution
we have an error here somewhere
what does it say the namespace assembly
one already contains a definition for
assembly 1 class 1 okay let's call this
class 2 because we already have class 1
here ok so what we are doing here
assembly class a1 is equal to new
assembly class when we created an
instance and we are trying to access the
ID property so if I build a solution it
should build without any problem ok
since this is an internal member I can
access this within any class of this
assembly 1 but on the other hand if I
try to access this look at this I have
another project then I build this
assembly do project we get another
assembly so from this assembly if I try
to access this internal member just like
how we have done here we will get a
compiler error okay so let's try to do
that and see what happens so in class 1
so this belongs to assembly to project
so let's say let's call this class s
assembly to class 1 so that we are clear
on what class we are creating so we have
another class in assembly 2 now for this
class let's get rid of this unwanted
code fast ok so if you look at this this
class is present in this assembly to
project now what we want to do we want
to create an instance of this class and
then access the ID property
in this assembly but we know that the ID
property is intima which means this this
it's not property it's a field so this
field is only accessible within the
containing assembly within this assembly
but we are trying to access it from
another assembly and internal access
modifier will not allow us to do that
okay so let's see that and before we do
that if we try to create an instance of
this class look at this within the same
assembly and trying to create an
instance of this class here and it works
fine but on the other hand if I try to
create an instance of this class here or
let's say public void maybe we'll call
this print method and then this one I am
trying to you know look at that a 1 is
equal to new basically you can see it
red squiggly there which is indicating
you know I don't know about this type so
if I hover my mouse look at that the
type or name space assembly 1 class 1
couldn't be found
are you missing a using directory or in
assembly reference and that error
message is very meaningful so are you
missing a using directory here here or
and assembly reference ok now where is
this class present this class is present
in assembly one project and and we know
that when we build this project assembly
one dot dll is generated now we need to
use the DLL in this project in order to
be able to access this class ok just
like how you're using console class look
at this for example if I want to use the
console class against a console class
but varies this control class coming
from it's coming from the system
namespace now if you look at the
references you have the system assembly
here and within that system assembly we
have the console class that's how that's
why you are able to access that but on
the other hand assembly one class is
available in this assembly one project
or in this assembly one assembly now you
need to refer that assembly in your
project to be able to access that class
in the first place and to do that
you need to set the reference okay and
set the reference just right-click on
the folder and say add reference in the
add reference dialog box on the projects
tab you look at that you can see
assembly one project and introduction to
c-sharp project but you don't see it
here because you are adding you don't
see assembly two in this list that's
because you are adding reference to this
project itself so I select my assembly
one here and the moment I do that look
at that assembly one assembly is added
as a reference to this project now still
you don't have the debtor gone you still
have that error so the type or namespace
assembly one class one couldn't be found
are you missing a using directory or an
assembly reference we are not missing
the assembly reference because we have
already added that then what else are we
missing we are missing the using
directory just like if you want to
access the console class we have the
system assembly here but if I remove the
using directory can I access that I
can't so it's the same case here you
need to use the using directory so using
what is that assembly one and the moment
we do that the error goes away okay now
let's go back to our discussion of
access modifiers so what are we doing
here I'm trying to create an instance of
our assembly one class which is defined
in another assembly and this assembly
one class has got an internal member and
we want to be able to access this one
and let's try to do that and see what
happens now when I try to do that a one
dot ID look at that first of all the
intelligence doesn't show up that which
means you're not allowed to access and
if you forcefully access that maybe
let's try to initialize that to one zero
one if I try to do that and if we build
we will get a compiler error
and that basically is telling us you're
not allowed to access that why because
that's an internal member and if the
member is internal then it's accessible
only within the assembly where it's
defined you're not allowed to access it
outside of this assembly but in spite of
this being an internal member we are
trying to refer that in this assembly so
this assembly is different from this
assembly and internal members are
accessible only within the containing
assembly any code outside the containing
assembly tries to access that you will
get a compiler error that's what is
internal okay now what is protected into
now okay this is interesting
protected internal it's actually a
combination of protected and internal
okay let's go back to the slides we know
that a protected member is accessible
within the containing type and the types
derived from the containing type and
what does internal say internal members
that are available anywhere within the
containing assembly so now protected
internal is a combination of protected
and internal so internal meaning the
member is available any anywhere within
the assembly and if it is also decorated
with protected access modifier then it
means that's accessible even outside the
assembly but those classes outside the
assembly should be deriving from the
containing class and the containing
class can be either in the same a zombie
or in a different assembly so if you
look at protected internal anywhere so a
protected internal member it's
accessible anywhere within the
containing assembly and from within a
derived class in any other assembly so
even classes within other assemblies
also access this as long as they are
derived from the containing class ok so
let's look at an example which hopefully
will will make it clear to you ok now
here this member ID is currently in -
now let's do this let's mark this as
protected
so if I mark it as protected internal we
know that this member is accessible
anywhere within this assembly one
project in the solution I mean within
this assembly one that is done by
internal but since I also have protected
here which means any class which is
deriving from this class also can access
that and that class can be in any other
assembly so now I have assembly to
another assembly in this assembly I have
this class what I'm going to do is I'm
going to make it inherit from assembly
one class one ok now this class is
inheriting from this class
so obviously this member is protected in
tomorrow
so this member should also be available
within this class in spite of this class
being present in another assembly but
then you can't access that on the
instance of assembly one class the way
to access that is you can simply say
base dot ID one zero one or what you can
do you can actually create an instance
of your own class assembly to class one
since this class is deriving from this
one from the principles of inheritance
whatever members you have derived here
will be available to this class so if I
create maybe a two
and when we say a 2 dot ID you should be
able to access that all right
so so the fact that you have marked it
as protected internal makes it available
within the containing assembly and to
the classes you know even if they're in
some other assemblies they can access it
provided those classes inherit from the
containing class ok that's protected
internal ok so if you look at the
definitions it's pretty clear a member
with internal access modifier is
available anywhere within the containing
assembly and it's a compile time error
it will access an internal member from
outside of the containing assembly
similarly along Guzman Blaine's
protected internal members can be
accessed by any code in the assembly in
which it is declared or from within the
derived class even if the class is
present in none another assembly it's a
combination of basically protected and
internal and if you have understood
protected and internal access modifiers
probably it should be very easy to
follow all right on this slide you can
