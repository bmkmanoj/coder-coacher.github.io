am very good this is part 57 in this
session we'll understand what is this
two string method where did that come
from and the reasons to overwrite that
now within the ordinate frame which we
know that every type directly or
indirectly inherit from system good
object class and if you look at systems
and object class it has four methods
which are actually available to every
type within dotnet for example let's say
I have a variable of type integer and
now look at this when I say number dot
you see these methods dot to string get
type get hashcode and equals these four
methods are actually defined in the base
system object class and through
inheritance they are available to every
type within dotnet alright now in this
session we will see the reasons to
override the tostring method now look at
this if I want to print this number now
what am I doing here
I'm actually converting this integer
into its string representation and if I
try to print the string representation
of an integer look at what's going to
happen it will actually convert that
properly I mean as we expect
so here it's an an integer format but
here we are converting that to string
the base implementation of the two
string properly formats this integer in
its strength string representation but
however when we have custom types you
know for example let's say I have a
class called customer
so I have a class called customer which
has got maybe a first name and a last
name so first name property which is
what we implemented similarly let's have
a last name property which is also Auto
implemented
all right so very simple class which has
got two properties now if we create an
instance of this custom type customer c1
is equal to new customer and obviously
we can initialize it
let's first and last name let's say
first name Simon and maybe last name
maybe ten Simon ten all right so we have
a custom class object now now if I say C
1.2 string okay
let's look at what's going to happen
okay now you made guess what might
actually happen look at this if it's an
integer there's no doubt you know okay
this is India format it it gives us the
string representation when they actually
print that but this is a complex type
the customer class is a complex type now
here we made the class very simple which
has got just two properties but in
reality it might have more properties
you know integer
you know customer ID date of birth etc
now when we say okay c1 got to string
what should it do which which property
should it print it will no it will not
have any idea whatsoever so obviously
something in a strange might happen when
we actually run this look at this when I
say okay convert this customer object to
its string representation what's
happening it is actually printing the
namespace dot the type name what is the
type of the c1 customer and this
customer class is present within presume
namespace so it's actually printing the
namespace dot customer I mean which is
nothing but the type name so the default
implementation of the to string that's
provided by the base system to the
object class will actually give you the
complete name of the type including the
namespace you know
that's what we get with the default
implementation but let's say you know
the requirement you know for your
project is in such a way that when
somebody calls to string on an object
they want something you know for example
maybe button here what I want is I want
maybe the customers last name comma and
then space and then his first name okay
is it possible to do that absolutely
what you got to do it here is to
override the to string method okay let's
see how to do that okay to overrate that
it's pretty simple we have already
understood that every time with in.net
framework in or directly or indirectly
in help from systems an object and
system known objects actually provides
four methods and out of those four you
can actually overwrite three of them
equals get hash code and to strain okay
in this session we'll learn how to
override the two string method look at
this is the moment I type override and
process and + space each day till is n
choose of the methods that are available
within this class to override okay so to
string so the moment I select that I get
the syntax of the overriding alright now
here what we can do is you don't have to
use the base implementation if you want
it you can do it we know that the base
implementation if we just run it like
this look at this it just the base
implementation is nothing but it prints
the complete class name including the
namespace okay now I don't want the base
implementation instead of that I want
the last name comma space and then the
first name so this class last name
plus concatenate come up with space then
the first name
alright so now if we like this you
should say last name comma space last
name so you can customize this however
you want depending on the requirement of
your project okay
generally it makes sense to overlay the
two string method you know to give you
the meaningful representation in a
string representation of a complex time
actually you can either say C 1.2 string
or you know to convert an object into it
into its string representation you can
also say you can also use the convert
clasp to string and then pass it your
custom type so now if feelin that you
know we get the same output except that
we are using convert clasp here instead
of the dot to string on that object okay
remember that you can overwrite the to
string method to give you a complex
types string representation and meaning
rather than using the default you know a
base classes implementation which will
give you the type full name you know
namespace dot the type name all right
that's it in this session on the slide
you can find some resources raised we
don't need an C sharp interview
questions thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
