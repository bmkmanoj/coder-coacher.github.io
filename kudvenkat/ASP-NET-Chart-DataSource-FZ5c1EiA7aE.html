tutorial in this video we'll discuss how
to bind database data to the asp.net
chart control using datasource property
in part 4 of this video series we
discussed how to retrieve data from the
database table and then programmatically
add that data to the chart control using
add XY method in this video we'll
discuss how to bind the same data using
datasource property we will be working
with the same example that we worked
with in part 4 so please watch part 4
before proceeding binding data to the
chart control using datasource property
is very similar to have we bind data to
any data bound control in asp.net
examples of data bound controls include
grid view drop-down list checkbox lists
radio button list etc let's flip to
visual studio this is the same example
that we worked with in part 4 notice at
the moment we are using a Dex way method
to add data to the chart control so here
first we are reading the connection
string from web config file and then we
are creating a sequel connection object
we are having a sequel query to retrieve
data from the database table we are then
opening the connection and then
executing the command so all these lines
are going to stay the way they are in
order to use the datasource property all
we need to do is change these three
lines let's actually delete these lines
now we will be adding data to the series
element that is present in the chart
control so here we have a series with
named series one now to this series we
need to specify the members for x-axis
and y-axis so on x-axis we want to
display student names so we need to
specify that to the series element and
the way we do that is by using a
property called x value member and the
column that contains the values is
student name so we are going to specify
that as the value for x value member
attribute and along the same lines we
need to specify Y value members that is
the values that we want to be displayed
on y-axis on y-axis we want total marks
to be displayed so let's specify that as
the value for y value members
attribute and all that is left now is to
specify the data source and invoke the
data bind method just like how we do it
with other data bound controls in
asp.net like grid view drop-down lists
etc so the ID of the chart control is
chart 1 dot data source equals sequel
data reader object and finally invoke
data bind method so with all these
changes let's go ahead and run our
project so notice that another data is
displayed the same way so now we are
using data source property to bind data
to the chart control at the moment we
have specified the x-value and y-value
members declaratively in the HTML markup
we can also specify them in the
code-behind file programmatically and
let's see how to do that now so if we
want to do that in the code-behind file
we need to get a reference to the series
and that is present inside the chart
control so chart 1 dot series and the
name of the series is series 1 dot x
value member equals student name
and we need to specify y-value members
as well and on y-axis we want total
marks so with these changes let's go
ahead and run the application one more
time and notice the data is displayed in
the same manner thank you for listening
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
