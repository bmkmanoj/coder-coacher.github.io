video we'll discuss using link pad tool
what is link pad link pad is a free tool
that we can download from link pad
dotnet once you are on the website there
is download now button download and
follow the on-screen instructions to
install link pad what is the use of link
pad to link pad helps us learn write and
test link queries once you have link pad
installed fire it up and then we write
and test our link queries using the
query window of link pad if you want
additional query window simply click on
file and then select new query now here
we have a straightforward link query the
first line here is creating an integer
sequence which contains numbers 1 to 10
and the LINQ query right here is
retrieving all the even numbers in that
sequence in descending order now notice
that we have dump method here that's
being invoked on the result variable
what is this dump method this dump
method is similar to consult or trade
line in a console application so in a
console application what is the use of
write line method it's going to write
the output to the console window
similarly the dump method within link
pad is going to write the results to the
results window what do you think is
going to happen if we don't have this
call to dump method and then once we
execute this link very notice that
within the results window the output is
not shown so if you want the output to
be shown then there must be a call to
the dump method so when we execute this
now notice that we get the output as
expected by the way to execute a link
query in the link pad you can either use
the screen button or use the keyboard
shortcut f5 now next to the result
button we also have lambdas equal and IL
buttons what are these this is button
displays intermediate language sequel
button displays the generated sequel
statement here in this case we don't
have any sequel because this is not
linked to sequel query this is linked to
objects so there is no associate its
sequel there but if it is linked to
sequa then it will show the generated
sequel that will be executed against the
target
database this lambda button shows the
lambda equivalent of this link query now
for the lambda equalent to be shown
simply invoke ask variable on the source
collection so we can invoke ask variable
on numbers here and notice that when we
execute this now it should choose the
lambda equivalent of this sequel like
syntax query and within the results
window we should still have the results
now we can invoke ask variable on the
source collection within the link query
itself or you can invoke it on the
source collection where it is declared
like this so you can also do this dot
ask variable and here we need to use the
VAR keyword so we're numbers which is a
new integer array so now when we execute
this it should it still shows the lambda
equivalent of this length query so you
can either invoke that ask variable on
the source collection where it is
declared or within the link very now can
we work with database using link pad
absolutely you can add a connection to a
database as well so to add a connection
all you need to do is click on add
connection and then we want to connect
the sequel server so under link pad
driver select default link to sequel and
then click Next under provider
select sequel server now we want to
connect to the sequel server that's
installed on my local machine so I am
going to use dot there and then I'm
going to use Windows authentication and
then I'm going to specify an existing
database to which I want to connect to
so this drop-down list is going to show
us all the databases that are present in
the local server installation so we want
to connect to the sample database we can
even test the connection so when we
click this button test connection notice
that connection successful so click OK
now here within this window it shows all
the entities related to the tables
within sample database so within the
sample database at the moment I have got
two tables departments and employees so
it
shows the entities related to those
tables okay notice that it shows all the
properties of each entity and in
addition to that it is also showing the
relationship between these two entities
so notice that this is a one-to-many
collection the green color the green
split arrow here indicates that there is
a one to many relationship between
department and employees now when I
click Department employees it
automatically highlights the employees
table similarly when I select Department
it automatically selects the
department's table so here this blue
split arrow indicates that it is a many
to one relationship meaning many
employees can be present in a single
department a single department can have
many - I mean many employees so this
green split arrow indicates one to many
blue split arrow indicates many to one
relationship now we can start writing
you know link to sequel queries now so
if you want some help you can simply
click on right click on that entity
notice that it also shows you some code
snippets so for example when I select
this one from E in employees where
select notice that it spits out that
code there and we can start writing our
linked queries so from E in employees
where e let's say we want all the
employee names you know that starts with
letter M and we want to sort them in
descending order so if that's the case
where a dot name dot starts with letter
M and we also want to you know sort them
in descending order so order by a dot
name descending so when we execute this
query notice that we get the two
employees whose name starts with letter
n so if you want just the name of the
person you simply say selecting dot name
so when we execute that we will get only
name now when I click on sequel
note
that it chooses the generated sequel
statement that will be executed against
the target database in this case sequel
server so here it has got a parameter
and the parameter value is M and the
wild-card symbol and it is using the
like operator there to filter the rows
from the database table so that's how we
write link to sequel queries now we can
also use link path to connect to WCF
data services at the moment there is you
know this Microsoft not when data
service available so let's say we want
to write queries against this WCF data
service so if that's the case we need to
add a connection to that WC of data
service and the way we do that is select
add connection and then now we want to
add a connection to WCF data service so
select that option click Next and then
it will ask us to enter the URI
so that's the URI for the WCF data
service so paste that there and we can
also test the connection again so
connection successful click OK now
notice that here we have got two
connections one to the sample database
and the other connection is to our WCF
data service and here are the entities
ok now we want to write some queries
against you know the stub you see of
data service so right click let's say
for example we want to retrieve some
products from this products table so
right click on that select this option
from P so it spits out that code for us
let's say we want to select all the
products you know whose name starts with
letter C maybe so where P dot and if you
want to look at the names of the
properties so P dot product name so P
dot product name dot starts with
let's say and we also want to order them
in this in ascending order order by P
dot product name in ascending order so
when we execute this we should get all
the products that start with letter C in
ascending order okay
and when we go to request log it shows
the request that is made to that WCF
service all right that's it for today
thank you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
