asp.net tutorial in this video we'll
discuss how to change grid view row
background color when a checkbox in that
row is checked let me explain what I
mean when we select a row by checking
the checkbox we want to change the
background color of that row to gray the
rules that we have not selected we want
to set their background color to white
we want to achieve this using javascript
we'll be continuing with the same
example that we worked with in part 3 of
this video series so please watch part 3
before proceeding now let's flip to
visual studio this is the same example
that we worked with in the previous
video session this javascript function
that is headed check box click this
function is called when the click event
occurs on the check box within the grid
view header when we check the header
check box all the check boxes in the
data rows of this grid view are
automatically checked when we uncheck
the header check box the check boxes in
the data are unchecked so when the rows
are selected we want their background
color to be changed to gray when they
are not selected we want the background
color to be white and we know that when
click event occurs on this check box
this is the JavaScript function that's
called and look at this it has got a
parameter this check box is the header
check box and inside the function notice
that we are looping through all the data
rows within the grid view control if
check box dot checked so basically this
check box is the header check box if
that is checked what does it mean all
the check boxes in the data rows are
also checked that means all the data
rows are selected at that point we want
to change the background color of those
selected rows to gray so if checked
property returns true then we know that
the rules are selected and at that point
we want to change the background color
to gray
so style dot background equals we can
either specify color name or color code
let's actually use color code and to
grab a get gray color we use six letters
eese else if the header check box is not
checked then we know that all of the
data row check boxes will also be
unchecked meaning the rows are not
selected in that case we want to set the
background color to white and to get
white color use six letter FS all right
so let's save these changes and reload
this page and look at this when the
rules are selected the background color
is changed to gray when they are not
selected the background color is white
but we do have a problem here look at
this when I uncheck or when I deselect
it all by unchecking the check box look
at that the background color of that row
is not set to white why is that that's
basically because when I click event
occurs on the check box in the data row
we have a separate JavaScript function
that's called and that function is this
one child check box click and notice to
this function we are passing a check box
object in this case the check box is the
check box that is present in the data
row okay and inside this function we
have a for loop where we are looping
through all the data rows and look at
this we have an if condition here if the
check the property is equal to false
then that means the checkbox is
unchecked meaning that Rho is not
selected if the row is not selected then
we want to set the background color of
that row to white so let's include six
letter F and let's include else section
and it comes to the else part of the
checkbox actually is checked so in that
case we want to set the background color
to gray all right so let's go ahead and
reload the page and look at this when I
unchecked the first row it works as
expected
but now let's uncheck the second row and
look at that it doesn't work why is that
that's basically because if you look at
this function notice that in this if
block we have a break statement so when
it is looping through each row within
the grid wheel and then when it finds a
row that has the checkbox unchecked that
means checked property is going to
return false it sets this variable to
true
it sets the background color to white
and then it executes this break
statement so what does that mean it's
going to break the for loop so any other
row that you're going to uncheck you
know it's going it's not going to
execute this piece of code for these two
rows because it has already found a row
which is unchecked and that this
condition becomes true so it executes
these two statements and the break
statement will cause that for loop to
break and that's the reason why these
rules background color is not change it
to white so if you want those rows also
you know background color also to change
to white when we uncheck the checkbox
then we have to remove this break
keyword so let's go and get rid of that
let's save the changes and look at this
when we select all and all the rows
background color is gray deselect
background color change to white I
uncheck the first row uncheck the second
row uncheck the third row now it all
works as expected
look at this when we check that back we
have the background color change to gray
and here is that function chair child
checkbox click let's look at another
example now what we want to do is when
we hover the mouse over a specific row
we want to change the font to bold and
onmouseout the phone should become
normal so when we mouse over one should
become bold and we want to make the font
bold in the entire row okay so on mouse
over the entire text in that entire row
should be bolded onmouseout it should
become normal okay so that means we need
to associate our code with onmouseover
and onmouseout events and again these
are client-side events so you can either
do it in the HTML or within the
code-behind file let's actually use code
behind file now we know that this row
data bound event of the gridview control
will be fired for each and every row
within the grid view control at that
point we can set on mouse-over event for
the row within the grid we control so e
dot Rho dot attributes dot add
onmouseover
this dot so this represents here the row
to which we are associating this event
so this dot style dot font weight is
equal to bold
similarly onmouseout this dot style dot
font weight equals normal so let's save
those changes reload the page and look
at this as we mouse over the phone
becomes bold
and as we mouse out the phone becomes
normal thank you for listening and have
a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
