Venkat this is part 62 of c-sharp video
series in this session we'll discuss
about the rules to follow when creating
partial classes before continuing with
the session I strongly recommend to
watch part 61 of this video series where
we have discussed the basics of partial
classes in c-sharp we know that a
partial class is a class that is played
across two or more physical files using
the partial keyword now when we have
these partial definitions of classes we
need to have the partial keyword on each
of the definition of that partial class
otherwise we end up getting a compiler
error let's look at that in action let's
flip to visual studio I have a simple
asp.net web application project here
let's add a class file right click on
the project click add new item and I
want to add a class file let's call this
sample partial class 1 okay so that's
the name of the file let's go ahead and
add this file and let's call the class
as sample partial class so this is a
partial class and let's add another
class file right click on the project
add new item and I'm going to call this
sample partial class 2 dot CS click add
that should add another file and let's
call this look at that this is a partial
class and the name of the class is
sample partial class and this class is
present in sample partial class 1 dot
cs5 and we have the same class here now
I have to use this partial keyword on
both of the on body parts of the class
ok so on both the parts we are using the
partial keyword so now if I build this
project it should build successfully
without any errors but on the other hand
if I remove the partial keyword here
look at this for this class in one of
the physical files you don't have the
partial keyword but in the other
physical file
you have the partial keyword okay now
let's try to compile and see what's
going to happen it will give a compiler
error saying that missing partial
modifier on the Declaration of type
sample partial class and another partial
declaration of this type exists and that
makes sense because we have a class you
know sample partial class which is a
partial class but then in the other
physical file you are saying this is not
a partial class by not using partial
keyword so it's not possible to create a
class like this that's why we get a
compiler error stating so so keep in
mind all the parts spread across
different physical files must use the
partial keyword when you're creating a
partial class all the parts spread
across different files must also have
the same access modifiers and this is
also very important to keep in mind if
we understand the basics classes
understanding you know creating partial
classes is pretty straightforward now we
know that a class can have access
modifiers classes can only have two
types of access modifiers internal and
public private protected and protected
internal cannot be used on a class so if
you are using an access modifier here we
are using let's put the partial keyword
here so that we don't get the compiler
error anymore now if you look at this on
sample partial class 1 dot CS file the
access modifier is public now let's
change the access modifier in sample
partial class 2 dot cs2 may be internal
okay now look at this you have a class
called sample partial class it's a
partial class and here you are saying
the access modifier is internal and in
this physical file you are saying it is
public ok so now which access modifier
should the compiler use it doesn't
really make sense right so that's why we
get a compiler error when we try to
build this project so it throws an error
saying that partial declarations of the
sample partial class have conflicting
access modifiers at one place you are
saying public in the other file you're
saying internal so it's conflicting with
each other that's why you have to use
the same access modifier either public
or internal on both the physical file
okay now if we build this control shift
be on the status bar you can see build
succeeded so all the parts spread across
different physical files must have the
same access modifiers if any of the
parts are declared abstract then the
entire type is considered abstract okay
that also makes sense now for example
let's say I'm saying okay this on in
this sample partial class 1 dot CS on
this physical file I'm saying ok this is
an abstract class ok but ok we have to
specify partial just before the class ok
so this is an abstract you're specifying
ok sample partial class is an abstract
partial class now I haven't specified
abstract class here abstract keyword on
sample partial + 2 dot CS physical file
but still this class will be treated as
an abstract class if you try to create
an instance of this class you know you
will get a compiler error now look at
this if any of the parts are declared
abstract then the entire type is
considered abstract ok so since we have
specified abstract in sample partial
class 1 dot CS physical file this class
is going to be an abstract class so if
we try to create an instance of that
sample partial class we will get an
error let's say obj look at that I will
not be able to do that let's see what
happens if we try to create an instance
of that let me build the solution look
at that cannot create an instance of the
abstract class but on the other hand if
I come in that and build the solution
build succeeded ok so if any of the
parts are declared abstract then the
entire type is considered abstract if
any of the parts are declared sealed
then the entire type is considered
sealed again if you just specify ok my
class is going to be sealed the class
then it's enough if you just specify it
on one of the class partial
classes then the entire type will become
a sealed class meaning this class cannot
act as a base class for any other class
okay so if I build it now control-shift
be to build the project will succeeded
now if I try to use this as a base class
for some other class let's say I'm
creating a class here and let's call it
public class let's call the class a
sample and if I try to use the sample
partial class as the base class for this
class remember that we have marked the
sample partial class as a sealed class
meaning you cannot use that as a base
class for any other class now if I try
to build a project look at that what's
going to happen let's build this
right-click and build we will get in a
compile error saying that cannot derived
cannot derive from seal type sample
partial class so if any of the parts are
declared Ste sealed then the entire type
is considered sealed if any of the parts
inherited class then the entire type
inherits that class for example let's
say I have you know the sample class for
example and then this has got a sample
method let's say public void maybe get a
data method so that's present in the
sample class and let's say we have the
sample partial class and the sample
partial class is inheriting from that
sample class okay now if I go to the web
form look at that since this partial
class that is present in sample partial
class 1 dot CS physical file is
inheriting from sample floss this class
will also automatically inherit from
that okay because essentially at the end
of the day you know at the compile time
both of these classes will be merged
together and they're going to form one
class so obviously when I try to create
an instance of this partial class and
then when I say obj dot I will get
access to that ket data method which
means both of the paths will have access
to that math
in the sense here I can in this partial
in the sample partial class 2 dot CS
file I can still be able to access that
sample class method if I want to okay
c-sharp does not support multiple class
inheritance we know that a class and
c-sharp cannot have more than one base
class at the same time if you try to do
that we get a compiler error so when it
comes to partial classes different parts
of the partial class must not specify
different base classes okay so which
means okay this is sample partial class
1 dot cs file Here I am saying okay the
base class for my partial class is
sample but here in this file we haven't
specified any base class so if I try to
build this project it should build
without any errors will succeeded on the
status bar now let's say I have let's
create another class here let's call
this public class employee so we have an
employee class here and let's say for
this partial definition of the class I'm
saying it's inheriting from the employee
class now if you look at this this
version of the partial class is
inheriting from employee and this part
of the partial class is inheriting from
sample so effectively you're saying your
partial class is going to inherit from
two classes at the same time so
obviously when I try to build this we
get a compiler that are saying we cannot
do that partial declarations of sample
partial class must not specify different
base classes and that makes sense
because c-sharp doesn't support multiple
class inheritance ok
so let's get rid of that and now if I
build the solution build succeeded on
the status bar
different parts of the partial class can
specify different base interfaces and
the final type implements all of the
interfaces listed by all of the partial
declarations and that also makes sense
for example let's say I have this
partial class let's actually create two
interfaces first so that we can inherit
from them let's call this AI employee
for example and let's call this AI
customer interface and let's say this
interface is having a method called void
employee method and let's say AI
customer interface is having a method
called our customer method okay
now we have two physical files which
have scored the sample partial class
let's say the sample partial class is in
implementing AI employee interface and
this sample partial class is
implementing I customer interface and if
you remember if a class inherits from an
interface then the class has to provide
implementation for all the interface
members now keeping in mind this is a
partial class look at that one part of
the partial class is implementing AI
employee interface and the other part of
the sample virtual class is implementing
I customer interface now the net effect
is the sample partial class is simply
has to implement both the member beaudy
interface members meaning they have to
implement employee method as well as
customer method and let's say you know
this part of the sample partial class is
implementing I employee
interface let's say void that's employee
method
okay right so it has implemented that
method now let me build this project as
you might expect we will get a compiler
error now okay why because the sample
partial class is implementing two
interfaces one is I employee and the
other one is I customer but if you look
at this we only have implemented
employee I employee interface method we
haven't implemented I customer method
that's why we get an error
partial declaration of sample partial
class must not specify different base
classes we are getting an error okay
these are interfaces so let's call them
interface instead of class we should
have done that first okay now let's
build a solution okay that makes sense
now
look at that a do demo dot sample
partial class does not implement
interface member i customer customer
method we have already implemented the
employee myth but the sample partial
class which is inheriting from I
customer hasn't provided the
implementation for the customer method
that's present within this interface now
we can implement that method either in
this sample bla I mean in this part of
the partial class or you can do it here
if you want to okay let's do it here for
example and see if it works
so public void and if you remember the
name of the method is customer method so
let's copy that and paste it here okay
now let's compile the solution and see
if it works build look at that will
succeeded though they are spread across
two physical files you know here this
this part of the sample partial class is
implementing ike is inheriting from i
customer interface but then we provided
the implementation for this interface
method in the other physical file where
we have the same partial class but still
it works now I can take this if I want I
can take this employee method from here
look at this sample partial class is
implementing I employee interface
but then in this version of the class I
don't have the I employee interface
method implemented I am going to
implement that here but still it will
work without any problem because the net
effect here is the sample partial class
is it in implementing I customer and I
employee interfaces and if you look at
both of these two physical files they
are providing the implementation for
both the interface members that's why we
don't get the compiler error it really
doesn't care whether you have provided
implementation in this file or in this
file at compile time it's going to
combine both of these classes it checks
okay this sample partial class is
implementing I customer and I employee
interfaces so is it providing
implementation for all the interface
members if the answer to that question
is yes the class will be successfully
compiled without any issues
and that's what is happening at the
moment so different parts of the partial
class can specify different base
interfaces and the final type implements
all of the interface listed interfaces
listed by all of the partial
declarations any members that are
declared in a partial definition are
available to all of the other parts of
the partial class and that makes sense
for example here you know this partial
class is spread across two physical
files let's say I have in this partial
class maybe public void let's call this
method one maybe and let's copy the same
thing and put that in the other physical
file and I have another method here and
let's call this method two so which
means now this is single partial class
at compile time we know that these
partial classes will be merged into one
class so obviously when I try to create
an instance of this class you know and
then I will be able to access method 1
method to employ a method customer
method you know all these methods not
only that this version of the partial
class it can access you know the members
that we have defined here and whereas
this partial flask can access members
that are defined
in this class okay so each partial
classes can access members define in the
other parts so any members that are
declared in a partial definition are
available to all of the other parts of
the partial class on this slide you can
