tutorial in this video well discuss the
significance of the base edge ref
element in angular when setting up
routing in our angular application we
first define the base path using the
space H ref element the base h of
element tells the angular router how to
compose the navigation urls on what
local development machine we typically
set it to a single four slash like this
this means all over navigation URLs now
will be relative to the root of the
application so for example when we click
on this list navigation menu item its
corresponding path list is appended to
the root URL and the root URL here is
localhost colon for the 204 slash and
along the same lines when I click on
this create navigation menu item the
part create is again appended to the
root URL so since we have said the base
href element to a single four slash all
the urls now are relative to the root of
the application another important point
to keep in mind about this base h ref
element is that browser user set to
prefix relative URLs when referencing
CSS files javascript files images etc
let's actually prove this by launching
browser developer tools at the moment we
are on the create round let's change the
route to list so we can also see the
images we are on this sources tab and if
you look at the images folder it's
inside assets and if we expand the
images folder we can see all those three
images we are referencing on this page
and notice this folder is actually
relative to the root URL localhost colon
4200 and why is it relative to the root
URL because we have set of a base path
to a single four slash along the same
lines all our JavaScript bundle files
that is the inline bundle main bundle
polyfills etc all of these are again
relative to the root URL in a bit we'll
see how things will change if
said the space-age development to
something else other than the single for
/aa our local development machine we
typically set the base HOF element value
to a single four slash this means all
the URLs are now relative to the root of
the application however on a production
server we typically deploy our
application to a subfolder for example
if we have deployed our application to a
subfolder called EMP then we may set the
base path to EMP when we do this all the
URLs now will be relative to that base
path EMP so for example if your server
name is server name then the URLs will
be something like this HTTP colon 4/4
slash server name for slash the base
part that we have set EMP in this case
for slash and the name of the page that
you are on for example if you are on the
list page then list similarly if you
navigate to the create page then this
part create will be relative to this
base path EMP along the same lines all
the JavaScript files images style sheets
all of them will also be relative to
this base path EMP will prove that in
just a bit
we already discussed during development
on our local development machine we
usually set the base href element to a
single four slash now if you want to set
this to something else other than single
four slash it's not enough if we just do
that change within our index dot HTML
when we run our project using the ng
self command
we also have to use the base href option
along with that ng serve command when I
initially ran this project I didn't use
that base edge of option so this is not
going to work as expected at the moment
our server is running in watch mode so
whatever changes we have saved just now
those are automatically picked up and
compiled so if we take a look at the
browser notice we don't see anything on
the page and we can see we've got five
errors so when we click on the console
tab we can see we have errors loading
the JavaScript bundle files to fix the
let's stop the server and then let's
execute ng serve - Oh command along with
the base HOF option so we want our base
edge RAF to be for /tmp for slash there
we go our application is working as
expected
at the moment we are on the list page
and noticed that path list is relative
to the base path
EMP similarly when we navigate to the
create page notice that part create is
relative to the base path EMP now let's
launch browser developer tools click on
the sources tab and notice our images
and all of our JavaScript bundle files
they are now relative to the space part
EMP on a local development machine we
usually set the base hf element value to
a single four slash however when we take
our application to a production server
we may deploy it to a subfolder called
EMP when we do that we will have to
remember to update the base href element
value index dot HTML before we deploy
our application to the production server
otherwise it may not work as expected
and there are two ways we can do this
one way is obviously to manually update
the index dot HTML page before we deploy
our application the other approach is to
use the base HRF option along with the
ng Pelt command this is going to
automatically update the index dot HTML
page let's actually prove that let's
change this to a single four slash like
we typically do on a developer machine
save our changes at the moment of our
server is still running so let's stop
our server and then let's build our
angular project let's do a production
build so let's use ng build and we want
to be a broad belt so I'm going to use
the products in and we also want to set
the base htough option and let's set it
to four slash EMP four slash and
remember at the moment within our index
dot HTML
a single four slash so let's execute
this Benjy build command our build is
complete now it should have generated
the dist folder and the dist folder will
contain our build file so if we look in
the destroyer notice here we have got
our index dot HTML and that's actually
format this so to format it right click
on it and select this option for my
document and if we look at the base href
element notice it is set to four /tmp
four slash as expected thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
