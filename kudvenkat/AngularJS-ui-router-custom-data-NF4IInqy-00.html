in this video we'll discuss how to add a
custom data to a state in angular to add
custom data to a state we use data
property in the example right here we
are adding some custom data to our home
state using the data property notice the
value for the data property is a
JavaScript object at the moment this
javascript object has got two properties
custom data 1 and custom data 2 as you
can see the values are home state custom
data 1 and home state custom data 2
along the same lines we are also adding
some custom data to our courses state
so first let's add this custom data
let's flip to visual studio first let's
add some custom data to our home state
for that I'm going to use the data
property the value for this is going to
be a JavaScript object so the first
property is going to be custom data 1
and the value for this is going to be
home state custom data 1 similarly let's
add another property the name of the
property here is going to be custom data
2 and the value is going to be home
state custom data 2 along the same lines
let's also add some custom data to our
courses state the values are going to
change slightly for custom data 1 the
value is going to be courses state
custom data 1 and for custom data to
property the value is going to be course
estate custom data 2 now this custom
data is available in all the controller
functions by default now what we want to
do is retrieve this custom data from the
home controller function and then
display this custom data on the home
view so let's go to our home controller
function now to read the custom data we
are going to use the state service so
let's inject that into our controller
function now I'm going to expose
properties for the view so this dot I'm
going to call this home custom data 1
and now we want to read home state
custom data so I'm going to use the
state service
and then I'm going to use the current
property of the state service which is
going to return as the current state and
if you look at our home state they using
data property to expose that custom data
so on the current property I am going to
use that data property and then the name
of our property is custom data one so we
are accessing home state custom data
from the home controller function so
when we use the current property it's
going to return us the current state
which is nothing but the home state and
then on that we use the data property
and then custom data 1 which is the name
of the custom data property within that
JavaScript object so let's do the same
thing for custom data to property and
here the property is going to be custom
data to now from the same home
controller function I also want to
access courses state custom data and we
do that slightly differently so let's
make a copy of that and what I'm going
to do is change the property name here
for the view I'm going to call it
courses custom data 1 and when I use the
current property on the state service
it's going to return as the current
state that is the home state but this
time we want course a state custom data
to do that we use a different function
and that is get function and to this
function we pass the name of the state
that we want and we want courses state
so this is going to return as the
courses state and on that we use the
data property and then the name of the
property custom data one so let's do the
same thing for custom data too so here
the property name is going to be courses
custom data two and the custom data two
property is custom data too all right so
all these properties all these full
properties should be available in the
view so let's go to our home view home
dot HTML and let's use two field sets to
display home state custom data and
course estate custom data so I'm going
to use a field set here
let's use a legend and the legend for
this is going to be home and first we
want to display custom data one and we
are going to use the binding expression
now since we are using controller as
syntax we have to use home controller
home ctrl dot and then the name of the
property that we have exposed the
property that we have exposed is home
custom data 1 so that's what we pasted
here let's include an HTML break and
then custom data 2 so that fields that
is going to display home state custom
data let's include another field set
which will display courses state custom
data so I'm going to name this courses
and custom data 1 and if you look at the
name of the property here it is courses
custom data 1 so let's copy and paste
that right here and let's paste it here
as well and change the property name
course this custom data too all right
let's save all these changes now when we
reload this view we should see custom
state data so first we say home state
custom data and then we see in another
field set courses state custom data so
to access state custom data from its own
controller so in our case to access in
our home state custom data from home
controller function we have used the
current property of the state service
and then dot data and then the custom
property name and to access state custom
data from a different controller in our
example we try to access course the
state custom data from home controller
function and we did that by using the
get function on the state service we
specify the name of the state and then
we use the data property and then the
custom property name and here is that
example which we have just seen and
finally to display the custom state data
on the view this is the code that we
have written
thank you for listening and have a great
