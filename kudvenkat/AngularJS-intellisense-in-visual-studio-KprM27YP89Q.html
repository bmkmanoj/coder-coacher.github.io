this video we'll discuss how to get
better
intellisense for angular in Visual
Studio this is continuation to power 28
so please watch part 28 before
proceeding
so in our script or JS file we already
have a reference to angular dot min dot
J's let's also add a reference to
angular route dot min Jas so basically
we are adding references to those files
to get some intelligence within visual
studio so on the angular object when I
plus dot and when I type module and open
the bracket notice we are getting
intellisense but then when I do the same
thing on this route provider service
which is injected into this config
function we don't get that intellisense
look at this when I type dot and when I
type van look at that I'm not getting
any intelligence here okay so we have
some form of intelligence for angular
individual studio but that's definitely
not good enough for these injected
services for example for route provider
look at that we are not getting any
intelligence at all so there are three
simple steps to get better intelligence
for angular in visual studio the first
step is to download angularjs extension
for visual studio from this link right
here I am already on that URL so when we
navigate to that URL the angularjs
extension script opens in the web page
so let's select all this copy it and
paste it in a notepad and I'm going to
save this notepad with this name angular
dot intellisense dot GS and I'm going to
save it to downloads folder in C Drive
that's our first step
the second step is to place that angular
JS extension file in a special directory
on our computer and that special
directory is
sequel and Program Files Microsoft
Visual Studio 12 Java Script references
so let's navigate to that directory c
colon program files Microsoft Visual
Studio 12 JavaScript references so we
need to place this file into that
special directory so let's paste it and
when we
do it it asks us for our permission
click continue so now we have that
angular JS extension script file within
that special directory that's our second
step and the third step is to drag and
drop these two files within our script
or J's file where we are writing over
angular code we have already done that
so at this point look at that when I go
to the angular object and when I plus
dot we get you know the same level of
intelligence there and when we go to the
injected service that is taller route
provider for example and when I type dot
look at that we have intelligence even
there when you know it shows up the
parameters similarly when I type dot
otherwise we get the intelligence there
as well so these are the three simple
steps to get better intelligence for
angular in Visual Studio thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
