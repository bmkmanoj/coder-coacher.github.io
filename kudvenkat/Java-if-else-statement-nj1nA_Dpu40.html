our video tutorials on Java programming
language in this tutorial we are going
to learn about control statements
control statements in java essentially
control the flow of execution by this
what I mean is depending upon a
condition to be true or false we might
change our flow of execution in Java
programming language there are multiple
control flow statements and they are
bucketed into selection or looping or
branching in selection bucket we have F
then if then else and switch statements
which will be focused in this tutorial
in looping we will also learn about
files divided and for loops there are
other versions of loops also in latest
versions of Java programming language
but we are going to focus on while the
while and for loop in this course then
we also have break and continue as two
constructs in our programming language
that allow us to break or continue or
branch from the regular course of action
now let's focus on if conditions now if
condition is something that allows you
to detect the validity or truthfulness
of a condition and depending upon it it
allows you to execute either of the
course of action either the statement
set 1 a 2 a execute or statement set 1 B
to be execute or to put it in simple
manner this statement is essentially
telling a program to execute a certain
section of code only if a particular
condition evaluates to true right now
what I am showing you on the slide is
general most general syntax of if
statement right note that the opening
and closing braces that you are seeing
here are optional when they depend there
is single statement right and the second
thing is the else part is completely
optional
now let's see this in action so we will
create a new project let's name it
JT zero zero eight and let's create a
new package comm dot cleaning dot java
now contour training dot java already
exists so so what we are going to do is
we will try to reuse this and create our
if demo here now now let's start of
taking input from user so that we are
also revising what we had studied in our
three base tutorials
so here I am asking scanner to input or
to consume the next token as an integer
into variable X now I am using if
condition here is X equal to 5 then
so let's execute this program I enter a
number let's see 6 it says that X is
more 5 and if I execute it again and if
I enter 5 it becomes happy and save X is
5 now note that if I want to print
something more after this then you will
also that if I enter place is 6 it says
that X is not 5 please enter 5 and if
you remove these braces then also the
program is a valid program but you will
observe that when I enter 5 it executes
system dot out it's 5 but it also
executed system dot out println
please enter 5 therefore braces are
important and I would suggest you to
always keep braces even if there is
single statement the reason of this
output was after else Java recognized
only one statement as part of if s
condition however system dot out dot
println
please enter 5 was always executed I
hope this is clear now let's understand
that there are other variants of ifs
also if is a general construct where you
can nest if within each other now there
are multiple ways to nest if within each
other for example let me use multiple
comments here and let's say under let us
understand different forms so first form
is you can have a if condition and then
you can have uh nested-if here side and
here you can have L now this is first
form of if statement where in a single
if you you have a nested if s condition
now there is also another form which is
formed to where you have a condition if
you have its L spot and then you also
have FX condition in only in the first
part and not in the second part right
similarly you can have a phase condition
only near spot but not in E spot and you
can have in both so this is what is
shown here that you can have nested if
statements right and if you have more
than one statement here then you need to
use basis a single if-else statement can
be considered as single statement for
outer is now one of the example could be
you are calculating the grade where it's
numbers are greater than 200 or if score
is less than to 400 that means they quit
lies between 200 and 400 and if it is
greater than 300 then the grade is 1 or
as greatest 2 and so on
you can also have multiple levels of
nesting you can have conditional
conditional if one followed by
conditional F 2 and so on
for example if number is greater than 0
and if number is less than 20 and if it
is
divisible by two then you can say that a
number is between 0 and 29 days even so
in this tutorial we learnt about control
statements water control statements of
in terms of selection statements
hydration statements and branching we
understood what is offense condition its
syntax and we also created a sample
program where we took an input from the
user
and we found out whether that number was
5 or not I would suggest you to create a
program which takes two numbers from the
user number one and number two and then
it prints the larger of two of them here
you will use the if condition to find
out if number is number one is greater
than number two then print your first
number was greater or your second number
was greater I hope you enjoyed our video
