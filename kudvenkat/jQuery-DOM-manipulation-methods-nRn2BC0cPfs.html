this video we'll discuss water jQuery
Dom manipulation methods and how to set
retrieve and remove attribute values
using jQuery so what are jQuery Dom
manipulation methods jQuery Dom
manipulation methods manipulate the Dom
that is the document object model in
some manner or the other the URL right
here has got the complete list of jQuery
Dom manipulation methods so here are
those manipulation methods which
manipulate the Dom in some manner or the
other we have already discussed some of
these methods we discussed value method
in our previous video sessions what is
this method going to do this is going to
get or set the value of all matching
elements we also have discussed this
HTML method what is this going to do
this gets or sets the HTML of all
matching elements in this video we are
going to discuss this
attr method what is the use of this
method this method is used to get our
set the attribute value of all matching
elements so let's understand how to use
this method with an example let's flip
to visual studio so here we have got two
developments and notice both the
developments have got title attribute
now we want to retrieve the title
attribute value of all these
developments so within our jQuery very
function so we are going to use a
selector which is going to give us all
developments and we want the title
attribute value so we are going to make
use of attr function if you look at this
method it has got two parameters name
and value now we want title attribute
value so that's the name of the
attribute now here we are trying to
retrieve the attribute value so when you
want to retrieve the attribute value you
only specify one parameter that is the
name parameter in this case we want the
title attribute value so the name is
going to be title now if you want to set
an attribute value that's when you
specify both the parameters for example
if I want to set the title attribute
value to ABC you know I specify both the
parameters but here I want to just
retrieve the title attribute value so
I'm going to specify only the first
parameter okay now let's go ahead and
use JavaScript
alert function to alert the title
attribute value so what do we expect
here now there are two developments so
we expect both the developments title
attribute to be alerted but let's look
at what's going to happen so let's save
the changes and reload this page look at
this we get the first development title
but we don't get the second development
title why is that that's because by
default when you are using the attr
function to retrieve an attribute value
and if you call that on the jQuery
collection object this is going to
return the title attribute value of only
the first matching development now if
you want to retrieve the title attribute
value of all the matching developments
then you will have to loop through each
of them using jQuery each function so
let's see how to do that so this
selector dollar death is going to give
us all the developments so we are going
to use this jQuery each function to loop
through each element and as we are
iterating over each element to refer to
the element that we are currently
iterating over we use the J I mean this
keyword and then on that we are going to
call the attr function we want to
retrieve the title attribute and let's
alert the title attribute value using
javascript alert function right so let's
save those changes now when we reload
look at this we get the first div title
and second div title so we have seen how
to retrieve the attribute values now
let's see how to set the attribute
values so let's leave this code as it is
now at the moment these developments
have already got a title and the design
time we have specified that for the
first David's might've one for second
day of my div - now let's change that to
some other title and to do that we are
again going to find all the developments
and we are going to use the attr
function so now we want to set the title
attribute so we have to specify both the
parameters so title attribute
and the value for the title attribute is
going to be nav div title so what is
this going to do this attr function is
going to implicitly iterate over each
development and then set the title
attribute of all the developments to new
div title and then here we have the code
to loop through and then retrieve the
title attribute so when we reload this
we expect the title of both the
developments to be negative title that's
for the first day and that's for the
second div so if we want to set the same
value for all the elements then you
don't have to loop through but if you
want to set a different value depending
on the development for example let's say
for the first day we want the title
attribute to be the one title and for
the second day we want the title
attribute to be two titles so a
different title attribute value for
different divs so if you have to do that
then you will have to loop through each
element so I'm going to loop through
again using the each function and dollar
this so on that we are going to call the
attr function so we want to set the
title attribute and we want the value
for the first div to be div one title so
div space and how do we get that number
now look at this here we are using the
jQuery each function so this is the
callback function so to this callback
function I'm going to pass the parameter
so what is this going to contain this is
going to contain the index of the
element that we are currently iterating
over so the index of the element within
this collection is going to start at
zero but for the first day we want the
div title to be div one title so we want
to increment the value of I by one so
here I'm going to say I plus one so if I
value is zero then we're incrementing it
by one if it is 1 then we will increment
it by two okay so for first div it will
be d 1 and 2 dot we also want to append
this word
title so all this together is the value
for title attribute okay and that's it
so let's save the changes and and we
reload this look at this we get div one
title for the first day
they've two title for the second day so
if you want to set the same value then
you don't have to loop through but if
you want to set a different value you
will have to loop through and within
that loop you compute the value that you
want and set it to the title attribute
now if you look at this code right here
look at this you know we can cache
whatever this selector returns to
improve the performance of this code so
what we can basically do is put this in
a variable like this where divs equals
that and then use the variable okay so
we can do the same thing here now when
we reload this the behavior should be
the same so Devon title div two title
all right now let's see how to use JSON
object to set multiple attribute values
at the same time so we want to do it in
one shot we want to set title style and
name attributes all in one shot let's
see how to do that using a JSON object
we discussed what Jason is in the
previous sessions of this video series
so basically I am first going to create
a variable adjacent object let's
actually call this config now JSON
object
you know begins and ends with the curly
brace and what are the attributes that
we want to say if we want to set title
attribute we want to set that to new
Dave title and we also want to set this
style attribute and we want to set this
to basically we want to set border
so style attribute value is going to be
border and we want this border to be 3
pixel solid red and let's also set name
attribute and let's have name at to be
to my deaf okay so we have three
attributes and the values in this JSON
object now what we want to do is find
all the developments and then on that
I'm going to call attr and then to this
function I'm going to pass our JSON
object so what is this going to do this
is going to implicitly iterate all
developments and set these attributes on
all the developments okay and let's do
another thing instead of displaying the
attribute names and the values in a
JavaScript alert let's actually disk you
know display them in a span element so
let's include an HTML break here and
let's include another HTML break between
both the developments and then here a
span element and we're going to use the
span element to display the result so
let's call this result span all right so
now what we want to do is create a
variable here let's name it result and
let's initialize that to an empty string
all right so result plus equals so what
we want to do is we want to loop through
all the developments and then retrieve
the attributes that we're setting title
style name you know the attribute names
and the values and display them within
the span element so we want to loop
through each development so I'm going to
use the div selector and use the each
function
so within that result plus equals the
first thing that we want to display is
title attribute value so title equals
whatever is the title attribute value so
how are we going to get the title
attribute value we can refer to the
element that we are currently iterating
over by using this keyword and then we
can use the attr function if we have set
this title attribute successfully we
should get that value so we want title
attribute value and to that lets append
an HTML break all right so let's make
two more copies of this next we want the
style attribute value and here to the
attr function let's pass tile and
finally we want name and name attribute
value since this is the last attribute
let's include an additional HTML break
here so each div element will have a
separate line okay
so we have built the result string now
let's display this result string within
this span element so span element has
got an ID so let's use the jQuery ID
selector and the jQuery ID selector is
hash and the element that we want to
find is result span let's call the HTML
method and pass our result variable all
right so what are we doing in this code
so basically we're using the JSON object
to set these three properties and then
to the attr function we are passing our
JSON object which is going to implicitly
iterate over each development and set
these three attributes and then we are
looping through each element and then
returning the title style and name
attribute values and displaying that
within the span element so let's save
the changes and when we reload look at
that we get the red border and when I
hover the mouse over look at that new
div title the title attribute value is
displayed as a tooltip and look at this
within the
and element we've got the title style
and name attribute so now here if we
look at this code you know we are first
creating the JSON object and we are then
passing this variable to the attr
function but we are not using this
variable anywhere else so what you can
do here is specify this JSON object in
line with in the attr function itself
instead of creating a separate object
first and then passing that object so
what I mean is I can take this jQuery
object a JSON object and remove that
variable and specify the JSON object in
line here within the attr method now the
behavior should be exactly the same
except that we don't have the need to
create that you know variable because we
are using it just one time so why create
an object first and then pass that
object instead create the object in line
like this another way to set multiple
attributes is by using method chaining
we discussed method chaining the
previous video sessions look at this on
the div selector we're calling attr
function so that's going to get the set
the title attribute and then whatever
this method returns on that we are
setting the style attribute and whatever
that method returns we are setting the
name attribute okay so here we using
method chaining here we are using JSON
object to set multiple attributes
finally let's see how to remove an
attribute using jQuery remove a TDR
function so basically here we are saying
find all developments with title
attribute and remove the title attribute
so let's look at this in action so at
the moment these developments have
caught title attribute right so now what
we want to do is first let's create a
variable let's call this result and
let's say div elements with title
attribute
equals now we want to find the number of
developments with title attribute and to
do that we are going to use this jQuery
selector so find all developments with
title attribute and we can use the
length property okay and to that lets
append an HTML break okay and then
result plus equals let's remove title
attribute so let's say removing title
attribute and let's append an HTML break
and to remove the title attribute we're
going to say okay find all developments
with title attribute and let's call
remove attr function and we want to
remove title attribute and finally
result plus equals let's find the
developments with title attribute okay
so before we remove the title attribute
you know developments with title
attribute should be to after we remove
the title attribute the count should be
zero and then we are finding the span
element and then displaying the result
within that so let's look at this in
action let's reload this page and look
at this before we remove the title
attribute we have two elements with
title attribute after we remove it in
our developments with title attribute is
zero so this removed the title attribute
from the development thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
