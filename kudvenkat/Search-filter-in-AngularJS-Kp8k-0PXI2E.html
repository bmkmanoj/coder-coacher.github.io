this video we'll discuss how to
implement search in angular using this
search filter so here is what we want to
do notice just about this employees
table we have this search employees text
box as we type in the search text box
all the columns in this table must be
searched and only the matching rows
should be displayed let's see how easy
it is to implement the search
functionality let's slip to Visual
Studio so within our script dot JS file
we have our controller function and
notice within this function we have this
array employees which at the moment
contains five employee objects and
notice each employee object has got name
gender salary and City properties we're
then attaching this employee's array to
the dollar scoop object using this
employee's variable which is going to be
the model and then with another view
which is HTML page one dot HTML we're
using this table element to display the
employee's notice within the table you
have called this tee head section which
at the moment contains four th elements
to display the column editors name
general salary and city and then within
tee body section we are looping through
each employee object in the employee's
array which is a model and then binding
to name gender salary and city
properties of the employee object as we
are looping through so if we view this
HTML in the browser this is how the
employee data is displayed now just
about this employees table we want this
search employee's text box so let's go
ahead and type the required HTML for
that so just about this table element
I'm going to first include this literal
text search followed by that an input
element input type equals text and I'm
going to include this placeholder
attribute and set the value of that to
search employees and I'm also going to
include this ng - model directive and
let's have that to search text at the
moment we don't have this variable
already on the scope object but as we
type into this text box whatever value
we type you know that value
we'll be stored in this property and
this property will be dynamically
attached to the dollar scope object by
angular and then if we have any other
element binding to that variable you
know the value that we type into the
textbox will be automatically available
for that other element thanks to two-way
data-binding in angular let's include
two brake elements between the search
text box and the table so that there is
some space between those two now let's
go ahead and reload this page so notice
we have our search employee's text box
at the moment when we type you know
something into the text box nothing is
going to happen since we have specified
ng - model directive on this input
element this variable will automatically
be added to the dollar scope object and
whatever we have typed into that text
box you know will be stored in that
variable and then we can use this search
text variable on any other element so
I'm going to use it along with ng-repeat
directive so I want to use angular
filter here so I'm going to separate
this expression with a pipe character
and then the name of the filter is
filter and the value for this filter is
going to come from this variable search
text okay so let's save our changes
and look at this when we reload this
page and as we type look at this when I
type for example F so letter F is
present in gender column of the
employees table so these are the two
matching rows and we see them and if I
type for example letter L letter L is
present you know for all the five
employees records in the gender column
so that's why all the five records are
displayed but if I type O so L o is
present only in the city column so only
these three London employees are
displayed so we have search
functionality you know built into a page
and look at the amount of code that we
have to write just the search text box
and this filter expression right here we
are done now at the moment
you know as we type into this text box
we are typing across every column in
this employees table now let's say I
want to search for example only within
the city column if that's what you want
to do there is one simple change that
you have to do so on this ngmodel
directive you know we have search text
I'm going to use dot city property on
that let's save the changes and when we
reload this look at that when I type L
now the first character L within the
city column we have in London so that's
what we see now it's searching only the
city column now if I type for example
see look at that within the city column
we have C and CH E is present in the
city column and only those two are
displayed now if I type letter M within
the city column we don't have any of the
rows with letter M Chennai or London
cities doesn't have letter M in them so
that's why none of the rows match and
nothing is displayed so here we have the
controller code here we have the view
code and finally the styles that are
applied thank you for listening and have
a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
