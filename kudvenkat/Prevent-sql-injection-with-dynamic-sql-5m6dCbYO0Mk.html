tutorial in this video we'll discuss how
to prevent sequel injection when using
dynamic sequel in our previous video we
have implemented this search page using
dynamic sequel to build our dynamic
sequel statements abused parameters this
is an example of good dynamic sequel
implementation this code as it stands is
immune for sequel injection in this
video let's look at an example of bad
dynamic sequel implementations I've seen
many software developers not just the
beginners but even experienced software
developers building their dynamic sequel
statements by concatenating user input
values instead of using parameters
without realizing that they're opening
doors for sequel injection let's rewrite
this code to build our dynamic sequel
statements by concatenate in user input
values and then see how it is prone to
sequel injection so let's make a copy of
this line and then comment these three
lines of code so the moment the query we
have a select star from employees where
1 equals 1 and then if the user has
provided a value within the first name
textbox we want to append you know this
condition here and first name equals
instead of using the parameter here I'm
going to concatenate the value the user
has provided in the first name textbox
directly to the string so let's retrieve
the value from the textbox and append it
to the string which is going to you know
include that and condition for us so
here we are building our dynamic sequel
statements by concatenating the user
input value and remember first-name is
an inverted column and we need to wrap
that within single quotes so the single
quote begins here we have the value from
the textbox and we need to end a single
cord and if the user has typed something
into the last name gender and salary
columns we need to add those as well so
let's do the same thing for those
columns as well comment these three
conditions for last name gender and
salary and let's build those three
conditions by concatenating the use of
input values that the user has typed
into those respective text boxes one
important thing to note here is that the
salary column is an integer column so we
don't have to wrap this calorie column
value within single quotes so with these
changes let's run the project by
pressing ctrl f5 and see how it is prone
to sequel injection
let's also run a new sequence of trades
I have the sequence of profiler running
already let's start a new trace and
let's provide a value for first name we
have the marks record as expected now
let's look at the query that's captured
in sequel server profiler look at the
query here select star from employees
where one equals one and first name
equals whatever value we typed in the
first name textbox so here we are
building our dynamic sequel statement by
concatenating the values that the user
has entered in the user input controls
with this string now this is dangerous
it's very easy to inject sequel using
this webpage now imagine what's going to
happen if I type something like this if
I type a single quote what is this going
to do this is going to close this single
quote that we have opened so at that
point the query is going to be select
star from employees where one equals one
and first name equals an empty string
and then after that technically I have
any command that we want for example we
can even have something like this drop
database sales dB
notice here we have got a database
called sales TV and I'm trying to drop
that by injecting the sequel here drop
database ASDB now if we execute this as
it is now we are going to get an error
because we have a none closed single
quote here but we can very easily
in that now look at this when I click
search button at this point we get
another unclosed quotation mark after
the character string now what we can do
is include the common characters - - so
this is going to comment that unclosed
quotation mark so now when we execute
this look at that the command completed
and if you look at what we have captured
in sequence of a profiler they'll give a
command here select star from employees
where one equals one and first name
equals an empty string and then we have
this command drop database sales DB and
we have that single quote commented and
if you look at the object Explorer here
CH DB is still present but when we
refresh the database folder notice sales
DB is gone it's no longer there the
reason we are able to inject sequel here
is because of the way we have
implemented this dynamic sequel we
should never ever concatenate user input
values to build our dynamic sequel
statements this is an example of bad
dynamic sequel implementations on the
other hand if we use parameters to build
our dynamic sequel statements we will
not have this sequel injection problem
let's actually prove that let's comment
this line and uncomment these three
lines right here similarly let's comment
these three F blocks where we are
concatenated user input values to build
our dynamic sequel statements and let's
uncomment these three F blocks where we
are using parameters to build up a
dynamic sequel statements let's run the
application one more time by pressing
ctrl f5 in the first name text box let's
type mark and click search notice we get
marks record as expected now let's see
what's captured in sequel profiler look
at the command right here select star
from employees where one equals one and
first name equals at first name and a
value for this parameter is whatever
value that we have typed in the
name text-box so anything that you type
into this text box is now treated as a
value for at first name parameter so
this makes our code immune to secret
injection let's actually prove that
first let's go back to object Explorer
and let's create a new database let's
call our database sales DB click OK so
we have the sales DB database created
here now let's go back and inject the
same sequel that we have injected
earlier let's click search now first of
all notice we don't have any search
results displayed and loots look at
sequel server profiler the data command
right here
checks are from employees where 1 equals
1 and first-name equals at first name
and now the value for this at first name
parameter is whatever we have typed in
the text box so this entire string is
the value for first name parameter and
since we don't have any employee whose
first name is test the page displays no
results but the important thing to keep
in mind here is that this command
drop database sales DB is not executed
and as a result we didn't lose our sales
DB database so if i refresh the
databases folder notice we still have
the sales DB database we also don't have
this problem of sequel injection if we
are using store procedures if you
recollect in one of our previous videos
we have implemented this page search
page without dynamic sequel and this
page is making use of this tool
procedure SP search employees so let's
navigate to that page the name of the
page is search page without dynamic
sequel and let's inject the same sequel
let's click the search button notice we
don't get any results and let's look at
the profiler look at the command right
here execute SP search employees let's
go to parameter X first name and the
value for that parameter is whatever we
have typed in the first name textbox and
if you look at object Explorer you still
have our sales DB so when we refresh
this
notice the sales DB is still there but
one important thing to keep in mind is
that in your procedure if you are
creating dynamic sequel statements by
concatenating user input values then
your store procedure is still prone to
sequel injection if this is not clear at
the moment don't worry we'll discuss an
example of this in our next video
finally let's quickly recap what we have
discussed so far
dynamic sequel provides great
flexibility when implementing
complicated logic that lot of
permutations and combinations always use
parameters to build your dynamic sequel
statements which prevents sequel
injection never ever rely on
concatenating user input values to build
your dynamic sequel statements it opened
doors for sequel injection stop seizures
are also prone to sequel injection if
you're building dynamic sequel
statements inside store procedures by
concatenating user input values instead
of using parameters we'll discuss an
example of this in our next video using
parameters to build dynamic sequel
statements not only prevents sequel
injection but also increases performance
by Z using the cached query plans we'll
discuss an example of this in a later
video and here we have the area dotnet
code where we have built our dynamic
sequel statements by concatenating user
input values that open the doors for
sequel injection thank you for listening
