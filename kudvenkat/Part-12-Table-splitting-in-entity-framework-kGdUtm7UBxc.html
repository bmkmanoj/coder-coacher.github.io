tutorial in this video we'll discuss the
concept of table splitting and entity
framework with database first approach
we discussed entity splitting in detail
in parts 10 and 11 of this video series
energy splitting refers to mapping an
entity to two or more tables when the
tables share a common came notice here
we are mapping this employee entity to
these two tables and between these two
tables employee ID is the common key
column so this is entity splitting now
let's see what is table splitting all
about mapping multiple entities to a
single table is called as table
splitting notice here we're mapping
these two entities that is employee and
employee contact detail entities to the
single employees table so this is table
splitting if you notice this employee
entity it has got employee ID first name
last name gender these map to this first
four columns in the table and this
employee contact detail has got employee
ID which maps to the employee ID column
that's the primary key of the table and
then we also have got email mobile and
landline properties which maps to these
three columns here so here we are
mapping you know two entities to a
single table so this is table splitting
the obvious next question is what is the
main reason for using table splitting
and this is a common interview question
as well table splitting is useful when
we want to delay the loading of some
properties with large data when using
lazy loading let's understand this with
an example let's say we have an employee
entity and it also has got photo
property and that photo property
actually is going to return the photo
data of the employee and within the
database let's say we are storing the
employee photo in a binary format now
since the photo property is also part of
the employee entity every time we load
the employee entity the data for photo
property is also loaded and let's say we
use that photo property only on a few
pages within our application but on the
majority of the pages we don't display
the employee photo so from a performance
perspective it doesn't really make sense
to load the photo property of the
employee every time below the employee
entity so that's one reason where we can
use table splitting and then this photo
property maybe it's present in a
different entity and then using lazy
loading load the photo property of the
employee only when required only when we
want to display the employee photo on a
given page right let's understand this
table splitting with an example for our
demo will be using this employees table
so I have already created this table so
let's flip the sequence of the
management studio so here is the
sequence clip to create and populate it
with some test data
I'll have the script available on my
blog in case you need it now by default
any frame work you know if we are using
this employee's table
by default entity framework is going to
generate one entity that is employee
entity based on this table let's
actually look at that in action let's
flip to visual studio so here I have a
new blank asp.net web application
project to this project let's add a new
item and we want to add a do data entity
data model and let's call this employee
model we want to generate our model from
the database so select that click Next
and give this connection string a
meaningful name let's call this employee
dbcontext
click Next so this is going to connect
to the database and retrieve all the
tables views and stored procedures so
let's select our employees table and
let's give the model a meaningful name
space let's call it employee model click
finish so this will automatically
generate now one entity which is the
employee entity under escort or you know
all the properties that is first in last
name gender email mobile landline and
obviously these are going to map to that
respective columns okay now we want you
know to create multiple entities and map
them to the single employees table and
the reason for that is let's say for
example you know we are going to use
most of the time employee refers name
last
and gender properties the employee
contact information let's say we don't
use it on majority majority of the time
and you know we don't require it as
often as we require the other properties
of the employee so what we're going to
do here is create two entities that is
one is going to be employee entity and
this is going to contain the properties
of the employee that we most often use
that is employee ID first name last name
and gender and then we are going to
create another entity called employee
contact detail entity and that entity is
going to contain employee ID email
mobile and landline let's see have to
perform this table splitting the first
step is to add an entity and to add an
entity you simply right-click on the
designer surface add entity and give the
entity a meaningful name let's call this
employee contact detail entity and
notice that the entity set is going to
have contact details and we want to
create a creep key property and the name
of the key property I'm going to you
know match that with what we have in the
employee entity so let's also call this
employee ID and the data type is going
to be in 32 so that should add this
employee entity I mean employee contact
detail entity now here we want this
email mobile and landline property so
I'm going to select all of them right
click cut those properties right click
on the employee contact detail and paste
there ok so we have the two entities now
we need to establish a relationship
between them so right click and add
Association so what is the association
between this employee at the moment
notice that this employee has only these
properties if we want the email mobile
and landline information if we have a
navigation property called employee
contact detail that will definitely be
useful so let's add an association and
notice what is going to happen to the
navigation properties with an employee
and
we contact detail entities so here we
are adding an association so employee is
going to contain employee contact detail
and similarly employee contact detail is
going to contain employee property and
the relationship between them is to is
one-to-one
okay so employee is going to have
employee contact detail navigation
property which will return an instance
of the employee contact detail and that
contains the email mobile and landline
properties data and similarly employee
contact detail contains employee
navigation property okay
so let's click ok so we have the
navigation properties and the
association between these two entities
is established now now right-click on
the association and select properties
now we need to specify the referential
constraint as well and the way we do
that is click on the ellipsis button on
this property and here the principal is
going to be our employee entity and on
that principle we have this employee
contact detail dependent so the
principal key is employee ID and that
should be mapped to employee ID property
within employee contact detail so that's
the referential constraint between these
entities alright and one more thing that
we need to do is map these properties to
the employee's table and how do we do
that right click on the entity select
table mapping option and then here we
want to map employee contact detail to
employee's table and notice that it maps
then so employee ID is map to employee
ID property
similarly email mobile and landline
columns are mapped to the respective
properties of employee contact detail
entity alright with all these changes
let's build a solution so Bill succeeded
now let's quickly test our entities so
to this project let's add a new item and
we want to add a webform
and on this waveform first let's set the
style attribute and let's set font
family to area and let's drag and drop a
checkbox control and let's set the text
on this checkbox control to something
like include contact details let's put
the next email break there let's drag
and drop in button control and then
let's change the text on the button
control to get employees data and then
let's drag and drop a grid view control
alright let's flip this to the design
mode let's actually auto format this
grid view control and select this
colorful scheme just to make it a little
nice double-click the button control to
generate the click event handler now
what we want to basically do is you know
when I check this box include contact
details at that point this grid view
control should display you know along
with the email ID first name last name
and gender properties it should also
display email mobile and landline
properties as well if I don't check that
box then only employee ID first name
last name and gender properties should
be displayed okay so let's see how to
achieve that for that first let's write
a private function here so private and
this function let's say it's going to
return a data table and this data table
is present in systems or data namespace
so let's go ahead and bring that in
so data table and let's call the sket
employee details and let's say this
method is going to return employee disk
details including contact details let's
call it get employee data including
contact details all right
so obviously we have this employee
dbcontext class so let's go ahead and
create an instance of that this what is
automatically generated for us by the
entity framework which we can use to
retrieve the employee information okay
so this method is going to return
employee data including the contact
details information so employee DB
context dot employees so this property
is going to return the list of employees
now along with the employees primary
information that is employee ID first
name last name and gender we also want
the contact details so I am going to
specify include contact detail
information as well and to get that
correct so that name has to match with
the name of the entity so employee
contact details let's copy and paste it
there so along with the employees
primary information include the contact
detail information as well ok and then
convert that to a list so obviously what
is this going to return this is going to
return a list of employee objects so
let's go ahead and store it in a
variable of type list of employee and
let's call this employees ok so now what
we are going to do is loop through each
employee object in employees collection
and then what you are going to do is
build at the data table dynamically so
let's create an instance of a data table
let's call it DT equals new data table
and we need to specify the columns for
our data table so
let's go ahead and create an array of
data columns and let's call it data
columns equals new data column actually
let's initialize the columns here so we
want to create a new data column and we
are going to use this constructor maybe
need to specify the name of the column
so here the column name is going to be
employee ID similarly we need to create
a data column for first name last name
gender email you know mobile and
landline to speed things up I have
already typed that code so let me cut
this and paste it right there so instead
of just keeping you watch me typing so
here what did we do
we've created an array of data columns
and then this data table is going to
have all these columns so data table dot
columns dot add range and we want to add
these data columns actually we can do
all this outside the for each loop
because we don't want to do that every
time we loop through an employee object
let's do it outside of the for each loop
and here what we are going to do is
create a new data row so data row let's
call it D R equals D T dot new row so
this data row now is going to have
obviously all these columns and what we
need to do is retrieve the employee
details and populate the data row and
then add it to the data table and then
return the data table finally so here we
are going to say d r off
what is the column name employee ID
equals we have the employee object here
so retrieve the employee ID property
value and store it in this column of
this data row similarly we are going to
say data row of first-name equals
employee dot first in
and just to speed things up I have
already typed that so let's copy and
paste that right there and then look at
this here we are only getting employee
ID first name last name gender let's
also retrieve email mobile and landline
properties so we're going to say email
equals employee object dot employee
contact detail so this is going to
return an instance of the employee
contact detail remember the employee
object has got employee contact detail
navigation property which is going to
return an instance of employee contact
detail which has got email property okay
and similarly we need to have a mobile
and landline and again to speed things
up I have already typed that so let's
copy and paste it right there so we have
the data row data row is populated with
data from the employee object now to the
data table to its rows collection let's
add the data row and then once you know
we have looped through all employees
returned the data table okay so this
method right now is going to return an
own employee primary information as well
as their contact details let's make a
copy of this method and then modify it
just to return the primary information
first of all let's change the name of
the method to get employee data so this
is not going to include contact details
so what we are going to do here is we
are going to remove this right here so
now employee contact detail information
will not be loaded only employee ID
first name last name and gender will be
loaded and then here we don't need these
data columns for the data table email
mobile and landline so let's get rid of
them
and then here we don't require these
three lines as well and then return the
data table so pretty simple change and
then when we click the button what we
want to do is we want to check the check
box one control so if that is checked
then we know the end user wants to load
contact details as well so in that case
we are going to say grid b1 dot data
source equals get employee data
including contact details we are going
to call that method else we are going to
call the other method which doesn't load
contact details okay and then invoke the
data bind method all right at this point
let's go ahead fire up sequel profiler
so secret profiler is running let's go
and run our application now
okay let's not check that checkbox
include contact details and notice this
when I execute get employees I only go
out employee ID first name last name
gender you know data for email mobile
and landline is not loaded so let's go
back to sequel profiler and if you look
at this query look at it very right here
what it says it only loads let's copy
this query and paste it in our sequencer
management studio look at that it only
loads employee ID first name last name
and gender columns it doesn't load email
mobile and landline now let's go back
check this checkbox and then click this
pattern so now we got you know email
mobile and landline as well let's go
back to sequel profiler now if you look
at the query notice that we have got you
know email mobile and landline columns
as well okay
so basically here you know the email
mobile and landline column values are
loaded only on demand been required okay
so that's how table splitting is useful
and these are the steps to perform table
splitting we have seen them in action
alright that's it for today thanks for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
