we don't need this unit test project the
only projects that we need at the web
project and this class library project
so the obvious question that comes to
our mind is why should we write this
unit test and what are the benefits they
provide the calculator project that we
have here is a very simple project so
whether we have unit tests or not it's
not going to make a massive difference
however the real world applications have
complex business rules this means the
application code may be complex also you
may have more than one developer working
on that application so the point that
I'm trying to make clear is that there
may be sections of code within the
application that we don't understand if
we are tasked with changing or
refactoring that code we may introduce
bugs if we are not entirely sure what
that original code is doing if we have
unit tests and if we change something
that is going to break the existing
functionality the unit tests that are
created around that functionality will
fail immediately so by looking at those
unit tests we can clearly say which
scenarios we are breaking with the
changes that we made I can't tell you
how many times I was saved by these unit
tests not just me but many of the
developers that I have worked with
saying I love these unit tests I've made
massive changes today but I can be
confident that I have not broken
anything because I have ran the unit
tests that cover my changes and all of
them have passed let me explain what I
mean so let's assume this calculator
application that we have is a complex
piece of application and the changes
that we are going to make are massive
and when I am doing those changes what
happened was you know I changed this
four slash here to a percentage symbol
and you know along with this change
there are several other changes now
let's say this is complex work that we
are doing so obviously that means we'll
have several unit tests at the moment
you know our application has only one
test now to run this unit test there are
several ways but in this video we'll
look at one of those ways to run the
unit test one of the easiest way is to
go to the test menu here and then select
pen dos and then test Explorer so within
the text Explorer we can see all the
unit tests in the solution now I am
going to go here right click on that and
then select this option run selected
tests so this is going to run that unit
test and look at what is going to happen
the unit test has actually failed and if
you look at what the error message says
right here look at what it says assert
dot are equal failed expected is five
and actually zero so this unit test is
expecting a value of five but what we
have got here is zero so let's
understand why is that so if you look at
what this unit test is doing its simply
testing this divide method so to divide
to this divide method be a passing
numerator value of twenty denominator
value of four so let's see what is this
divide method doing so I'm going to
right click on that and go to its
destination
so numerator is 20 and denominator is
four so 20 modulus of four so what does
this modulus operator going to do it's
actually going to give us the reminder
of a division not the quotient and if
you look at what we are expecting right
here within the unit test we're actually
expecting the quotient of that that's
why we have expected a value of five
okay so that brings us to the fact that
we have made a breaking change so this
is going to break a scenario where the
users are going to expect a quotient
instead of a reminder so at that point
I'm going to come here and change it
back to a forward slash which is going
to return as the quotient instead of the
remainder so now at this point if we go
ahead and run this unit test this unit
test should pass okay so unit tests can
help us in number of ways and there are
several benefits of these unit tests so
let's look at those benefits now so unit
tests help us find bugs
early unit-tests greatly help in finding
the bugs early in the development
lifecycle after I have made some changes
I can run the unit tests immediately on
my local machine if any of the unit is
fair then we know that we may have
broken a scenario within the existing
functionality we have found the bug
early that means we also have the
opportunity to fix that bug early if we
did not have unit tests then we may have
deployed the application to the QA
servers the tester may or may not have
found the bug if the tester has not
found that bug on the QA and wai-man
then the application code is moved to
the production server the users may find
this bug on production server when using
our application this is bad for two
reasons
one since there is a production bug the
end-user is not able to do what he wants
to do with our application - it is going
to take a lot of time and effort to fix
this bug as we have found it late in the
development lifecycle unit tests also
help significantly reduce production
bugs this is related to the previous
point with unit tests we are able to
find bugs early in the development
lifecycle this also means that we have
the opportunity to fix those bugs early
before they make it to the production
servers
hence unit tests significantly reduces
production bugs unit tests make complex
code easy to understand if you are
looking at some complex piece of code
that you have written years ago chances
are that you may not understand that
code even worse if that code is written
by someone else
however if you have unit tests written
around that complex piece of code then
it is relatively easy to understand that
complex code with the help of those unit
tests I can't tell you how many times I
have used this technique to understand
the code written by someone else unit
tests provide a form of documentation
since unit tests are created for each
scenario they provide a form of
documentation let us say we have a
calculate method that does four things
adds subtracts multiplies and divides
two numbers then you may have for unit
tests covering each scenario so unit
tests indeed provide a form of
documentation unit tests save
development time if you have a good code
coverage with unit tests then you don't
have to really worry about that you're
going to break something with your code
changes because of this fear believe me
some developers and Leslie test it
changes wasting a lot of development
time so unit tests can give that
assurance to the developer that the
changes are not going to break existing
features as long as we have good code
coverage we will discuss what code
coverage is in detail in a later video
with unit tests it is easier to change
and refactor code many times you may be
tasked with refactoring the existing
code to meet the latest design changes
proposed by your architecture team so
here we are not implementing any new
functionality we are just changing the
existing code to meet the new
architecture design and standards these
refactoring changes can sometimes be
quite big so the existing unit tests can
come to your aid at this time if all the
unit tests pass then we know we have not
broken anything with our refactoring
changes if some unit has fail then we
know we have broken something and we
have the opportunity to fix those broken
scenarios so this benefit nicely leads
us to the next benefit that is
developers can become more confident
with those changes so in general
unit tests add a great value to
applications
