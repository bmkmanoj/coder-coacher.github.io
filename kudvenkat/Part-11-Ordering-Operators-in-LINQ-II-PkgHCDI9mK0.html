video we'll discuss ordering operators
order by order by descending then by
then by descending and rivers all of
these standard query operators belong to
ordering operators category order by
order by descending then by and then by
descending can be used to sort data
reverse method on the other hand simply
reverses the items in a given collection
we discussed order by order by
descending in part 10 of this video
series in this video we will be
discussing then by then by descending
and reverse methods order by order by
descending work fine when we want to
sort a collection just by one value or
expression if we want to sort be more
than one value or expression that's when
we use then by are then by descending
along with order by order by descending
order by order by descending performs
the primary sort then by other then by
descending is used for adding secondary
sort secondary sort operators that is
then by or then by descending
can be used more than once in the same
linked query let's look at a few
examples let's flip to visual studio
here I have a new console application
all I have done so far is created the
student class with these three
properties student ID name and total
marks in addition we have the static
method get all students which is
returning list of student objects and if
you look at the implementation here
we're creating a variable of type list
of student which at the moment contains
five student objects notice that there
are four students who have got total
marks of eight hundred and then finally
the method returns the list now what we
want to do is sort the students first by
total marks notice that the students are
sorted by total marks in ascending order
there are four students who have got
total marks of eight hundred then what
we want to do is all the students who
have total marks of 800 we want to sort
them then by name in ascending order
notice that the student names for those
who have got total months of 800 are in
ascending order and notice that at the
moment there are two John's and now
what we want to do is we want to sort
both of them by student ID in ascending
order so let's see how to achieve this
so let's flip to visual studio we have
our student class so let's make use of
get all student static method which is
going to return as the list of student
objects and then we use order by and
then specify a lambda expression has
such that s tour total max so this is
going to sort the students by total
marks now what do you think is going to
happen if I use order by again and then
specify a lambda expression to sort
students by name do you think it's going
to sort first by total marks and then by
name let's actually look at that in
action and if you look at what this
order by method returns it returns
I ordered innumerable of student so
let's use a variable of that type to
store the result and let's call the
variable itself result and then let's
use a for each loop so for the each
student let's call it s and result what
we want to do is plant total marks of
the student so it has total marks and
then we want to print at AB space and we
can achieve that using escape sequence
backslash T and then we want student
name again tab space and then student ID
all right so let's go ahead and run this
and see what output we get first of all
notice two remarks they are not sorted
but look at the names students are
sorted by name in ascending order but
that's not what we want we want this
list to be sorted first by total marks
in ascending order and then by name in
ascending order and then by student ID
in ascending order so to achieve that we
use then by so we want to sort first
students by total marks in ascending
order so that's when we use order by so
this is going to specify the primary
sort and then the result should then be
sorted by name in descending order in
ascending order sorry so then by has
such that s dot name so first sort by
two remarks in ascending order
then by name in ascending order so let's
run this notice that students are first
sorted by name in ascending order sorry
by total marks in ascending order and
then by name in ascending order right
now what we want to do is in a look at
these two John's the student IDs who are
already sorted in ascending order for
them now let's say we want to sort those
IDs in descending order now to achieve
that we can use another than by but we
use this time then by descending because
we want to sort by student ID in
descending order so as such that s dot
student ID so now let's run this notice
that now one zero five is listed first
and then one zero for next for the two
John's alright now let's look at another
example now what we want to do is
actually rewrite this same link very
using sequel like syntax so from s n
student dot get all students what we
want to do is first sort by total marks
and then sort by name so here we may or
may not specify the ascending keyword
because that's the default if we don't
specify the keyword by default in our
students will be sorted by total marks
in ascending order and then by name in
ascending order again and then we want
to sort the students by student ID and
that should be done in descending order
so let's use this ending keyword there
and we want to select all such students
and another the important thing to
notice here is that notice that we are
not using here then by or then by
descending methods instead we are
specifying our sort expressions here
using a comma separated list the first
sort expression here will be used for
primary sorting and the subsequent SWAT
expressions will be used for secondary
saw so now when we run this we should
get the same output here we are using
sequel like syntax alright now let's
look at the use of reverse method so
reverse method what it is going to do
it's not going to sort the items instead
it will simply reverse the items in a
given collection so let's get rid of
this code right here let's create a
variable of type enumerable ienumerable
off student let's call this students
let's use a student class and then it
will get all students which is going to
give us the list of students and then
let's actually print a message onto the
screen console.writeline
before calling reverse method and then
let's actually use a for each loop so
for each student s n students collection
what we want to do is print student ID
and start student ID backslash t stop
name backslash d and has taught total
marks all right now let's actually call
the reverse method so notice that this
reverse method is again returning us you
know ienumerable of T source in this
case the source is list of students so
it's going to give us high n numerable
of students so let's use another
variable ienumerable of student and
let's call this result and then let's
copy this code and then paste it right
here
so after calling the worst method let's
print an empty line here console dot
write line alright so let's go ahead and
run this now notice that before calling
the reverse method these are the this is
the order for IDs and after calling
reverse method let's actually see why
it's not reversing
that's because if we look at what we are
doing they using the same connection
that's why they are in the same order
instead we should be looping through our
result so let's copy and paste it right
there and this one more time now notice
the I it is you know the objects are
actually reversed okay
so reverse method is simply going to
reverse the items in the given
collection that's it for today thank you
for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
