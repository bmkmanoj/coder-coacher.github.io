venket this is part 94 face p.net video
series this is continuation to part 93
if you haven't watched that I would
strongly encourage you to do so before
continuing with the session in this
session we'll discuss about unlocking
the locked-in user accounts in part 93
of this video series we discussed about
locking user accounts if a user
repeatedly enters the wrong password the
counts are basically locked to prevent
hackers from guessing passwords and
making dictionary attacks first let's
get the account locked and then we'll
discuss about the different approaches
that we have to unlock the locked user
accounts so if you remember this the
application that we were working with in
part 93 and there's a table within the
daiba database TBL users and then this
is locked of that flag in this table
determines whether the account is locked
or not at the moment this account is not
locked so let's go ahead and enter an
invalid username and password three
times so I enter the wrong password the
first time I have three items left two
attempts left one attempt left now the
account is locked so obviously if we go
back to the table look at that the
account is locked and that's the locked
date and time okay now after this even
if I enter a correct username and
password I will not be able to log in
because my account is currently locked
so I need to get this account unlocked
okay so obviously to unlock the accounts
there are different approaches that
different organizations follow it
depends on the organization's policy end
and things like that so one of the
easiest approaches whenever the account
is locked the end user calls the
technical help desk the authorized
person at the technical help desk will
authenticate the user by asking him a
simple few questions to make sure that
is that he is the owner of the account
and after that the authorized person can
issue a simple update query like this so
update TBL users what is this very doing
it's simply updating is locked to zero
retry attempts to now and lock the date
and time to now basically this update
query will unlock the user account but
however look at this this is a manual
query
the person is running this query
manually so obviously there are risks
when we run queries you know manually
against a production database first of
all it's not recommended because it is
error-prone and we may unintentionally
modify other rules that we did that we
did not intend to update just imagine
what would happen if you forget to use
this ver clause because this is being
made by a person you know on the
production database on an ad-hoc basis
so it's not recommended to do that okay
so that's approach one but still some
organizations follow that another
approach would be to provide a web page
that lists all the locked user accounts
okay so we'll have a web form which
lists all the user accounts that are
locked and then on that web form maybe
we'll have you know a button called
enable against every locked user account
and the helpdesk person can just click
that unlock button and the account will
be locked you know basically unlocked
this is not error-prone because there is
an application page which is doing that
the air the authorized person is not
writing the query manually so so that
human element of error is not there but
however this is still a manual process
because the person has to unlock each
account okay depending on how big the
application I mean how many users you
have there might be many calls and you
may require more people to unlock the
account so this could be inefficient
okay but from an implementation
perspective if you know how to write
basic ad or dotnet code you know this
approach should not be very difficult to
achieve just in case if you are unsure
on how to do this leave a comment on
this video I will I will get a video
recorded on on how to do that when I get
some time okay but in this session we
are going to discuss about approach
three okay which is more efficient and
which is automated so basically what we
are going to do in this approach three
is we are going to create a sequel
server job this job will we'll check
this TBL users table periodically for
the locked user account so it's gonna
scan this table every 30 minutes maybe
and then it figures out okay if the
account is locked let's say for example
from
more than 24 hours it will automatically
unlock the account okay so let's see how
to do that now again the secret server's
job you know the frequency at which the
job is going to run it's configurable
now I'm saying it's going to run every
30 minutes but the organisation policy
states okay instead of making the job
run every 30 seconds then at every five
minutes because we don't want the users
accounts to be locked after 24 hours
okay
again at what point do we actually want
to unlock the user accounts that's also
up to the organization for example let's
say we have locked a user account and
after that account is locked how long do
we actually want to keep it locked is it
10 hours 20 hours 24 hours some
organization states 24 hours some
organizations 48 hours and and that is
to you know prevent hackers from making
repeated attempts to break into the
system okay so basically some
organizations say 24 hours some
organizations 48 hours for this
demonstration purposes let's stick to 24
hours and we want to have this job
running every 30 minutes let's see how
to do that okay so first we want an
update query okay let's get rid of this
one so I have an update query so this
update query we will use as part of the
job let's let me uncomment this so it's
a pretty simple update query now what we
basically want to do is we want to check
this table and any account that is
locked for more than 24 hours should be
automatically unlocked by this job okay
so this is just an update statement so
what is this update statement doing its
updating you know retry attempts to null
each lock to zero and lock date and time
to now okay but then there is a a where
clause where is locked is equal to one
so the count should be locked and then
there is another this is the important
condition so this is what is checking if
24 hours have elapsed since the account
is locked so what have you using for
that we're using a date diff function
now if you're new to date dysfunction we
have discussed about date difference in
sequences over video series I will have
a link to that video if you are new to
so watch that I'm not going to cover the
specifics of this function here so
basically this data function is looking
at this particular column lock the date
and time and it's comparing the
difference between when the account is
locked and the current date and time
when this update query is executed if
that difference in hours is greater than
24 go ahead and update that okay so it's
as simple as that okay all right
so now instead of running this query
manually every time what we want to do
is we want to schedule this as part of a
job we want to create a sequel server
job okay so to create a sequel server
job open sequel server management studio
and with an object Explorer you should
see something called sequel server agent
if the sequel server agent is not
running right click on that and click
start so since I have this equals silver
agent already running start is disabled
okay but if it's not running on your
machine it would be unable to click so
click that after sequel server agent is
JA
started let's go ahead and create a job
ok now you can create a job if sequel
server agent is not started but the jobs
will not run okay so let's go ahead and
create a job here so I want to create a
new job so on this new job give it a
meaningful name for this job so what is
this job going to do this job is going
to unlock user account so that's what
I'm going to name this unlock user
accounts and I'm going to know the owner
is whoever you have here and category
again choose a meaningful category or
leave it to the default give it a
meaningful description and the most
important thing is make sure this
enabled checkbox is checked otherwise
your job will be disabled and it will
not run and then the steps this is the
next important you know step in creating
a job so what do you want your job to do
what are the steps in that job so click
on this new button to add a job step
which should bring up a new job step
dialog box in this job step give a
meaningful name to your step so what
what is this step going to do it's going
to execute this update query so I'm
going to name that so execute
update query okay and what is this step
type is it a transact sequel script or
is it some kind of PowerShell script or
is it a replication task you know or is
it a sequence of integration no package
there are several things but it's a
simple T sequel script so I'm going to
select that run as you can leave that
blank and what's the database now our
table is actually within TBL users is in
sample database and I want this job to
run against that table in that database
so I'm going to choose sample database
and then paste your update query here so
I'm going to copy this and paste it
there okay so that's the command click
OK so we are done with these steps and
the next most important thing is the
schedules so how often do you want this
job to run automatically where do we
define that on the schedules page so
click on new we are on the schedules
page so give a meaningful name to the
job schedule so this job is going to run
every 30 minutes on a daily basis so
every 30 minutes daily schedule type
it's recurring it's not a one-time job
it's recurring job and it's enabled and
occurs when does it occur it occurs
daily and reoccurs every one day so on a
daily basis that's going to happen and
it occurs every I'm going to say every
30 minutes starting at this time and
ending at this time so round-the-clock
it's going to occur every 30 minutes
okay start date is today and there is no
end date that I can see you know we want
to run this forever okay so I click OK
we are done so we created you know the
name and all that on the general next
steps and the schedules we can also
configure alerts and notifications we'll
talk about them in a later video session
they are not relevant for this demo so
I'm going to click OK so that should
create a job here
within sequel server agent jobs look at
that unlock user account now let's go
ahead and see if the job has not now at
the moment you know we have scheduled it
to run every 30 minutes so we cannot
wait for 30 minutes so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to change the schedule
basically to run it to run for every
minute for the time being let's go there
so schedules that's the one which I want
to edit let's click that I want this to
run every one minute so let me click OK
click OK and now the job should run
every minute
so if we wait for a minute the job is
going to automatically run but then this
record will not be updated why because
it's not greater than 24 hours look at
this if I run this update query 0 rows
affected why because this account is
just locked so until tomorrow this time
it's not going to get unlocked so let's
go ahead and change the time the date
and time they lock the date and time
manually so update so that's the table
we want to update TBL users set locked
date time is equal to let's copy and
paste that and change it to yesterday or
day before yesterday so that it gets
unlocked immediately when the job runs
ok so let me update that there's only
one row so I'm not using the where
clause so let me execute that and let's
select now look at that it's day before
yesterday so it's definitely greater
than 24 hours so if we wait for the next
1 minute you know it the job will pick
that up any minute and then you know
basically unlock that it will set retry
times to null is locked to 0 and locked
date and time to now ok look at that it
has gone so we did not do the update
manually now this job is going to run
every one minute now because we
configured it to run but in production
we don't have to run it every one minute
maybe every 15 or half an hour so if you
look at this job right now right-click
on the job and save you
history it will show you when all this
job has run look at that it has run once
at 34 you know 20 34 and 2035 one so
it's going to run every one minute okay
