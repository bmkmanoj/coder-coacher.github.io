this video we'll discuss how to control
the height width and opacity of an image
using multiple slightest on the page so
here is what we want to achieve we're
going to have these three sliders we
want to control the height of the image
using the first slider the second slider
should control the width of the image
and the third slider is going to control
the opacity of the image opacity is a
number between 0 &amp;amp; 1
when opacity is set 1 the image will be
clearly visible when opacity is set to 0
the image will be completely invisible
so let's see how to control these three
attributes of the image using these
three sliders so let's flip to visual
studio so the first step here is to
include a development and I'm going to
give this development an ID let's call
this their height and similarly I'm
going to include 3 more developments so
the second day of I am going to call
this width and the third day of I'm
going to call it div opacity and the
last one I'm going to call their
dimensions and let's include a break
element after each development okay so
the first three developments you know
are going to be used to produce these
three sliders and the last development
that is the fourth one we will use that
to display the dimensions and we need an
image element as well so within my
project I already have an image so let's
use an image element and reference that
image so image and let's set the source
attribute to tulips dot jpg and let's
have this tile attribute and let's set
the initial height and width 200 pixels
each so height is going to be 100 pixels
and width is also going to be 100 pixels
all right so with these changes if we
run it we will only see the image now on
these three developments let's call this
light a function which is going to give
us the three sliders that we need
okay so within our jquery's ready
function I'm going to find the first div
elements by ID so let's use the jQuery
ID selector find div height and we also
want to find div width so find both the
developments by ID and on that I'm going
to call slider function okay and let
specify the options for this slider
function so the minimum value for both
of these sliders is going to be 100 so
we want the minimum width and height to
be at least 100 pixels and maximum is
going to be 500 pixels and when this
light event is raised so when we move
the slider
you know the slide event will be raised
and then that is raised we want to
handle that event so I'm going to have a
function with name refresh image so
that's the function that we want to call
when this light event is raised so we'll
define that function in just a bit okay
now this is going to give us the slider
for height and width but we also need a
slider for controlling opacity okay so
let's find that development by ID so
again let's go ahead and use the jQuery
ID selector find the development and on
that let's call this slider function now
let's use the JavaScript object now for
opacity let's say the minimum value is
going to be zero and maximum is going to
be 100 and again as usual when this
light event is raised we want to handle
that using this refresh image function
which we are at to define so now let's
go ahead and define that refresh
function so function refresh image so
this is the function that will be called
when slide event is raised okay so
that's when we want to do most of the
work so at this point let's save the
changes let's go ahead and reload this
page so now we should get those three
sliders notice that we
these three sliders and we also have the
image now let's actually set the slider
of the opacity to be on the right hand
side so we want the initial value to be
100 we want this image to be completely
visible when the web page first loads so
I'm going to set the opacity to its
maximum value so let's go ahead and set
value to 100 okay so let's save the
changes let's go ahead and reload this
and now notice that for the last slider
this slider is on the right-hand side
all right now we need to retrieve the
height width and opacity values from the
respective sliders and then we need to
set those values using the CSS function
for this image element let's go and do
that so within refresh image function
I'm going to create a variable let's
call it height so first let's go ahead
and retrieve the height value so I'm
going to use the jQuery ID selector
again find the div height element and on
that I'm going to call slider function
and ask for value property okay so
basically here we are saying give me the
value property of the slider okay
so within that variable we should have
the current height value from the slider
similarly we want to retrieve the width
and opacity values so I'm going to
change the variable name here to width
and the development that we are
interested in is div width and we want
to retrieve the value of the value
property similarly we have div opacity
and we want the value property of the
value of the value property and let's
change the name of the variable here to
opacity so we have the three values now
let's find the image element now image
element also has got an ID that is so we
haven't given the image element ID so
let's give it an ID let's set it to my
image so let's find the image element by
ID my image and let's use the CSS
function and then specify the three
properties that we are interested
so what are the three properties height
so we want to set height to what we have
in this variable similarly let's go and
set the vet width to what we have in the
respective variable and opacity to what
we have in our opacity variable now if
you look at the opacity slider the value
is actually ranging from 0 to 100
but then in reality opacity value is a
number between 0 and 1 when the opacity
is set to 1 the image will be clearly
visible when opacity is set to 0 the
image will be completely invisible okay
so if we divide the number by 100 then
we are going to get a number between 0
and 1
okay so we are setting the three
attributes here and the final thing that
is left is to display those dimensions
within this you know the fourth
development that we have here the div
dimensions okay so let's find this live
by DT of dimensions so let's use the
jQuery ID selector find the day and I'm
going to use the HTML function and what
do we want to display we want to first
display height so height equals and
height is present in height variable and
let's append an HTML break there so
let's make a copy of that and let's
include a plus there and paste what we
have copied the next attribute that we
want to display is width and this is
present in width variable and if you
want you can append this word pixels
saying that that unit is pixels you know
the unit for height and width is pixels
and finally we want opacity so opacity
equals and opacity is present in opacity
variable
okay so let's save all those changes
reload our page and look at this when we
moved the slider
you know height slider look at that
height at the moment it's 129 pixels
with this hundred pixels and opacity it
is saying 100 but keep in mind opacity
is a number between 0 and 1 so when we
display the value let's actually divide
that by 100 so we get the exact opacity
value that we are setting for the image
okay
so let's save the changes let's reload
this page and look at this now opacity
is 1 that's why the image is you know
clearly visible and look at this as we
move the height slider the height of the
images you know keeps increasing and
when we move it to the left hand side it
decreases similarly let's good and
control the width using the width slider
and look at what happens to the width
dimension here okay and similarly
opacity look at that the image is
clearly visible as we move it to the
left notice that you know it fades away
slowly as we move it completely to the
left you know
the opacity becomes zero and it's
completely invisible as we move it to
the right it becomes visible so here is
the jQuery code that we just looked at
thank you for listening and have a great
