this video we'll discuss the jQuery
disabled selector enable selector and
where you can find jQuery selectors
documentation first let's look at the
disabled selector : disabled this
selector is going to select all elements
that are disabled let's look at a few
examples let's flip to gel studio so the
HTML that we have here will produce this
output
I'll have this entire HTML available on
my blog in case you need it
at the moment on this page we have four
elements that are disabled these two
text boxes they drop down list and the
submit button so what we want to do now
is select all those elements that are
disabled and set a 3 pixel solid red
border around them so within the script
section we already have the ready
function wired up now we want to select
all elements that are disabled and then
we want to set a border which is 3 pixel
solid red so let's save these changes
and let's reload this page look at that
all those elements that are disabled
gets a solid red border now here we are
selecting all the disabled elements
instead let's say we want to select only
input elements so here the drop-down
list is not an input element whereas the
text boxes and the submit button
they are input elements so we want to
select only the input elements that are
disabled so input : disabled let's save
the changes reload the page and look at
that the red border around the drop-down
list goes away because that is not an
input element right so only the text
boxes and the submit button gets a solid
red water now let's say we want to
filter this even further I want all
input elements of type equals text to
have you know a solid red border around
them if that's the case you can filter
that by using the attribute selector so
basically we can say give me all
input elements where type attribute
equals value text and that are disabled
so this is going to return us all input
elements of type equals text and that
are disabled so when we reload this page
only these two text boxes should have a
solid red border now let's look at
enabled selector so colon and labeled
this is going to select all elements
that are enabled so instead of disabled
here I'm going to use enable and if you
look at this page in our this text box
and the text area element they are
enabled so let's save the changes reload
the page and look at that the all the
elements that are enabled gets a solid
red border now instead of selecting all
the elements if you want to select just
this text area element then you can use
the tag selector in conjunction with
that : enable the selector so I can say
text area : enable so what is this going
to do
give me all text area elements that are
enabled and then set it 3 pixels solid
red border so when we save the changes
and when we reload this only the text
area elements should have a red border
okay so where we can find the selectors
documentation this is the URL and when
you navigate to that page you can see
all the jQuery selectors here the
complete list I'll have this link
available on my blog now we have
discussed most of the commonly used
selectors if you need information about
any of the jQuery selectors you can come
onto this page and then click on the
selector that you are interested in for
example if we click on this bottom
selector and it will take you to another
page where you will have the description
of what that selector is capable of
doing and an example
all right so that's it for today thank
you for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
