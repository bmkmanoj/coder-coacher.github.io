in this video we'll discuss hidden input
and read-only attributes
please watch but 42 before proceeding
hidden input attribute is useful when
you want to render a property using
input type equals hidden this attribute
is extremely useful when you don't want
the user to see or edit the property
value but you need to pose the property
value back to the server when the form
is submitted so that we can update the
correct record this hidden input
attribute is present in system dot web
dot MVC namespace let us understand the
use of this attribute with an example
notice that when we navigate to details
action within home controller we can see
that employees full details including ID
property now let's say we don't want to
allow the user to see this ID property
and at the same time we don't want to
allow him to be able to change this
property's value and to achieve this we
can simply decorate the ID property
within our employee class with this
hidden input attribute so we have the ID
property here I'm going to decorate this
with hidden input attribute let's fill
the solution and let's refresh this view
notice that even after the view is
refreshed we see you are still seeing ID
property that's because we need to tell
this attribute not to display the value
and to do that we can use named property
display value equals false let's build a
solution and let's refresh this view
once more and notice that we don't see
the ID property now now let's see if we
will be able to see that property when
we try to edit this employee details
obviously the first step now is to
implement the Edit action method within
the home controller so here we have the
Edit action method we are passing the ID
of the employee that vary editing so let
me copy this code so we are creating an
instance of a sample dbcontext class
retrieving the employee that we want to
edit and then we pass that employee to
the view the next step is to implement
the Edit view itself so let's
right-click on the action method select
add view from the context menu
the name of the view is going to be edit
raise the view engine we are going to
create a strongly typed view against
employee model class and the scaffold
template is going to be empty for now
let's click Add so that should add edit
here we first of all let's use the div
tag and set style attribute
and we need to generate the form tag and
to do that I am going to make use of
begin form HTML helper and to have the
opening and closing form tags generated
automatically I'm going to wrap this
call inside a using statement and then
I'm going to use this HTML dot editor
for model HTML helper which is going to
walk through each property and then
generate the editor interface for us
automatically and then let's have to
HTML breaks and then a submit button so
input type equals submit value equals
save alright with all these changes
let's build a solution and let's
navigate to edit / one so we should be
able to edit this employee details
notice that we see the employee full
details except the ID properly if I
right click on that and move page source
notice that we have an input element you
know with name ID type is equal to
hidden and look at the value one so when
we click this Save button
you know the ID of the employee also
will be posted to the server and we can
use that ID to update the correct
employee's record the next attribute
that we will discuss today is read-only
attribute this attribute is present in
system that component model namespace as
the name suggests this attribute is used
to make the property read-only but
please note that we will still be able
to change the property value on the view
itself but once we post that form to the
server the model binder in asp.net will
respect that read-only attribute and it
will not move the value you know to that
property so from the posted form values
it will not you know bind the value to
the employee class for example if we
decorate email address with read-only
property you know we will still be
to change that on the view itself but
when we submit the form
you know the default model binder in
asp.net MVC will not move that value
from the posted form values to the class
properties let's actually look at that
in action practically so within our
employee class let's set this email
address you know read only by using
read-only attribute so read-only if you
want the property to be read-only
said that true if you don't want that to
be read-only I mean if you want that
property to be readwrite you know simply
say false or if you don't use that
attribute it is going to be read/write
let's build the solution and then within
home controller we need to implement the
Edit action method that responds to the
HTTP POST operation so we know that when
we post this form you know to the server
we are going to receive an employee
object so I'm going to pass the employee
object as the parameter and then to
speed things up I have this um you know
edit action method code already
implemented so let me copy and paste it
right here so if you look at this code
it's very straightforward you know we
are checking if the model state is valid
we're creating an instance for sample DB
context class and then we are retrieving
that employee which we are editing from
the database okay and notice that we are
pro plating all the properties full name
gender age hire date all the properties
except email address okay so this
employee object that's coming into this
method is going to contain the values
from the form so using those values you
are populating this employee from DB
object all the properties except email
address because we don't want to pass
email address you know we want that
email address to be read-only
the default model binder in a bit we'll
see that we'll put a breakpoint and then
watch the values of this employee object
you'll notice that email address will be
now because we decorate that property
with read-only attribute so the default
model binder in MVC will not move the
value for that property from this form
and then we are passing that employee
from DB object you know to this function
which is going and then we are setting
the state of that entity as modified
because obviously some values will be
changed and then we call Save Changes
method which is going to save the
changes to the database table and then
we are redirecting to the detail section
passing the ID of the employee pretty
simple and straightforward if there are
any model validation errors we stay on
the same view and we pass the employee
object all right let's put a breakpoint
here let's actually run this in debug
mode and you'll notice that you know the
email address property will be null so
let's actually navigate to edit action
and pass employee ID of one and then
let's say you know come on let's change
the name of John Smith from one to two
gender from male one to male 2 and let's
also change the email address John Smith
to at pledge intercom and then when I
click Save obviously we will land in
this action method and the note is that
you know if you look at full name that
has changed to John Smith 2 and gender
has changed to male 2 but look at email
address that's now because since we
decorated in this email address property
of the employee object with read-only
attribute it's not going to receive that
value from the posted form the default
asp.net MVC model binder is going to
respect that read-only attribute okay
but notice that on the UI I am still
able to change this value to whatever I
want and then if I let that go through
it's going to save the changes and
redirect us back to the detail section
so I can say John Smith - male - but
email address is the same it then
changed John Smith at prezi.com so
read-only attribute is present in system
that component model namespace as the
name suggests this attribute is used to
make a property read-only please note
that we will still be able to change the
property
on the view but once we post that form
you know the model binder in asp.net
will respect that read-only attribute
and will not move the value to that
property you can also make a property of
a class read-only simply by removing the
set accessor now if you look at this
property with an employee class employee
class email address it has got both get
and set access meaning it's both read
and write you know if you remove set
accessor it's going to be read-only
property anyway so there are two ways to
make a property read-only you can either
remove that set accessor or you can
decorate that with this read-only
attribute on this slide you can find
resources for asp.net c-sharp and
sequence of interview questions that's
it for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
