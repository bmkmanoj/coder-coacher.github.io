venket this is part 63 of c-sharp video
series in this session we'll discuss
about what partial methods are and the
rules to follow when creating partial
methods before continuing with the
session I strongly recommend to watch
pat 61 and 62 of this video series a
partial class are a structure can
contain partial methods partial methods
are created using the partial keyword
let's understand partial methods with an
example let's flip to visual studio here
I have a very simple console application
project to this project let's add a
class file right click on the project
name add and I want to add a class file
and let's name the class file as partial
class file 1 dot C s and within this
file I'm going to have a partial class
so let's say public partial class and
let's call our partial class s sample
partial class and this partial class is
going to contain a partial method so I'm
going to use this partial keyword and
the written type of the method is going
to be void
I'm going to call the sample partial
method and all I'm going to have here is
the definition of the method only the
signature I'm not going to have the
implementation so only the definition of
the partial method I'm going to have a
non partial method as well so public
void let's call this you know maybe
public method and all this method does
is prints out a message on to the
console saying that public method
invoked ok and this method also calls
the sample partial method ok so a very
simple partial class which has the
declaration or the definition of the
sample partial method and then a public
method which prints out this message
public method invoked and then calls the
sample partial method ok now let's flip
to this program dot CS file
which actually contains the main method
for this console application and what we
are going to do here is we are going to
create an instance of the sample partial
class so sample partial class let's call
this SPC is equal to new sample partial
class and then this sample partial class
is going to invoke the public method and
if you remember what is the public
method doing it prints out this message
public method invoked and it also calls
sample partial method now you might be
wondering okay the sample partial method
it only has you know the definition of
the method only the signature it doesn't
have implementation so what's going to
happen when this method gets called is
it doing anything no it's not let's say
you know what is actually going to
happen if I compile this first of all
will this compile let's see that I try
to build this look at that build it
succeeded okay that's fine let's run
this and see what happens when this
public method gets invoked and
interestingly look at that look at the
output and compare that with the method
implementation here here it's calling
public method in work so it's printing
out this line but then it's not calling
this method okay so that's an important
point to keep in mind as far as partial
methods are concerned now if you look at
this partial method it doesn't have an
implementation so since it doesn't have
an implementation what is the compiler
going to do it's going to ignore this
definition okay it ignores the signature
and it also ignores this call to that
partial method that's why we don't get a
compiler error and at runtime it ignores
both of them and we only get that
message on the screen but whereas let's
do this let's add another class file to
this console application project and
let's call that partial class file to
dot CS
okay and let's name the partial class as
the name so public partial class sample
partial class so this is the other part
of the partial class and what I'm going
to do here is I'm going to provide the
implementation for the sample partial
method in the other physical file and
all I'm doing here is we are printing
out a message on to the console console
dot write line and we will say sample
partial method invoked okay so what we
have what have we done now we added this
physical file I mean partial class file
to dot CS and then we provided the
implementation for the sample partial
method so we have the definition here
and the implementation here
so as far as partial methods are
concerned there are two parts to the
partial method one is the definition
that's the only signature part and the
other one is the implementation and if
you look at this the implication of the
partial class is present in one physical
file and the implementation is present
in the other physical file of the
partial class now let's go ahead and run
this program and see what's going to
happen now if you look at this you know
the public method it's going to print
this message as expected and it calls
the sample partial method we don't have
the implementation for this method here
but then it's present in the other
partial file so it's gone it's going to
combine that and then it is going to
print this message as well so if we run
this now we should have both the methods
invoked and printed now is it possible
to provide the implementation for the
partial method in the same physical file
where we have the definition absolutely
if you want you can do that now if I run
this look at that we have the same
output so remember that as far as a
partial method is concerned it has got
two parts one is the definition of the
method that's the own
signature you know the definition of the
method ends with the semicolon it will
not contain a body and then the other
part is the implementation and then
these two parts can be present in the
same physical file of the partial class
or they could be present in separate
physical files so a partial method
declaration consists of two parts the
definition only the method signature and
the implementation these may be in a
separate parts of the partial class or
in the same part the implementation for
a partial method is optional and we have
seen that if you remove the
implementation what's going to happen if
we don't provide the implementation the
compiler removes the signature and all
the calls to the method we don't get a
compiler error the signature of the
method and the calls to that respective
partial method will be ignored
partial methods are private by default
this is another important point to keep
in mind partial methods are private by
default and it's a compile time error to
include any access modifiers including
private now since these are private by
default can I use the private access
modifier on the partial method no you
can't if you try to compile this you
will get an error a partial method
cannot have access modifiers not only
access modifiers it also cannot have
virtual abstract override new seal all
these modifiers okay so partial methods
are private by default and it's a
compile time error to include
declaration and implementation at the
same time for a partial method let's
understand this practically so can I do
this ok I'm saying this is a partial
method and then what I'm going to do is
I'm going to provide the body for that
method or let's get rid of this one
look at this Here I am saying this is a
partial method and then I'm providing
the definition that's the signature and
the implementation at the same time if
you're doing that this is not a partial
method at all
you have everything present at one place
so if I try to compile this let's see
what happens it gives a compiler error
no defining declaration found for
implementing declaration of part
method okay and it makes sense there's
no declaration for this partial method
you have the implementation but where is
the declaration so this is not a partial
method it's a non partial method you
have the definition and the
implementation at the same place and we
cannot do that for a partial method if I
remove this partial keyword and if I try
to compile this then this will work fine
because this is not a partial method but
the moment I include that partial
keyword then this method implementation
expects a definition for this partial
method to be present either in the same
physical file or in another physical
file the partial method return type must
be wired including any other written
type apart from void is a compile time
error again if you look at this the
partial method that we have the return
type of that is void if you try to have
any other return type we will get a
compile error and it makes sense because
remember the partial method
implementations are optional and being
that the case if they are optional if
these partial methods return values
wherever you call them you know let's
say for example there's a partial method
first of all these are private which
means the partial methods cannot be
invoked outside and then they also
cannot have return types if they have
return types you can use variables
retrieve those return values and then
you make decisions in your program flow
and all of a sudden if there is no
implementation for those partial methods
then what your programs supposed to do
that's why you know you don't really
have to mug these things if we
understand the concepts of these partial
methods you know we can easily remember
them so partial methods are private by
default they cannot have any other
written type apart from void including
any other return type apart from void is
a compile time error so if I try to
build that partial methods must have a
void return type and that makes sense
signature of the partial method
declaration must match with the
signature of the implementation again
that's straightforward now this is the
definition and this is the
implementation now let's say in my
definition I have into I now this
signature is different from the
implementation okay so if I try to build
this look at what's going to happen
no defining declaration found for
implementing declaration so this
implementation of the partial method
does not have you know an equivalent
partial method declaration because this
methods signature is different from this
methods signature on the other hand if I
put int I here and if we try to build
this it works fine
yeah that's because maybe here we need
to pass in zero but then if we try to
build as look at that it compiles
because both the signatures match here
okay so keep that in mind signature of
the partial method declaration must
match with the signature of the
implementation a partial method must be
declared within a partial class or as
partial structure and non partial class
erase structure cannot include partial
methods okay and that's obvious if it's
a partial class then it can include a
partial method but if it's a non partial
class then it cannot include a partial
method for example let's get rid of this
partial class there and obviously we
need to comment this otherwise we get a
compiler error and look at this so if
you look at this one this is a non
partial class because we don't have that
partial keyword there and then in a non
partial class I'm trying to include a
partial method let's see what happens
when I try to build this so a partial
method must be declared within a partial
clause or partial structure and that
makes sense and the other error is
because of this call so let's comment
that now if we try to build as we get
only one error and that is a partial
method must be declared within a partial
class or a partial structure and no
a partial class cannot have partial
methods a partial method can be
implemented only once trying to
implement a partial method more than
once
raises a compile-time error and this is
again very important to keep in mind so
we have two partial classes here so
let's call this public partial class
that's our sample partial class and
let's on uncomment this okay so this is
a partial void sample method and what
I'm going to do is I'm going to provide
the implementation for this method here
so console dot readline and let's say
sample partial method may be invoked so
we have provided the implementation for
this partial method within the same
physical file but what I'm going to do
is I'm going to copy this and move it
across to the other physical file so
technically what are we doing we are
implementing this partial method in two
places in this physical file as well as
in this physical file now let's try to
compile this and see what actually
happens well solution a partial method
may not have multiple implementing
declarations so we are implementing here
once we are implementing here the second
time so multiple implementing
declarations but then the definition
declaration is only one and the error
message makes sense so keep in mind a
partial method can be implemented only
once trying to implement a partial
method more than once raises a compile
time error on this slide you can find
