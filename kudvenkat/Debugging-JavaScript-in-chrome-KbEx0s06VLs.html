in this video we'll discuss debugging
JavaScript in Google Chrome browser
let's understand this using this webform
1 dot aspx and forget what this page is
doing it's simply printing this number
30 let's understand how this web page is
doing that so we have a webform Vandor
aspx within visual studio notice that
within the script section we're calling
this javascript function print sum if
you look at this page right here we
don't have this javascript function
defined anywhere on this page so it must
be coming from the script dot JS file so
if you look inside that file notice that
we have a print sum function there and
we look at what this function is doing
it is simply writing the return value of
this function calculate sum to the web
page using document dot write and if you
look at what calculate sum function is
doing it has got two parameters first
number and second number it's adding
those two parameters together storing
the result in this variable and
returning that variable back so pretty
straightforward JavaScript code there
now let's understand how to debug this
JavaScript code in Google Chrome browser
to debug JavaScript in Google Chrome we
use developer tools and there are two
ways to launch developer tools one way
is by clicking on this button customize
and control Google Chrome as you can see
from the tooltip within that you should
find more tools and within that
developer tools that's one way the other
way is by using the keyboard shortcut
f12 so let's press f12 and notice that
it launches developer tools at the
moment we don't have any JavaScript
errors and if you look at this developer
tools window it's talked at the bottom
of the browser if you want that to be
docked on the right simply click on this
button if you want that back at the
bottom click on the same button again
now let's introduce a deliberate
JavaScript error and I'm going to do
that by removing this letter B from
second number okay
so let's save our changes and I'm going
to reload this page and the way I'm
going to reload this page is by pressing
ctrl R this will ensure that it is going
to reload the JavaScript file rather
than using the cache
version so when I press control our look
at that the Google Chrome browser is not
displaying any error information about
the error okay it simply doesn't display
the number 30 that we expect it to
display to see those JavaScript errors
use developer tools so I'm going to
press f12 to launch developer tools and
look at what happens right here you can
see a cross and number one next to it
and if I hover the mouse over that look
at that it says one error and you can
see that JavaScript error in the console
tab right here within developer tools
the error says uncaught reference error
second number is not defined and it also
tells us the file that has got that
JavaScript so the file that has the
JavaScript that cost the era is script
or GS file and within that the line
number is 6 that's where we have this
error now look at what's going to happen
when I click on that file name it's
going to open that script or J's file
within sources tab in the developer
tools so we have the script J's file
open and we have the entire JavaScript
code that's present in that file and
look at what happened to this line
number 6 we have a red squiggly
underneath the line that has caught that
error and if I hover the mouse over that
look at that we get the actual error as
well uncaught reference error second
number is not defined let's go fix that
JavaScript error and to do that we
simply have to introduce that letter B
back so let's save our changes and let's
reload this page by pressing ctrl R so
we expect it to print 30 and there we go
now let's see how to set a breakpoint in
Google Chrome to set a breakpoint we
simply have to click on the grey margin
where we see line numbers in the sources
tab so let's launch developer tools once
again so we are within the sources tab
we have our script or JS file open there
and let's say I want a breakpoint on
line number two within that script of
J's file to do that I simply click on
the gray margin there on that line
number look at that we have a blue tag
there indicating that we have a
breakpoint now if we reload the page the
JavaScript execution is going to pause
at that break point now to step through
the code we have various keystrokes to
step over use f10 to step into a
function use f11 to step out if a
function use shift f11 and to continue
execution f8 so we can either use these
keyboard shortcuts or we can use these
buttons that are present within the
developer tools so we have those buttons
right here and when I hover the over the
respective button look at what it says
this button is for resuming script
execution and the keyboard shortcut is
have fade this is for step over f10 step
in to f11 step out shift f11 okay now
look at this we are right here and on
this line we are calling another
function calculate sum so if you want to
step into that function you + f11 so
right now the execution you know is n
calculate sum and it actually shows us
the values that we have passed for first
number and second number parameters look
at that first number is 10 and second
number if I hover over it we should
actually see the value is 20 all right
now I'm going to continue execution by
pressing f8 so the execution has
completed and it displays that number 30
there all right so we have a normal
break point here this breakpoint is hit
every time okay now if you want to set a
conditional breakpoint a conditional
breakpoint is a breakpoint that's hit
only when the specified condition is
true let's say we want to set our
conditional breakpoint right here on
this line so I click on that so when we
click on the gray margin we get a
breakpoint now when we already have a
breakpoint we right-click on that
breakpoint and select this option edit
breakpoint and then we can specify our
condition there if you don't have a
breakpoint already you can simply right
click on it and select add conditional
breakpoint and then you can specify your
condition there so basically what I want
to do is when first number is equal to
20 only then I want to break at that
point and then I press Enter so
look at the color of the tag that's a
it's an orange tag so that indicates
that it's a conditional breakpoint at
the moment if you look at what we are
passing the first number it is 10 but
our condition is first number W equals
20 so when I reload this page it's not
going to pause execution at that
breakpoint okay now when we actually
pass 20 as the value for the first
number parameter that's when that
condition is going to be true and the
execution will pause at that breakpoint
let's actually look at that in action so
what I'm going to do is change the value
here from 10 to 20 save the changes and
I'm going to reload this page by
pressing ctrl R look at that now the
breakpoint is hit because first number
is 20 and the condition that we
specified in this breakpoint is true so
that's conditional breakpoint I'm going
to continue execution by pressing f8 and
let's also discuss about this called
stackpanel
this is an extremely useful tool which
basically displays the complete
execution path let's understand what we
mean by that
so we are within developer tools and if
you look at this breakpoint you know we
would like to understand let's actually
reload this page now if you want to
understand how we reach this point call
stack is your best friend okay so how
did we reach this breakpoint now look at
this on web form one dot aspx on line
number 10 okay we are calling this print
sum function right and you know once
that print sum function is called that
print sum function is actually present
in script dot JS file so on line number
two we are actually making a call to
calculate sum and that's how we ended up
on this line number six in calculate sum
which is also present in script dot j as
well so this call stack shows you the
complete execution path which is very
useful in understanding how we have
reached this breakpoint thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
