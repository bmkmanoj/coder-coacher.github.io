in this video we'll discuss customizing
the display and it it templated helpers
in MVC please watch but 44 before
proceeding in part 44 we discuss the
built-in display ended it templated
helpers will be using the same example
that we worked with in part 44 notice
that at the moment when we navigate to
this edit action within home controller
and then when we pass this employee 81
we are providing an editing interface to
edit that employee details
notice this hired a property this
property is of type date time so by
default asp.net MVC is going to use the
built-in date/time editor template to
provide an editing interface for this
property value so by default this
built-in date/time editor template is
simply going to render a textbox control
as the editing interface for that
date/time value and the end user has to
type the date into the textbox literal a
but remember any time you have a
requirement in your project to capture
dates from the end-user it's always
recommended to display calendar instead
of asking the user to type the date into
the textbox by hand okay
for example you know as soon as I click
on this high date text box we want a
calendar to drop down and as soon as I
select the date from the calendar the
selected date should be populated with
in the textbox control and the calendar
should immediately disappear this would
avoid any confusions as far as date
formats a concern because if you ask the
user to type the date into the textbox
control different users may type it in
different formats for example some users
may type it in ddmm by YY other users
may type it in mmddyy so to avoid all
these confusion you know it's
recommended to display a calendar and
for this purpose we are going to make
use of jquery calendar so we are going
to customize the date/time editor
template but before we do that let's
understand the conventions used by MVC
to find these customized a template and
keep in mind we can customize both the
display templates and editor templates
the customize the display templates must
live in a special subfolder that is
named as display
in place and similarly editor templates
must live in a special subfolder that
named as editor templates and these
special sub folders can then live either
in shared folder or in a specific views
folder so within our MVC demo project we
have the shared folder so if these
display templates and editor templates
live within the shared folder then those
templates will be available for all the
views within the entire project on the
other hand if these folders are present
only you know within this home views
folder then those templates will be
available only for the views within that
home folder and another important thing
to keep in mind is that the name of the
template must match the name of the type
in this example we are going to
customize the date/time template so the
name of the template in this case has to
be date/time dot AAC X let's flip to
visual studio so let's add a folder to a
shade folder and I'm going to name this
edit the templates and then I'm going to
add a view to this folder and let's name
it date time the name is this name is
very important because we are going to
customize the date time edit a template
and this is going to add date/time that
a/cs HTML partial view I'm going to get
rid of the code that sort of generated
and then we need to specify the model
for this partial view the model is going
to be date/time because that's what is
the template that we are customizing and
then we are going to make use of
nullable date/time because if you
remember this hire date property can
have a null value within the database so
it's a nullable date/time so the model
for view for our view is going to be
nullable date/time and then to display
the date we need a textbox control so to
get the textbox control we are going to
make use of text box HTML helper and
this helper method needs three
parameters the name of the textbox the
value and the HTML attributes so the
name is going to be an empty string and
where is the value going to come from
the value is going to come from the
model object and the model is a nullable
date/time so it's very important that we
check if the value
within the model is there or not and how
do we do that using a property called
has value okay so this is a boolean
property which is going to return true
or false if there is a value it's going
to return true in which case we want to
retrieve the value and then convert that
to a string and while we are converting
it to the string we can also represent
the date format string whether you want
it in ddmm Y by Y or mmddyy Y so you can
specify that format there so I basically
want it indeed a /mm slash why why why
why and you may be wondering why did I
specify capital letter M for months
that's because if you specify small
letter M you know in a date-time format
string small letter ends are considered
four minutes if you want months you
specify capital letter m and if you
specify to lead to capital letter M s if
it is the first month instead of
displaying just one it will display zero
one okay similarly if you you know
specify two DS for date it's going to
display zero one for the first man okay
not one similarly if you want the name
of the day specify for DS now these date
format strings are actually available at
this microsoft length i'll have this
link available on my blog just in case
if you need to refer to that and notice
you know look at this if i specify you
know what - capital letter ms
you know if it is a sixth month i will
have zero six if i late specify only one
capital letter m the month is you know
if it is a six month it's not going to
have a preceding 0 if you want the full
month name then you specify for capital
letter ends ends like that
okay so I'll have this link available on
my blog in case if you need that alright
so if the model has got a value we are
converting it to the date string to be
in that format else we are simply going
to have an empty string within the text
box so that is the second property I
mean parameter that we need to specify
for this text box control and
third parameter is the HTML attributes
okay so I need to set one HTML attribute
which is nothing but the class for the
text box in a bit you will see how we
are going to make use of that class and
to set the HTML attributes we can set
them as unknown using an anonymous type
so new and we need to set the class for
the textbox controlled I'm in the CSS
class and to do that we type class but
then keep in mind class is a c-sharp or
reserved keyword and if you want to use
that as an attribute name then you need
to precede that with an add symbol okay
so the class is going to be date you can
give it any meaningful name I am just
giving it date okay so that's all the
modification that is required for this
date I'm partial video so this is going
to act as our you know customized
date/time editor template and then the
next thing is a modification is for our
edit view itself so now look at this we
are going to make use of jQuery calendar
so if we need the jQuery calendar then
we need to refer to some jQuery scripts
and CSS files okay but then if you look
at our MVC application we neither have
scripts folder not you know the CSS
contents folder within this project okay
now if you actually create a new MVC for
project look at this to create a new MVC
for project in visual studio so you go
to file new project and then you sell at
a speed on an MVC for web application to
give it a name and then once you click
OK it is going to ask you to pick a
template now when we were creating this
MVC demo project we picked the template
as empty project and that's the reason
why we don't have any contents and
script folders within that okay but then
if you select Internet application as
the template as the project template and
click OK then it is going to create a
project like this for you and it's going
to have the content folder which is
going to contain all they required
jQuery CSS files and similarly it's
going to have the scripts folder which
is going to have all the required jQuery
scripts
okay now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to right-click on this project
which I have created in that way and
then I'm going to open that in Windows
Explorer and then copy the content and
script folders so copy them and then I'm
going to go back to our MVC demo project
right click on the project name and I'm
going to paste in there so this should
copy over both the contents and scripts
and then we need to script files so one
is the jQuery script file itself and I'm
going to take the minified version will
talk about the minified difference
between minified jQuery and the normal
jQuery in a later video session but for
now we are simply going to take the
minified jquery javascript reference and
then jquery UI again the minified
version so these are the two javascript
files that are required
I mean jQuery script files and then the
next thing is the CSS files okay because
the calendar if you want the calendar to
have these styles you need to refer to
the CSS files so which are the two CSS
files I need the site dot CSS file
within the content folder and then the
other CSS file is within themes within
base its jQuery UI all CSS so let me
drag and drop so we have now all the
required script and CSS files the final
thing now is to actually attach our
invoke date picker function on this
textbox control so as soon as I move my
mouse
you know I click into this hired a text
box we want a calendar so we need to
call that date picker function you know
you know on this text box control and to
do that we have to write some JavaScript
I mean jQuery script so we are going to
use script tag here script type is equal
to text slash JavaScript and to write
JavaScript you know the first character
we use is dollar so we're going to write
a function here
and what I'm going to do is if you
remember in our date time editor
template
notice that we have set a CSS class of
date okay so the class for this text box
is going to be date and look at this we
are using HTML helper text box so what
is this going to do this is going to
generate an input type of text so an
input control of type text and the CSS
class is going to be date so I'm going
to select this control and invoke date
picker function on that control and how
are we going to do that using jQuery so
to find that text box control what I am
I going to do I am going to find all the
input controls of type text and which
has got a class a CSS class of date so
this you know jQuery selector should
find this text box control on the form
and on that let's go ahead and invoke
date picker function okay and to this
date picker function we need to specify
the date format as well so what is the
date format that we want as soon as we
select the date within the calendar you
know that gets populated within the text
box
so in which format do you want that to
be selected within the text box whether
it's in DD YY I mean mm YY or mmddyy Y
so you can specify that format so for
jQuery to specify the date format I'm
going to use the string date format and
then within double quotes you specify
the format DD mm / YY okay so those are
all the changes required now let's build
our solution and let's go back to a view
and refresh this now let's actually
cancel that and let
freshness so now these styles of this
page should also change because we are
referring to CSS files so it's going to
change the styles of all the controls
and look at that we have a semicolon
next to hire date that's possibly
because the thin date time let's see
HTML we have a semicolon Devi node we
don't need that so let's get rid of that
save it and let's refresh that so now we
shouldn't have that semicolon anymore
now when I click that look at that
I get the calendar okay now look at that
it is 2nd of November 2007 ok so I have
the date there already selected now if I
select for example 11th November look at
that 11th November 2007 so I have the
date okay now we have a calendar instead
of asking the user to literally type the
date into the textbox control alright on
