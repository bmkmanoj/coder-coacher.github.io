video we'll discuss passing data to the
thread function in a type safe manner
this is continuation part 89 so please
watch part eighty nine before proceeding
in part 89 we discussed passing data to
the thread function using parametrized
thread star delegate but the data
approach we have lost the type safety
feature of c-sharp programming language
so to pass data to the thread function
in a type safe manner encapsulate the
thread function and the data it needs in
a helper class and then use the thread
star delegate to execute the thread
function let's understand the statement
with an example so here this number
class is going to be of a helper class
this class contains the thread function
here print numbers is the thread
function because this is going to be
executed by a thread that we are going
to create now this print numbers
function also needs the target number
because it's going to print numbers
until a given target so it needs to know
about the target number and to hold that
target number by using this private
field underscore target so this helper
class that is the number class contains
two things the thread function which is
print numbers and the data this thread
function requires in this case the
target number and to initialize this
target you know private field within
this class be using this constructor
here so anybody who is going to make use
of this class they need to create an
instance of this class and when they are
creating an instance of this class they
are forced to use this constructor so
they are forced to provide a value for
the target number which will then be
used to initialize this private field
and then that in turn is used by this
method to print the numbers under that
given target now let's see how we are
using this within the main method so
here we are prompting the user to enter
the target number we are reading that
from the console converting it to an
integer and then storing it in this
variable of type integer and then we are
creating an instance of the number class
and notice that here we're using the
construct
that we have specified here and we are
passing the target that we have caught
from the end-user to that class
constructor so that is now populated
with in this private view and then when
we invoke print numbers function it's
going to print the numbers until that
given target so here we are creating an
instance of the thread class to its
constructor we are passing an instance
of thread start delegate this delegate
is pointing to this print numbers
function so when we invoke start method
on the thread it's going to execute that
print numbers function and it's going to
print the numbers until the given target
let's look at this in action we'll be
modifying the example that we worked
with in the previous session so first
let's modify this number class so here
we need a private field of type integer
let's call it underscore target and to
initialize this target field
we need a constructor so whatever we are
getting into this constructor we are
going to use that to populate the
private field of the class so this
underscore target equals whatever coming
into this function
I mean constructor and since you know
this class already contains the target
number there is no need to pass the
target number again as a parameter so we
can get rid of this and this function is
going to be an instance method so let's
get rid of that static keyword you can
get rid of this line here we can get rid
of this condition as well and within the
for loop we are going to check if I is
less than or equal to underscore target
this private field so that's the
modification for the helper class and
within our main method be prom the user
to enter the target number we are going
to read that from the console let's come
with that two integer
and then let's do it in a variable of
type integer the next step is to create
an instance of our number class own
number and notice that we are forced to
use that constructor we have waited for
that class and let's pass the value for
that parameter and here we are creating
an instance of the thread class and
instead of using parameterize the thread
start we can just use thread start
delegate and then number dot print
numbers and we can get rid of you know
the target parameter that is passed to
the start method because there's no need
to do that anymore because you know the
target number is now present within this
number class itself all right so here we
cannot invoke the print numbers function
on the name of the class because that's
an instance method now so we need to
pass this instance alright so let's go
ahead and run this and see if it works
as expected
let's enter the target number as 20 and
it prints enter 20 now is it mandatory
to create an instance of the thread star
delegate explicitly not really even if
we don't do that the compiler is
automatically going to do that implicit
conversion for us so still the program
should work in the same manner alright
so in this video we have discussed
passing data to the thread function in
our next video we'll discuss retrieving
data from the thread function using
callback method that's it for today
thank you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
