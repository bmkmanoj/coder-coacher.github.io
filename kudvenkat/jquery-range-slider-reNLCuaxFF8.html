in this video we'll discuss the jQuery
rain slider with an example here is what
we want to achieve we want to capture
the users minimum and maximum age using
this range slider so let's see how to
achieve this the first step here is to
implement the required HTML so within
the HTML we first need this little text
age followed by that we are going to
include a span element to display the
minimum and maximum age as we move these
sliders so let's go ahead and implement
the required HTML so first we need that
little text 8 followed by that a span
element to display the output so I'm
going to call this span output and
following this let's include two HTML
break elements and following that we
need the range slider itself so I'm
going to include it development let's
give it an ID let's set it to slider
let's include an HTML break now we need
a label to display this text minimum age
followed by that a text box similarly
another label and then a text box so
let's include a label here and this
label is going to display this text
minimum age similarly let's include
another label and this is going to say
maximum age followed by the minimum age
label we need a text box to capture the
minimum age so input type equals text
and let's give it an ID let's call it
txt min age so basically this label
right here is for this text box so I'm
going to use the for attribute and
specify the ID of the text box here okay
similarly this label is going to be for
a text box which is going to capture
maximum age so let's change the ID here
to txt Max age and this label is for
this text box so let's specify the idea
of the text box
in the for attribute of the label
alright and in between these text boxes
let's include an HTML break in fact
let's include to HTML breaks so let's
save the changes and reload this page so
we should get a UI
similar to what we have in our
presentation except that we don't have
the slider at the moment okay now to get
the slider on this development we have
to call the jQuery slider function so
let's find this development by ID so
let's use the jQuery ID selector find
the development and on that I'm going to
call slider function so let's save these
changes and let's reload our page now we
should get a slider but look at this
this is not a range slider okay so if
you want to get a range slider all you
need to do is set range option to true
so let's go ahead and do that so let's
pass a JavaScript object here and then
specify our options
so we want to range value data range
slider so I'm going to set the range
option to true let's save the changes
reload our page and look at this we
should get a range slider okay now let's
say you know this is 8 let's say minimum
age has to be at least 18 so I'm going
to set min and maximum age here so let's
specify the minimum value minimum let's
say it's 18 maximum let's say it's 100
okay now what we want to do is as we
move the minimum and maximum age sliders
we want to display you know the minimum
and maximum age here you know within the
span element so I'm going to make use of
slide event so this is the even that is
raised when we slide
you know the slider okay so let's
specify the callback function so this
function is going to receive two
parameters the event itself and the
element that triggered the event so in
this case this slider is the element
that triggered the event okay so within
the event handler what do we want to do
within the span element we want to
display our result now what I'm going to
do is
actually create a variable here and
let's call this pan output equals dollar
actually let's change the ID to output I
mean the variable name to output span
because the idea of the span element is
already span output so just to
differentiate between the two I'm
calling it output span and let's find
the span element by ID so the ID of the
span element is pan output so I'm going
to reuse this variable that's why I'm
cashing the element okay so we are going
to use that output span variable and I'm
going to use the HTML function so what
do we want to display we want to display
the minimum and maximum age as we move
the sliders okay so we can use this UI
element to retrieve the value so you i
dot values property okay we want values
of zero property that is going to give
us the minimum age okay and to that we
want to append a dash and then we want
to retrieve the maximum age value and
maximum age value is present at index
position one within that values array
okay and to that let's go ahead and
append this text ears okay so basically
we want minimum - maximum years okay so
let's go ahead and save our changes
reload this page so now look at this I
am moving the maximum years notice that
we have specified the minimum to be 18
that's why you know it displays the
minimum ages 18 maximum as we are
sliding this notice that that gets
updated now when we move the minimum age
slider notice that it gets updated as
well okay
now let's say when the web form first
loads
we want the minimum age you know the
minimum eight slided to be at 20 and
maximum eight slider to be at 30 for
example if that's the case you can
specify the values using values property
so values and let's say the default
values for minimum age is going to be 20
and Max is going to be 30 all right so
let's see what changes reload this page
now when the webform loads look at that
it's at 20 and this is at 30 now within
that span element we want to display the
minimum and maximum age when the wave
form initially loads to do that what I'm
going to do is we use this output span
element so within our jQuery ready
function when the wave form loads what I
want to do is use the HTML function and
display the current min and Max values
you know the default min and Max values
now here within the context of this HTML
function here we don't have this UI
parameter so what I'm going to do is
actually use this slider element itself
okay
so let's actually cache that so I'm
going to call the slider element equals
dollar hash slider okay so that's going
to find our development so let's use
this variable instead of finding it in
the dorm once again and here I'm going
to use that development and on that I'm
going to call this slider function and
you know I'm going to ask the slider
function for values property okay and I
want the value that is present at index
position 0 okay so that's going to give
us the minimum age and to that we want
to append this - and we want maximum
value so maximum value to retrieve that
we are going to use the same except that
the index position here will be 1 and to
that we want to append years word okay
that's it so let's go ahead and save our
changes reload the page so look at that
initially the values are 20 to 30 years
as we move the minimum age that gets
updated maximum major gets updated when
we move the maximum 8 slider now the
next thing that we want to do is when we
you know scroll this we want to display
them you know whatever slide of its
cross-slide we want to update the
corresponding values within the span
element but as soon as we stop it slider
at that point we want to retrieve the
minimum age maximum age and then display
them in the respective text boxes so I
can use stop even handler for that okay
so that is the event raised when we stop
sliding right so I'm going to use stop
option and then associate a callback
function so I'm actually going to make a
copy of this now we want to find the
text box element so the ex-demon age is
the ID of the minimum age textbox so
let's find it by jQuery ID selector and
on that I'm going to call the Val
function and what do we want to display
here we want to display the minimum age
value so we can get minimum age value
using UI dot values of zero okay and
similarly we want to retrieve the
maximum age value and we can do that by
replacing this index position with
number one okay and similarly when the
webform first loads what I want us
display the minimum and maximum age
within these respective text boxes okay
just like how we are displaying the
minimum and maximum age in the span
element and for that Kia let's find the
minimum age text box by ID and the value
of that I can use the same code right
similarly
let's find the max-age textbox and we
want the value that is present at index
position 1 so let's save our changes
reload our page and look at this when
the waveform initially loads you know we
have the current values displayed in the
span element and in the respective text
boxes as we slide look at that the value
in the span element gets updated but not
in the minimum age textbox now when I
stop sliding that's when the value will
be updated within the minimum age
textbox similarly when we move the max
age slider look at that span element
gets updated but nor the textbox as soon
as we stop sliding that's when the
textbox is updated but if you want you
know the value to be updated dynamically
in the respect to text boxes then
instead of using stop event handler you
could use slide even handler so if we
move this code into slide event handler
then you know as you move the slider the
values within the respective text boxes
will be updated let's reload our page
and quickly test this look at this as we
are sliding both the span and textbox
elements are updated so here is the HTML
and the jQuery code thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
