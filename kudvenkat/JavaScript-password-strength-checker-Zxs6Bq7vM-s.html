asp.net tutorial in this video we'll
discuss how to implement a simple
password strength checker using
javascript here is what we want to
achieve as we typed the password in the
password text box the strength of the
password should be displayed within the
label control the password strength is
determined based on the scoring criteria
if the pass would contain at least eight
characters then I had 20 points to the
password score if it contains at least
one lowercase letter then add 20 more
points if it contains at least one
uppercase letter 20 more points if it
contains at least one number 20 more
points and if it contains at least one
special character then 20 more points so
if a password satisfies all these
conditions then the password score is
going to be 100 so if the password score
is greater than or equal to 100 then the
password strength is strong if it's
greater than or equal to 80 then the
password strength is medium greater than
or equal to 60 weak less than 60 very
weak so let's see how to implement this
in an asp.net webforms application so
let's drag and drop a text box control
onto this waveform and we also need a
label control so let's drag and drop
that as well and within this script
section let's write a JavaScript
function let's name this check password
strength let's create a few variables
within this function the first thing
that we need is the password text box
itself so that's what text box equals
document or get element by ID and the ID
of the text box is textbox 1 so let's
copy that and next we need the password
itself so let's create a variable for
that password equals password text box
dot value
and then let's create a variable which
is going to store these special
characters to speed things up I have
typed some of the special characters so
exclamation pound dollar percentage etc
so let's include them in this variable
and then let's create another variable
to hold password score and let's
initialize that to zero now the first
thing that we want to do is check if the
password contains at least one of these
special characters so I'm going to use a
for loop here for variable I equals zero
I less than password dot length I plus
plus if our special characters are
present in this variable special
characters so if special characters dot
index off and the password is present in
this variable password password dot care
add
so if the index is greater than minus
one so what does this condition mean
here so basically we are checking if the
password contains at least one of these
special characters so in order to check
that we are looping through each
character within the password so we are
using a for loop looping through each
character and this caret function is
going to give us each character that is
present within the password and then we
are passing that character to this index
of method which we are calling on this
special characters string so if the
character that is present within the
password if that can be found in the
special character string then the index
of method is going to return the index
of that character within that string and
the index if the character is found will
definitely be greater than minus one so
if that's the case we want to add 20
points to this password score so if
there is a special character within the
password string then add 20 points to
pass what's cool now if the string
contains at least one lower case letter
then we want to add 20 more points so
let's check that if now we are going to
use regular expressions for this so if
regular expressions are usually present
in two forward slashes F a-to-z you know
the small letters the lowercase letters
if a to Z dot test and we want to check
if any of the characters between A to Z
are present within the password if
that's the case then add 20 more points
to the password score
similarly if the password contains at
least one uppercase letter between A to
Z then add 20 more points and if the
password contains at least one number
and to check if a number is present with
an S train we use backslash D that's the
regular expression and if a number can
be found at least one number within the
password then add 20 more points and
finally if the password length is
greater than eight characters then add
20 more points so password dot length
greater than or equal to eight
then add 20 more points now let's go
ahead and create two more variables
variable strength let's initialize that
to an empty string variable background
color and let's initialize that also to
an empty string in F now here is our you
know scale if the password score is
greater than or equal to 100 then the
password strength is strong so if
passwords collator than are equal to 100
then strength equals strong
and background color equals green we
want to change the background color of
the e password text box to green okay
allows F let's make a copy of this so
else F passwords Co is greater than or
equal to 80 then the password strength
is medium so strength is going to be
medium and we want the background color
to be grey so let's make a copy of this
if it's greater than or equal to 60 then
the password strength is weak and we
want to display a maroon background
color and finally
you know if it's less than 60 the
password score then the password
strength is very weak and we want to
display a red background color but in
the textbox control okay right so now
document dot get element by ID we want
to display the strength of the password
within the label control and the ID of
the label control is label one so let's
copy that dot in a HTML equals strength
of the password and let's also change
the background color of the text box so
we already have the password text box so
password text box dot style dot
background color equals we have a
variable background color and let's also
change the font color of the text box
and to change the font color we use the
color property so let's change the font
color to white within the text box
control all right and we want to call
this JavaScript function on key up event
of the textbox control so anytime we
type a key into the textbox we want to
call this function all right so let's go
ahead and run this
and look at this as we type you know P
kept the letter P only one letter so the
password is very weak so play gene and
at the moment we only have six
characters there the moment I add a
number look at that the password
strength has changed from very weak to B
if I put another number look at that
medium and if I include a special
character know it is strong so if you
look at this password it contains a
special character one number one you
know lower case letter one upper case
letter and the length of the password is
greater than eight so it satisfies all
these conditions so it displays strong
within the label control at the moment
the characters within the password are
displayed within the textbox control if
you don't want that simply set text mode
property of the textbox control two
password and that should hide the
characters so let's reload this page so
look at this as we type now the
characters are not displayed thank you
for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
