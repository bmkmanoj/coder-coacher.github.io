video we'll discuss aggregate functions
in link link standard query operators
like select where order by min max count
etc can be broadly classified into these
categories aggregate operators grouping
operators restriction operators etc in
this video we will be discussing
aggregate operators here are the
aggregate operators men max sum count
average and aggregate in this video
we'll be discussing all these aggregate
operators except the aggregate operator
in our next video we'll be discussing
the benefit of aggregate operator now
let's write some examples using these
aggregate operators at the moment on my
machine I have two instances of visual
studio running one solution is called
demo so here we'll be writing examples
without using link and in the other
solution that is in link demo solution
will be rewriting the same example using
link okay so now what we want to do is
here I've got an integer array and it
contains numbers from 1 to 10 so we want
to write um you know a program which is
going to find out the smallest number in
this array and then print that out again
we want to do that without using link so
in order to implement that we first need
a variable let's make it an malleable
integer and we are going to use this
variable to store the smallest number to
store the result okay so how we are
going to find that so we are going to
use a for each loop and then loop
through each integer that we have caught
in the numbers collection and then we
check if this result variable if it does
not have a value or if I is less than
the value that is already there within
the result variable then in that case we
want to store that value of I within the
result variable so this is how we find
in
now the smallest number within this
number sorry and then finally what we
want to do is write out the smallest
number alright so look at you know how
much code we have to write just to find
out the smallest number within a given
array so now when we run this it should
print out number one now let's see how
to achieve the same thing using link so
let's copy this our a and then let's
move to the other instance of visual
studio which is linked demo and paste
that array right there and notice that
I'm already using system dot link
namespace and so let's say end result
equals so we have the numbers are a and
then look at this we have this min link
function so all you need to do is just
use that function so this function is
going to return the smallest number
within this collection and let's print
the result out so console dot readline
result so now when we run this we should
get number one as the result okay look
at you know how simple it is with length
now let's say I want to find out the
smallest even number now if I have to
achieve that without using blank then
you know there's the same logic but
except that here we need to check if I
mod 2 equals 0 so when will a number be
an even number if it's divisible by two
you know if the reminder is zero then
that's when the number is even number in
that case check if the result variable
has already has a value if it doesn't
have a value or if it is less than the
result then store that within the result
variable so this should give us the
smallest even number so again so much of
code to find the smallest even number in
a given array of integers so let's run
this notice that the result is 2 and if
you have to achieve that width length
all you need to do is use the ver
standard query operator um and then you
know
we want to filter these numbers and how
do we want to filter them so take each
number let's call it X X such that X mod
2 equals 0 so what is this very operator
going to do it's going to return look at
the return type it's going to return
ienumerable of int meaning a list of
integers but then it's only going to
return all the even numbers and then
from that list you know this min query
extension method is going to return the
smallest even number so when we run this
we should get 2 as the result and again
look at how precise the syntax is with
length okay so now let's see how to find
out the largest number so to find out
the largest number without using the
length so we can comment this one
because we want to find the largest
number within the array so if we have to
achieve that without using link the same
idea we're going to look to each number
in the array and then we say if I value
is greater than what is already there in
the result then store that value in the
result okay so when we run this it
should print 10 but with length it's as
simple as saying you know
just use Mac's function so this is going
to give us the maximum number within
that array so number ten and when we run
this it should give number ten okay now
if we want to find out the largest even
number then include this condition right
so this I mean is going to return the
largest even number which is again ten
and if we want to achieve the same thing
with the link use the where and filter
you know the even numbers retrieve the
even numbers and then get the maximum
out of it again the output should be ten
okay now let's say how to find out the
sum of all numbers so if we have to
achieve that without using link so let's
comment this one right here we want to
find out the sum of all numbers so here
we are going to initialize this result
to zero and then we are looping through
each element within the array and then
we will say result equals result plus I
okay so again this bit of code to
achieve this so when we run this we
should get the sum of first 10 numbers
which is 55 this is without using link
and if we have to achieve that with the
link all you need to do is use the sum
aggregate function so dot sum when we
run this we should get the same output
which is 55 now if we want to find the
sum of all even numbers then we use this
condition right here right so this
should compute the sum of all even
numbers let's go and run the sum of all
even numbers is 30 now let's see how to
achieve that with length all you need to
do is use the very extension method
filter out the even numbers and then
compute the sum of them so again it
should give the same output
so now let's see how to find out the
count of all numbers how many elements
we have in a given array now if we have
to do that without link then instead of
computing the sum of numbers what we
want to do is we want to actually count
the number of element so instead of
saying result equals result plus I we
will say result equals result plus 1 so
when we run this we should get 10 and if
we have to achieve that with link we use
the count aggregate function
so let's go to and rundas we should get
10 as the result and if we want to find
the count of all even numbers then we
use this condition here in the for each
loop so this should return 5 and if we
have to achieve that with link we use
the very extension method and we should
get 5 and let's see how to find out
average of all numbers now if we have to
find the average of all numbers we have
to first add all the numbers together
and then divide them or divide that sum
by total number of elements that we have
caught in that array so to hold the sum
I'm actually going to have another
variable let's call it end some actually
let's make the type Y 2 double sum and
then to hold the total number of
elements let's call it total we have an
integer variable let's again initialize
that to 0 and result is going to be
double ok so we want to find the average
of all numbers so we are going to loop
through each number within the array
then we can comment this one so we need
to find the sum so sum equals sum plus I
and we also need to find the total
number of elements or total equals total
plus 1
right so once we have the sum and total
to compute the average result equals sum
by total number of elements and we print
out the result so when we run this we
should get the average of our numbers
from 1 to 10 which is 5.5 now if we have
to achieve that same thing with laying
all we do is use the average aggregate
function and the reason why we have
compliation error is because average
returns double but this result is of
type integer so let's make this two
double run that and 5.5 and if we want
the average of all even numbers we use
the where and say X such that X mod 2
equals 0 so get all the even numbers and
then compute the average of that which
is 6 and if we have to achieve that
without using glend
then we need to have this condition
right here so let's run this so 6
average okay so we have used some of the
aggregate functions let's look at
another example so let's say we have the
string theory right here and we want to
find out the shortest country name and
the number of characters in it and the
longest country name number of
characters so let's copy this string now
first let's see how to achieve this
without using links so let's get rid of
all this from here so we have string
array now what we want to do is print
the numbers number of characters in the
shortest country name so for that first
let's use a variable to hold the result
so let's call it result and that's
actually make it malleable type and hold
null value right we are going to use it
for each loop for each string STR n D
countries
if the result variable does not have a
value Oh
if the STR dot length okay if that is
less than the value that we have in the
result then we know for sure you know
that string has got you know less
characters than what is already stored
in the result variable in that case
we'll say result equals STR dot length
and then finally we'll print a message
the shortest country name so console dot
write line shortest country name has you
know whatever characters in its name and
where do we get this from from the
result variable so now when we run this
it should actually print too because
here UK is the name of the country which
has got the least number of characters
which is two so let's go ahead and run
this look at that the shortest country
name has two characters in its name now
if we have to achieve this with length
look at how simple it is and work the
min function and then pass a lambda
expression which is going to return the
length of each string okay so it's
basically going to get the string or the
length you know which is the smallest in
this case it's going to return to that
because that's the length of the
smallest number of characters in a given
string so to achieve that let's copy
this array
and paste it right there
we don't need this variable
country start minimum you know country
such that country dot length okay and if
we want to print the same message let's
actually copy the string placed it right
there and once we run this the same
result okay
and if we want to find out the country
which has got you know the longest
number of characters in its name then
the largest country name has whatever
characters in its name and instead of
men use max function so when we run this
we should get five as India has got five
characters in its name and if we have to
achieve that with without using link
then the same program but we say length
is greater than what we already have in
result variable and let's say the
largest country name has so five
characters okay so in our next video
we'll discuss using aggregate operator
