Lincoln this is part 46 in this part we
will see how to use enum in an example
and the advantages of doing so in fact
45 we have seen I mean we have written a
very simple program there were a set of
related numbers basically to describe
zero for unknown one for male and two
for female and the program was less
readable there because we are using
these integers okay how do I know what
does one mean it's mock male or female
I'm listen under like dragged down and
look at the documentation I will not
know that okay now this is a very simple
program we just have one you know gender
which is using set of related numbers
but in reality in your application there
will be hundreds and hundreds of related
numbers you know and it becomes
extremely complex if you have to rely on
these integral numbers your program
becomes unreadable it becomes
unmaintainable or a period of time okay
now how do we make this readable to make
this readable you can make use of enums
okay so let's see how to replace that
now just like how I have created a class
using the class keyword to create an
enum you use the enum keyword and by the
way enums are value types we will be
talking about all the other concepts
related to enums in a later session but
in this session we will look at an
example of using enums and replace these
you know integer related numbers using
that enum okay so let's create an enum
for gender and to do that we use the
enum keyword so public email and let's
call that as gender and what I'm going
to do is I'm going to say okay my enum
is going to be starting with unknown and
then male
and then female okay all we have done
here is created these three entries so
create an enum using the enum keyword
and then unknown male female so we are
done creating the enum let's see how to
use this enum in our sample program okay
so now in this program what you can
basically do is okay before we modify
this method will actually modify the
customer class itself now instead of
saying the customer class gender as
integer we will say this is going to be
of type gender all right that's the
first change and the next change is in
this method okay so instead of passing
in integer we'll pass in the enum now
gender and then this is switching on the
gender type UNAM okay so now here
instead of saying zero what you can
basically do is you can use your agenda
and say gender dot unknown now look at
it it becomes more readable okay this is
whatever code that goes in here is for
unknown gender
initially it was one two and zero zero
means what is it for male or female over
R no we didn't have the readability
there and similarly for case one we will
say gender dot male and look at this the
best part is you get intellisense as
well so male and similarly gender dot
female and we will leave the default
there okay so this is the second change
and the third change is in your customer
object itself we know that in this
customer object this gender is actually
an enum and look at this okay what is
marks gender if he is a male instead of
okay what is the value for male is it 1
0 2 or 3 or 4 instead of referring back
to the values what you can do okay it
uses gender so gender dot male
and if you hover your mouse over that
you will say customer dot gender you
know property is of type gender you can
see that on the left hand side similarly
if I hover over here by customer name
properties of string type gender is of
type you know gender enum if you're not
sure you can actually right click go to
definition okay gender look at this name
is of type string gender is of type
gender enum and if you want to look at
the values you can just click no right
click go to definition and you can see
unknown male female okay so now let's go
and change it here so maybe is a female
so I can say gender dot female and here
Sam gender is unknown so we'll say
gender dot unknown and by the way look
at this just like how we have for
example in our you know this is the
symbol for an enum it's like a postcard
over a postcard this is a symbol for
enum just keep that in the back of your
mind just by looking at you know when
you press dot the intent in the
intelligence you can actually tell by
the symbol is it a class is a tenant of
is or is it an enum alright so we are
done now so our program is actually more
readable okay now by looking at this you
can say okay mark is male mary is female
and Sam's gender is unknown and even
your switch statement here is now more
readable okay now if we run the program
output doesn't change in any way except
that we have restructured our program
using enums which make this which made
this program readable and more
maintainable even if your application if
the complexity of your application grows
and if you keep adding more enums you
know it is still going to be more
readable and more maintainable and
actually within the dotnet framework
itself there are several enums for
example if you look at the system to the
IO namespace within system that I you
name space you have you know for example
file share let's say for example the
program
has already opened the file and if you
want to open the file again what kind of
you know share permissions you want to
have okay do you want to open it and
read only mode read right or right wall
if these are just numbers then it
becomes extremely complex to remember
okay what is it for read and what is the
number for right or what is the number
for delete okay so using enums
definitely makes you a program more
readable okay now we have just spoken
about why items are required and what
are the problems enum solve you know it
makes your program more readable and
more maintainable but we haven't spoken
the concepts related to enums which we
will actually be doing in the next
session okay we will be talking about
you know the different things that you
can do you know converting an enum into
an underlying type and similarly
converting the underlying types back to
enums you know trying to assign the
values of one enum to another EMM
listing all the values of anonymity
cetera which we'll be doing in the next
session on this line you can find

interview questions that's it for today
