this video we'll discuss how to get the
checked checkbox text along with the
value this is continuation to part 12 so
please watch part 12 before proceeding
here is what we want to achieve as we
check these check boxes we want to
retrieve both the text and value in this
example j/s is the value javascript is
the text so text is what we usually
display to the end-user value will be
stored in the DBA and here is the
example that we worked with in the
previous video session notice we have
got two checkbox groups skills and
preferred cities in our case all these
check boxes have got you know the same
text and value however in real time that
may not be the case always the value may
be different from text and if you look
at the jQuery code that we have written
in the previous video session what does
this result collection contain it
contains all those checked check boxes
and here we are using this jQuery each
function to iterate over the check boxes
that are present within this result
collection and notice we are calling
this here so what is this keyword
referring to this is referring to a
check box within that result collection
and on that element we are calling value
function what does this value function
going to do it's going to return as the
value of the check box
similarly in jQuery we also of got text
a function which is going to return us
the text of an element so let's use that
and see if that's going to work with
check box so we have the value here now
to that let's append a dash and then to
that let's append the text of the check
box and to get the check text of the
check box I'm going to call text
function and to that lets append an HTML
break so let's save these changes and
let's reload this page and look at this
when I select JavaScript I get the value
and we have a dash there but we don't
care
the text that is associated with that
checkbox okay so basically text function
is not working with that checkbox
element okay so let's see now how to
retrieve the text so here we have got
the text this is the text that is
displayed next to this checkbox element
okay so to make this work I'm actually
going to put this inside a label control
and then on that label control we can
call text and it's going to work so
let's take that value and let's use a
label here and let's use for attribute
for that label and I'm using this label
for this checkbox okay so I'm going to
call it for option - I'm actually going
to change the value or for javascript
checkbox to j/s you know and here we are
going to say this is the label for
option - j s and then let's paste the
text that we want to display next to the
checkbox okay so for this checkbox the
value is j s and text is JavaScript okay
now for this for attribute we have
specified the value s option - gia's you
can give this any meaningful name that
you want for example I can give it like
CB - j s so this is label for checkbox
JavaScript okay
so similarly let's do that modification
for all these checkboxes so for the
jQuery checkbox the value is going to be
JQ for C sharp
let's actually change it to CS for V B
it's going to be maybe similarly for New
York NY New Delhi and D and London let's
change it to L N and let's also include
a label for every check box so let's
paste that there and for these check
boxes as well okay so for jQuery you
know this for attribute of the label is
going to contain CB
- jq4 c-sharp it is going to be CS and
for Visual Basic VB and for this label
and why New Delhi and London okay and
similarly we want to change the text as
well so let's take that and put it
inside this label similarly let's take C
sharp and put it here and VB and let's
do the same thing for the other set of
checkboxes and finally London
alright now so we have a check box and a
label okay so here we are iterating
through all the check boxes that are
present within that result collection
and here is that loop so here I'm
actually going to create a variable
let's actually call this selected value
equals I'm actually going to use this
okay so let's cut that from there and
include that okay so within the result
string what we want we want the value of
the check box okay so that's going to be
in that selected value variable and to
that we want to append the text and
where is the text present that is
present inside the label and if you look
at the for attribute value you know it
is CB - Jas for JavaScript CB - JQ for
jQuery okay so after - whatever text you
have that is equal to the value of the
associated checkbox okay and we already
have the selected value of the checkbox
okay so now what I'm going to do
instead of using this this keyword what
does this refers to this refers to the
checkbox that is present within this
result collection okay but the text now
is actually present in the label control
so we want to retrieve the text from The
Associated label okay so how are we
going to find this label we can use you
know this jQuery selector find all label
elements where for attribute equals CB
so that's how the value is - and then
you know whatever is they value of the
checkbox okay so to that we want to
concatenate the value of the checkbox
and where is the value of the checkbox
present that is present in the selected
value variable so I can use that there
so CB - if it is you know JavaScript
checkbox CB - je s so that's going to
get this label control and the text
method is going to pull out the text
from that label okay
so CB - J's for example and then we need
to close this quotation mark so let's
put a single code there so we need to
close that double quote and we need to
close the square bracket and finally end
the single code okay and then we are
calling text function that should return
us the text that is present in the
associated label okay
so let's save these changes and let's go
ahead and reload the page look at this
when we select JavaScript I get the
value J s and the text JavaScript
similarly when we select New Delhi so nd
is the value and New Delhi is the text
okay
and here's the HTML and the jQuery code
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
