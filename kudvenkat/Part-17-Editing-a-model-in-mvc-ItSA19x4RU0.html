venket this is part 17 of asp.net MVC
tutorial in this video we'll discuss
editing a model in MVC please watch part
16 before proceeding with this video
this what we want to achieve at the
moment we have this index view which
lists all the employees that are present
in this database table now notice that
every employee has caught an edit link
next to them once I click on this edit
link we want to present the user with
this edit form where we can change the
employee details as required and then
once we click on the Save button we want
to save the changes to the database
table let's flip to the browser so this
is the index view now let me click on
this edit link and see what's going to
happen
we get an error the resource cannot be
found notice the URL we are navigating
to edit action with an employee
controller okay and look at employee
controller class do we have edit action
method within that no we don't and
that's the reason why we get this error
the resource cannot be found so
obviously the first thing to do is to
implement this edit action method within
employee controller class so this is how
it's going to look and the first thing
to notice here look at the name it's
edit and then notice that this method is
decorated with HTTP GET attribute
meaning this controller action method is
only going to respond to the get request
of this URL
what is this URL the action name is edit
and this controller action method will
only ever respond to the get request of
this URL because it's decorated with
HTTP cap attribute and another important
thing to notice is the parameter look at
this it is receiving a parameter you
know ID parameter look at the URL once
we click on this edit link we are also
passing the ID of the employee ok so
that gets passed into this controller
action method and within the action
method itself what we are doing we are
creating an instance of employee
business layer class and this object has
got employees property which is going to
list all the employees but then we want
only that single employee who
should match with what's coming into the
saidit method okay so we are using that
little lambda expression there to get
that single employee and then once we
have the employee that we want to edit
be handed over to the view the view will
render this form so let's go ahead and
implement this controller action method
let's flip to visual studio so let's
make a copy of this action method just
to speed things up so let's get rid of
this action name attribute and let's
name our controller action method edit
and then we need to have a parameter ID
so this is going to be the ID of the
employee that we are going to edit so
now let's go ahead and create an
instance of our employee business lay
class so employee business layer and
then this object has got a property
employees which is going to list all the
employees but we are only interested in
that single employee where that
employee's ID is equal to whatever is
coming into this method as a parameter
and let's assign it to employee object
and then let's hand this employee object
to the view okay so we are done
implementing the controller action
method now we need the view and to
generate the view right click on the
controller action method select add view
from the context menu look at that the
name of the view is headed view engine
is going to be racer we want to create a
strongly typed view and our model class
is going to be employee class that's
present in our business layer project
and scaffold template is going to be
added okay let's click add and this
should add edit dot CS HTML view within
employees folder lo so I have here edit
dot CS HTML now the first thing that I
want to do is I want to get rid of the
scripts section here and we are going to
talk about scripts in a later video
session and then let me add
another div tag here to specify a style
of font family so div style is equal to
font - family and let's set it to area
and let's take the closing div tag and
move that to the end of the form okay so
that's all there to it let's go ahead
and run this now let's navigate to the
index action so that should list all the
employees let's click on edit look at
that I get you know the employee that
I'm trying to edit here mark is gender
is male City London and and date of
birth now one thing to notice here on
gender at the moment it's using text box
but it makes more sense to have a
drop-down list for gender instead of
text box as an editing interface and if
you remember we have implemented you
know if you go back to the list and then
if we click on this create new look at
this we have this form to create a new
employee and we implemented this in part
12 of this video series okay and notice
that for gender we have a drop-down list
here so we can make use of the same code
from that create view okay so let's go
back to visual studio we have this
create view there so here we have this
piece of code you know which renders the
drop-down list for us okay and notice
that you know we are using this
drop-down list
HTML helper so let me copy that
and then move that over to our edit view
so here we have this gender so I'm going
to replace this code with this one and
let's format this properly to do that
select the HTML and + ctrl K D alright
so what we are doing here look at this
this is the name of the property gender
and then a drop down list is a
collection of you know select a list
item objects so we are creating a new
list of select item select list item and
these are our two objects you know male
and female and then we want this as the
first option within the drop-down list
okay so with that let's go ahead and run
this and see if it's going to work as
expected so employee index let's edit so
Mary and notice that the gender
drop-down list has correctly selected
male agenda which is female
okay it's not defaulting to select
agenda okay
now let's change Mary's details from New
York to let's say New York one and let's
submit this and see what's going to
happen again we have an error the
resource cannot be found and it makes
sense because you know this is the URL
but we are posting the form okay and if
you look at the controller action method
that we have with an employee we have an
edit controller action method but then
since we have decorated that the HTTP
GET attribute it's going to respond only
to the cat request of this URL but not
the post request in our next video we'll
discuss how to solve this error on the
slide you can find resources for asp.net
c sharp ends equals the way interview
questions that's it for today thank you
for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
