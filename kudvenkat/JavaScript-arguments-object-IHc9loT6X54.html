in this video we'll discuss the
arguments object in JavaScript the
JavaScript arguments object is a local
variable available within all functions
it contains all the function parameters
that are passed to the function and can
be indexed like an array the length
property of the arguments object returns
the number of arguments passed to the
function let's understand this arguments
object with an example here we have
print arguments function notice that it
is declared without any formal
parameters and we are calling print
arguments here we are not passing any
arguments to this function so in this
case this method should print number of
arguments equals 0 on the second line
here we are passing two arguments so in
this case we should get this message
number of arguments equals 2 and
whatever those 3 are two arguments are
and finally we are passing 3 arguments
to this function in this case the
message should be number of arguments
equals 3 and whatever those 3 arguments
are so let's see how to achieve this
using the arguments object so let's
create a function let's name this print
arguments and to get the number of
arguments that are passed to the
function when we call this function we
can use the arguments object so this
object is available within all functions
and length property should give us the
number of arguments that are passed to
this function and we want to print this
message all humans count equals whatever
is the number of arguments that are
passed to this function and then let's
print an HTML break now what we want to
do is loop through each argument that is
present in this argument object and
print its value so let's use a for loop
for that so let's start at 0 I less than
arguments dot length I plus plus
now here the message that we want to
plant is the argument index so let's use
this text argument and then whatever is
the index position of the argument so we
get that using this variable I and then
let's append an equal to symbol and then
the actual value of the argument and
that's present within arguments object
and notice that we can index it like an
array and then let's also append an HTML
break so that each argument will be
printed on a separate line and after we
have all the arguments printed let's
print another HTML break all right now
let's call this print arguments function
let's first call it without any
arguments now let's call it with two
arguments a and B and now let's call it
with three arguments let's run this and
see the output that we get notice that
when we call the function without any
arguments arguments count is zero and we
call it with two arguments arguments
count is two and those two arguments are
printed and when we call it three
arguments arguments count is three and
we get those three arguments so pretty
straightforward to get all the arguments
and we are using arguments object for
that purpose another common question
that gets asked is is it possible to
pass variable number of arguments to a
JavaScript function the answer is yes
you can pass as many arguments as you
want to any JavaScript function all the
parameters will be stored in the
arguments object let's look at another
quick example so let's use another
function here let's call it add numbers
now we want to provide a capability
where you know we can use this function
to add as many number
it says we want now if the end user
passes no arguments no numbers in that
case it should say count of numbers is
zero and sum of numbers is zero in case
if we pass three numbers like this then
it should say count of numbers is three
and the sum of those three numbers in
this case is 60 so it should print the
sum so let's see how to achieve this so
to achieve this we can use the arguments
object so first we want to print the
number number of numbers that are passed
to this function so document dot write
count of numbers equals and to get the
count of arguments that are passed we
can use the length property let's up in
an HTML break and then let's create a
variable first to hold the sum of
numbers and let's initialize that to
zero and then let's use a for loop so
for where I equals zero I less than
arguments dot length I plus plus so we
are looping through each argument object
using this for loop and then let's
initialize the sum sum equals sum plus
arguments of I so we are looping through
each argument that is passed to the
function and then adding it you know
adding all those numbers together and
storing that result in this sound
variable and finally we want to print
the Sun so document dot write sum of
numbers equals whatever is the sum
and then let's print an HTML break as
well all right so first let's call add
numbers without any arguments
now let's pass 10 20 and 30 so let's run
this program notice that in the first
case count of numbers is 0 and sum of
numbers is 0 count of numbers is 3 and
sum of 10 20 and 30 is 60 the arguments
object is available only inside a
function body attempting to access the
arguments object outside a function
results in arguments is undefined error
so this arguments object is available
only inside the context of a function if
we try to access the arguments object
outside of the function body then you
will get arguments is undefined error
and though we can index the arguments
object like an array as you can see here
it's not an array ok the arguments
object is not an array it does not have
any added properties except length for
example it does not have the sort method
that the array object has however we can
convert the arguments object to an array
there are two ways we can do that so
let's see how to convert the arguments
object to an array and then use the sort
method to sort the numbers so let's call
this print numbers
and let's create a variable here let's
call this arguments array equals I'm
going to use the array class and it has
got prototype so array dot prototype dot
slice method call so here we are using
this slice method and then we are going
to call that slice method and I'm going
to pass the arguments object as a
parameter to that function so that
function is going to convert that
arguments object to NRA so in this case
this args array will actually contain
the arguments object in the form of an
array now since that's present in the
form of an array we can use this sort
method and then let's write the value
that is present within the arguments
array to the page so let's call this
print numbers function and let's pass
three numbers let's pass maybe 50 20 and
70 now notice these numbers are not
sorted now we are converting these
arguments you know these arguments gets
passed to this arguments object and then
we are using the slice method of the
array object to convert that arguments
object to an array and then we are
calling the sort method so this should
automatically sort the numbers within
this array and then we are writing the
values to the page so let's run this and
see if the numbers get sorted notice
that we passed 50 20 70 we get 20 50 70
the numbers are sorted so one way to
sort I mean to convert the arguments
object to an array is by using array dot
prototype or you can also use the array
literal like this so you can use square
brackets dot sliced call and then pass
the arguments object now when we run
this we should still get the same
response
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
