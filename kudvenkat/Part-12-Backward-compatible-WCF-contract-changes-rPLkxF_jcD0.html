this video we'll discuss how to make
changes to WCF contracts in a backward
compatible manner so that it doesn't
break the existing clients this is
continuation 2 part 11 so please watch
part 11 before proceeding now I must
tell you that I have modified the
employee service and the client
applications so that the state of both
of these applications is similar to how
it was at the end of part 8 in this
video series so if you want to follow
along make sure you make those changes
as well now if you notice this employee
service contract yeah these operation
contracts get employees save employee
they're using employee object and if you
look at the employee class it's actually
a data contract so our employee service
now is making use of data contracts
instead of message contracts after the
WCF service is deployed on the
production server the vestal document
shouldn't be changed in any way that
would break the existing clients this is
because the clients have already
generated the proxy classes and the
relevant configuration to interact with
our service if we intend to make changes
those changes should be done in such a
way that they support backward
compatibility in general WCF contracts a
version tolerant by default the data
contract serializer which is the default
engine for serialization in WCF allows
missing non required data and ignores
any superfluous data for service
contracts data contracts and message
contracts for a full list of changes and
the impact that these changes could have
on the existing clients refer to this
MSDN article now when we navigate to
this article notice the table right here
basically this table lists all the
service contract changes and the impact
that these changes could have on the
existing clients now when we add new
parameters to an operation signature
clients are unaffected that's basically
because new parameters are initialized
to their default values at this service
side let me explain what I mean
let's say for example here get employee
is expecting ID parameter now if we go
ahead and add a new parameter to this
operation contract okay so obviously we
need to make that change within the
implementation as well let's run the
host so the host is running now let's
run the client as well so get employee
look at that it's working as expected
okay
in spite of adding a new parameter to
this get employee method now what
actually happens here when we add new
parameters to an existing operation
contract and if the client doesn't send
any values for those new parameters
because the existing clients doesn't
know about this new parameter okay so
they are not going to send any data for
this parameter so what's going to happen
at the service side is this parameter
will be initialized to its default value
and the client is unaffected okay so
adding new parameters to an existing
operation contract this change will not
affect the existing clients
similarly removing parameters from an
existing operation signature again
clients are unaffected because when we
remove an existing parameter okay if we
remove an existing parameter declined
we'll continue to send data for that
existing parameter okay and what happens
at the service side is the service will
simply simply ignore that extra data
that is coming in and obviously that
data will be lost at the service but the
clients are unaffected the client will
continue to send data for those
parameters that we have removed the
service will simply ignore them and the
data will be lost to the service but the
client will not get any exception okay
so adding or removing parameters from an
existing operation contract
you know these changes will not affect
that client modifying parameter types
change may or may not impact the
existing clients depending on whether
the parameter types are compatible for
example let's say you know this ID
parameter initially it is of type
integer now let's change the type of
this parameter to date/time okay now
obviously the existing clients will
continue to send data for this parameter
so once the data arrives at the service
the service will try to convert the data
to date/time data type if the service is
successful in doing that conversion then
no problem the client is unaffected on
the other hand if the service is not
able to do that conversion because the
types are not compatible obviously an
exception will be thrown okay and the
same is the case with modifying types
for return values if the types are
compatible client unaffected otherwise
an exception will be thrown adding new
operations now this doesn't affect the
client because when we add new operation
contracts let's say for example to this
let's put it how it works
now to this service contract if I add
maybe a new operation contract let's say
get employee name by ID
let's pass an ID and this is an
operation contract so when we add a new
operation contract now this service has
got two three operation contracts but
the existing clients who have already
built their Vistal I mean the proxy
classes and the configuration they will
know only about these two operation
contracts they will not know about this
third operation contract so they will
not be able to invoke this operation
contract but the new clients you know
they will know about this because they
have just generated proxy classes based
on the vestal document the vestal the
new Vistal document contains get
employee name by ID operation contract
as well so they will be able to invoke
this method but the existing clients
will not know about this method
so they will not be able to invoke it
but they won't receive any exception
they will continue to work in the same
way
removing operations will impact the
existing clients if they try to call
that operation for example let's say
let's get rid of this operation contract
yard now let's comment this save
employee operation contract
let's close the host that's already
running so at the moment this service
has made only so we have an error that's
basically because this has to be an
integer type let's go ahead and run the
host
okay now the existing client who has
already billed their proxy classes you
know they know that they're going to
have get employee and save employee
method so our client that we have built
before making you know the changes to
the vessel document look at this in
button save we are invoking save
employee method so when we run this and
try to invoke that save employee look at
this get employee will continue to work
but if I try to save this employee let's
say with ID 3 we get an exception so
save employee cannot be processed at the
receiver okay because that operation
contract doesn't exist
okay so removing an operation contract
can have an impact on existing clients
and the second table here lists the
changes that we can make to a data
contract and the impact that these
changes could have on the existing
clients now adding new non required
members to an existing data contract
clients are unaffected okay look at this
it's a new non required member now how
can we make a specific member required
or not required if you look at the data
contract so here let's uncomment this
look at this employee Clause this is a
data contract and within this we've got
several data member
okay and this data member attribute has
got is required parameter okay so if we
set this parameter to true obviously
that member is required now when I for
example add a new member so let's add
City as a new member and city is going
to be string type and let's set order to
sex now this is a new non required
member so we are changing the data
contract we are adding a new non
required member the existing client is
unaware of this new member so obviously
the existing client is not going to send
any data for this member so which means
you know this member will be initialized
to its default and then will be inserted
into the data table with whatever
default value that we specify but then
there won't be any exception sent to the
client let's actually look at that in
action so we have a non required member
here so let's go to the table first and
at the moment if you look at this table
it doesn't have city column let's
actually alter this table to have a city
column and we want to add city column
and let's set the data type to n where
care of 50 and obviously get employee
and save employee the procedures which
our service calls we need to modify
those procedures as well so we have SP
get employee so let's go ahead and
modify the stored procedure and to get
the text of that stored procedure use SP
underscore health procedure get the text
and let's quickly change the
implementation of this one to release to
return city as well okay so let's modify
the stored procedure
and similarly we need to modify save
employee SP save employee so let's copy
the text of that and then to the save
employee let's first change create to
Alder we need to pass city and this is
of type and we're care of 50 and let's
initial I I mean let's specify a default
value of null for that so if you don't
have a value for this parameter then
null be null will be inserted into the
table so let's also pass at city to this
method I mean to this insert statement
let's execute this alright so we are
done from the database side so let's go
to the service itself and if you look at
the service this employee object has got
now City data member so obviously when
we get an employee we need to initialize
that our property similarly when we try
to save it we need to add value for that
parameter so let's get to the service
implementation so within the service
implementation here we have you know
annual salary and city so City equals
let's copy this and paste it right there
and let's change this to City and let's
do the same thing in this block as well
alright so that is going to you know
cater for get employee now let's get to
save employee so we are saving the
employee object here so let's copy these
lines and then create a new sequel
parameter let's call this parameter city
so the name of the parameter is add city
employee object has got
city property so use that and we want to
add this parameter sitting to this
command object alright so we're done
with these changes let's stop the
service that's already running let's run
the host once again
okay the service is hosted now let's get
to the client so let's run the client so
the client doesn't know about the new
data member that we have added and if
you look at the new data member that we
have just added it's a non required data
member ok so obviously the client is not
going to send data for this data member
ok so what happens is the service side
is being she lies to its defaults and
the default value will be stored in the
database table let's actually look at
that in action so when we say get an
employee
so obviously city will not be displayed
we are not having that field at all and
let's save this employee as how many
employees we have in the table at the
moment we have two employees so let's
save this employee with ID 3 look at
that employee is saved and if you look
at select star from TBL employee look at
what happened to city it's basically the
null for the third employee because the
client didn't send data for that non
required new data member and obviously
you know the service has initialized it
to defaults and then it worked in the
same way as it was before all right now
what is going to happen when we make it
required let's see that let's actually
make it required by specifying is
required name the property and let's set
that to true ok now we are adding a new
required mapper and the existing client
doesn't know about this so let's close
the host let's run this once again let's
get to the client now and let's try to
save this employee as number 4 okay so
get let's actually get an employee on
let's get employee to
so get will continue to work the same
way now let's try to save it with ID for
look at this we get an error the
formatted through an exception we'll
trying to deserialize the message and
look at this you know it says employee
service is not expected expecting
element city instead it has got element
of early pay okay
keep in mind the type of employee that
we were trying to add is part-time
employee now
after if you look at the employee
service year after employee type it is
actually expecting city but instead you
know the client then sent data for this
so obviously this a required feel okay
that's why it throws the sick that
exception okay so instead of city it was
getting hourly pay because for part-time
employee if you look at this part-time
employee here how will you pay others
work you know the order should be after
employee type it should have received
city but instead it got hourly pay and
that's why through an exception saying
that there's a required feel I expected
to have a value for that I don't have a
value and that's why it's saying you
know this error right there okay so
basically if you look at this table here
adding a new non required member doesn't
throw an exception but adding a new
required member is going to throw an
exception okay similarly removing non
required members nothing is going to
happen it doesn't affect the client but
the existing clients will will continue
to send data for that non required a
member okay and that data will be
ignored and lost at the service side
okay similarly if we remove required
member obviously an exception will be
thrown and modifying existing existing
member types are you know basically the
same rules apply as that of modifying
parameter types you know within an
operation contract
okay if the types are compatible and no
exception otherwise an exception will be
thrown okay so basically whenever we
make changes to a service contracts data
contracts or message contracts you know
we need to keep these things in mind so
that we don't make changes which would
break existing clients that's it for
today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
