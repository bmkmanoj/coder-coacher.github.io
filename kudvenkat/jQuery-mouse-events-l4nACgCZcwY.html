this video we'll discuss take free Mouse
events let's understand these Mouse
events with an example notice that next
to every form field we have an image
displayed now when we move the mouse
over this image we want to display the
help text that is associated with that
figure and when we move the mouse away
from the image we want to hide that help
text so let's see how to achieve this
let's flip to show studio so this is the
same example that we worked with in the
previous video session I've done a
couple of changes to this project the
first change is that I've added this
image help dot P&amp;amp;J to this project and
the second change is to this HTML itself
so to every row I've added these two TDs
so within the first TD we've got the
image element and notice the source
attribute is set to this image help dot
PNG and within this TD we've got the
development so this is the development
that displays the health text so this
help text is for the first name field
and look at what the helped exhales
first name as shown in passport and look
at this style attribute it is set to
display colon on meaning when the page
initially loads the developments are
hidden only the image element is shown
and the important thing to keep in mind
here is the ID attribute value of both
the image and div elements now if you
look at the ID attribute value the only
difference is within the first three
characters so for image element it is
IMG first name health and for the
development it is div first name how all
right now I have added these two TDs for
all the TRS on this page basically for
all the fields so even for the last name
we have got those two TDs
so within this TD we have called the
image and here we have got the
development which contains the health
text I'll have all this HTML available
on my blog in case you need it now at
the moment when we view this HTML in the
browser this is how it looks like and
notice when I move the mouse over
nothing happens that div doesn't show up
so onmouseover we want to display the
day of that contains
texts and run Mouse out we want to hide
that so within the script section with
an already function let's first find
this image element and if you look at
this image element it has got the ID so
let's use the ID selector and ID
selector is hash and the ID that we want
to find this image first name help okay
so look at this when I type mo we can
find all the mouse events Mouse down
mouse enter etc so when mouse over event
occurs we want to handle that okay so
what do we want to do when we mouse over
this image we want to display the div
that contains the help text so we want
to find that div and the div also has
got an ID so we can use the ID selector
again so find the div by ID and the idea
that we are looking for is div first
name how so we found the ID so what do
we want to do we want to slowly fade in
that development so it shows up the
health text so I'm going to use this
fade in function and since this is going
to animate it we can specify the speed
for the animation so the speed is going
to be 500 milliseconds so it's going to
take half a second to slowly fade in to
display the help text associated with
first name fear okay so that's what
happens on mouse-over and this I'm also
going to chain Mouse out event
look at that Mouse out so we want to
handle that event as well and unmount
out what do we want to do we want to
hide the development so again I'm going
to find the development by ID but this
time on Mouse out what do we want to do
we want to hide the development so I'm
going to use fade out slowly so it's
going to slowly fade out okay so let's
save the changes and let's reload this
page and look at this when I move the
mouse over this first name field the div
that is associated with first name field
which contains the how text show
and onmouseout look at that it fades out
and at the moment the health text only
works for first name field it doesn't
work the last name you know for any
other field on this form why is that
that's because we have hard-coded the
IDS of the image and development here so
let's make this a little more generic so
it works for all these fields okay so
first of all we want to remove this hard
coding right here we just don't want to
find the first element we want to find
all the image elements so what I'm going
to do is instead of using the ID
selector I'm going to use element
selector so I'm basically telling find
me all images now let's you know add a
little more filtering to this selector
instead of saying find all images this
is going to find any image element on
this page instead of that let's only
target those image elements which has
got the source attribute set to help dot
PNG so I'm going to copy that I'm going
to say find all image elements which
have got source attribute set to help
dot PNG okay so this is going to find
all these help images so once we have
those image elements you know we are
attaching mouse over and mouse out
events so on mouse over what do we want
to do now the important thing here again
we have hard coding ok we don't want
that hard coding so what I'm going to do
is use a variable here and let's call
this help icon ID so basically what we
are trying to do is get the image
element ID and how can we get the image
element ID look at this this mouse over
event occurs on the image element ok so
within the mouse over even handling
function I can use this keyword and what
is this keyword refers to this refers to
the element on which mouse over event
occurred ok the image element and then I
can use this jQuery attr function
and retrieve the ID attribute value so
it's as simple as that
so now this variable contains you know
for example if I move the mouse over
let's say first name image then this
variable is going to contain the ID of
the first name image okay and if you
look at the difference within the ID
attribute values the only difference is
in the first three characters so the
image element contains IMG first name
hell and the development contains div
first name have so all I need to do is
replace that word IMG those three
characters with div okay so I'm going to
take this variable and let's create
another variable let's call this div ID
equals help I can ID dot replace and
what do we want to replace we want to
replace these three characters IMG width
div all right
so we've got the divider so we are going
to use this variable so now let's go
ahead and remove this hard coding from
here so I still want to use the ID
selector but the ID is now going to be
in this variable div ID and then we want
to fade in okay so I'm going to copy
these two lines and paste them in Mouse
out as well because we want to remove
this hard coding also and then let's use
this dyd variable okay so to that let's
append divided e so let's save the
changes now let's reload this page and
notice this when I move the mouse over C
D we get the help text favorite color it
works so all the fields are now working
okay now if you look at the code here
we've got some duplication okay so
basically these two lines are duplicated
let's actually move those two lines to a
separate function so you know we don't
have that duplication so let's call this
function get div ID
and I'm going to copy these two lines
and paste them within this function now
instead of using this keyword here let's
actually use a parameter
let's pass help icon or help image to
this function and we are going to use
that parameter here okay and instead of
using this variable we can simply say
return whatever value okay now let's go
ahead and use this function instead of
these two lines so we can actually
remove those two lines and we can in
fact use this method directly here
because that's going to get us the
divider and the same here
all right so let's save those changes
reload this page and it should still
work the same way okay look at that it
doesn't work why is that that's
basically because we are calling this
function but we are not passing the
element over which that even tuckered
okay so we have to pass that element so
we use this keyword here and this
keyword here so what is this going to do
it's going to pass the element over
which the respective event has occurred
mouse over or mouse out okay so let's
save the changes
now let's reload this and look at this
it works now okay so in this example we
are using mouse over and mouse out
events now instead of those two events
we could also use mouse enter and mouse
leave so instead of mouse over we can
use mouse enter and instead of Mouse out
we can Eve use mouse leave so let's save
the changes reload this page and it
should still work on you know mouse
enter it works on Mouse leave it works
okay and here is that example now
instead of mouse enter and mouse Li we
could also use hover
however function accepts two function
arguments one for mouse enter event and
one for mouse love leave event so here
is the hover function and it's a
shorthand for mouse enter and mouse
leave so at the moment we using mouse
enter and mouse leave instead of that we
can use have a function which is a
shorthand so however and if you look at
this one look at that we need to pass
two function arguments okay so I'm going
to remove the mouse enter from here so
we are passing the first one function
and then so that function ends here I am
going to remove this
and pass the second function
so let's save the changes reload the
page and it should still work so here
were using the hover function and
passing the two function arguments thank
you for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
