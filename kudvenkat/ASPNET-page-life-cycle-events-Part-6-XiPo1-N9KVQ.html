venket this is part 6 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll learn about
events in the page lifecycle of an
asp.net web application before
continuing with the session I strongly
recommend to watch part 3 4 and 5 of
this video series in part 4 of this
video series we have discussed that
even's can occur at three levels in an
asp.net web application even can occur
at the application level examples of
application level events include session
start session and application start
application and etc and the application
level even suicide in global dot a si X
file events can also occur at the page
or the web form level examples of page
level events include page load page
pre-render etc we will be talking about
page level events in the session events
can also occur the control level
examples of control level events include
click event of a button control selected
index change the event of a drop-down
list tax change the event of a text box
etc we will be talking about control
level events in a later video session
and from the previous parts in this
video series we know that web
applications work on a stateless
protocol every time a request is made
for a web form the following sequence of
events at our web application creates an
instance of the web form that is
requested process the events of the web
form and controls generates the HTML and
sense that HTML back to the client who
has requested that web form and then the
web form gets destroyed and removed from
the web server memory with this
knowledge now let's dive into the events
in a page lifecycle now in this table
you can see some of the commonly used
events in the lifecycle of an asp.net
web form now there are more even
standards but these are the commonly
used ones and these events are listed in
the order of their occurrence
except for this edit event that you can
see in the last which occurs only if
there is an unhandled
section now in fact this page underscore
error event is extensively used to
handle the unhandled exceptions and then
lock the information about them either
in a database or log them to an event
viewer in fact we will actually see how
to do that in a later video session when
we talk about exception handling in an
asp.net web application so the first
event in the life cycle of an asp.net
platform is the pre entertainment pre
init standing for pre initialization as
the name suggests this event happens
just before page initialization event
starts and the page properties like east
post back East callback and east cross
page post back are set at this stage now
if you don't understand what these
properties are don't worry we will be
talking about them in a great detail in
later video sessions and this events
allows us to set the master page and
theme of a web application dynamically
now most of the time we set the team and
master page statically at design time
but then if you want to do the
dynamically at runtime you can do that
as well
using this pre initialization event and
anytime you are working with dynamic
controls we extensively use pre
initialization event and in fact we will
see how to work with dynamic controls in
a later video session and if you're
wondering what a dynamic you know what
do we mean by saying you know working
with dynamic controls usually you know
when we design a web application at the
design time we drag and drop button and
you know text box and any other control
from the toolbox onto the web form but
if there is ever a need for us to create
these controls dynamically at the
runtime then you know pre initialization
event can can be very useful there we
will be talking about working with these
dynamic controls in a later session the
next event is the init event in its
standing for initialization
so page init event occurs after the init
event of all the individual controls on
the platform and this is very important
to keep in mind look at this that you
have a web form and on the web form you
can have several controls like button
Xbox etc so the entertainment of the web
form itself you know occurs after the
unity event of all the individual
controls on that web form okay and we
use this event to read or initialize any
of these control properties and in fact
one of the very important points to keep
in mind about page initialization is
that the server controls the asp.net
server controls are loaded and
initialized from the web server you know
from the web forms view state at this
stage so this is one of the very common
interview question as well they could
ask you in in two ways they could ask
you what happens during page
initialization or when does view state
restoration happens in an asp.net page
lifecycle so view state restoration
meaning when are the controls
initialized you know with the web forms
view state data during the page
initialization State or view state
restoration happens during page in it
okay and then the next stage is the init
complete and as the name suggests
initialization complete so obviously
this event happens immediately after
page initialization the next event is
the preload event preload you know as
the name says you know this event
happens just before the page load event
and then obviously load event and page
load event occurs this is again very
important to keep in mind the page load
event occurs before the load event of
all the individual controls on that
platform so if you remember init event
so page initialization event occurs
after the init event of all the
individual controls on that webform
whereas page load event occurs before
the load event of all the individual
controls on the webform so a slight
difference keep that in mind and then
control level events so this is a slight
deviation here
so until load all these are page level
events pre init init init complete pre
load load so after all these page level
events are processed any control events
that happens for example button click
drop-down list selected and exchange
you know those control level events are
processed at this stage so after the
page load event occurs the control
events like buttons buttons click drop
downs drop-down list selected index
changed etc you know they occur here and
then after the control events are
processed then load complete event
happens okay so this event is raised
after the control events are handled and
then after load complete pre-render
again as the name says this event is
raised just before the rendering stage
of the page if you're wondering what
rendering means rendering means you know
sending that HTML rendering the actual
page and pre-rendered complete raised
immediately after the pre-render event
and finally you know after pre de and
the complete what happens the HTML is
sent back to the client now the page is
ready to be destroyed and discarded
that's when the unload event will be
fired okay so at this stage you know the
Sun load event is raised for each
control and then for the page itself
okay at this stage the page is unloaded
from the memory it's removed from the
web servers memory because remember web
applications work on a stateless
protocol whenever a request is made an
instance of that webform and all the
controls is created you know all these
events are processed HTML it's generated
send it send the HTML back to the client
on the web so what should happen to the
web form instance and any memory that
it's consuming it has to be unloaded
from that memory destroyed completely ok
and that's what happens during unload
event and edit event as we discussed
this you know this does not happen every
time it only occurs when there is an
unhandled exception on that page which
we'll be talking about in a later video
session now let's look at you know how
you know let's let's put this in action
let's actually see the order of the
events execution if you look at this
it's very pretty I mean it's pretty
simple to understand all I have is I
have these event handlers you know I
have an event handler for page pre
initialization page initializer
and all the events that we have just
seen now and then when I actually run
the web form you should see that they
events get fired in this order so if you
look at what we are doing here we are
actually writing you know the name of
the event to the response object and you
are wondering okay what is this BR
within that double code it's nothing but
it's basically to induce a space if you
don't include that break HTML element
there what happens is everything comes
in one line and and the output won't be
that clear that's why I'm including that
HTML break you know with with the name
of the event itself so let's look at
this in action so I have this asp.net
web application already created now if
you look at this webform it's pretty
simple all it has is the code that you
have seen on the slide I've just copied
and pasted that here so now if I run
this look at what's going to happen
so obviously the output will be what you
have seen in the slide is a bridge Priya
net then initialization init complete in
that order and now one important thing
to keep in mind is that look at this I
have intentionally and I mean commented
response to try to call you know in Page
unload event handler now what happens if
we uncomment that let's uncomment that
so I am uncommenting response dot right
from page and load let's rerun this
control f5 so let's see what's going to
happen look at this I get an exception
system dot web dot HTTP exception it
says response is not available in this
context and that makes perfect sense
look at this if you want comment this
line what's going to happen we get this
error message you know response is not
available in this context and that makes
perfect sense because you know when this
unload event fired this event is fired
after actually you know all the
processing of the webform is done the
HTML is generated and that HTML is
completely sent you know rendered and
sent back to the client who requested
that webform and now this webform during
the unload
stage is actually ready to be destroyed
and discarded so at this point obviously
the request and response objects will
not be available and that's what is the
error message so we have already
generated the required HTML that we want
to send back to the client so during the
unload process you cannot you know ask
it to you know send some more HTML back
to the client who has requested that
perform at this stage the webform in
fact is ready to be discarded that's why
this this error message makes perfect
sense all right that's it in this video
session on this slide you can see
resources for asp.net c-sharp and sequel
server interview questions that's it for
today thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
