tutorial in this video we'll discuss how
to add required attribute dynamically in
angular template different forms let's
understand this with an example here is
what we want to do on our form we have
caught this contact preference field if
I select email as the contact preference
then we want to make the email field
required and phone number field optional
that means we want to dynamically add
the required attribute on this email
input field and at the same time remove
it from the phone number input field on
the other hand if I select phone as my
contact preference then we want to make
the phone number field required and
email field optional let's look at the
steps required for this this is the same
create employee form that we've been
working with so far in this video series
what I have done off screen is made this
phone number field also required so if
we touch the field and leave it without
providing a phone number then we get the
validation error message phone number is
required and email field is also
required along the same lines this
contact preference field is also
required now what we want to do is if I
select email as my contact preference
then we want only the email field to be
required and not the phone number and if
I select phone as my contact preference
then we want phone number to be required
but not the email field notice of a
contact preference field HTML is right
here now what we want to do is see the
value that we get when we select one of
the contact preference radio buttons to
do that just below this span element
which displays the validation error
message let's include this little text
which says contact preference elected
value and then let's use the template
reference variable so here is our
template reference variable we are using
the same name on both the radio buttons
so let's use this template reference
variable and on that let's invoke the
value property which is going to give us
the selected radio button value so if we
select email
should get email as the value and
similarly if we select phone radio
button
we should get phone as the value let's
look at this in action notice of a
create employee form is automatically
reloaded when we select the email as the
contact preference the value is email
and when we select phone the value is
phone so we are going to use this
expression to dynamically add or remove
the required attribute we only included
this line of code right here for
debugging we don't need this anymore so
let's go ahead and delete that now let's
take a look at our phone number field
HTML our phone number field is just
above the contact preference field
notice on the phone number input field
we have the required attribute which is
what is making this field a required
field and the way we have applied it
here is going to apply it always to the
input field and we don't want that we
want to conditionally add or remove the
required attribute and to do that we are
going to bind it the required attribute
to a boolean expression so let's wrap
this required attribute in a pair of
square brackets and bind it to this
boolean expression contact preference
dot value equals phone so basically if
the selected contact preference radio
button value is phone then this boolean
expression is going to return true that
means the required attribute will be
added to the phone number input field if
we select email as the contact
preference then the value property will
return email meaning this entire boolean
expression is going to return false
that means the required attribute will
be removed from the phone number input
field so let's do the same thing on our
email input field as well so instead of
adding the required attribute like this
let's add it conditionally and our
condition here is going to check if the
selected radio button value is email
let's save our changes and then take a
look at the browser notice now when we
click within the email field and leave
the field without typing anything we
don't get the required validation and
the same thing happens with the phone
number field as well
because at the moment we don't have any
of the contact preference radio button
selected so this boolean expression
right here is going to return false that
means that acquired attribute is removed
from the email input field and the same
thing happens with the required
attribute on the phone number input
field now when we select email as the
contact preference notice we see the
validation error email is required and
when I select phone we see phone number
is required there is a small caveat here
let's reload the form to understand it
notice now when I select email or phone
we don't see the required validation
errors that's because we are checking
the touched property on both the email
field and the phone number field so
let's remove all the references to
touched property
let's save our changes and then take a
look at the browser notice now we don't
have to have the email or phone number
fields touched first for these
validation error messages to show up
that's because we have removed the
touched property check so the trick to
this is to conditionally add or remove
the required attribute by binding it to
a boolean expression I hope you have
