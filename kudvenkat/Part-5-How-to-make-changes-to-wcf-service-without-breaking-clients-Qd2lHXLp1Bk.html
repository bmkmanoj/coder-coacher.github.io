this video we'll discuss how to make
changes to WCF service without breaking
the existing clients this is
continuation 2 part 4 so please watch
part 4 before proceeding with this video
in this demo we'll be using the example
that we have implemented in part 3 of
this video series if you recollect from
part 3 we have implemented
hello servers the service has got a
single service contract which is a
hollow service and a single operation
contract get a message within the
service implementation all this method
does is concatenate that name parameter
with this word hello and then return
that string back okay so a very simple
service there and then we have hosted
this service using a console application
the host is already running on my
machine and then we also have
implemented a client application that's
an asp.net web application so basically
within this client we are building an
instance of the proxy class and then on
the proxy we are using the proxy
basically to invoke that get message so
the interface of the client application
is this so if we enter something like
play game get message you know this
application invokes the service and we
get that response back from the WCF
service now let's say for some reason we
want to change the name of the service
contract within the WCF service now at
the moment the name of the service
contract is a hollow service okay so if
you look at the client application
they're using hollow service client
that's the name of the proxy class okay
by creating an instance of this proxy
class we are able to invoke the sket
message operation okay now let's go
ahead and make a change to this a hollow
service interface let's change it to a
hollow service changed now if we change
it within the interface file we also
need to change it in the service file
service implementation file and then
within the app dot config file of this
host project we need to
specify the contract name there so
initially the contract was I hollow
service now it is changed to I hollow
service change so now let's close this
host and then rerun once again so now
the WCF service has changed now let's
look at what's going to happen to that
line so let's click this get message
here look at that we get an error that's
basically because the change that we
have made right now is not compatible
with that line and it's a breaking
change it's going to break all the
existing lines and we don't want that to
happen and if we want to prevent that
from happening
use name property of the service
contract attribute that will that
property will give the service contract
an explicit name and once the service
contract has got the explicit name you
can change the name of that interface in
any way you want that's not going to
break the clients let's actually look at
that in action so let's go back to the
service and here let's use name property
let's set name to eye
hello service that was the original name
of the service contract interface and we
are setting the name property of the
service contract attribute to that
original name okay
so let's close the host and let's rerun
it once again
alright the host has started let's go
back to the client application let's
enter something like prism test look at
that now the client is working without
any problem ok so what's happening
behind the scenes how did this name
probe parameter of the service contract
attribute fix that issue now in order to
understand that we need to understand
the Vistal document that the WCF service
makes available for the clients to
generate their proxy classes so let's
get to the Vistal document and to get to
the Vistal document we use the base
address so let's use the base address
and within this Vistal document we have
caught something called port type so
let's look at that XML element and this
port type XML element has got this name
attribute and at the moment notice the
name attribute is set to eye hallo
service which is nothing but the value
that we have assigned to the name of
property of the service contract
attribute now for a moment let's remove
this name property and then let's run
the host once again and let's refresh
this Vistal document and now let's
search for that port type element and
look at what this name attribute is set
to I hallo service changed so this what
happens if we don't set an explicit name
to the service contract using name
parameter of the service contract
attribute then this name attribute will
be set to the name of the interface by
default and now if you change the
interface name obviously that is going
to change the name of the port type
element within the vestal document which
the client uses to communicate with your
service so obviously that's going to
break that lines okay
so on the other hand if you give it an
explicit name something like this so
name equals
I hello service let's rerun it once
again okay so the host is running and
let's refresh this
so port type look at that now it's set
to the value of that name parameter okay
now no matter what you change you know
this interface name too it's not going
to affect the existing clients okay
pretty simple basically use name
property of the service contract
attribute and give it an explicit name
to prevent the clients from breaking
when service contract interface name is
changed okay and we discussed about that
port type XML element as well basically
we can think of this port type as the
interface that --lined uses to
communicate with the WCF CL service now
when that interface changes obviously
the clients that is the existing clients
are going to break okay in a similar
fashion we can set name property on the
operation contract as well
okay later if you change the name of the
operation contract if you don't want the
existing clients to break give it an
explicit name using the name parameter
of the operation contract attribute you
can try that on your own all right
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
