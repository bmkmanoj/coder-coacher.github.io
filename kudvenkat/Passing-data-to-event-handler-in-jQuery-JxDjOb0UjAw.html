this video we'll discuss how to pass
data to the email handler function in
jQuery let's understand this with an
example let's flip to visual studio here
we have a button with ID BTN click me
within our jQuery ready function let's
find that button by ID and we want to
associate a click event handler and to
do that I'm going to make use of this on
function we discuss this in our previous
video session so to bind the click event
handler we first need to specify the
name of the event which is click and
when this event occurs we want to call
this function say hello we don't have
this function defined yet so let's go
ahead and define that function so all we
want to do is alert hello so let's save
the changes and when we reload this page
and when we click this button we get the
alert hello
now when the click event occurs this is
the even handler function that's called
now what we want to do is pass some
custom data to this event handler
function to do that I'm going to make
use of JSON object so I'm going to pass
a JSON object and this JSON object is
going to contain two properties first
name let's initialize this to John and
last name and let's initialize this to
Doe
so when click event occurs we are
calling this say hello even handler
function and to this even handler
function we are passing this JSON object
which has got two properties first name
and last name right so this function is
going to receive that JSON object so the
next question is how are we going to
access first name and last name
properties within this say hello even
handler function to access those two
properties we're going to make use of
event object we know that the event
handler automatically receives the event
object now this event object has got
data property and that data property
will have these two properties first
name and law
name look at this so we want to alert
hello and then to that we want to
concatenate first name and last name
property values so I'm going to make use
of this event object that's coming in
into this method so even to object has
got data property and look at this when
I plus dot notice we have first name and
last name properties so let's select
first name and to that let's concatenate
a single space and then again the last
name all right so let's save those
changes reload this page and look at
this when we click the button we get
hello John Doe let's find another click
event handler so I'm going to make a
copy of this and let's pass only first
name so we are passing the JSON object
here also but we are only passing a
value for first name property okay so
here we are binding click even handle it
twice so when we save the changes and
when we reload this page and when we
click this button we should get two
alerts look at this so we get the first
alert hello John Doe and once I click OK
I get hello John and then look at this
last name is undefined why is that
that's basically because you know this
JSON object does not contain last name
property and that's why you know last
name is undefined let's actually change
this first name here to mary so we know
this is a different json object now
let's say we don't want that undefined
if that's the case you know you need to
check if data is not you know if last
name is not now and how do we do that so
in our first name we have it here but we
need to check last name so what I'm
going to do is copy this and put all
this in brackets because we are going to
have a condition here so even dot data
dot last name if that is not equal to
null so if this condition is true then
do this so we are concatenated a space
and then the last name
else if this condition is false then to
the first name just concatenate an empty
string so let's save these changes and
let's reload this page look at this when
we click the button hello John Doe when
I click OK we get hello Mary we don't
have that undefined
now now let's bind one more click event
handler and this time I'm not going to
pass this JSON object at all so all I
have here is the name of the event and
the even handler function that I want to
call ok so we are not setting I mean we
are not passing any custom data okay so
but still this is the same handler that
we are calling ok now when we don't pass
or when we don't set any custom data you
know data property of the event object
is going to be now so within our
function let's check if event dot data
if that is equal to now because here we
are not passing or setting any custom
data if that is now then what I want to
do is alert a message saying no name
provided else if data is not now then
execute this piece of code so let's save
those changes let's reload this page and
when we click this button we should get
three alerts first hello John Doe hello
Mary and then no name provided because
here we are not you know passing any
data and here is that example which we
just discussed now thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
