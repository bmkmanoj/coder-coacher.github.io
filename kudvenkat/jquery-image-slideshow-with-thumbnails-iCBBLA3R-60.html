this video well discus creating a simple
image slideshow using jQuery this is
continuation to part 44 so please watch
part 44 before proceeding here is what
we want to achieve we want to include
these two buttons start slideshow stop
slideshow when we click start slideshow
button the slideshow should start and
when we click stop slideshow this
slideshow should stop so let's say help
to achieve this let's flip to visual
studio this is the same example that we
worked with in the previous video
session at the moment this is how the
page looks like to keep this example
simple I'm going to remove these two
drop-down lists and these two buttons so
let's get rid of this HTML from the page
and that's and let's also remove the
corresponding jQuery code so from the
jQuery ready function I'm going to
remove all the jQuery code so within the
jQuery ready function we don't have any
jQuery code at the moment so let's save
the changes and when the reload this
page notice that the two drop down this
and the two buttons are removed now the
first step is to include these two
buttons so just before the image element
I'm going to include an input element of
type button let's give it an ID let's
call this BTN start slideshow and the
value on the button is going to be start
slideshow so let's make a copy of the
button and let's change the ID of this
button to BTN stop slideshow and the
value on the button is going to be stop
slideshow let's include two HTML break
elements save the changes let's reload
this page and notice that we get those
two buttons and within our jQuery ready
function I'm going to create four
variables in a bit you will understand
the purpose of these variables so the
first variable is going to be image URLs
and this is going to be an array
the second variable is going to be
interval ID and the third variable is
going to be BTN start so this variable
will hold a reference to this button
that is BT and start slideshow button so
that's the ID of the button so let's use
the jQuery ID selector to find that
button similarly let's create another
variable to hold a reference to stop
slideshow button the ID of this top
slideshow button is BTN stop slideshow
the next thing that we want to do is
loop through these thumbnail image
elements retrieve the source attribute
value that is the image URL of each
image and then push that URL into this
image URLs array so to loop through all
these thumbnail image elements I'm going
to use a jQuery ancestor descendant
syntax so notice all these image
elements are nested inside a development
with ID div container so find an element
with ID div container and within that we
have image elements nested so give me
all those image elements so then we are
going to use this each function to
iterate over each image element and as
we are iterating over we want to call a
function so now I'm going to use this
image URLs variable that we have created
so which is an array into that we want
to push the source attribute value of
each image element so I'm going to use
push method and to refer to the element
that we are currently iterating over we
are going to use this keyword and then
we want the source attribute value so we
are using the ATT a function specifying
the name of the attribute as source so
this is going to retrieve the image URL
of the image element that we are
currently iterating over and we are
passing that to push method push method
is going to push that into this variable
image URLs which is an array so by the
time this code is executed within this
array we have all these image URLs next
I'm going to create a function so let's
call this function set image within this
function I'm going to create a variable
let's call this main image element so
basically this is going to hold a
reference to this main image element and
the ID of the main image element is main
image so let's use the jQuery ID
selector and find that main image
element now we want to find the where L
of the image that is being currently
displayed within the main image so let's
name the variable current image URL so
that's the URL of the image that is
being currently displayed within the
main image and to get that we can use
the attr function and we want the source
attribute value so the name of the
attribute is going to be source okay so
we got the current image URL that's
being displayed within the main image
now what we want to do is we want to
find the index position of that image
URL within this array this image URL
sorry keep in mind this image URLs now
contain all these URLs and the image
that is being displayed with the main
image element is one of them so we want
to find the index of the image that's
being currently displayed within the
main image so we want to find that index
you know from this array that is the
main image URLs array so to do that I'm
going to create a variable I'm going to
call this current image index
equals I'm going to use jQuery in array
function under this function the first
parameter is the element you know whose
index we want to find out and the
element is current image water and the
next one is the array itself and the
array is this one image URLs so
basically this function is going to
return the index of this element within
this array so if the current image index
is equal to image URLs dot length minus
one so if that condition is true then
I'm going to initialize this current
image index to minus one now if this
condition is a bit unclear at the moment
don't worry in a bit this will be much
clearer okay so if the current image
index is equal to image URLs dot length
minus one so at the moment if you look
at the thumbnail images we've got five
thumbnail images that means image URLs
dot length will be 5 5 minus 1 is 4
right so if the current image index is 4
that means we are displaying this last
image within the main image element so
when if it is the last image then we
want to start again from the first image
okay so I am setting the current image
index to minus 1 deliberately because
you know when we are going to set the
next image that we want to display in
the main image will increment the
current image index by 1 okay so I'm
going to find the main image element and
I'm going to use the attr function and
we want to set the source attribute
value and we want to retrieve the source
attribute value from this image URLs
array
right so image URLs and this is an array
so we need to specify the index position
you know of the image URL that you want
and this current image index you know
contains that position but we need to
increment that by one okay so this
current image index will have the value
or the index of the image that is being
currently displayed but then we want to
increment it by 1 so we get the next
image and that's what we want to display
within the main image element okay so
let's see if the changes now we have two
buttons that is start slideshow and
stops lecture so when we click start
slideshow button that's when we want the
slideshow to start so find the button by
ID the ID of the start slideshow button
is BTN start slideshow we have already
you know found that from the Dom and we
are storing it in this variable so I'm
going to use that variable so BTN start
dot click so when I click event is
triggered we want to call a function and
what we want to do we want to start the
slideshow so to start the slideshow you
know we want to call this function and
once the slideshow has started you know
we want to automate eclis cycle through
the images within the main image element
right so I'm going to use set interval
you know JavaScript function we
discussed the set interval function in
detail in part 34 of JavaScript tutorial
so what is this function going to do
it's going to execute a specified
function repeatedly at specified time
interval let's say for example we want
the duration for each image you know to
change is maybe half a second so we want
the set image function to be called
every half a second right so I'm going
to use this set interval function
and the function that we want to call is
set image so this is the name of the
function and we want to call that
function every 500 milliseconds and you
know this function is going to return an
identifier and we are going to store
that identifier within this available
interval ID so that's the reason we have
created that variable so interval ID
equals whatever this function returns so
this is the identifier of the repeated
action right so once the slideshow has
started we want to disable start
slideshow button so to refer to the
start slideshow button I'm going to use
this keyword and then I am going to use
this attribute function and I want to
set disabled attribute to disabled and
if at all if the disabled button is
disabled I mean stop slideshow button is
disabled we want to enable that because
the slideshow is in progress now so
let's find BTN stop and we want to
remove attribute disabled all right
similarly when we click this top
slideshow button we want to stop
slideshow so BT and stop dot clerk we
want to call a function when that event
is triggered and we want to stop the
slideshow so to stop this slideshow we
want to cancel the repeated execution of
set image function now notice that when
we call the set interval function we are
storing the identifier of the repeated
action within this interval ID so we can
use this identifier to cancel that
repeated action and to cancel that
repeated action we are going to use
another JavaScript function
clear interval and to this function we
need to pass the interval ID that we
want to cancel so interval ID so this is
going to stop this slideshow so clear
interval will cancel the repeated action
so once we have stopped the slideshow
the slideshow button itself should be
disabled so I'm going to make a copy of
this so disabled and on the current
button which is the DES a stop slideshow
button and we want to enable start
slideshow button so I'm going to say BTN
start dot remove attribute disabled and
when the page first loads we won't stop
slideshow button to be disabled so here
I'm going to call you know the DAT TR
function which is going to disable stop
button on the initial page load alright
so that's all day to it let's save the
changes let's go ahead and reload this
page and look at this when the page
first loads stop slideshow button is
disabled now when we click start
slideshow look at that the slide show
starts right so the image within the
main image is changed every 500
milliseconds if you want to display that
for a longer duration just change this
duration here okay so now when we go
ahead and click stop slideshow look at
that this slideshow should stop and
notice stop slideshow button is disabled
and start slideshow button is enabled
now so when I click start slideshow
again this slideshow should start wavy
stop it so it should next display these
tulips image so look at this display
tulips and then it goes through the rest
of the images
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
