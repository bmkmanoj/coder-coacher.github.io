franca this is part 45 phase B dotnet
gridview tutorial in this video we'll
discuss about sorting a grid view that
uses object data source control and the
data set will be using table TBL
employee for this demo since we want to
use object data source control we first
need to implement employee data access
layer so let's flip to visual studio
let's add a class file to this project
let's name it employee data access layer
dot CS now plan capsulate employee
information we need to first implement
employee class in the interest of time I
have this class already implemented and
this is a very straightforward class
with for auto implemented properties
employee ID name gender and City now we
need a method with an employee data
access layer class that can retrieve
data from the stable TBL employee so we
have to write bit of a do dotnet code
here so let's go ahead and import the ad
or namespaces that are required system
data system data system dot data or
sequel client and system dot
configuration now let's copy and paste
the method itself and if you look at
this method it's a straightforward
method look at the return type of the
method
it's a returning list of employee
objects and it's a static method within
the method we are creating an object of
type list employee using the
configuration manager class we are
reading the connection string from web
config file using that connection string
we are building sequel connection object
and look at the sequel command select
star from TBL employee we are executing
the command and then we are looping
through each row and then converting
that row into an employee object and
adding that employee object to the list
and finally returning the list alright
now let's build the project so that this
employee data access layer is compiled
now let's you know flip to web form one
dot aspx let's drag and drop a gridview
control let's auto format this let's
choose brown sugar scheme now let's drag
and drop object at a source control
let's configure this let's select our
business object employee data access
layer click next select your select
method which is get all employees finish
now let's associate this object data
source control with this grid view
control now notice that I don't get an
option I'll enable sorting or allow
sorting if I mean in the previous
session we discussed about using sequel
data source control when I answers here
its sequel data source control with the
grid view control I got that option
unloved sorting but then here I don't
have this option but within the HTML
source let's go ahead and set this
option
I love sorting so let me set that to
true okay now with this change let me go
ahead and run and notice that every
column every bound field has got a sort
expression as well meaning the headers
within the grid view control will be
rendered as hyperlinks and I can click
on them to sort you know by that column
so if I click on this look at this I'm
going to get a runtime error and look at
the error the data source object data
source one does not support sorting with
ienumerable data automatic sorting is
only supported with data view data table
and data set okay
so if you look at our method it's
returning in a list of employee object
okay so for grid view sorting automatic
sorting to work with list of employee
there is there is a workaround we'll
talk about that in a bit but today we'll
solve this using data set in our next
video session we'll discuss about how to
use list of employee object as the
return type of this method and still
make it work so for the time being to
fix this we actually make this method
return a data set instead of list of
employee object and to do that all I
need to do is I'm going to convert the
return type to data set since I am
returning a data set I do not need that
list of employee object and then I'm
going to use sequel data adapter let's
call the object as
a
and we can get rid of all this let's
create a data set object data set D s is
equal to new data set and then fill the
data set finally return the data set
that's it let's build the solution
control shift B to build the project so
on the status Y you can see build
succeeded now let me run the same thing
and see if it's going to work so
obviously when the waveform loads you
know the hyperlink the column should be
rendered as hyperlinks look at that I
click on that column once it gets sorted
in ascending order first if I click on
it again it gets sorted in descending
order so automatic sorting is supported
now in our next video we'll see how to
make this sorting work in spite of the
return type being you know a list of
employee objects all right on this slide
you can find resources for asp.net
c-sharp and sequence of interview
questions that's it for today
