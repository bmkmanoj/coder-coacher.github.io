thank it this is part five of asp.net
grid-view tutorial in this video we'll
discuss about transforming XML using
XSLT and then binding that XML to a grid
view control using XML data source
control in part four of the asp.net grid
view tutorial we discussed about binding
an XML file to a grid view control using
XML data source control if you remember
the XML file was like this it was using
change the XML elements and then the XML
data source control din't work as
expected when the XML file contained
these child XML elements so we had to
manually rewrite that XML file to use
attributes as you can see on the right
hand side now rewriting large XML files
manually is pad for two reasons number
one it is laborious and two it's
error-prone okay don't you think it will
be nice if we can apply XSLT stylesheets
and then automatically convert you know
the data that is in this format which
uses chain XML nodes into an XML file
which uses attributes okay well we will
see the XSLT that can do that for us
automatically so this is the XSLT file
which can do the transformation for us
and if you look at this it's pretty
straight forward so we are first
matching countries which is nothing but
our route XML element and then within
that route XML element we have got
several country elements okay so we need
to loop through each country element and
then retrieve you know each XML node
there and then convert that to an
attribute so this ID convert that to an
attribute and then assign this as a text
for or a value for that attribute okay
and if you look at this template here
you know the second section here that's
what it's doing so it's looking at the
country and then we are using a for each
loop so for each country element you
know within that country for each
element go ahead retrieve its name and
text okay so very simple XSLT okay now
let's let's say
we'll use this in an example so let's
flip to visual studio so here I have
this country's dot XML in the data
folder okay and I want to display this
data within this grid view control okay
so now let's go ahead and add an XS LT
style sheet so right-click on the data
folder add new item and click on the
data tab in install templates and then
select XSLT file and let's change this
name to countries XSLT dot XSLT XSLT is
the extension for XSLT files click add
that should add an XSLT file so let's go
ahead and copy the XSLT into this file
okay so we have an XML file and to
transform that XML file we have this
XSLT file okay so now on this waveform I
have a grid view control so we want to
use XML data source control and then
display this country's XML file in that
grid view control so let's drag and drop
the XML data source control onto the
webform click on configure data source
so obviously we need to select the data
file which is nothing but our country's
dot XML file which contains countries
data so countries dot XML select that
the next thing is we need to select our
transformation file which converts that
XML file that has child element you know
child
XML nodes into attributes so click on
the Browse button and click on the data
tab and look at this when I select data
tab it's not showing this country's XSLT
dot XSLT file that's because it is
expecting a dot XSL extension but we
have XSLT extension so for that to be
displayed select all files here it will
show the XSLT file select that click ok
so we are done so we are done
configuring XML data source control now
we need to associate this XML data
source control with this grid view
control so click on that smart tag
button select XML data source 1 and look
at that the moment I do that I don't get
an error now the data is displayed as
expected and obviously when I going to
run this it's going to display the
data on the webform okay so that's
another way of you know using XML you
know displaying this XML data with child
nodes in a grid view control using that
XML data source control now if I don't
want to use XML data source control and
if I want to display
you know this XML which has caught this
child XML nodes then another option is
to basically load this data into a data
set and then bind the data set to the
grid view control okay so let's look at
that so now I don't want to use this XML
data source control so I'm going to get
rid of that actually let's get rid of
this XML I mean grid we control as well
let's drag and drop another grid we
control onto the webform so grid be in
control and then I want to bind this XML
data with that grid view control okay
and I don't want to use an accessibility
transformation and if I have to do that
obviously I have to write code for that
so and to do that here I have you know
four lines of code which can do that so
we are creating an instance of the data
set and then we are using data sets read
xml method to read countries xml data
and then we are setting the data set as
the data source for the grid view
control and invoking data bind pretty
straightforward so let's run this
project and as you might expect when the
webform loads it's going to read that
XML data load that into the grid view
control as expected okay there we go on
this slide you can find resources for
asp.net c-sharp and sequel server
interview questions that's it for today
thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
