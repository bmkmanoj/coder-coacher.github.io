video we'll discuss Union intersect and
accept operators in length Union
operator combines two collections into
one collection while removing the
duplicate elements let's understand this
with an example
here we've got two collections numbers 1
and numbers to notice the elements 1 &amp;amp; 3
are present in both the collections and
here we are performing a union between
those two collections so what we expect
back is a single integer collection and
the duplicate elements 1 &amp;amp; 3 should be
present only once within the result set
and that's what we get back when we
execute this place of code so I have
already typed this code within the main
method so let's run this and as you
might expect notice that we get a single
integer collection back and the
duplicate elements 1 &amp;amp; 3 are present
only once within the result set now
when comparing elements just like
distinct method Union intersect and
accept methods work in a slightly
different manner with complex types like
employee customer etc now here we've got
two lists of employee objects employee
is a complex style and notice this
employee Mike is present in both the
lists and here we are performing a union
between those two lists so what we
expect back is a single list of employee
objects and thus to placate employee
Mike should be present only once within
the list but if you look at the actual
output that we got notice that employee
Mike is present two times this means the
duplicate employee objects are not
removed why is that that's because by
default here the default comparer is
being used to compare employee objects
and what is the default compare to it
we'll just check for object references
being equal and not the individual
property values of the employee object
you know we have seen this problem with
distinct method as well so just like
this linked method to solve this problem
you know we have three options and we
discussed all these three options in
detail in our previous video session so
I am NOT going into the details of these
three options now the easiest way to
solve this problem among these three
options is to use this third option that
is projecting
properties into a new anonymous type and
we know that the anonymous type will
automatically override equals and get
hashcode methods and the behavior will
be what we expect okay so now I have
this exact same code that we have seen
on the slide so let's copy this and
paste it within the main method and
let's format these two lists properly
and let's format this list as well now
when we do a union between these two
lists of employee objects notice that
employee Mike is present two times and
we want that duplicates to be removed
and the easiest way to achieve that is
to project the properties into a new
anonymous type so list one dot select X
such that we want to project that into a
new anonymous type X dot ID and X dot
name similarly we want to project list
two objects also into an anonymous type
so let's do dot select X such that new X
dot I D and X dot name so now when we
run this look at what we get in the
output employee Mike is present only
once the duplicate is removed intersect
method returns the common elements
between the two collections so if you
look at these two collections what are
the elements that are common between
them elements 1 &amp;amp; 3 so when we perform
an intersection between those two
collections in the output we get 1 &amp;amp; 3 &amp;amp;
accept method returns the elements that
are present within the first collection
but not in the second collection so if
you look at these two collections what
are the elements that are present in the
first collection but not in the second
collection so within the second
collection you know we have 1 &amp;amp; 3 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp;
3 are present here but 2 4 &amp;amp; 5 or not
present within the second collection
so when we use this accept method
between numbers 1 and numbers 2 that's
what we get elements that are present in
the first collection but not in the
second collection that's it for today
