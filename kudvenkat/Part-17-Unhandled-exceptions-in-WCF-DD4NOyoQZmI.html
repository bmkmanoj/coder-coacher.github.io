this video we'll discuss unhandled
exceptions in WCF this is continuation
to part 16 so please watch part 16 from
the WCF video series before proceeding
with this video an unhandled exception
in the WCF servers will cause the
communication channel to fault and this
session will be lost was the
communication channel isn't faulted
state we cannot use the same instance of
the proxy class anymore we'll have to
create a new instance of the proxy class
let's understand this with an example
let's flip to visual studio we'll be
using the same calculator service that
we worked with in the previous session
of this video series so here we have a
very simple crack data service that's
going to divide two numbers and then if
you look at the application
configuration file here the binding that
we are using at the moment is basic HTTP
binding and if you recollect in the
previous session we have also said the
security mode to none for WS HTTP
binding so for the time being let's go
ahead and comment this a section right
here and then the client for thus
calculated service is going to be a
Windows application if you recollect in
the previous session we have built a
client application for the calculator
service but this application is a web
application now in this demo we are
going to make use of a vendor's
application as the client for the
calculator service and in a bit we'll
understand why they're using Windows
client rather than a web application so
just to speed things up I already have
created a windows forms application so
on the form I have got two labels where
we have specified numerator and
denominator two text box controls a
button and a label control to display
are the result of division and you know
I have already added a reference to
calculate the service and when we click
this divide button what we are doing
here is basically retrieving the
numerator value from the first text box
denominator value from the second text
box converting them into integers and
then storing in the respective variables
and find Lybia invoking the divide
method
of the proxy class and then passing in
the numerator and denominator converting
the result to a string and then setting
that result as the text within the label
control and if you look at this client
reference variable here it's actually an
instance of calculator service client so
within the constructor of this form one
we are creating a new instance of our
calculator service client okay
so straightforward in our code here
alright at this point let's actually go
ahead and run our calculator service and
then let's run this Windows client and
actually before we do that since we have
changed the configuration within our
calculator service let's go ahead and
update the service reference and now
let's go ahead and run the client itself
and keep in mind for the calculator
service at the moment we're using a
basic HTTP binding okay now look at this
when we enter number 10 as the numerator
2 as the denominator
click divide so we get the output that
we expect okay now if we pass 0 as
denominator and when we click divide
what's going to happen the calculator
service is going to throw an exception
what kind of exception is it going to
throw divided by 0 exception and with no
service we are not handling that
exception so that is an uncaught
exception so what is this uncaught
exception going to do to our WCF service
basically it's going to fault
this server channel and then if there
are any sessions with that server
channel you know that session will also
be ripped down okay so at the moment we
are using basic HTTP binding so when we
click divided so look at that we get
that exception message back because
within our Windows client what we are
doing if there is a fault exception we
are retrieving the message out of it and
then displaying within the label so
that's why we are looking at that
exception message there and look at this
when I try to divide 10 by 5
when I click this divide look at that it
still works fine without any problem but
then what did we discuss here an
unhandled exception in the WCF service
will cause the communication channel to
fall and the session will be lost once
the communication channel is in faulted
state we cannot use the same instance of
the proxy class anymore
we'll have to create a new instance of
the proxy class but if you look at our
Windows client code here look at this
when the form is initialized that's when
we are creating an instance of our
calculator client and you know when we
click this button you know they're using
the same proxy instance ok but then here
we are saying you know once the
communication channel is in folded state
we cannot use the same instance of the
proxy class anymore but the basic HTTP
binding we are able to use the same
instance of the proxy class so why is
that happening because we expect you
know the same proxy class not to work
but when the communication channel is
faulted that's because basic HTTP
binding does not have sessions so when
there is an unhandled exception it only
falls to serve our channel the client
proxy is still ok because with basic
HTTP binding the server channel is not
maintaining any sessions and when the
client calls again it's not expecting
the channel to maintain any session so
that's why here declined proxies ok but
by basic HTTP binding now let's change
the binding of the server's from basic
HTTP binding to WS HTTP binding and see
what's going to happen so let's close
the Kline that is running let's go to
the calculator service and within the
application configuration file let's
change the binding from basic HTTP
binding to WS HTTP binding that's the
only change to the service and let's
actually stop the service host that's
running and let's rerun the service host
then let's flip to this Windows client
update the service reference so now it
should be using
ws HTTP binding okay and with this
change let's go to new on declined as
well so let's enter number ten let's
divide that by two so we should get
number five which is fine
now let's pass zero so the service is
going to throw an exception and that
exception is unhandled so we get that
attempted to divide by zero exception
now let's try to divide this by five and
lick divide look at that we get an
unhandled exception and if you look at
the details here and notice that we get
communication object faulted exception
so basically you know it has ripped it
down the channel as well as this session
and we are not able to use the same
proxy class anymore look at this at this
point no matter what you try to do you
get the same error so communication
object faulted exception
okay now this proxy class right here
this instance of the proxy class is no
longer useful we'll have to create a new
instance of the proxy class now before
we do that let's actually look at this
text right here ws HTTP binding have
secure sessions so when there is an
unhandled exception it falls the server
channel at this point the existing
client proxies useless as it is also
faulted because with WS HTTP binding the
channel is maintaining a secure session
and when the client calls again it
expects the channel to maintain the same
session the same session does not exist
at the server channel anymore
as the unhandled exception has already
ripped down the channel and the session
along with it and that's what is exactly
happening now so when we click divide
look at that communication object
faulted exception now to overcome this
problem let's actually create another I
mean let's drag and drop another button
control here and then let's change the
text on this button control to
create a new proxy then let's increase
the width of this button and within the
button click event handler all we are
going to do is create a new instance of
this proxy class and then we are going
to display a message using message box
stating and new instance of the proxy
class is created all right now let's go
to and run the client application so
let's enter number 10 divide that by 2
so we should get number 5 then we divide
it by 0 we should get an exception and
when I try to divide it by 1 we should
get that error communication object
salted exception now when we create a
new proxy what's going to happen look at
that we are assigning a new instance of
our calculated service client to this
reference variable so I mean we are
creating effectively a new instance of
the proxy class now let's click the
button so a new instance of the proxy
class is created now when we try to
divide it look at that we get the result
as expected but again you know if at all
an exception has occurred now if we try
to use the same proxy we get the same
error communication object faulted
exception so the bottom line is whenever
there is an unhandled exception it's
going to rip down the channel and then
if the channel is maintaining any
sessions you know the session
information will also be lost
ok now you may be wondering how can we
solve this problem in reality now a WCF
servers should you know whenever there
is an exception we should actually be
handling that exception and returning a
fault instead of an exception now if at
all if there is an unhandled
exception the service thinks that you
know something has gone terribly wrong
and because of that is going to rip down
the channel and it's going to take down
any session information that the channel
has caught okay and then you know the
client proxies no longer useful at that
point of time okay so in our next
session we will see how to convert you
know an exception into a soap fault and
then return this whole fault okay so
when we return soap falls it's not going
to fall the silver channel and it's not
going to lose that session information
there we'll discuss that in our next
video session and if you're wondering
why we are using a Windows client you
know as the client for our calculator
service instead of a web application
that's basically because if you look at
our web application what are we doing
within the button click event every time
we click the button we are creating a
new instance of the calculator service
client okay so with this web application
we don't really see any difference
that's basically because every time we
click the button you know we are
creating a new instance of the
calculator service client class that's
why it's it's going to work just fine
without any problem so let's say 10
divided by 2 you get number 5 and when
we say 10 divided by 0 we get that
exception but when I try to divide it by
5 again okay that'd be good too
now here everything is fine because
every time we click this button we are
creating a new instance of the proxy
class all right that's it for today
thank you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
