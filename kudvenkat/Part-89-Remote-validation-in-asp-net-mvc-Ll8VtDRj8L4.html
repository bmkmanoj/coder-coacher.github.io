in this video we'll discuss remote
validation in MVC a sometimes to check
if a field value is valid we may need to
make a database call a classic example
of this is the user registration page
that you can see here to register a user
we need to ensure that the provided user
name is unique so to check if the user
name is not taken already we have to
make a call to the server and then check
the respective database table there's
something called remote attribute that's
extremely useful in situations like this
let's understand using this attribute
with an example we'll be using this
table TBL users for this demo I'll have
the sequel script available on my blog
in case if you need it the first step
here is to add an Adu dotnet entity data
model based on this table TBL users so
let's flip to visual studio let's
right-click on the models folder add a
new item select data ideo dotnet entity
data model and let's name this sample
data model and we want to generate the
model from the database and we want the
connection string to be saved as sample
DB context within the web config file so
this is going to connect to the database
and retrieve all the views tables and
stood procedures let's expand tables
select TBL users table and we want our
models to live in models namespace click
finish so this should generate an entity
with named TBL user but let's change
that to user let's save the changes and
let's build a solution so that this user
entity class is compiled the next step
is to add a controller and let's call it
home controller and let's use the
scaffolding template MVC controller with
read / write actions and views using
entity framework and our model class is
going to be the user entity class that
we have just generated and the data
context class is going to be sample
dbcontext click Add so this should
generate the home controller and all the
respective view
let's navigate to this create view and
let's get rid of the script section
otherwise we would get a compiler error
let's run the application now at the
moment we don't have any users within
this table TBL users so when this index
view renders there will be no users on
this view okay
now let's create a new user let's try
creating a user with test as the full
name test has two user name and test as
the password click create so this is
fine we don't have any user with that
user named test so this record is
created fine but let me create another
user with the same user name and let's
see look at that it allows me so we are
having now user names you know basically
duplicated user names that's what we
want to prevent and let's see how to
achieve that using removed attribute so
let's flip to visual studio the first
step here is to add a method to a
controller which is going to perform the
validation for us so this method is
going to return true or false if the
method returns true then the validation
has succeeded if it returns false then
the validation has failed so the return
type here is going to be boolean and
let's call this method is user name
available and we are going to pass a
parameter to this function username so
we are going to use link extension
method any here okay so here we have an
instance of our sample DB context class
so this object has got users property
which is going to list all the users
that are present within the database so
within that list you know I'm going to
check you know if there is any user with
the provided user name if that's the
case then we don't want to allow the
user to be created okay so basically the
validation should fail so if you look at
this any
extension method it's going to return a
boolean true or false okay so this
method returns true if a match is found
otherwise it's going to return false
okay so let's say user such that user
dot username equal to whatever username
that we are passing into this function
so if there is a match this function
will return true otherwise it's going to
return false okay so if there is a match
that means the username is already
existing in which case we don't want to
you know all of the user to be created
meaning the validation should fail okay
so we should return false in that case
if the validation has to fail okay
that's why we are going to negate
whatever this function is going to
return so return that value okay so a
very simple method you know it this
method should return true if we want the
app validation to be succeeded otherwise
it should return false
okay now the validation is done on the
client side okay so we need to return
JSON result back instead of boolean so
let's change the return type to jason
result and to return JSON result from a
controller action method we can use
jason function okay so we are passing
true or false to this method jason
method it's going to wrap that inside
adjacent result object and then return
it okay and then there's another
parameter that we need to specify jason
request behavior that is going to be a
love get because this request to this
method will be issued as a get request
okay so this is the method which is
responsible for performing the
validation now we need to hook up this
method with username property of the
user class and if you look at this
auto-generated file that we have within
this auto-generated file we have our
user class and this class has got all
the properties ID full-name username etc
okay now it's not a good practice to
make any changes to this auto-generated
file because if this file were to
auto-generate again we would lose all
our changes so let's add another user
class since this class is generated as a
partial class we can add another partial
user class so let's right click on the
models folder and let's add a class
let's call this user dot CS and this is
going to be a partial class I'm going to
add another class here and let's call
this maybe user metadata and this class
is going to contain the metadata for our
user okay so somehow we need to link
these two classes and to link them I'm
going to use metadata type attribute and
that type attribute is present in system
dot component model data annotations
namespace so let's decorate this with
metadata type attribute and then specify
the type which contains the metadata for
this class so this user metadata class
contains the metadata for user class
alright and then let's specify the
property here public string what is the
name of the property username this is
what we want to validate
all right so we're going to decorate
this property with a remote attribute
and again this remote attribute is
present in system dot web dot MVC
namespace so let's go ahead and bring
the pin and let's specify the remote
attribute here so here we will specify
the name of the method which is going to
do the validation for us and it is this
method is username available so we're
going to pass that and the next
parameter is the name of the controller
which contains that method and the
controller which contains this method is
the home controller and that's what we
are passing here and we can also specify
the error message that we want to be
displayed in case if the validation has
failed so let's say the validation error
message is username already in use okay
so we are done so let's build our
solution the next step is for this
validation to work we need to reference
some script files so let's go to a
create view so we need three script
files we need a jQuery itself we need
jQuery dot validate and jQuery dot
validate unobtrusive so let's drag and
drop these script files on to this view
and then let's also drag and drop the
CSS file so within content the site dot
CSS so let's drag and drop that as well
and let's change the syntax to use tilde
character
all right so let's build a solution and
let's navigate to the create view look
at that full name test use the name test
and look at this the moment I tab of a
we get that validation error use the
name already in use okay
on the other hand if I try test one look
at that the validation goes away and
then once I click create we should be
able to create a user with that username
test one okay now for this validation to
work make sure within this function you
know this parameter user name the name
of the parameter must match with the
name of the field on the create view so
here the name of the parameter is
username and then if you look at the
create view the field that you see here
you know this user name field the input
field has got the same name user name if
you misspell it
so within home controller if you
misspell it something like user name one
maybe you know the default model bind in
asp.net MVC will not bind the field
value with this parameter and hence the
validation will not work as expected
alright so obviously for the validation
to work you need to reference these
script files jQuery jQuery dot validate
jQuery dot validate that unobtrusive and
we also need to make sure that both
client validation and unobtrusive
javascript are enabled that's it for
today thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
