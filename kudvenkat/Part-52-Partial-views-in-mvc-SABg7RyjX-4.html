this video we'll discuss partial views
if you're an asp.net webforms developer
then you will realize that partial views
in MVC are very similar to use the
controls in asp.net webforms
partial views are used to encapsulate
reusable view logic and that a great
means to simplify the complexity of
views these partial views can then be
used on multiple views where we need
similar kind of view logic the file
extension for partial view depends on
two things the view engine that we are
using and the programming language for
example if you're using ways of view
engine and the programming language is C
sharp then the file extension for the
partial view is going to be dot CSS HTML
if your programming language is Visual
Basic then it's going to be dot Phebe
HTML on the other hand if your view
engine is ASP X then the programming
language is not going to have any
influence on the file extension of the
partial view it's going to be dot ASC X
let's understand these partial views
with an example let's say we want to
display employees photo and their age
gender salary as you can see here and we
want to display the employees data in
this fashion on several views there are
two ways we can achieve that one repeat
this HTML and see shaft code on each and
every view where you want a similar kind
of an output but this has got a
disadvantage tomorrow if we want to
update you know this view such that we
also want to display date of birth then
you will have to update all those views
okay the other way is to actually
encapsulate this HTML and code into a
partial view and then use that partial
view on all the views where you want
this kind of an output and this has got
two advantages one you know using
partial views make the views themselves
simpler to understand because they
reduce the complexity the amount of code
will be reduced within the view itself
so they will be simpler to understand
and number two maintainability will be
much easier tomorrow
you update that one partial view and
then all of the views wherever we are
using the partial view will be
automatically update to update it so
maintainability will also be much easier
first of all let's create an index view
that's going to list employees in this
fashion and then we will see how to
encapsulate the view logic you know of
displaying that one employee into a
partial view and then we will see how to
use that partial view on the index view
okay
so we'll be using this table TBL
employee for this demo and then within
the view we want to display employees
photo age gender and salary so we have
got those columns there so age gender
and salary and then the photo path of
the employee and notice that the photos
of employee are going to be in the
photos folder and that photos folder is
going to be within the root directory
the tilde symbol here indicates the root
directory of our web application project
so within the root directory we are
going to have photos directory and
within that we are going to have you
know photos of employees now I have
these photos here so let's copy them and
then within our project there is a
photos folder and that's present within
the root directory of our project let's
go ahead and paste the photos into that
folder that's the first step and the
next step is to actually add the index
view itself
so the name of the view is going to be
indexed we don't need a parameter for
the index view let's go ahead and create
an instance of a sample DB context class
which will help us connect to the
database and then return a view and to
the view let's pass the list of
employees alright the next step is to
add the index view itself the name of
the view is going to be index we're
going to make use of razor view engine
I'm going to create a strongly typed
view and the scaffold template is going
to be list let's add that so this should
add index dot CSS HTML so we have the
index view there I'm going to get rid of
all this HTML which is auto-generated
for us now the important thing to notice
here is that the model for this view is
going to be I enumerable of employees
that is the list of employees okay and
then what I want to do is I want the
HTML which is going to produce this
output so I'm going to have a table and
within that I'm going to have two TDs
one TD to display the image of the
employee and another TD to display these
three you know fields and the values
that's H enter and salary so it should
be pretty straightforward HTML so let me
copy that and then paste it there now
this is going to display one employee
details but then we need to loop through
each employee because look at this the
model for this view is actually
ienumerable of employee meaning we'll
get a list of employees so I'm going to
use a for each loop here
so the model for this view the model for
this view is list of employees so we are
going to look through each employee in
that model so let's close that bracket
right here okay so we are going to pass
each employee object you know into this
HTML so this HTML will be repeated for
each employee in that model and within
the HTML itself it's very
straightforward we have a table tag and
look at that we have a style tag there
we have set font family to area we have
set border one pixel solid black border
and the width of that table is going to
be 300 pixels and notice that I have one
TR and within that one TR I have two DDS
1 TD is right here and look at this TD
what is it doing it is retrieving the
photo okay and then we are using URL dot
content HTML helper to resolve that path
for us and then we are setting the
alternate text as well for that image in
the previous sessions we have discussed
about displaying images in an MVC
application it's the same code here we
are using the image deck setting the
source and all the attributes so that's
the first TD so within the first TD we
are displaying the image and then within
the second TD I have got another table
okay so basically a table for displaying
age gender and salary and within that I
have three rows okay so one row for each
column value age gender and salary three
rows and within each row I'm going to
have two TDs so here we have two TDs
first TD is going to contain the label
which is age and the second TD is going
to contain the value okay so the same
logic here as for gender and salary
pretty simple and straightforward HTML
and see Sharpe code here okay but then
notice this view it's a little
complicated here because you have I mean
we have this for each loop there and we
have this HTML
and you know it's a bit messy here now
it's possible we can encapsulate this
entire HTML into a partial view and then
we can use that partial view we'll do
that in a bit foot but for now let's
build the solution ctrl shift B is the
keyboard shortcut so on the status file
you can notice that it says Bill
succeeded let's go ahead and navigate to
the index view so that should render the
output as you can see here so we have
the output okay now let's see how to you
know encapsulate this HTML into its own
partial view and partial views can
reside either in the shared folder or in
a specific views folder if we add a
partial view to a shared folder then
obviously that will be available for all
the views in the entire application on
the other hand if we added to a specific
folder then it's going to be available
only for the views within that folder
let's actually add it to the shared
folder so I'm going to add a view and
the name of the view is going to be
under school employee and we're going to
make use of rays of view Indian we're
going to create a strongly typed view
and the scaffold template is going to be
empty we're going to create a partial
view I'm going to add that so that
should add underscore employee dot CS
HTML notice that we are using c-sharp
programming language and the view engine
is raisa so the extension for the view
is dot c sh t ml now notice that the
model for this view is one employee
object okay so what I'm going to do here
is we are going to read tree we're going
to cut this HTML I'm going to take that
entire table from there and put that
within our employee dot CSS HTML partial
view and notice that we have some errors
here at saying you know the item does
not exist and it makes sense because we
haven't declared item since we copied
this HTML from index dot CSS HTML view
in
we have the terror there so what we need
to do is the model for this view is the
employee object so the photo property
alternate text property is going to come
from that model object so all we need to
do here is use model instead of item so
let's replace that that
okay so this is our partial view now now
we want to use this partial view within
our index dot CSS HTML okay and to use a
partial view or a render a partial view
then the reason HTML helper called
partial okay and notice that there are
several overloaded versions of this HTML
helper but we are going to use that this
overloaded version which takes two
parameters that is the name of the
partial view and the model object okay
so the name is underscore employee
that's the name of the partial view and
the model for the model object for this
partial view is employee object so let's
pass that and item is nothing but the
employee object because that's going to
come from your model that's it let's
build a solution so notice that in the
status bar bills exceeded let's refresh
this view we should have the same output
except that now we're using a partial
view okay and you know instead of using
partial extension method there's another
extension method that we can use render
partial okay you might be wondering why
do we have two methods to do the same
thing in our next video we'll discuss
the difference between partial and
render partial HTML helper methods when
this slide you can find the sources face

interview questions that's it for today
