we'll discuss partitioning operators
take skip take while and skip while all
of these standard query operators belong
to partitioning operators category take
method returns a specified number of
elements from the start of the
collection the number of items to return
is specified using the count parameter
let's look at an example let's flip to
visual studio here I have a new console
application at the moment within the
main method we have the string array
called countries which contains seven
different country names what we want to
do is retrieve the first three country
names so we're going to make use of this
take extension method and if you notice
this method expects one parameter of
type integer and using this parameter we
specify the number of items that we want
to retrieve since we want to retrieve
three items I'm going to pass three as
the argument value and if you notice
what this method returns it returns
ienumerable of string so let's use a
variable of that type to store the
result and let's name the variable as
resolved and then all that is left now
is to use a for each loop loop through
each string in the result collection and
then print out the value of that string
onto the console screen so now when we
run this as you might expect it is going
to print the first three country names
now let's see how to rewrite the same
query using sequel like syntax so from
country n country's collection what we
want to do we want to select such
country now when we run this query what
do you think is going to happen it's
going to list each and every country
within that collection but that's not
what we want we want the first three
countries so we are going to make use of
the take operator and then pass 3 as the
argument value so now when we run this
we should get only the first three
countries so that's our example two now
let's look at skip method skip method
actually does the opposite of take
method skip method skips a specified
number of elements in a collection and
then returns the remaining elements the
number of items that we want to skip is
specified using the count
amita so let's look at an example and
what we want to do is actually skip the
first three countries and then the
retrieved rest of them so to achieve
that we simply say countries dot skip
three so it's going to skip the first
three countries and then retrieve the
rest of them now notice that for the
same argument value the Skip method
returns all of the items that they take
method would not return so now when we
say take three what's going to happen
it's going to retrieve first three and
it's not going to return these countries
now when we say skip three it's going to
skip these three and then return the
rest of them so for the same argument
value the Skip method returns all of the
items that they take method would not
return take while method returns
elements from a collection as long as
the given condition specified by the
predicate is true let's look at an
example and what we want to do is return
countries starting from the beginning of
the array until a country name is hit
that does not have the length greater
than two characters and to specify that
condition we are using this lambda
expression right here as such that s dot
length is greater than two now this
lambda expression will be executed
against every item starting from the
first item in the collection now is the
length of the first string greater than
two yes so that item will be returned is
the length greater than two for this
string yes so that string will be
returned so it is true for this string
as well so that will be returned but for
this thing you know this lambda
expression is going to return false
so only the first three country names
will be returned here because with the
fourth element the condition becomes
false so it's going to stop there so
let's actually look at that in action so
can rase dot take while as such that as
dot length greater than two
so now it should return the first three
countries there look at that
now what do you think
skip file is going to do so when we say
skip file s such that s dot length
greater than two so when we do this you
know it's going to skip the items until
that condition is true and then return
the rest of them so for this item this
expression evaluates to true so it's
going to skip that it's going to skip
that it's going to skip that and then at
this point the condition will become
false so from that point onwards it's
going to return the rest of the items so
now when we run this we should get from
us till Italy so that's our next example
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
