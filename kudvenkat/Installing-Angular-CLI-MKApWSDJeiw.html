tutorial in this video we'll discuss how
to install angular CLI first let's look
at the prereqs we need node six point
nine point zero or higher and NPM three
or higher to install angular CLI to
check the versions you have on your
machine use these two commands we
execute these commands from command
prompt window there are a couple of ways
to fire up the command prompt window I
have Windows 10 operating system so on
Windows 10 we click on the start button
scroll all the way down within the
program list until you find w and then
here we have windows system folder so
let's expand this and then we have the
command prompt right click on that
select more and then select run as
administrator another way is to simply
fire up the run window type CMD and
click OK once you have your command
prompt window fired up let's type node -
V to check the version of node and
similarly to check the version of NPM we
type NPM - B if you don't have the
prereqs you can download the latest
version of node and NPM from this URL
right here make sure you download the
correct installer depending on your
operating system
once you have node and NPM install they
are all set to install angular CLI to
install angular CLI we use this command
npm install - g at angular 4 / CLI we
can also use this command the only
difference here is instead of typing the
full word install we are using its alias
i in both these commands they flag - g
instructs npm to install angular CLI
globally on our machine so in the
command prompt window let's type the
command required to install angular CLI
npm install or we can use its alias just
i and then - g to install angular's here
like globally and then at
for slash CLI and then press ENTER
depending on the speed of your computer
and internet connection this may take
anywhere between from a few seconds to a
couple of minutes there we go
it's done if you see a tree structure
like this then you have angular CLI
successfully installed you might see a
couple of warnings like this you can
safely ignore them to check the version
of angular CLI you have we can use this
command ng - me ng is the angular CLI
itself and - V tells us the version of
angular CLI
on our machine so in the command prompt
render let's type ng - V and then plus
the Enter key at the time of this
recording the latest version of angular
CLI is one point four point three and
that's what is installed on my machine
it also displays the version of node and
the operating system I have so we just
successfully installed angular CLI if
you run into any problems installing
angular CLI then follow these steps and
hopefully angular CLI will be
successfully installed the first step is
to delete NPM folder from this path so
navigate to your C Drive or the drive
where you have your operating system
installed and within your C Drive you
will find a folder called users so
inside this users folder you'll find
another folder with the username that
you used to log into your computer in my
case the username that I used to log
into my computer is user itself so I
have a folder with that name and inside
that folder you'll have this folder
AppData and by default this is a hidden
folder and for you to be able to see the
hidden folder go to the View tab and
then click on options and then on the
beauty of right here make sure you have
this option check show hidden files
folders and drives and go inside that
AppData folder and then there we have
this roaming folder and here we have
this NPM folder so we need to delete
this NPM folder from omishi
next uninstall and reinstall node to
uninstall node go to control panel and
then go to programs and features this
may take a couple of seconds to list all
the programs that you have installed on
your machine find node within the list
right click and then select uninstalled
from the context menu
this uninstalls node we then need to
reinstall node and then try to install
angular CLI again and hopefully it helps
if you still have a problem please leave
the problem you're facing as a comment
on this video and we will try to help as
soon as we can also if you had a problem
and you solved it yourself please let us
know what the problem is and how you
solved it by leaving a comment so it
could help out others with a similar
problem after all it's all about sharing
and learning from each other in our next
video we'll discuss creating an angular
project from scratch using the angular
CLI tool that we have just installed
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
