this video well discuss remote
validation in MVC when javascript is
disabled
this is continuation to part 89 so
please watch part 89 before proceeding
with this video out of the box removed
attribute only works when javascript is
enabled if the end user disables
JavaScript then the validation doesn't
work so this is the user registration
view that we have created in the
previous session and if you notice this
table TBL users we already have a user
with test 1 as the user name and look at
this when I enter test 1 as the user
name we get that validation error right
away that's because javascript is
enabled on my machine at the moment and
then the browser is able to issue this
ajax request to this validation method
so this is the method which gets called
when we enter user name in this field
and that's because within this user
class we have decorated this user name
property with the remote attribute and
we specified this is the method which
contains the validation logic so call
this method as invent somebody types a
user name into this field on the UI so
how is the browser make able to make
that Ajax call - this is user name
available method by using javascript so
we need JavaScript to be enabled on the
browser what happens if we disable
JavaScript let's look at that so to
disable JavaScript click on that setting
button select settings and then search
for JavaScript click on content settings
button and select this radio button do
not allow any site to run JavaScript
click done so this has disabled
javascript within google chrome now so
let's reload this view and look at this
as I type test one I don't get any
validation error and look at this when I
click on this create button we are able
to create another user with test 1 as
the use
name so essentially we have skipped
decline side validation that is enforced
by the remote attribute by disabling
JavaScript and that's why it's very
important to always have server side
validation so that if the end-user
disables the client-side validation we
still have suicide logic which does the
validation always so to make server side
validation work when javascript is
disabled
there are two ways the first approach is
to add model validation error
dynamically in the controller action
method and we will discuss this option
in this video in our next video we'll
discuss creating a custom remote
attribute and overriding the East valid
method so let's look at adding model
validation error dynamically so what's
happening when we click the create
button so when we click create button
you know there are two create action
methods here within the home controller
this create action method responds to
the get request whereas this one
responds to the post request meaning
that when we click create new and when I
click this create button the form get
posted to the server and at that point
this is the action method that gets
called so within this action method what
I'm going to do is we're going to check
if there are any users with the user
name that we have provided in the UI and
if that is the case we are going to add
model validation error dynamically so
first we need to check you know if there
are any users with the given user name
and to do that we are going to write the
same kind of logic that we have in this
function you know DB dot user is dot ne
and then we are checking if any of the
user within that users collection has
got a user name you know which matches
with the user name that is coming into
this function so we have the user object
coming into this function we can use
that object and then the user name
property
so let's actually look at that so if we
already have the instance of database
contact
class so DB e dot users which is going
to give us the list of all users in the
database dot any and then we can check X
such that X dot username equals so this
object is going to receive the
properties I mean the field values that
we enter on the UI here okay so we will
be receiving full name username password
all values you know within this object
so user dot username so if this method
returns true then we know for sure there
is all today and user with the username
that we have entered here okay in that
case what we need to do we are going to
add model validation error so we have
this model state object dot add more the
letter function so we are going to
invoke that and then specify the key the
key is nothing but the property so which
property username and then what is the
error message that you want to specify
so I'm going to use this overloaded
version where we can specify the error
message as a string so maybe something
like username is already in use okay so
when we add validation error like this
to the model State what's going to
happen it's going to turn this is valid
property to false in that case it's not
going to execute this logic so it
doesn't get inside that if block and it
comes back to this return view and then
it's going to render that create view
back to the user
ok so let's build this and let's reload
this view end at the moment JavaScript
is still disabled on the browser so now
look at this when I type test one as two
username and then when I tab away we
don't get that validation error but then
look at this when I click this create
button the form will get posted to the
server
and on the silver side this HTTP POST
method is going to check okay is the
provided username is there within the
list if that's the case add this model
validation error username is already in
use to the model state object and then
it checks you know its model state valid
that's going to return false so it comes
back and returns the view and passes
that user object okay and we get the
error as expected okay but then one
thing we have to keep in mind is that
delegating the responsibility of
performing validation to a controller
action method violates separation of
concerns within MVC so ideally all
validation logic should be in the model
and then if you look at you know this
user model here look at that
to validate model data we need to use
attributes that should be the preferred
approach validation attributes are there
for that purpose and it's the
responsibility of the model you know to
check if model data is valid or not it's
not the responsibility of the controller
so by moving this logic to check if
there are any validation I mean
validation errors into the controller we
are violating separation of concerns
with an MVC okay so in our next video we
will see how to customize this remote
attribute
so this is the code that we have just
discussed which adds model validation
error dynamic lay within the controller
action method that's it for today thank
you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
