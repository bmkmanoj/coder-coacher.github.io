this video we'll discuss disabling and
making form controls read-only here we
have the list of classes and attributes
that we use to disable or make form
controls read-only to disable some of
the form controls we may have to use
both they disabled the attribute and the
disabled class in our previous video to
disable checkboxes and radio buttons we
have used both the disabled class and
disabled attribute but most of the form
controls can be disabled just by using
the disabled attribute let's look at an
example right here I have an input
element of type text notice at the
moment we are not using this abled
attribute so this text box right here is
not disabled to disable this text box
all we have to do is use the boolean
disabled attribute so when we reload our
page notice the text box is disabled and
when I hover the mouse over that
disabled control look at what happens to
the cursor style it changes to a stop
sign so this disabled attribute is used
to disable individual form controls or
all the controls in a field set let's
now look at an example of disabling a
fieldset let's flip to visual studio
here we have a field set with an input
element of type text a select element a
check box and a submit button let's save
our changes when we reload this page
notice none of the form controls within
that field set are disabled now let's
say we want to disable all these
controls within that fields at one way
to achieve this is by using the disabled
attribute on all of these individual
form controls but then this approach is
tedious and error-prone better way of
doing this is by using disabled
attribute on the field set itself when
we do that it's going to disable all the
controls that we have within that field
set let's save our changes and when we
reload this page
notice all the controls are now disabled
as expected next let's discuss how to
make form input controls read-only to
make an input control read-only
use the read-only attribute read-only
controls prevent users from making any
modifications to the content and they
appear just like disabled controls
except that the cursor style does not
change to a stop sign on hava let's look
at an example let's flip to visual
studio here we have an input element of
type text let's include an HTML break
and then another input element of type
text on this first input control let's
use read-only attribute and on this one
let's use disabled attribute let's save
our changes and let's reload the first
one is read-only control look at this
on hover the cursor style does not
change to a stop sign and the second one
is the disabled control and on hover the
cursor style changes to a stop sign
that's the fundamental difference
between a read-only control and disabled
control in bootstrap both of them in
general prevent the user from making any
modification to their content next let's
discuss how to display plain read-only
text next to a label within a form so
here is what we want to do we want to
display this plain read-only ID value 1
0 1 next to its label ID in a single
draw as you can see here we also have
first name and its associated textbox
last name and its text box let's look at
this in action let's flip to visual
studio so here we have a form element
with class had to form horizontal this
class is going to line up labels and
their associated controls in a single
line side-by-side so within the first
development we have a label for ID and
then this value 1 0 1 which is the plain
text that we want to display next to
this label ID is inside this div element
so the label is 2 units wide and the
value itself which is present in this
development is 10 units wide and then we
have another development here and within
this development we have a label for
first name which is 2 units wide and
then the textbox for first name which is
10 units wide and then within the final
div we have a
label for last name which is two units
wide and a textbox for last name which
is ten units wide so if we view this
HTML in the browser this is how it looks
like
notice the ID value one zero one is not
properly aligned with its label whenever
we want to display plain read-only text
like this bootstrap recommends using
form control static class on a paragraph
element so we are going to wrap this
value one zero one in a paragraph
element and then on the paragraph
element we are going to use this
bootstrap class form control static
which is going to line it up properly
with its label ID so let's flip to
visual studio so let's use a paragraph
element here and on this paragraph
element let's use form control static
class let's save our changes reload this
page notice now the ID value is properly
aligned with its label thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
