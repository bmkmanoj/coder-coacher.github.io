in this video we'll discuss cash
profiles in MVC we'll be working with
the same example that we started in part
73 so please watch but 73 from the
asp.net MVC tutorial before proceeding
with this video now to catch the data
returned by the index action method for
16 seconds we would use output cash
attribute as you can see here notice
that we have set duration to 60 seconds
so here we are specifying output cash
settings within the application code so
specifying output cash settings within
the application code can have the
disadvantages as listed here now if we
have to apply the same cash setting that
is a duration of 60 seconds for several
methods within our entire application
then we will end up with a similar
duplicated code at all those places and
later if we want to change the cash
setting for example I want to change the
setting from 60 to 120 seconds then we
will have to make modification at all
those places so maintaining the
application code becomes much
complicated and also since we are
changing the application code here and
if we want to have those changes taking
effect in the application that's already
deployed then we need to rebuild our
application and redeploy to all our
production servers so to overcome these
disadvantages we can specify these cache
settings within the web config file
using cache profiles and here is an
example of a cache profile within
vectored config file let's look at that
in action so now if I want to cache the
output of this index action method for
60 seconds we would use output cache
attribute and set duration to 60 seconds
but we don't want to hard-code the cache
settings within the application hood
like this we want to move these settings
into cache profiles within web config
file so within web config file under
system dot web we want to specify
caching sections
and we want to specify output cache
settings so we want to use some output
cache profiles so let's add a cache
profile so give your profile a
meaningful name so here we want to cache
the data for one minute so I'm going to
call this one minute cache or you can
give it any meaningful name you want and
let's specify the duration so duration
is going to be 60 seconds vary by per M
is going to be none so I want to cache
only one response of a controller action
method so I am setting vary by param to
none we discussed in detail about this
vary by parameter asp.net video tutorial
so if you're new to caching concepts
please watch those videos all right
so at this point we have a cache profile
specified within our web config file so
within the home controller instead of
hard-coding cache setting like this I'm
going to use another named parameter so
this constructor of this output cache
attribute has a named parameter called
cache profile as you can see in the
intellisense
so let's specify cache profile so cache
profile is equal to whatever is the name
of your cache profile what's the name of
our cache profile is called one minute
cache so let's copy the name paste it
here let's build our application and
let's navigate to the index action and
see if that output is cached for 60
seconds the first time the form loads is
going to load that by executing the
action method look at that it's loaded
at 21 46 let's refresh this look at that
even after refreshing the time is not
changed meaning we are getting that
output from the cache not by reacts
accusing the action method all right so
at this point we have our cache settings
within the web load config file so what
are the advantages of using cache
profiles now one of the advantages is we
have one place to change the cache
so no matter you know at how many places
you have used this one minute cache
profile tomorrow if you want to change
the duration from 60 to 120 you just
change the duration right here and at
all the places within our application we
are reading the cache profile settings
from the web config file that is from
that one single location so you know all
those references will automatically use
the updated value okay so one of the
main advantages is that we have one
place to change the cache settings so
maintainability is much easier and since
the changes are done in web config file
we need not build and redeploy the
application simply make the changes to
your configuration file save and you are
done let's now look at using cache
profiles with child action methods now
within our home controller if you
remember this get employee count is a
child action method that's invoked from
the index fear okay now let's see using
cache profiles with this child action
method okay so since this is a child
action method let's also decorate that
the child action only attribute it's not
mandatory but to be explicit about it
let's decorate that to child action
Emily let's build the solution and let's
refresh this view and see what's going
to happen look at that we get the
narrower duration must be a positive
integer and if you remember within web
config file duration is set to 60
seconds which is definitely a positive
integer so for some reason the cache
profiles are not working with child
action methods and to make these cache
profiles work with child action methods
there are several ways and one of the
ways that I am aware of is by creating a
custom output cache attribute if you are
aware of any other better way of
achieving it please leave a comment
either on this video or on my blog okay
so we are going to create a custom
output cache attribute okay so first of
all let's add a new folder
and let's call it common and let's add a
class file so this folder is going to
contain all the common code that we are
going to use so let's add a class file
and let's call it partial cash attribute
and first of all let's go ahead and
import the namespaces that we need so we
need system dot web dot MVC we need
system dot of AB dot configuration and
we need system dot configuration
okay so this partial cash attribute is
going to extend the output cash
attribute so I'm going to inherit from
the output cash attribute class now
let's include a constructor for this
partial cash attribute so a public
constructor and to this constructor we
are going to pass cash profile name so
what is this constructor going to do
this constructor is going to read you
know the cash profile settings from web
config file for us ok and obviously the
cash profile settings are present so the
cash profile is basically present within
output cash settings
ok so we need to read this output cash
setting section from web blog config
file and to do that anytime we want to
read anything from web config file what
is the class we use we use web
configuration manager class so web
configuration manager class and we need
to get a section from web config file so
I'm going to use the sketch section
method and you specify the path for the
section so the path is going to be
system dot the app within that we have
cashing section
so caching and within that we have
output cache settings section so that's
the part
okay now this get section look at that
it returns an object but we know this
get section what section is it going to
return it's going to return output cache
settings section so
so we are going to get output cache
settings section
and let's give it that meaningful name
output cash setting section is equal to
so we need to typecast the object type
to output cash settings so all we are
doing here is we are getting that
section since that is returning and all
you know a type of object type
we need to typecast it to be of type
output care settings and we are storing
whatever this function is returning in
this variable okay so within output cash
setting section so within web config
file within output cash settings what do
you have you have output cash profiles
and there is a cash profile with this
name one minute cash so what I'm going
to do here so output cash settings
section so that's the name of the object
dot there is a property output cash
profiles and then you can specify I mean
basically n DEXA you can specify the
name of your profile so what's the name
of your profile one minute cash and what
is this going to return this is going to
return an output cash profile so we are
going to store that in an object of type
output cash profile
and let's call it output cache profile
okay so now what we need to do using
this output cache profile so at this
point we have reached into this profile
and so obviously we have duration here
value by param not only that there are
several other attributes like vary by
control vary by custom vary by header so
we need to read all these attribute
values I'm not going to read all of them
I'm going to read whatever I am
interested in I am interested in
duration so output cache profile dot
duration is going to give me that
similarly I need vary by param so output
cache profile dot vary by param
similarly you can read all the other
attribute values as well whatever you
have specified within web config file ok
so we have you know our partial cache
attribute so let's build the solution
now let's go back to the home controller
now look at this instead of using the
output cache attribute I'm going to make
use of my custom partial cache attribute
so here I'm going to specify partial ok
look at that for some reason I'm not
getting you know this intelligence for
this partial cache attribute why is that
that's because this partial cache
attribute is present in a different
namespace and we see demo dot common so
we need to include that namespace within
our home controller so let's include
that
and now let's see if we get let's
actually get rid of that all together
and then use look at that partial cash
and then once I open you know the
bracket look at that there are two
overloaded constructors and one of the
overloaded constructors is expecting a
cash profile name to be passed in so
what is the name of our cash profile
actually we did a small mistake here but
in our partial cash attribute we have
hard-coded of a cash profile name
instead of that what we need to do we
can simply pass whatever we are passing
to this constructor so let's go ahead
and pass it there okay so now here
within the home controller we are
passing we are going to pass the name of
our cash profile so what is the name of
our cash profile one minute cash so
let's copy that and pass it to the
constructor so once we pass it to the
constructor of this partial cash
attribute so that's going to so that's
going to receive that name and it's
going to read that profile values or
attribute values from web config file
okay all right so let's build the
solution so we have applied partial cash
attribute only on the staled action
method we have not cashed the output of
the index action method
okay so let's build a solution let's
refresh this view and see if it works
okay look at that you know the employee
list is loaded at 31 53 now you know we
are not cashing this index data so this
time is bound to change but this time
shouldn't change so let me refresh that
because that this time keeps changing
but this is not changing so we are able
to cash portions of up here
all right on this slide you can find
resources for you know basically all my
YouTube playlists you know a link to my
YouTube playlist where all the videos
are organized in logical sequence you
also have a link to my blog where you
can find code samples and text versions
of all the videos that's it for today
thank you for listening
