questions and answers video series in
this video we'll discuss an interview
question on virtual method in an
abstract class one of our YouTube
channel subscribers faced this question
in an interview for dotnet developer
roll the interview question is like this
an abstract class has a default
implementation for a method the methods
default implementation is needed in some
class but not in some other class how
can you achieve it the answer to this
question is very simple if you know what
a virtual method is and its purpose then
you already know the answer let's
understand the answer to this question
with an example we have a new console
application here within this console
application let's create an abstract
class let's name this class abstract
class this abstract class is going to
contain only one method and we are going
to provide default implementation for
that method so let's make this method
public I'm going to make this method
virtual and there is a reason for doing
so well this is that in just a bit let's
name this method abstract class method
let's provide a default implementation
for this method all this method is going
to do is print this line to the console
default implementation so we have an
abstract class and we have got a default
implementation for a method within this
abstract class now what is the interview
question we want this default
implementation in some class but not in
some other class now by making this
method virtual within the abstract class
we are basically telling to the derived
classes if a class wants to use this
default implementation as it is then
that class is free to do so on the other
hand if another class does not want to
use this default implementation it's
also free to override this default
implementation with a new implementation
that's what is the significance of this
virtual method let's actually look at
this in action so I'm going to create a
class here let's name this some class
and we're going to make this class
inherit from our abstract class and this
class is going to do nothing now since
this class has inherited from the
abstract class this class will have
access to this method which also has a
default implementation so when we create
an instance of this class and call
abstract class method this class is
going to use the default implementation
so for this some class the default
implementation that's available in the
base abstract class is available now we
are going to have another class let's
name this some other class and this
class is also going to inherit from
abstract class but now we don't want
this class to use this default
implementation so this class is now free
to override the default implementation
provided by the base class so we want to
override the abstract class method and
we want to change the implementation so
the sum of the class is going to print
new implementation to the console so
this default implementation is available
for some class but not for some other
class so now within our main method if
we create an instance of some class
let's call it SC equals new some class
and then when we call the abstract class
method you know it's going to use the
default implementation because some
class did not override the default
implementation it's going to use the
default implementation provided by the
base class as it is so this statement
right here is going to print default
implementation let's create an instance
of some other class let's call it SOC
equals new some other class and now on
this object if we call abstract class
method this class is going to print this
line new implementation that is because
within some other class we have
overwritten the default implementation
provided by the base abstract class
so let's go ahead and run this now there
we go we get the output as expected so
the some class uses the default
implementation provided by the base
class whereas there's some other class
has provided its own new implementation
hope this answers the question if you
have any suggestions to improve this
answer please leave them as comments
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
