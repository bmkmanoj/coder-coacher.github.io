venket this is part 15 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll learn about
the command event of an asp.net button
control we'll also discuss about the
command name and command argument
properties asp.net button control
exposes to events click and command
events in part 14 we have discussed
about the click event in this session
we'll discuss about the command event
when the button is actually clicked both
the events are raised click event
happens before the command event let's
look at that in an example here I have a
simple asp.net web application let's
drag and drop the button control on to
the web form now when I double-click the
button the event handler for the click
event is generated automatically in the
code-behind file and if you look at the
source of this HTML we are using this on
click attribute to wire up the event
handler with the click event of the
button control ok so now let's say I
want to write to the response team
button click event ok now let's see how
to get the event handler for the command
event and first of all how do we find
all the events that are supported by a
button there are two ways one way is to
simply right-click on the button control
go into the properties window usually we
get to this property screen so click on
this you know lightning bolt symbol and
you should see all the events there
supported by the control so here the
button supports the click event and we
already have a event handler for that
and we have the command event as well so
now one once I double click here the
command event handler should
automatically be generated and if you
look at the source you should see it has
added the on command attribute and then
we are using button 1 underscore command
this is the name of the method which is
going to handle the command event ok so
here let's say response dot right button
command even
okay so let's actually put the HTML
break here so that the output comes
properly in separate lines okay so now
let's put a breakpoint here and run the
application so we said that when we
click the button both the events are
raised the click event and the command
event okay and the click even happens
before the command event let's look at
that so here we are in the code let me
click this button so as soon as I click
the button look at that button click
event is handled first and then when I
press f5 oh we should have put a
breakpoint here so let's put the
breakpoint there as well now let's click
that so first button click event and
then once I press f5 it comes to the
button command event plus f5 and the
output as expected so when we click the
button keep in mind that both the events
get fired the click event and the
command event and I told you there are
two ways to actually find out what are
all the even supported by a specific
control one way is to obviously go to
the properties window and then find them
there the other way is to actually find
it using code now if you look at this
button control the ID of the button
control is button one so in the code
behind when I say button one dot you
should see all the methods properties
and events that are supported by this
this control whatever have that you know
flashing symbol or lightning bolt symbol
you know those are the events so click
event command the event okay so these
are the two even supported by a button
control so this is another way to figure
that out all right now how do we hook up
the event handler to the event of a
control now for example we have you know
the button has a click event when that
event occurs this event handler method
is being fired so how are we hooking
that up using the on click attribute so
this onclick attribute is telling to the
button control when the click event
occurs call this method
similarly on command attribute is
telling the button control you know when
that even doctor is called this event
handler now is it possible only to do it
in the HTML so here we are associating
the even handler to the event of a
control using you know the HTML
declaratively ok now we can do that
programmatically as well now what is
going to happen when I actually remove
these you know hookups here now if I run
and click the button the button control
does not know which even handlers to
call that's why nothing happens look at
that nothing gets printed out ok because
we removed those associations so we have
seen how to associate you know the click
event to the event handler declaratively
in the HTML using those attributes we
can also do that programmatically using
delegates let's see how to do that so in
the page load which happens before
obviously the respective postback events
the click and command events what I can
do is button one dot click event so to
the click event I want to associate an
event handler so button one dot click
plus equals new event handler here even
handler is a delegate okay so this
delegate now is pointing to this
function button one underscore click so
at runtime and the click even happens
the button control now knows it has to
call this function and a function with
this name and similarly if I want to
associate the command event so button 1
dot command and then give a space press
plus equals and then now if you press
tab automatically it generates the event
handler name for us okay so even handle
a delegate is used to hook up this
method with this event of this button
control ok similarly we are using a
different delegate here command even
handle a delegate to hook up come a
button one underscore commander this is
the event handler which should be called
when command event occurs on button one
control so now if we run that and click
the bar
then you know it knows which even
handler to call when that respect you
invent occurs and then there we get the
output all right so even handlers can be
associated to the events of control in
two ways declaratively at design time in
the HTML using the attributes or
programmatically using delegates now
when do I actually use this command most
of the time in reality we use the click
event but when do we actually use this
command event okay now if you have
multiple button controls on a webform
and if you want to programmatically
determine which button control is
clicked then we can make use of this
command event along with the command
name and command argument properties
okay let me actually show you a demo
then it will be much clearer so here I
have a little bit of HTML just to save
some time in typing I have it here so
let's go to the webform let's get rid of
this HTML that way that I have here let
me paste this okay now if you look at
the HTML it's pretty simple all I have
is declarations for the button control
so let's look at the design first so I
have four button controls here a button
which says print delete show top 10
employees show bottom 10 employees and
if you look at the source it's pretty
simple so button this is the ideal and
it is equal to server which is pretty
simple
I mean text is equal to print and then I
have on command attribute okay which
tells which even handler method to call
and if you notice all these four button
controls you know the on command you
know all the button controls have the
same even handler here command button
underscore click command button
underscore click you know if you look at
the on command attribute and then there
is another problem attribute command
name property attribute if you look at
that for the print button the command
name is print and I have given delete as
the command name for delete button and
for top you know for the button which
shows top 10 employees I said that
my name is show and similarly for bottom
ten employees the command name is shir
later I will tell you how do we actually
what is the purpose of these command
names and if you look at that if you
look at these four buttons that we have
the last two button controls have
command argument attribute as well so
command argument top ten command
argument bottom ten okay but these two
button controls the top two buttons
print and delete button they don't have
command argument okay and then there is
an output label which just prints out
the message now if you look at the code
behind let me copy that
let's get rid of this code okay so if
you look at this code behind it's pretty
simple now we know that this command
button under scope click event handler
will be called whenever you click any of
these buttons
why because on command attribute you
specified this is the event handler that
we want to call for all the four buttons
and then look at this in the code behind
we are programmatically determining
which button is clicked depending on the
command now if you look at the you know
the event handler method here this even
handler method is actually taking in two
objects one is sender which is of type
object and the other object is of type
command eventargs
okay now this object if you look at this
command eventargs object e dot it has
got the command name and command
argument properties and if you look at
the HTML we have specified the command
name and command argument properties
okay so when I click a button what
happens these even handler get fired I
mean this event handler will handle that
event and then whatever is the command
name and argument that you have
specified here will then be passed into
this object and then I am using that
objects properties to determine which
button they have clicked and what do I
have to do okay so if the command name
is print so if you look at this for the
print button the command name is print
so we know that's you know that's one
way to figure out they have clicked the
print button similarly if they click the
delete button then command name will be
delete so you click the delete button we
are using the simple switch case
statement here and then if you look at
top 10 and bottom 10 employees I mean we
have a but two buttons show top 10 show
bottom 10 employees if you look at those
two buttons both for both the buttons
the command name is show so it gets
whether you click top 10 employees or
bottom 10 employees
buttons it gets into this block and look
at this here I'm using another property
of this command event args object which
is nothing but command argument what is
this command argument whatever you have
specified here so here we have specified
command arguments top 10 and the command
argument for bottom 10 employees as
bottom 10 so now I am using the command
argument 2 to figure out which button
the user has clicked so if a dot command
argument and if you look at this command
argument in the intelligence it so shows
that it's an object data type so we need
to convert that to string before we
compare it to a string so if the command
argument is equal to top 10 then we know
that the user has clicked the top ten
employees button so we will show that
message otherwise we say he click the
bottom 10 employees so this way we can
actually look at this now I have four
button controls on this platform but how
many even handler methods do I have I
just have one event handler method
within this one method I'm handling the
click events I mean the command events
of all the four button controls and then
I am determining what to do based on the
command name and command argument
properties of the button control okay so
obviously now as you might expect when
we run this when we click actually let's
put a breakpoint so that you will
understand what actually is happening so
we will put a breakpoint in the command
name there run the application and now
as soon as I click the print button you
know the command name will be look at
this when I click the print button
so obviously command name will be print
so it comes here and then prints that
message so I press f5 and we should see
that you clicked print button and
similarly if I click show top 10
employees so command name is show it
comes into this case statement so let's
press f10 now so it comes into this case
statement and then command all
demanded cut it's now checking the
command argument so if you look at this
command arguments top 10 ok and top 10
is equal to top 10 so it's going to
print this out so plus a 5 and we should
see you click show top 10 employees
button so basically if you want to us if
you have you know multiple button
controls and then you have only one even
in the method and you want to
programmatically determine which button
is clicked we can make use of this
command event along with the command
name and command argument properties so
if you have multiple button controls on
a webform and if you want to
programmatically determine which button
control is clicked we can make use
command event along with the command
name and command argument properties
command event makes it possible to have
a single event handler method responding
to the click event of multiple button
controls and that's what we have just
seen the command event command name and
command argument properties these are
extremely useful when actually working
with data bound controls like repeater
grid View data lists you know we'll be
talking about these three data bind data
bound controls in a later video session
