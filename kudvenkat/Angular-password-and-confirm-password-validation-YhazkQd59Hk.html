in this video we'll discuss how to
compare password and confirm password
fields and validate if they are equal if
they are not equal we want to display
this validation error message password
and confirm password does not match this
is commonly called Crossfield validation
in angular we cannot use the built in
angle of validators to perform cross
validation so let's create a custom
validator to use a custom validator in
template driven forms we create the
validator as a director we discuss
creating custom validator and a
directive in parts 25 and 26 of this
video series this video gives us a
little more experience creating custom
validators and directives will make this
custom validator a reusable validator
so we could use it to compare any two
input fields for equality for example we
can use the same custom validator to
compare if email and confirm email
fields are equal here is of a great
employee form at the moment we don't
have password and confirm password
fields so let's include them on our form
let's place our password and confirm
password fields just after this employee
photo part image field here is our
password field notice we are using an
input element we have given it the name
password we are also using the ng model
directive and we are also using the
angular built-in required well data and
we are using angular touched invalid and
required properties along with bootstrap
classes for styling and displaying
required validation error message and
here is our confirm password field and
again this HTML is very similar to what
we have on the password field except
that here we named our field confirm
password now this is all standard stuff
that we have discussed so far in this
video series nothing related to
Crossfield validation is going on here
so let's see what changes and then take
a quick look at the browser notice now
we have password and confirm password
fields if I attach the password field
and leave it we get the required
validation
and same is the case with confirm
password at a moment we don't have
Crossfield validation in place so if we
type non matching passwords notice we
don't get any validation error so let's
see how to implement this we are going
to create a custom validator
let's place the custom validator in its
own file and I'm going to place that
file in the shared folder so let's right
click on the shared folder add a new
file and I'm going to name this file
confirm equal validator and we know we
are going to create this validator as a
directive so it also has a dot directive
suffix and this is a type script file so
it also has dot TS extension in angular
a custom validator is nothing but a
class so let's create a class and I'm
going to name this class confirm equal
validator directive a custom validator
implements validator interface so let's
make this class implement the angular
validator interface we don't have the
validator interface type so let's
include the required import statement to
import validator
from angular forms in angular when we
create a component we decorate the class
with add component decorator similarly
when we create a module we decorate the
class with at ng module date later here
we are creating a directive so let's
decorate this class with at directive
decorator we don't have this directive
type imported yet so let's include the
required import statement to import
directive from angular core now we are
going to use this directive as an
attribute on the element that we want to
validate in our case we're going to use
this directive to validate if password
and confirm password fields are equal so
we are going to use this directive as an
attribute on one of these two fields so
we need a selector for that
so let's specify that selector right
here notice we named our selector app
confirm equal validator now we can use
this selector as an attribute either on
the password field our
from password field that's actually
included on the confirm password field
right here next we need to register our
custom validator with the list of
validators that angular maintains for
that we are going to use providers
property and this is the syntax we use
to add our custom validator class to the
list of validators angular maintains and
that list is in this ng validators it
contains all the validators including
the built-in validators for us to be
able to use our custom validator we have
to add our validator
to that list angular maintains and this
is a syntax that can help us do that and
it's essentially said this multi
property to Drew to tell angular that we
want to add our custom validator class
to the list of validators angular
maintains notice we have a red squiggly
and ng validators that's because we
don't have it imported yet
so let's import it from angular forms
now notice of a custom validator class
is implementing the angular validator
interface so let's provide the
implementation for the method provided
by this Val data interface and that
method is validate this method is going
to receive the controls that we want to
validate as a parameter now if you look
at this custom directive we are actually
using it as an attribute on the element
that we want to validate in our case we
are using it on this confirm password
field so this field will be passed into
this method as a parameter so let's name
the parameter control and the type of
this is going to be abstract control so
we don't have this imported yet let's
import it from angular forms next let's
specify the return type for validate
method this method returns either an
object or now if the validation succeeds
this method returns null if the
validation fails
it returns this object and this object
is a key value pair and the key is of
type string and the value can be
anything so let's specify the value type
as any now I'm going to create an input
property for this directive the reason
we are creating this input property will
be clear in just a bit now I'm going to
name this input property same as the
selector because this is a directive
input property for some reason if you
don't like the name of this property you
can use an alias instead we discussed
creating an alias in our previous videos
in this series but I'm going to name
this property AB confirm equal validator
and this is an input property and the
type for this is string we don't have
this input type input it yet so let's
import it from angular Co now we're
going to use this input field to pass in
the name of the field that we want to
compare confirm password field width now
notice we are using this directive as an
attribute on the confirm password field
right here now we want to compare the
value and confirm password field with
the value in password field so we are
going to use this input property to pass
the name of the password field so
instead of having the name of the
control hard-coded within our validator
we are going to pass the name of the
control that we want to compare this
confirm password field with to this
input parameter so let's specify the
name of the password field as a value
for this input parameter now we can use
this input property within our validate
method to get a reference to this
password field so within our validate
method let's create a constant and I'm
going to call it control to compare and
that equals to the control that is
coming into a validate method as a
parameter and this control is nothing
but the confirm password field we
that's the field on which we have our
directive used as an attribute so the
confirm password field is coming into
this method as input parameter on that
I'm going to call parent so what is the
parent of this confirm password field
the parent for the confirm password
field is the route form element okay so
we are going to the root element and
from there we are going to get our
password field now you might be
wondering why do we have to go you know
from the password field to the root and
then try to find the password field
isn't there an easy way to find the
password field I don't think so because
these are sibling nodes so we have to go
up one level and then find the password
field that's the reason we are using the
parent property and on that we are going
to use the get method and we know we
have said this input property to the
name of the password field so we can use
that property to get the name of the
password field so now within this
constant we have a password field so all
that is left now is to check whether the
values in password and confirm password
fields are equal if they are then we
return a null indicating validation
succeeded otherwise we return an object
with the key value pair indicating
validation has failed so this if
statement right here checks if this
control to compare is true thee and the
value in that is not equal to the value
in control so this control is the
confirm password view and this control
to compare is the password field if they
are not equal then we want a signal
validation has failed so we are
returning this object and remember the
return type of this method can either be
an object or an now an object if the
validation has failed with a key value
pair so the key here is a string not
equal and a value can be anything I am
returning a boolean true now if they are
equal then what we want to do is simply
return now now we can use this key not
equal within the view template to
determine when to show the validation
error so let's flip over to the view
template and on the confirm password
field let's make a copy of this span
element the validation error message
here is password and confirm password
does not match and instead of using the
required key we are going to use this
key not equal so the final step is to
import of a validator in the module
where we won't use at the moment within
our project we only have one module and
that is our route module so in app dot
module dot ES file let's include the
required import statement to import our
custom Val data and since this is a
directive we also need to include in the
declarations array right here let's save
all our changes and then take a look at
the browser notice now when we type non
matching passwords we get the validation
error right away password and confirm
password does not match as soon as they
match the error goes away but we have a
small issue here
notice when I delete confirm password we
see both the errors required and our
custom validation error now when we
don't have anything typed within the
confirm password field we only want to
show this required error to fix it on
this panel event let's include an
additional check so basically we want to
show a custom validation error only when
the confirm password field is touched
and when we have this key not equal on
the errors collection and when we don't
have this required key now when we have
this required key on the errors
collection then we know required
validation has failed and at that point
we want to show the required error and
not this custom validation error notice
now when we have non matching passwords
we see the validation error right way
when I delete this we see the required
validation error and the passwords don't
match we see our customer ID
genera and when the match we don't see
any validation error at the moment with
our custom validator we have two issues
here's the first one notice when the
passwords are non matching only the
confirm password field is tiled like
this now I would actually like the
password field also to have the same red
border so what's the second issue here
it is at the moment we have non matching
passwords so we see our custom
validation error as soon as the
passwords match the validation error
disappears so it seems as if everything
is working fine now look what happens if
we go back and change the password field
so we have non matching passwords notice
we don't get our custom validation error
so this is our second issue in our next
video we'll discuss how to fix these two
issues on this slide we have our custom
validator code and on the slide we have
the HTML thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
