tutorial in this video we'll discuss
take the UI support for animating class
transitions jQuery UI add support for
animating colors and class transitions
in our previous video session we'll
discuss animating colors in this video
we'll discuss animating class
transitions with the basic jQuery
functionality these methods add class
removed last toggle class these methods
will not animate style properties that
are defined in a CSS class let's
understand this with an example let's
flip to visual studio on this page right
here we've got a div element with some
text inside it and then a break element
and a button element so if we view this
HTML in the browser this is how it looks
like and on this page we also have a CSS
class yeah read div at the moment we are
not using this class anywhere on this
page and look at the script file that is
referenced at the moment we are
referencing only the core jQuery file we
are not referencing the jQuery UI file
yet we have that within our solution
Explorer but we are not referencing that
at the moment on this page now what we
want to do is when we click this button
we want to check if they read that div
class is applied to this development if
it is already applied we want to remove
it if it is not applied then we want to
add it so let's see how to achieve that
so back in visual studio with no jQuery
ready function I'm going to create a
variable let's call this apply class and
I'm going to initialize that to true and
let's wire up a click event handler to
the button the ID of the button is BTN
animate so when we click the button we
want to execute some code which is going
to be part of this anonymous function so
what do we want to do when we click the
button we want to check the value of
this apply class variable if that is
true then we want to add that CSS class
to the development so let's actually
cache the development in a variable so
I'm going to call this variable
development equal to let's use the
jQuery ID selector again
and find the development so if apply
class then development dot add class the
first thing to notice here are the
number of parameters notice that at the
moment we only have got one parameter to
this function the name of the class that
we want to add to the development and
the name of the class is read del so
let's go ahead and add that class so if
I apply class is true then we want to
add the class otherwise we want to
remove the class and to remove the class
I'm going to use the remove class
function again if you look at this
function it has got only one parameter
the name of the class that we want to
remove so the class that we want to
remove is red there so let's save our
changes and another thing that we want
to do is we want to change the value of
this variable to opposite of what it has
already so within the click event
handler outside of this else block apply
class equals not apply class so if the
value is true already
then this is going to change it to false
if it is false then it is going to
change it to true so these changes let's
view our page in the browser now look at
this when I click the button the class
is applied and look at these Styles they
change immediately instantaneously there
are no animations whatsoever when I
click the button again the class will be
removed and look at what happens to the
styles they are reverted instantaneously
now what we want to do is as we add and
remove classes we want to animate all
these styles that are defined in this
red div class okay so to achieve that we
can use jQuery UI so let's drag and drop
the stick with the UI file on our page
so at the moment we are referencing
jQuery UI and as a result of that look
at this the moment we open the bracket
look at the intellisense all of a sudden
we have now four parameters for this
function the name of the class that we
want to add the speed for the animation
that's the second parameter easing
function that we want to use and the
callback function that we want to
execute as soon as the animation is
lead alright so at the moment we are
specifying the name of the class let's
specify the speed for the animation the
speed parameter can be a string or a
number if you are using a string then
you will have to use one of these three
Bri predefined strings slow so when you
set the value to slow then it is going
to take 600 milliseconds for the
animation to complete you can also use
normal which is 400 milliseconds and
fast which is 200 milliseconds or you
can specify your custom speed here using
a number let's say we want the animation
to last for 2,000 milliseconds similarly
when we remove the class the animation
should last for 2,000 milliseconds so
let's save our changes now reload this
page and look at this when we click the
button now look at that all those styles
that are defined within that red div
class are applied over a duration of
2,000 milliseconds similarly when the
class is being removed the styles are
reverted back again or a duration of
2,000 milliseconds let's look at the
other parameters of these classes so
easing so this is again a string value
that specifies the name of the easing
function to use for the list of all
easing functions visit this URL right
here and here you can see all the easing
functions so basically an easing
function specifies the speed at which an
animation progresses at different points
within the animation and here you have
the names of the easing functions and
when you click on that you know it's
going to animate on how that animation
is going to progress at different points
within the animation alright so let's go
ahead and probably use you know this
animation or easing function so that's
our third parameter and the last
parameter is the callback function the
function that we want to call when the
animation completes let's say when the
animation completes we want to alert the
message
animation complete so we should get this
message as soon as the animation
completes so let's save our changes
reload our webform and look at this when
we click the button the animation has
completed and we get the alert so here
we have used an example of add class and
remove class now let's look at an
example of using toggle class so
basically at the moment we are checking
if the class is applied if it's not
applied we are applying it if it's
already applied we are removing it and
we have written some custom code for
that instead of all this code to do what
exactly we have done just now we can use
toggle class function so we can get rid
of this variable so that's no longer
required and within the click event
handler so I'm going to find the
development using its ID my dear and
let's use toggle class method and let's
specify the class name that we want to
toggle so the class name is read dev and
we can specify the speed as well so
let's specify speed as 2,000
milliseconds again we have easing
function and callback function so let's
just use the duration for now so let's
say we're changes reload this page and
it should behave exactly the same way so
the class is not applied at the moment
and we click the button the class is
applied and it's pleasant when we click
it again it should remove it and it
happens using an animation that lasts
for 2,000 milliseconds so here are the
parameters that are common for all the
three methods that we have just
dispersed thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
