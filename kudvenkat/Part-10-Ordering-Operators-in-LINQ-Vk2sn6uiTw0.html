video we'll discuss ordering operators
and length order by order by descending
then by then by descending n traverse
all of these standard query operators
belong to ordering operators category
order by order by descending then by and
then by descending can be used to sort
data reverse method on the other hand
simply reverses the items in a given
collection let's look at a few examples
let's flip to visual studio
here I have a new console application
all I have done so far is created the
student class with these three
properties student ID name and total
miles in addition to these three
properties we also have this static
method get all students which is
returning list of student objects and if
you look at the implementation here we
have a variable of type list of student
and at the moment this list contains for
student objects and finally this method
returns that list back so now what we
want to do is sort students by name in
ascending order so let's flip to visual
studio so within our main method first
let's go ahead and print the names of
the students in the current order they
are n so console dot readline student
names before sorting let's create a
variable of type list of student let's
call the students equals let's make use
of our student class and that the static
method it contains get all students
which is going to return us the list of
student objects now let's use a for each
loop loop through each student so for
each student s n students list all we
want to do is print out student name so
console dot readline as dot name and
then let's print an empty line onto the
console so console dot write line and
now we want to sort students by name in
ascending order
so again we are going to make use of
student class and we'll get all students
method which is going to give us the
list
student objects and to sort students by
name in ascending order we are going to
make use of this order by extension
method and then specify our lambda
expression s such that s dot name so we
want to sort students by name in
ascending order and if I have the mouse
over this order by extension method look
at what this method is returning back
it's returning back I ordered
innumerable of student so let's create a
variable of type I ordered innumerable
of student and let's call this may be
resolved and all that is left is to use
a for each loop loop through each
student let's call this s 1 n result we
will go ahead and plant student name so
console dot readline s1 dot name but
before we actually print the student
names what we want to do is print this
statement student names after sorting
all right so let's go and run this
notice that student names after sorting
they are sorted by name in ascending
order okay now if we look at the example
that we have on the slide notice that
for the result variable we are using
ienumerable of student but here we are
using I ordered innumerable of student
now if I use I enumerable of student is
this still going to work let's look at
that let's go and run this okay there's
the same output so how is it working
with both I ordered innumerable and I
anywhere that's because if we go to the
definition on I ordered enumerable that
actually inherits from i enumerable so
that's why we can either use I ordered
enumerable or I enumerable to store the
results right let's look at example two
so what we want to do now is rewrite
example one using sequel like syntax so
instead of using the extension methods
in text time let's use sequel like
syntax
so from student in student dot get all
students what we want to do is we want
to order by student dot name and we want
to order student names in descending
order so I can optionally specify this
ascending keyword now this keyword is
optional even if you don't specify it by
default you know students will be sorted
in ascending order
okay and what we want to do is select
student all right so now let's go to and
run this and see if we get the same
output look at that the students are
still sorted by name in ascending order
let's look at example three what we want
to do is sort students by name in
descending order so how do we do that so
let's make use of a student class get
all students now we are going to make
use of order by descending extension
method so order by extension method is
going to sort them in ascending order
order by descending is going to sort
them in descending order so order by
descending as such that s dot name
that's it and again if I have the mouse
over this order by descending you know
it's returning this I ordered
innumerable of student so now let's run
this so notice that student names after
sorting they are sorted in descending
order example for let's see how to
rewrite this using sequel like syntax so
from student n student dot get all
students now what we want to do we want
to order by student dot name in
descending order and we want to select
such student now notice that when we use
sequel like syntax we don't use order by
descending
extension method instead we use the
order by keyword and then specify
descending keyword and you will have to
dis pacify the descending keyword after
the property name right so let's go and
run this now and notice the output the
students are still sorted by name in
descending order that's it for today
