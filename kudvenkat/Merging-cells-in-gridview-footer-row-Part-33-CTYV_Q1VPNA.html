venket this is part thirty three of
asp.net grid-view tutorial in this video
we'll discuss about merging cells in
grid view footer row let me explain what
I mean the employees grid view control
here has got four columns displaying
employee ID name gender and City columns
but to look at the footer it has got a
single column or the all the four
columns are actually merged into a
single column let's see how to achieve
this will be using TBL employee table
for this demo so let's drag and drop a
grid view control let's auto format this
to use brown sugar scheme let's drag and
drop sequel data source control onto the
waveform let's configure this let's
select our connection string from web
config file click Next
let's select our TBL employee table we
want all the columns so select star from
TBL employee click Next test your query
finish now let's associate our sequel
data source control with of a grid view
control all right now look at this by
default the grid view controls footer is
not visible so we have to turn on you
know a property to show the footer which
is show footer property so get to the
properties of the grid view control and
then scroll all the way down to show
footer look at that by default let's
false let's turn that on now notice the
footer row here you know it has got four
columns within that one two three and
four now our requirement is we need to
merge this four cells into a single cell
let's see how to achieve that found the
best way to do that is by using the rule
data bound event so during the row data
bound event when the row type is futa
you know that's when we are going to
clear that cell and then add a new
tables here let's see how to do that in
action so first let's go ahead and
generate route it abound even handler so
let's get to the properties of the grid
view control and then click on the
events icon and then let's generate the
row data bound event handler so let's
double click with an rotate around event
so here I'm going to you make use of you
know the grid view grid view row event
arguments object so if you dot Rho dot
row type
if that is equal to footer row so when
the footer row is being data bound
that's when I want to remove the cells
that belong to that footer row so to do
that I am going to say e dot Rho dot
cells dot clear so that's going to clear
all the rules that are present within
the footer row okay but then we need one
row so let me go ahead and create a
table cell so a cell within the grid
view control is nothing but a table cell
so I'm going to create a table cell
object so let's name it table cell is
equal to new table cell and then we want
that single table cell to span across
all the four columns and to do that we
need to set a property table cell dot
column span is equal to and notice that
this property obviously is an integer
property so I'm going to set that to
four and then we need to add the table
cell to the rule you know to that footer
row and to do that simply you can see
each row dot cells collection dot add
what do we want to add look at that it
expects a table cell object we already
have created the table cell object let's
add that to the collection that's it now
if we run this as you might expect
within the footer row you know all the
four cells should have been merged into
a single cell okay but then we will not
have that message in our total employees
count is equal to six beneath because we
need to compute that let's see have to
do that again that's going to be very
straightforward so f e dot Rho dot row
type is equal to data row okay so what
we need to basically do is we need to
loop through each row you know the data
rows and then count the number of
employees obviously to do that I'm going
to declare a variable you know of type
integer remember we have to declare that
variable outside of the row data bound
event because this even gets fired for
every row okay and then if you declare
that variable inside
even handler this variable gets
initialized to zero every time that's
why it's important that we declare it
outside of the rotator bound event
handler and then if the row type is data
row then we know for sure there is an
employee data row in which case we want
to increment the value of employee count
by one okay and notice this here I'm
using elsif because you know when this
row data bound the event is raised
it's either raised for you know the data
row or the footer row you know it cannot
be both at the same time so if it is
data row it cannot be footer if it is
footer row it cannot be data row okay so
just to save some processing time you
know use else--if because if this is
true it doesn't care checking this
condition at all
similarly if this is false it just
checks this condition okay all right so
let's you know go ahead and use a
variable here I'm going to call that int
count maybe is equal to zero and then
basically we need to increment the value
of this variable by one so count plus
equals one so count is equal to count
plus one and then let's use else F okay
so basically what we want to do here we
want to display a message within that
label control and look at this another
thing is we want that to be you know
Center aligned and I want that font to
be bolded out so to do that all I'm
setting a stable cell dat want dot bold
is equal to true and horizontal
alignment of the table cell to center
and then finally we display that message
okay
so let's do that so table cell dot font
that bold is equal to true and table
cell dot horizontal align is equal to
horizontal align Center and finally we
need to set the text so table cell the
text is equal to total employees count
is equal to whatever is the value that's
going to be in this variable count so
let's copy that
and convert that to string okay so let's
run this now and we should have the
output as we expected okay look at that
total employees count is equal to six so
it's very easy to merge you know the
table cells within the suitor row but we
have to do that within the rude little
bound event so look if you look at this
we are simply clearing all the cells
that are present in the footer row and
then we are creating a new table cell
object setting the column span to four
and then whatever styling properties
that you want to add like font bolding
horizontal align etc set the text that
you want to be in that table cell
finally add that table cell pro you know
object to the cells collection property
of the row object in our case this is
the footer row so we are adding that
table cell to the footer row okay on
this slide you can find resources face
