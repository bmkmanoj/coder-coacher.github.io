in this video we'll discuss properties
in JavaScript in an object oriented
programming language classes can have
properties for example it lasts in
c-sharp can have these three types of
properties readwrite properties
read-only properties and write only
properties here we have an employee
class and notice this class has two
properties age and name age is readwrite
property because we've got both the get
and set accessors whereas name is
read-only property because it has got
only the get accessor and not the set
accessor we know that javascript is also
an object-oriented programming language
so objects in JavaScript can also have
properties before we look at an example
first let's try and understand why we
need properties when we already have
public fields we know that encapsulation
is one of the primary pillars of
object-oriented programming language
properties provide encapsulation if we
use public fields then we cannot really
control on what is assigned and returned
from that public field whereas when we
use properties we can control that let's
understand that with an example so let's
create a function here under this
function let's pass H parameter this dot
age equals 8 so basically this employee
constructor function is going to
construct an employee object for us and
this employee object has one public
field age so let's go and create an
employee object equals new employee
let's pass a value of 30 for age so this
employee object now has got 30 stored in
the age public field but now I can use
that public field and change the value
to anything I like for example I can set
it to 10,000 there is no validation in
place right now let's say for example
you know I want age to be only between
one and hundred any value outside that
range is an invalid
age and I want to return a validation
error message saying so since I'm using
a public field I cannot really control
that but whereas when the use properties
we can control that so now when we
actually alert employee age we get
10,000 now let's see how to use
properties to control the value that is
assigned to a property so let's include
two parameters for the employee
constructor function and let's create a
private variable here underscore name
and let's initialize that with the
parameter similarly let's create another
variable underscore age and initialize
that also with the parameter now we want
to define a property to define a
property we use object and this object
has got define property function so the
first parameter is going to be the
object on which we want to define a
property now we want to define a
property for an instance of this
function right so we use this keyword
and the second parameter is the name of
the property so let's say the name of
the property is going to be age and the
third parameter we specify the get and
set functions
so get so this is going to tell that we
are going to define a function for get
so get : we use the function keyword and
this get access our I mean this get
function is simply going to return the
value that is present in this way let's
go age variable so return underscore age
and we also want to define set function
so set colon function and this function
is going to receive a parameter value
and what we want to do is initialize the
private variable underscore age with
that value so basically here I notice we
are setting 10,000 so that will be
passed to this function into this
parameter value and notice that we are
using it to initialize the private
variable now what is our requirement we
want to do validation if the age is not
between 1 and 100 then we want to return
an error message saying invalidate so
how do we do that validation we can do
that within this set function so if
value is less than 1 or value is greater
than 100 then we want to alert a
validation message saying invalid age
else
we want to initialize the H private
field with the value that is coming into
the function now let's go ahead and
define another property for name so
let's actually make a copy of that so we
want to define a property on an instance
of this function and the name of the
property is going to be name so let's
define our get function and the get
function will simply return the value
that is present in underscore name
private variable now we want name to be
read-only function I mean read-only
property so I am NOT going to include
set function so now here we have an
employee object so at the moment if you
look at the employee constructor
function it has two parameters name and
age let's pass Tom as name and 30s H now
notice here we're setting age to 10,000
and let's try to change name to Tommy
all right
let's throw in a breakpoint here and
let's run the application in debug mode
okay so now let's + f10 notice we are
trying to set age to 10,000 at the
moment if you look at the age property
value it is 30 because that is what we
have passed to the constructor so age at
the moment is 30 now when I press f11 it
gets into the set function notice that
and if you look at this value parameter
notice that the value is 10,000 so at
this moment this condition is going to
become true because value is greater
than 100 that condition is true so it is
going to come inside and then alert a
validation error message so we get this
message invalid age I click OK so it
comes here now let me press f10 it goes
back and look at the age it is still
thirty since I am setting it to a value
that is not within the allowed range we
get a validation error message and the
value remains what it is now if you look
at name at the moment it is storm
because that's what we are passing to
the constructor function and if you look
at this name property here notice that
it has only the get access R it does not
have set accessor but here we are trying
to change the value that is stored in
name property since this name property
is not having a set function you know it
won't set or change the value of the
name property because it's a read-only
property so at the moment name is Tom
even after pressing f then notice that
nothing happens it is still Tom so now
when we alert the message so notice that
the age is 30 now that's actually print
both name and age employee dot name Plus
let's append a space and then let's
print age now let's go ahead and change
age to something valid something like 35
and let's run this now so let's press
f10 and look at the age now it is 30
name is storm now we are trying to
change age to 35 let's + f10 and left
and again and now if we hover the mouse
over name it's storm it's not changed to
Tommy and age should be 35 because
that's a valid value it should change
that from 30 to 35 when I plus f5 notice
that we get Tom 35
so this is the same example that we just
discussed thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
