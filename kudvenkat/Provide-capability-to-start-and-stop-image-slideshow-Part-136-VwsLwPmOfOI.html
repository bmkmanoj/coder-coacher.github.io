this video we'll discuss providing the
capability to start and stop the image
slideshow that we have created in part
134 and 135 please watch these parts
before proceeding with this video
because we'll be working with the same
example that we started in part 134
notice that at the moment the end-user
doesn't have any capability to stop this
slideshow that's already in progress now
this is what we want to achieve we want
to provide the user with in button
control if the slideshow is not already
in progress the text on the button
control will say start slideshow once
the user clicks on that button the
slideshow should start and the text on
the button control should immediately
change to stop slideshow and then when
the user clicks stop slideshow the
slideshow that's in progress should stop
immediately and the text on the button
control should change back to start
slideshow and this is very
straightforward to achieve all you need
to do is drag and drop your button
control and double click on that to
generate the even handler and then
within the even handler you either have
to enable or disable the timer to start
or stop the slideshow so basically if
you remember you know we are able to
change the images that are displayed
within the image control dynamically
because the timer control raises this
thick event now we have configured the
interval for the timer control as 1000
milliseconds that's one second so every
one second this timer control is raising
the tick event and it pulls the page
back to the server and upon post back
within that tick event handler we have
written code to change the image within
the image control dynamically and now
this timer control is capable of raising
the deke event only if it is enable if
you disable it it's not going to raise
that tick event meaning it's not going
to post the page back to the server in
which case it's going to stop the
slideshow so all you have to do is
enable or disable the timer control but
you'll have to check the state of the
control before you do that okay so if
the timer control is enabled then we
know that this slideshow is already in
progress and we want to stop the
slideshow because the user has clicked
on
button so if the timer is enable and if
the user has clicked on the button
disable the timer which is going to stop
the slideshow and since we have stopped
the slideshow the text on the button
control should say start slideshow and
that's what we have it here okay if it
is coming to else bar then we know the
timer control is already disabled
meaning the slideshow has already
stopped and we need to enable you know
the timer control for it to have to
raise that tick event so we are enabling
the timer control and then we are
setting the text of the button control
to stop slideshow okay let's look at
this in action so let's go to default or
aspx include to HTML brakes there drag
and drop a button control and initially
when the waveform first loads you know
the slideshow will be in progress so we
want the text on the button control to
be something like stop slideshow and
then let's flip this waveform to the
design mode double click that regenerate
the event handler and then within the
even handler if the timer control is
already enable then in that case disable
the timer control and to do that all we
are going to do is set enable property
to false and then since you have
disabled the timer control the text on
the button control needs to say start
slideshow
on the other hand if the timer control
is already disabled then we need to
enable that and the text on the button
control should say stop slideshow so
these changes let's go ahead and run
this and now the end user should have
the capability to start and stop the
slideshow on demand so the slideshow is
in progress we are at number five six
click stop slideshow look at that it
stopped at image six now once they click
on start slideshow it should resume at
image seven there we go so I can stop it
I can start it again okay now at the
moment there are two problems with this
code if we want to add a new image to
the slideshow then we will have to
modify the application code because if
you remember you know we have hard-coded
you know I to eight here because we have
maximum of eight images here you know
once it reaches number eight image
number eight we want to reset it at one
and start all over again that's why we
have hard-coded it at eight now let's
say if I want to add a new image to the
slideshow you know I'll have to change
this application code all I have to do
is change it to nine it's going to work
but then you know while this application
code change is not that complicated but
it is still going to require you know
testing deployment you know to the build
and deployment to the production server
which is obviously going to contain
consume okay so I mean anytime you want
to add an image to the existing
slideshow it should be as simple as a
configuration change it shouldn't
require the application code to be built
and deployed again okay so that's the
first problem you know adding an image
to the slideshow is causing your
application code to be modified because
we haven't written it in the most
efficient way okay and another problem
is the new image has to be named in a
specific way you know if you remember
these image names were something
completely different but we have changed
their names to one two three and four
okay so the new image if it has some
some other name like XYZ jpg
we'll have to change it to nine dot J PJ
okay so obviously you know that's a
disadvantage because if we want to
remember those image names for some
other purpose you know we don't have
that right now we don't have those
images names at the moment okay so let's
see how to fix both of these issues in
our next video on this slide you can
find resources for asp.net c-sharp and
sequence of interview questions thank
you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
