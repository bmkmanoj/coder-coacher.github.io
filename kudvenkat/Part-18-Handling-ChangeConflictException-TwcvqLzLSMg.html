tutorial in this video we'll discuss how
to handle change conflict exception this
is continuation to part 17 in this demo
we'll be using the same example that we
worked with in part 17 so please watch
part 17 before proceeding there are
three options available to handle change
conflict exception will be using refresh
mode in them for this purpose refresh
mode enum has got three different values
which define how to handle optimistic
concurrency conflicts the first option
is keep current values when we select
this option it's going to keep all the
current changes made by the current user
in the data context object and then when
we subsequently call submit changes
method this method is going to save all
changes made by the current user to the
database overwriting any changes made by
other users after the data was loaded by
the current user let's look at this in
action let's flip to visual studio so
this is the same example that we worked
with in the previous video session when
we click this deposit $500 button we are
going to add $500 to the current account
balance all right now when we have this
piece of code executed and if at all if
there is a change conflict meaning if
somebody else try to update the same
piece of data then we know for sure
there is going to be change conflict
exception and we want to be in a
position to handle that so in order to
do that I'm going to wrap this inside a
try block and then if there is a change
conflict we are going to get that
exception so change conflict exception
now this exception is present in system
dot data dot linked namespace so let's
bring that in now whenever there is a
change conflict you know we know that
the control is going to come into this
catch block and at that point we want to
be in a position to resolve that
conflict and then save the changes to
the database table and there are three
options one of the options is to use
keep current values so let's see how to
do that so in order to resolve the
conflicts we are going to make use of
this data context instance object so
deeb a dot change conflicts so this
property is going to return a change
conflict collection object and this
object has got resolved all method and
this method expects refresh mode to be
passed as a parameter and if you look at
refresh mode it has got three values so
keep current values let's select that
for now now I'm going to write some for
each loop code here now this for each
loop code is actually not required to
just handle the exception and save the
changes to the database table this just
is going to print the current value
original value and the database value of
each member that has got a change
conflict let's actually write this code
and it will be much clearer so for each
change conflict object change conflict
let's call this object change conflict n
DB dot change conflicts so we are
looping through each object change
conflict object and then we are going to
use another for each loop to loop
through each member change conflict okay
so for each member change conflict let's
name this member change conflict n
object change conflict dot member
conflicts and now what we're going to do
is print the current value original
value and the database value so let's
write that to the page so let's use
response tort write method and then we
are going to use this member core member
change conflict object and when I press
dot notice that we have different
properties current value database value
and original value so first let's go
ahead and print the current value let's
convert that with strain and then let's
append an HTML break so the output comes
on different lines
and then to specify that this is indeed
printing the current value let's simply
print the string saying current value
now let's do the same thing for original
value and database value so original
value and then we also want database
value so original value and then the
database value all right so this method
is going to resolve the conflicts by
keeping the current values within the
data context object after that we need
to make a call to submit changes method
which is going to save the changes to
the database and then let's call this
get accounts data method which is going
to reload the data into the label
controls all right so with all these
changes let's go ahead and run this and
before we do that let's actually throw a
breakpoint on this line DV dot submit
changes just before we call the submit
changes method and let's run this in
debug mode so while this page is loading
let's go back to sequel server
management studio and at the moment
notice that the account balance is 1,000
and the account name is John Mary so
that should be displayed on the page
let's go ahead and hit deposit button so
we are going to deposit $400 which means
the current account balance will be 1500
right so let's go ahead and hit that so
it should stop at that breakpoint so
just before we are calling submit
changes method the processing is stopped
and notice that the current value for
account balance property is $1,500 now
let's go back to sequence server
management studio and execute this
update statement so when we clicked the
submit changes I mean the deposit finder
dollars button we are changing the
account balance by adding hundred
dollars now here we are executing an
update statement which is reducing the
account balance by 300 okay so after we
have loaded the data into the applica
somebody else have changed you know the
same record so now if you look at the
state of our database look at that the
database value for account balance is
700 and the current value within the
data context object for account balance
is 1500 the original value is 1000 right
so now let's actually press f10 it
should get to this cache block so we
should you know have the change conflict
exception let's go back let's press f10
once again so this is going to keep the
current values so let's press f10 now
it's going to loop through each change
conflict so there's going to be only one
change conflict because in only one
field is affected so if you look at
change conflict notice that you know the
count is 1 so we are going to now loop
through that member which is what the
conflict so that member is nothing but
the account balance field so the current
value look at that current value is 1500
data value database value is 700 and the
original value is 1000 now what did we
say that we want to use we want to use
keep current values so it's going to
store now this 1000 into the current
value property of the data context
object and then when we call submit
changes method it's going to overwrite
this 700 with that 1500 so when we plus
f5 now the balance should be updated to
1500 notice that the balance is updated
to 1500 so the other users changes have
silently overwritten okay so now when we
execute this notice that the account
balance is 1500 so that's what keep
current values option doom now let's
look at keep changes what is this going
to do it keeps the current values that
you have been changed but updates the
other values with the database values so
when we call submit changes method this
will save any changes made by the
current user and will preserve any
changes made by other users as well if
they are not modified by the
current user but if the other user
changed the same value as the current
user then the current users changes we
are going to overwrite it let's look at
that in action and then it should be
much clearer so now let's go back to our
application and then let's stop this
debugging let's and attach the debugger
and then let's change the Refresh mode
here from keep current values to keep
changes so we are saying to keep only
the changes ok the changes that this
current user has made now if at all if
he has not changed any field and if that
has been changed by you know somebody
else behind the scenes you know at the
same time then those values you know
will be stored in the data context
object meaning when we issue an update
it's going to update you know preserve
those changes made by the other user ok
so now let's go back to single cell
management studio now we are going to
execute this account statement I mean
update statement notice that at the
moment the account balance is 1500 now
we are going to detect 300 from account
balance and we are also going to change
account name - John - Mary from John
Mary so here we are updating two fields
the account balance and account name but
if you look at the application here the
application is changing only one field
that is the account balance right so now
let's run this application within the
debug mode and keep in mind we have used
to keep changes method so now let's
click this deposit $400 button but
notice at the moment the balance is
$1,500 so when we click deposit 500 it
should hit that breakpoint and stop
right there
so the account balance should be 2000
okay now let's actually execute this
update statement so now the other user
have changed two fields at the same time
ok that is the account balance and the
account name the original account
balance you know was 1500 now it is
changed to 1200 and the account name has
changed from John Mary to John - Mary
now let's go back to our application and
let's press f5 and notice the current
and original and database values for
both the properties so the current value
for account name is John - Mary now look
at this
that is the value you know that the
other user has made it has preserved
that change because the current user did
not modify that property so whatever is
not modified by the current user
you know those will be retained as they
were if another user has made changes
those changes will be preserved so the
original value for that property was
John Mary and you know the value that is
stored in the database is John - Mary
now if you look at account balance
another story is a little different so
the original value was 1500 okay and the
database value is 1200 because we use
that update query to reduce the balance
by 300 and the current value is 2,000 so
this property value is overwritten okay
so keep changes as the name says it's
going to keep only the changes within
the data context object that means when
we call submit changes method it will
save any changes made by the current
user and it will also preserve any
changes made by the other users as long
as the current user has not modified the
same fields okay so that's keep changes
now let's look at overwrite current
values so this is pretty straightforward
so this is going to update the data
context object with the current database
value so we are basically saying
overwrite the current values which means
you know that all the changes made by
the current user will be discarded
so let's actually look at this in action
so let's go back to our application and
then let's keep this to effectively stop
debugging and let's change this to
overwrite current values
and then let's run the application and
the debug mode let's go back to sequel
server management studio so at the
moment the current balance is 12 mm and
nem is John - Mary let's actually change
it to John Mary and let's try to detect
300 dollars from the account but before
we execute that update statement let's
click this button deposit $500 so it
should stop at that statement right
there and if you look at the account
balance at the moment look at that
that's the current value 2500 right now
let's go back and execute this update
statement so the original value was 2500
the account balance so that's changed
now I mean the original account balance
was 2000 we directed 300 so the account
balance has changed to 1700 and John -
Mary's changed - John Mary and within
our application we have increased the
balance by 500 so now the current
account balance is 2500 because
initially it was 2000 now when we call
submit changes there is going to be
change conflict exception so it's going
to come to the catch block
let's hit f5 now look at what happened
now the option that we have chosen is
override current values so what it has
essentially done is overwritten the
current values you know with the values
that are present in the database so when
we call submit changes method and
nothing is actually going to happen okay
so all the current user changes aren't
discarded because that's what we are
telling when we selected overwrite
current values thank you for listening
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
