am venket this is part 81 of asp.net
video series in this session we'll
discuss about a real-time example where
asp.net tracing can be used in part 79
of this video series we have discussed
about the basics of tracing in asp.net
and in part 80 we have discussed about
writing custom messages to the asp.net
trace log in this session we are going
to make use of these concepts to
identify the root cause of a performance
related issue asp.net the page is very
slow what will you do to make it fast
this is a very common asp.net interview
question and in fact keep in mind there
are several reasons why a page could be
slow we need to identify the root cause
of the slowness but before we do that
keep in mind it's not generally possible
to debug applications on the production
server and the reasons are usually we
don't install the IDE s that is Visual
Studio sequel server management studio
etc on the production server we want to
keep the production servers as light as
possible so that's the reason why this
IDE s integrated development
environments are not installed on the
production servers and another reason
could be the code on the production
server is actually optimized for release
pearls it's not practically possible to
debug the code that is optimized for
release pearls so these are the reasons
why we cannot debug the application on
the production server
now if the slowness is also happening on
the development machine then it's easy
to identify the root cause of the issue
all you can do is put a breakpoint in a
walk through the code see which method
or which event procedure is causing that
slowness it's very easy to identify when
the issue is reproducible on the
development machine but keep in mind in
reality many a times you know we will
have issues on the production server but
that couldn't be replicated on any of
the other environments so the only way
to debug that is is I mean to find out
the root cause is actually to use
tracing okay so anytime we have issues
with in the development stage
is then we can easily identify those on
the development machine by debug gain
okay but then once the code moves to the
production server and if we are not able
to replicate that issue on the
development machine then it's not
possible to debug it on the development
machine and we know that we don't have
the capability of debugging the
application on the production server so
that's when we turn on tracing on the
production server identify what is the
root cause okay so we'll look at that in
this session now usually when the page
is slow you know there are two two
things we need to check the first thing
is is it the database that's causing the
issue now your page could be calling
sequel queries or stored procedures so
we need to first eliminate you know
these queries and stored procedures
being the cause of the performance
problem okay and how do we do that if
you know what are the queries and stored
procedures that your page is calling
simply execute those queries and stored
procedures you know in sequence of a
management studio if they are running
fast enough then you know it's not a
problem with those queries or stored
procedures another way to quickly
identify you know um if the source of
the problem is with queries or stored
procedures is by using sequel profiler
for example here I have a simple asp.net
web page here I have three grid view
controls and what are these grid view
controls going to do they're going to
load data from this table and 6l so I
have a table called TBL employees table
which has got five employees here and I
have three stored procedures here the
first stored procedure SP get employees
it gets all the employees if you look at
the stories here it's a simple stored
procedure you know it selects all the
columns and if I execute this it gets
all the employees and I have another
stored procedure SP get employees by
department it gives me total number of
employees by department and if you look
at the Select query again this is very
simple and straightforward I get the
department name and the total number of
employees within that department so if I
execute this as you might expect
okay nhr 283 and along the same lines I
have another stored procedure here which
gives me total number of employees by
gender gender and the
of employees okay so obviously if we
execute that we get the total number of
employees by gender so what we are
basically doing here is this asp.net
page that we have which has got these
three grid view controls it's going to
invoke those three stored procedures and
display all the employees total
employees by Department and total
employees by gender no it's going to
display that like that so obviously
since this waveform is displaying these
details I know it could be invoking
these three stored procedures but if
you're not sure what sequel queries are
stored procedures you know is the page
calling then what you can do is you can
turn on sequel profiler okay so but
let's quickly look at the code so if you
look at the code that I have here you
know when I run this web form on the
page load all this data is being loaded
so on the web form load event I have you
know get all employees method invoked
get employees by gender and get
employees by department and if you look
at these methods they are very simple
get all employees is going to get all
these employees and if you look at that
all this method does is it's going to
call another function called execute
stored procedure so I have this function
I am NOT going to show the code for this
at this point of time we'll talk about
that in just a bit so I have this
execute stored procedure method for now
understand that this tool this method is
going to execute a stored procedure and
return the data as data set so if you
pass in sp get employees this method
will execute that stored procedure and
return the data you know as a data set
which we are using as the data source
for the grid view control and you are
calling the data bind method okay
since we have three stored procedures
these three methods are calling those
three stored procedures and then these
three methods are being invoked in the
page load okay so it's as simple as that
now
the problem here is no it's a very
simple page but still when I run this
look at that when I run this it's
actually loading and loading and loading
it's taking a lot of time just to
retrieve the data and display it still
it is not so finally it came so
definitely there is some performance
issue here it's taking more than five to
six seconds okay so how do we identify
the root cause of the performance issue
and keep in mind this problem is not
reproducible on local machine it's
happening only on the production server
okay so we need to identify that all
right now first we need to eliminate the
queries being the source of the problem
one way is to run these queries here
manually within sequel server management
studio or the the other thing is you can
actually use sequel profiler so I'm
going to use sequel profiler here and
I'll go to tools and select sequel
profiler and click connect and then you
will have this trace window click run
there the trace message will start now
what I'm going to do I'm going to run
this page once again so whatever are the
queries that are issued to the sequel
server from this webform will now be
logged within the profiler okay so once
the page is loaded we can stop the trace
and to do that use this pause button and
within this you can see the procedures
now for example the procedures that we
are looking for or SP get employees SP
get employees by department SP get
employees by gender so I can find them
there so we have SP get employees by
gender and if you look at the duration
it looks less than 0 milliseconds ok
similarly SP get employees by department
that also took less than 0 seconds and
then maybe SP get employees that took
less than 0 millisecond okay so the
queries are destroyed procedures are not
the source of the problem here ok so
then what is the source of the problem
how do we identify that so we know that
it's the application code which is
causing the issue so I'm going to go to
my code and I'm going to turn tracing on
and how do we set tracing on I just go
to the page directive and set the trace
element to true so trace is equal to to
true okay that's it let's go ahead and
run this and if you remember the trace
message will actually show how long each
event is taking to be processed we have
discussed about this one
and part 79 of this video series so if
you look at this one these are the page
level events okay all the events are
executing fine but then there is one
event here which is the page load begin
load and end load look at that the end
load event it's almost taking seven
seconds there so this is the duration
seven seconds so most of the work is
being done in page load and page load is
actually consuming most of the time okay
now if I look at the code in the page
load event of this webform okay there
are three methods which of these three
methods are causing the issue okay so
how do I identify that if you remember
we can write custom messages to the
trace log using trace dot 1 and traced
or tried methods okay so let's write you
know the custom messages but if you look
at the default trace that I get I don't
know you know now it only says me the
problem is within the load event but
then within the load event which piece
of code is causing the issue I don't
know so we have to identify that and how
do we identify that we can actually use
the trace method you know the one method
or right method I'm going to use the one
method because that writes the messages
in red color and it would be easy to
identify so what I'm going to do here is
I'm going to say get all employees
started meaning at this point get all
employees started and then I'm going to
say completed so now on the trace we
like we will know how long is this
method call taking ok similarly what I'm
going to do is I'm going to copy that
for the rest of the methods okay so
let's do that for completed as well but
then this is going to be get employees
by gender so let's copy that there and
along the same lines let's copy it here
and finally get employees by Department
basically what we are trying to do here
is identify you know the times taken for
these methods to complete their work
okay so now let's go ahead and run this
now so we have this now so when we run
this we will get the time so we will
make the modifications like this to the
code and then probably deploy it to the
production server to identify the root
cause because we will have the trace
messages written so now if I scroll down
here I look at that
get employees started and completed if
you look at the time it took less than
you know one second
these are in milliseconds by the I mean
less than second and then if you look at
get employees by gender that is what is
taking time okay so if you look at that
most of the time is spent in get
employees by gender okay so let's look
at that method so if I look at this get
employees by gender I right-click that
go to definition that's the method and
that method is calling this execute
stored procedure I right click on that
and say go to definition and this
execute stored procedure if you look at
that okay because in get employees by
gender I don't have much of the code all
it's doing is you know using the output
of this method as the data source for
the grid view and calling data bind so
something should be happening within
this executed procedure okay so if you
look at this now look at that we are
passing in the SP name and then what's
happening here this is the regular ad or
dotnet code I'm not going to get into
the details of the ad or or net code
here okay but then we have one if
condition here if SP name is equal to SP
get employees by gender which is what is
being passed from this method SP get
employees by gender we are saying thread
dot sleep somebody you know put this
code here which is causing the issue
okay so now we are able to identify the
root cause because we know which piece
of code is actually causing that issue
okay and now you will remove this code
build the application deploy to the
production you know it should solve the
problem you know on the other hand it
might be there only on the production
server maybe you know somebody put that
code there accidentally that's not
present in development machine that's
why we may not have the issue on the
development machine but it's there only
on the production server but but the
idea here is to identify
by the root cause and we were able to do
that easily using tracing in spite of
not being able to debug it on the
production server okay and if queries
are slow you know there are several
query optimization techniques you know
check if there are indexes to help the
query select only the required columns
avoid select star check if there is a
possibility to reduce the number of
joins if possible use the new log
statement on your select statements and
check if there are curses and if you can
easily replace them the joins and on the
other hand if it's the application which
is causing the issue we turn the tracing
on and we have seen how to identify
which method or which piece of code is
actually causing the issue on this slide
