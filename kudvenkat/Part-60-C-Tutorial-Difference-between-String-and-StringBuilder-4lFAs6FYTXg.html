am ranked it this is part 60 in this
session we'll understand the difference
between the strings of type system rod
string and system dot text not string
builder in fact the difference is very
simple strings of type system dot string
are immutable
whereas strings of type string builder
are mutable ok so what do we mean by
mutable and immutable let's understand
with an example and then we'll
understand the advantage of using string
builder when heavy string manipulation
is involved ok let's say I have you know
a simple program like this string let's
say use a string variable and initially
I'm actually initializing this to
c-sharp let's say I want to print a word
c-sharp video tutorial from beginners
you know the way I can do is you know I
initially initialize that to c-sharp and
then maybe I will concatenate that again
plus equals maybe we will say c-sharp
video and you know you can concatenate
them like this so obviously what we are
doing here is we are manipulating this
string object we are changing the string
object many times so c-sharp video
tutorial and maybe here for and maybe
here so if you look at this you have
changed the string almost five times
initially you have initialized that to
c-sharp and then change that to c-sharp
video by concatenating this word and
then c-sharp video tutorial for
beginners so 1 2 3 4 5
you are basically changing the state
same string object 5 times so what
actually happens when you change it five
times ok this is what happens in memory
look at this when you first initialize
the string this this you this variable
user string to see shop what happens
this variable gets created this
reference variable gets gets created on
the stack which will be pointing to the
C sharp object initially and you would
have all these objects okay so it will
be pointing to this and then when we
have this line use a string is equal to
use a string plus video and we when we
have this line so what's going to happen
you know this object this reference
variable now is pointing to this object
so as soon as this line gets executed
what happens the reference variable you
know will no longer point to this object
it will instead create another new
string object because this train once
created this object once created it's
immutable meaning you cannot change the
table jekt in memory there instead when
this line gets executed what actually
happens is this object you know will
remain there in the memory and other new
string of objects get created this value
this value within this object will be
copied over and to that this word will
be concatenated you know in this new
object okay so now your reference
variable will point will be pointing to
this object
but then when it encounters this line
what happens even this object is
discarded in the sense your reference
variable will no longer point to that
object it will now be pointing to this
object copying that value and then
tutorial word together and then forms
this new string object so it goes on
okay so here if you look at this we just
manipulated it five times and we ended
up with Romney objects five objects and
food are actually thrown away I mean
they are not used at all but they still
remain in memory you know they occupy
the amount of memory they occupy okay so
when will they be cleaned and who will
clean them garbage collector so until
the garbage collector runs you know
these objects are going to stay in the
memory on the heap and you know there is
going to be memory pressure for your
program so obviously any time you know
when you when you manipulate string over
and over and over again you will have so
many objects created here we are
changing the string object five times so
we have four orphaned string objects
orphaned may
there is no reference variable pointing
to these objects that's why these are
considered garbage and they will be
clean when the garbage collector runs
okay but this object is not garbage why
because there is a reference variable
pointing to it at this point you know
pointing to this object so when somebody
says you know print the value that is
contained in user string variable what
happens it goes and checks what is the
value in this object pulls that value
and print set okay so this object is not
garbage but all these are garbage
so since strings of type system dot
strength are immutable they cannot be
changed once created that is what is the
meaning of immutable okay but whereas
strings of type string builder are
mutable meaning no matter how many j
times you change your string builder
object
you wouldn't get new objects the same
object will be changed in the end memory
so even if you change the object ten
thousand times you will still have only
one much stringbuilder object you don't
have lot of you know garbage objects or
orphaned stringbuilder objects because
why it can be changed it can be it's
mutable basically changeable over time
but whereas strings of type system dot
string are immutable you cannot change
them once created if you have to change
them then what happens that object will
be discarded another new object gets
created which the values we cut below
and your reference variable will now be
pointing to that new object so that's
how strings of types is to not string
gets changed they are immutable okay so
we can rewrite I mean actually if we
print this as you expect we get that C
sharp video tutorial for beginners
message
so let's print that so as we expect we
get that now to make this program a
little more efficient what you can
actually do is use string builder object
okay so instead of using
you know the string we use string
builder and string builder class you
know the string class is actually
present in system namespace but whereas
string builder is present in system or
text namespace so let's include that and
then instead of using string I'm gonna
say string builder okay so user string
is equal to new string builder and there
are several overloaded versions of this
constructor so I'm going to use the
version which takes in a string object
and create that and obviously if it is a
string builder object you cannot use
plus equals to concatenate those strings
instead what you need to do is there is
a method called append so we need to use
that append method so when we use the
append method we can concatenate the
strings together let's do the same thing
for the other things that we have
okay and finally if you want the string
representation of that string builder
object we use the two string method and
now when you run this program as you
might expect there wouldn't be any
change in the output except that we are
programmable to form a little better now
it doesn't create unnecessary you know
string objects the orphan string objects
so anytime there is heavy manipulation
of strings involved always use string
builder rather than strings because it's
good for bit performance you don't end
up the plot of orphaned string objects
on the heap so a string builder objects
are mutable they offer better
performance than string objects of types
is to not strain when heavy string
manipulation is involved okay just
imagine I just want to show you a very
simple program let's say I have a
program like this maybe string user
string is equal to string dot empty
initially we are creating an empty
string so one string object gets created
in the heap and then there is a loop
like this for int I is equal to 1 maybe
I less than or equal to 10,000 I plus
plus and what we are basically doing
here is user strength plus equals you
know I want to add to that the number
and then a space so what's going to
happen now we are going to add numbers 1
space 2 space 3 space for until 10,000
into the string variable and finally we
will just print that now as you might
expect now since strings of type system
dot strength are immutable how many
objects do you think gets created there
are like two thousand I'm in 20 thousand
ten thousand objects get created okay
ten thousand one in fact because we have
this object already created here and out
of these ten thousand one objects we
will use only one string object the
other 9999 or objects or ten thousand
or orphaned we no longer use them they
are just there sitting and floating on
the hip waiting for the garbage
collected to run and destroy them until
then the program will be under severe
memory pressure so when we run this you
know as you might expect it prints those
numbers but just imagine how many an
orphaned string objects get created on
the heap so that's why when heavy string
manipulation is involved always use
strings of type system dot text string
builder rather than strings of type
system strain so to brief up in summary
you know there are basically three
differences between system not string
and system dot text string builder okay
strings of type system not string or
present in system but string name space
where a string builder is present in
system dot txt or string builder
namespace and one of the main
differences is strings of type system
strength are immutable
there are string will the strings are
mutable and because of which we have
better performance using stringbuilder
objects over system dot string if there
is heavy string manipulation as involved
so this diagram should give you a very
good idea about what we mean by mutable
and immutable immutable means you can
change them in place those objects can
be changed once created
they're as immutable means they cannot
be changed if you have to change them
you have you will end up creating
another object on this slide you can
