this video we'll discuss what happens if
the binding does not provide security
and you have explicitly set protection
level other than none this is
continuation to part 48 so please watch
what 48 before proceeding in part 48 we
discussed using this protection level
named parameter it can take any of these
three values non sign encrypt and sign
so what happens if the binding does not
provide security and you have explicitly
set protection level other than not an
exception will be thrown let's
understand this with an example
we'll be working with the same example
that we worked with in the previous
session so if you look at the hello
service contract here it has got three
operation contracts and if you look at
these two operation contracts right here
notice that we have set protection level
explicitly other than none for these two
operation contracts and then within the
conflict file if you look at the binding
we are using we are using WS HTTP
binding out-of-the-box security is
enabled for WS HTTP binding so when I
run this WCF service look at that the
service host get started without any
problem now let's change the binding to
basic HTTP binding out-of-the-box
security is not enabled for basic HTTP
binding although we can able we can
enable it if required okay so for basic
HTTP binding security is not enabled and
within the service contract we have used
this protection level name the parameter
to enforce the minimum level of security
that we require for this operation
contract and for this operation contract
so here we want the messages to be just
digitally signed here we want the
message is to be signed and encrypted as
well okay but the binding does not you
know provide security the security is
not enabled for basic HTTP binding now
when I build the solution look at within
the status bar bill succeeded so we
don't get any compilation errors but
then when it tries to start the service
host look at that there is an invalid
operation exception and look at the
error message what it says that
twist message must be protected this is
required by an operation of the contract
the protection must be provided by the
binding but the basic HTTP binding it
doesn't have security enable by default
and that's why we have that exception
there so if you enforce minimum level of
protection using the production level
named parameter then you will have to
use a binding that provides at least
that minimum level of protection
otherwise you will have an exception
so in general production level parameter
is used to enforce the minimum level of
protection required if the binding does
not provide that minimum level of
protection an exception will be thrown
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
