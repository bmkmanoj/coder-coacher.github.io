am Frank ed this is part 14 of asp.net
could view tutorial in this video we'll
discuss about conflict detection
property of sequel data source control
please watch part 13 of the asp.net view
tutorial before proceeding with this
video let's flip to sequel server
management studio so I have this table
TBL employee with some sample data I
want to display this data within the
grid view control so let's flip to
visual studio drag-and-drop grid view
control let's auto format that let's
choose brown sugar scheme let's drag and
drop sequel data source control onto the
web form and let's configure this now
select the connection string from web
config file click Next we want to
retrieve the data from TBL employee we
want all the columns so select star from
TBL employee and if you remember in the
previous session if we want to have the
insert update and delete statements to
be auto-generated then we clicked on
this advanced button and we have
selected this option generate insert
update and delete statements and then
for now let's leave this use of domestic
concurrency check box unchecked and
click OK let's click Next test your
query click finish now let's associate
the sequel data source control with this
grid view control so and since we have
insert update and delete statements
auto-generated we can enable the grid
view to delete rows so enable deleting
let's check that so obviously delete
button will be visible okay now let's
run this as it stands and remember when
we were configuring the sequel data
source control we didn't select the
check box use optimistic concurrency
okay so since that check box was
unchecked you know remember that and
then look at the delete command it's
pretty simple and straightforward delete
from TBL employee where employee ID is
equal to add employee ID so employee ID
is the primary key for this column so
when somebody clicks this delete button
now the delete statement that's
generated is going to use that primary
key to delete that row from the database
not only delete if you look at the
update statement update TBL employee
set name is equal to F name gender is
equal to add gender city is equal to add
city where employee ID is equal to add
employee ID again the primary key of
that column I mean of the table is used
to match that draw okay now just imagine
what's going to happen now if you look
at the state of the data here in the
grid we control when we loaded this from
the table this is how the data was now
while I am looking at this data somebody
else can go and change the data in the
table for example let's now update if we
look at the employee with ID is equal to
his name at the moment is John but
somebody issues issued this update query
and changed the name of the person with
employee ID is equal to two so now it's
changed to Johnny but if you look at the
grid view control
it is still John now if I'm going to
delete this job you know without even
knowing that somebody has updated that
row I'm going to delete this row okay
similarly if I have an edit button
I would edit that and you know maybe I
change from Johnny to maybe J ok if I if
I change it to J and then if I update I
might be over writing the changes with
somebody else have done ok so basically
this is a concurrency problem so what
should happen if two users try to update
the same data at the same time ok so
obviously you know if if somebody
somebody else has changed the data and
then when I try to update it you know I
should get a message stating that you
know somebody else has changed data or I
should get that new data and display
that in the grid view control so that
based on that I would either on you know
don't change the data or don't delete
the data now look at this since the data
is changed now and if I click this
delete button I'm going to delete a
John's record without even realizing
that somebody has changed his name ok so
that's basically
concurrency problem so how can we avoid
these concurrency related issues by
using that optimistic concurrency so
let's see what is going to happen if I
choose that checkbox ok so let's go and
reconfigure this equal data source
control let's click Next on the Advanced
tab I'm going to choose this option use
optimistic concurrency I'm going to
click OK click Next and then
now let's flip this waveform to the
source mode and look at the generated
delete and update queries now instead of
just matching up the primary key in the
where clause look at this
they lead from TBL employee where
employee ID is equal to at original
employee ID and look at that name is
equal to at original name so the name
should be equal to the original meaning
the name should be equal to what it was
when we actually loaded the data into
the grid view control if it doesn't
match then you know this the condition
and the where Clause is not met so the
rule will not be updated okay similarly
not only name you know we have other
columns as well gender and city and we
have another you know or clause here or
name is null and original name is not so
if that name has become now then the
original name should also be now okay
similarly gender and city and the same
is the case with update even when you
try to update it's going to match the
value suit with original value so if
they have changed you know then the
where clause will not match and the
update statement will not go through
okay so let's see what happens now so
let's run this as it stands and if you
look at the state of the data at the
moment we have around six five records
now let's change it david dave' so I'm
going to say that's going to be employee
86 let's update that now let's select
the data back so david has changed it
today and if you look at the data and
the grid view control it still says
david now let me try to delete this and
see what's going to happen pay close
attention today what happens on the
screen look at that it didn't delete the
row it simply refreshed it loaded the
grid we control with you know the new
data so what happened when I hit this
delete button you know this query was
sent to the database the delete query
since the where clause did not match new
row was updated and then the grid view
simply refreshed with new data okay so
basically when that happens you know
look at this there could be problems you
know if somebody changes the data we are
not deleting the data
okay so if that happens then we want to
display this message employee with
employee role with employee ID is equal
to one is not deleted due to date beta
conflict and I want that to be in red
color and if we successfully delete the
row then I want to say employee row with
the employee ID whatever is successfully
deleted let's see how to achieve this to
achieve this obviously we can make use
of that true data bound event of the
gridview control okay so how do i
generate the event handler for rotator
bound event right click on the grid we
control select properties and then click
on that lightning bolt symbol the events
icon and then row actually it's not true
data bound event we can make use of this
row deleted event so when this event is
actually raised this event is raised
when the row is deleted from the grid
view control okay so after the row is
deleted that's when this event is raised
so I can make use of that event and then
within the even handler we have this
grid view deleted eventargs object
coming in as a parameter and this object
has caught a parameter Y dot affected
rows so if this affected rows count is
greater than zero then we know for sure
a row is deleted otherwise you know we
know no row was deleted so that's a clue
for us to detect whether the row in
question is deleted or not and just to
speed things up I have this code already
typed so let me copy that and paste it
within this even handler so if you look
at that let's actually have an able
control on to the waveform so that we
can display that message there so let's
drag and drop a label control
and let's get rid of the text property
and then let's set font bold is equal to
true and let's change the ID of this one
to LBL message okay so if you look at in
the code-behind file within the rule
deleted even so when this event will be
raised this event will be raised after
the row has been deleted okay so we are
setting LBL message that visible is
equal to true and then we are saying if
a dot effected Rose is greater than zero
okay meaning rules have been deleted at
that point what are we doing label
message to a text employee row with
employee ID is equal to look at that
since I want employee ID in double
quotes I'm using an escape sequence of
backslash and a double quote so that's
the escape sequence character and look
at this how am I getting you know that
the employee ID again I'm making use of
the keys property there edad keys
remember the primary key for this table
is employee ID okay employee ID column
so we are using the keys property and
then retrieving you know employee ID and
converting that to string and then again
appending that to another double quote
and then is successfully deleted and we
are setting the full color to navy else
if the affected rows count is you know
basically if it's not greater than zero
then we know that no row has been
deleted in which case we are saying
employee row with employee ID is equal
to whatever is not deleted due to data
conflict we know for sure the data has
changed and that's why you know the
conditions in the where clause dint
match and neuro was deleted and we are
setting the color to red so let's go
ahead and run this now and see what's
going to happen if we get the messages
as expected so basically that's the
state of the data now now without
changing any data if I delete the row
look at that that row is deleted
employee
tidy is equal to four is successfully
deleted now let's change pants name to
pee okay and that's employee eighty-five
so let's update that and obviously if
you look at the data within the table so
Pam's name is P but then in the grid we
control it spam let's delete that look
at that employee robit' employee IDs
equal five is not deleted due to data
conflicts so we get the message as
expected
all right on this slide you can find the

it for today thank you for listening
