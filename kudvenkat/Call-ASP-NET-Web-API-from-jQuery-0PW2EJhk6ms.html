API tutorial in this video we'll discuss
how to call a speed or net web api
service using jQuery AJAX so here is
what we want to do we want to design a
very simple HTML page with two buttons
and an unordered list as you can see
here when we click this get all
employees button we want to call the
asp.net web api service using jQuery
AJAX retrieve the employee details and
then display the first and last name
within the unordered list when we click
this Clear button we want to clear the
unordered list so let's see how to
achieve this let's flip to visual studio
the first thing that we want to do here
is add an HTML page to our employee
service project so let's right click on
the project add and we want to add an
HTML page
let's name the page employees dot HTML
we are going to use jQuery to call the
asp.net web api service so we need to
reference jQuery on this page with in
order its folder we've got jQuery so
let's drag and drop this on the
employees dot HTML page within our body
section we need two buttons and an
unordered list so let's include the HTML
markup required for that so let's
include an input element let's give it
an ID let's call it BTN and the type is
button value on the button is get all
employees let's make another copy of
this button the ID of this button is
button clear the value on the button is
clear and finally we need an unordered
list let's give it an ID let's call it
unordered list employees
and within the head section let's
include another section for script we
are going to use this section to write
the jQuery code to call our asp.net web
api service so when the document is
ready we want to execute some code which
is going to be part of this anonymous
function so the first thing that we want
to do here is find this unordered list
using its ID so let's use the jQuery ID
selector which is hash finally unordered
list and then we are going to store the
reference in a variable let's call the
variable employees we need this
unordered list multiple times so instead
of finding it in the Dom every time we
are going to use this variable so now
let's associate a click even handler
with this get all employees button the
ID of the button is BTN so let's use the
jQuery ID selector again find the button
and then wire up click event handler so
when we click the button we want to
execute some code which is going to be
part of this anonymous function so when
we click the button what do we want to
do we want to call the asp.net web api
service using jQuery AJAX so let's use
the jQuery AJAX function and we'll have
to specify a few options to be able to
call the asp.net web api service so
first we have to tell the type of
requests that we want to issue we want
to issue a get request so type is going
to be get
and the next thing is we want to specify
the URL for our asp.net Web API service
so notice the HTML page and the asp.net
Web API service both of them are in the
same project so we can use relative URLs
or the full URI I'm going to use
relative URL so the URL here for our
services API for slash employees and
then when the service returns data we
are expecting JSON data so let's tell
that by using data type option so the
type of data that we are expecting is
JSON when the request completes
successfully we want to execute some
code which is going to be part of this
success function so when the request
completes the data will be passed to
this anonymous function so what do we
want to do with the data we want to loop
through each employee object retrieve
their first and last name and then
display their full name within the
unordered list like this but before that
we want to clear if at all if there is
anything within this unordered list so
what we are going to do here is find the
unordered list employees and then empty
it out and now let's use the jQuery for
each function and then we want to
iterate over the data and as we are
iterating over we want to execute some
code which is going to be part of this
anonymous function so to this function
the index of the employee object and the
employee object itself are passed okay
so what do we want to do with the
employee object we want to retrieve the
full name so first let's create a
variable full name equals we have the
employee object that we are currently
iterating over in this variable so value
dot first-name plus we need a space
and then their last name so value dot
last name so we have their full name so
what do we want to do with this full
name we want to display that within the
unordered list and let's find the
unordered list so this variable is
already having a reference for that so
unordered list dot append we want to
append a list item Ally and the text
within the list item is going to be full
name which we have in this variable and
then we want to close the list item all
right so that's what we want to do when
we click get all employees pattern now
we need to associate to event handler
for the Clear button as well and the ID
for the Clear button is BT and clear so
let's again use the jQuery ID selector
find the Clear button and wire up click
event handler when we click the button
we want to execute some code which is
going to be part of this anonymous
function so what do we want to do when
we click the button we want to clear the
unordered list so we have the variable
on that let's call empty function
let's give our solution I build build
succeeded let's run the project by
pressing ctrl f5 but we click this get
all employees button notice we get the
employee details as expected when we
click the Clear button the unordered
list is cleared here is the HTML and DJ
very good that we just discussed in this
example both the client that is the HTML
page which contains our jQuery code and
the asp.net web api service they are
present in the same project that is our
employee service project so the Ajax
call is working as expected but if these
two are present in different projects
that is if the client is present in a
different project and if the web web a
service is present in a different
project then the Ajax call wouldn't work
in our next video we'll discuss the
reasons why the Ajax call wouldn't work
if the client and web api service are in
two different projects and we'll also
discuss how to get it to work so please
stay tuned thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
