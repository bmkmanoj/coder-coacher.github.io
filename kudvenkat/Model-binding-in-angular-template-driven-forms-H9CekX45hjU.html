in this video we'll discuss binding
angular form to our own model class
along the way we'll also discuss how to
fix one of the common error that we get
when exporting ng model directive to a
local template reference variable the
error that we get is this cannot assign
to a reference a variable we'll discuss
what causes this error and how to fix it
here is the project that we've been
working with so far in this video series
at a moment of a create employee
component is using the angular
auto-generated form model now if we take
a look at the models folder notice we
have this file employee dot model dot TS
and here we have employee class and what
we want to do is use the employee class
as the model for our create employee
component so the first step is to import
this employee class within our create
employee component so let's go to create
employee component type script class and
then let's import the employee class
from employee dot model tortillas file
within the models folder next within our
create employee component class let's
create a property I'm going to place
that property just before the
department's property let's name the
property employee and the type for this
property is going to be the employee
type which we have just imported
now let's initialize all the properties
of this employee class to now let's
start with ID next let's set the name to
no similarly let's set the rest of the
properties of the employee class also
too now now we want to use this employee
object as the model for our create
employee component so here is what we
want to do we want to use the ng model
directive and bind the input fields that
we have in our create form with the
respective properties in this employee
class now if we take a look at create
employee component view template notice
here we have a full-name input field we
have said the name
attribute of this input field to full
name and we have also said ng model to
full name and we know what is this going
to do Bangla generated for model is
going to create a property with the name
full name and then here we are exporting
ng model directive into a local template
reference variable and we deliberately
name this local template reference
variable full name control and not just
full name now if we name it full name we
know what's going to happen let's
actually take a look at the browser
notice we don't have anything displayed
on the page and if we take a look at the
console we have this error cannot assign
to a reference or variable and we know
what's causing this now angler generated
for model has already created a property
with named full name and here we are
trying to explore this ng model
directive into a template reference
variable with the same name full name
and that's the reason we are getting
this error cannot assign to a reference
of variable and we know one way to fix
this is by giving this template
reference variable a different name
other than full name so we can either
name it full name control full
invariable etc now if we save our
changes and then take another look at
the browser notice the form is reloading
but it should reload fine without any
errors look at the console we don't have
any errors at the moment as far as this
full name input field is concerned we
have a bit of inconsistency here we
named the field full name but if we take
a look at our employee clause we named
that property just named so to be
consistent let's change this full name
to name let's change it at all the
places where we have full name
notice we have the same error again
cannot assign to a reference available
this is because we have set the name
attribute and ngmodel to name and we're
also creating a template reference
variable with the same name one way to
fix this is by changing the name of the
template reference variable to something
other than name the other way to fix
this is by using our own model class so
we want to use this employee property as
the model for our great employee
component so I'm going to bind the ng
model directive to the name property of
the employee object notice the error is
gone and the form is displayed as
expected now if we take a look at the
angular auto-generated phone model know
this name is part of it right now and it
is initialized with no value that's
because if we take a look at the name
property within our employee object we
have set it to now at the moment we are
only displaying the angular generated
for model
let's also display our own employee
model to do this let's go to the view
template of a paid employee component
scroll all the way down notice here we
are displaying the angle generated for
model in addition to that we also want
to display our own employee model so
let's first display this text of a
employee model and we want to display
what we have in the employee property
now this is the property that that is
referring to and we know this property
is pointing to an employee object which
is a model and that's what we want to
display within a view template and
format that let's use the Jason pipe
notice along with the angle it generated
for model we also have our own employee
model so let's bind all these input
fields to their respective properties in
the employee class let's start with this
photo path property so we want to bind
the source property of the image element
to the photo path property of the
employee object let's do the same thing
with the rest of the properties
notice now we have all our employee
properties in both the models and legend
rated for model and our own employee
model in a moment all these properties
are now that's because in the employee
object which we have set as the model we
have initialized them too now and as we
start to interact with the form fields
and as we populate them the respective
properties in both the models will be
updated notice this date of birth field
it is now in both of our own employee
model and it's also now within the
enolate generated for model and look at
what happens when I select a date when I
select a date
notice both the models are populated as
expected and the same thing will happen
as you select these other values for the
other input fields notice now the
department ID is populated in both the
models Department ID here is 4 and
within our own model it's also for now
we have some cleanup to do here but then
our create employee component we created
this date of birth field to set a
default date we are not using this field
anymore so let's delete that and if we
scroll down a bit and if we take a look
at this they pick a config object week
numbers are anyway shown by default so
we don't need this property we also
don't want to set a min and Max date so
let's remove all those properties at the
moment when we fill out this employee
form and when we click the Save button
we're actually logging the endless
generated form model values to the
console instead we want to now log our
own employee model so if we take a look
at this nd submit directive notice we
are binding save employee method to that
and to that method we are passing the
employee form and this employee form is
of a ng form instead of that we want to
pass our own employee model and we have
this property employee which is pointing
it to an employee object which is our
model so we want to log this to the
console when we click the Save button so
what we want to do is pass the object
that this employee property
is pointing to we also have to change
our save employee method within our
component class so now it's no longer
employee form that is being passed to
this method
we're actually passing an employee
object that's actually named this new
employee and the type of this is
employee and what we want to do is log
the employee object to the console let's
fill this form first let's launch it
browse the developer tools and then
click the Save button to log our
employee model to the console notice we
have all the property values captured as
expected at the moment the ID property
is now we'll discuss how to fix that in
our upcoming videos that's it in this
video thank you for listening and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
