am venket this is part 2 of XP dotnet
video series in this session we'll learn
about using visual studio creating our
first asp.net web application and
finally we'll learn about the different
vendors that appear in visual studio
when you first fire up Visual Studio you
will see the start page and this start
page contains latest news related to
dotnet development and other learning
and community resources to fire up
Visual Studio go to the Start menu
select all programs Microsoft Visual
Studio 2010 Microsoft Visual Studio 2010
upon selecting that you should see
Visual Studio 2010 open up and on the
start page you should see the latest
news related to Visual Studio 2010
besides other learning and community
resources at the bottom of the start
page you can see the first check box
which states closed page after page of
the project load meaning close the start
page if I open a project and after that
project gets loaded and the next option
that you have is show page on startup
when I start Visual Studio do you want
the start page to be shown or not that's
dictated by this check box just in case
if I uncheck this
I'm telling Visual Studio not to show
the startup page when when I for you
know run Visual Studio so close that and
when I open visual studio once again it
will not show the start page for me
because I have unchecked the check box
now if I want to view the start page all
you have to do is from the View menu
select start page and that should bring
the start page are so to create our
first asp.net web application it's as
simple as selecting file and then new
project so from the view from the file
menu select new project which brings up
the new project dialog box and from here
pick the programming language of your
choice I can build asp.net web
application using visual C sharp or
Visual Basic
or any dotnet supporting language so I
choose visual C sharp and since we are
going to create a web application I'm
going to select fab underneath visual
c-sharp and from the middle section
select asp.net web application and way
do you want to create that specify the
location I want this to be created in
the C Drive so I selected C Drive there
and then if you look at this there are
two things here one is the name of the
project that you see here the name of
the project that I'm giving is web
application 1 and the solution name is
also web application 1 in a bit we'll
understand the difference between
projects and solutions and finally click
OK so this should create a web
application project for us within C
tribe ok so now we have created the web
application project the next thing that
we will learn about today is the
solution Explorer now to see all the
files that make up your project you know
you can make use of something called
solution Explorer window now within
Visual Studio I cannot see solution
Explorer to view that you can go to view
menu and select solution Explorer and if
you look in the right-hand side there is
some keyboard shortcut here you can
either select view solution Explorer or
you can use the keyboard shortcut ctrl W
and ass ok so ctrl W and s should bring
up the solution Explorer and look at the
solution Explorer you have the solution
itself whose name is web application 1
and underneath that solution we have web
application 1 project so a solution is a
collection of projects which means to
this solution I can add another project
by simply right clicking on that and
selecting add new project which should
bring up add new project dialog box now
instead of choosing visual C sharp as
the programming language let me choose
visual basic so I'm going to choose
visual basic and let's say I want to
create a class library project I'm going
to leave that the name of the project as
class like
be one and look at this this project is
going to be created in sequel and
backslash web application 1 what is this
one this is nothing but the folder of
the solution itself so I want this
project to be created as part of this
web application one solution so when I
click OK it's going to add a new class
library project to the solution so
within the solution Explorer if you look
at that the solution name is web
application one which has got two
projects underneath that one is the
class library project which is making
use of Visual Basic programming language
and the other one is the web application
project which is using visual sea shell
programming language now a solution will
have a dot SL an extension now if I
right-click on the solutions you know
solution itself and when I select open
folder in Windows Explorer you should
see there is a solution with named web
application one which has got dot SLN
extension and then the solution and
these two projects if you notice the
address bar here they are present in C
colon web application 1 so in C Drive
this web application 1 is the solution
folder within that solution folder we
have got two other projects web
application 1 and plus liability one
Silesian files have the extension of dot
SL an whereas the project files have the
extension of dot CS proj if you look at
this the web application one project
which is a web application project has
dot CS prod if you remember when we were
creating this web application one
project we have chosen the programming
language as c-sharp so the extension of
this project is dot csps standing for
c-sharp project on the other hand if you
remember when we were creating class
library project we have chosen VB as the
programming language so since V B is the
programming language here the project
extension will be dot VB proj may be
standing for visual basic and another
thing to notice within the solution
Explorer is that the name of the web
application project is pulled it
indicating that
within the solution this project is the
starter project meaning when we run you
know this project by clicking this
button start debugging the first project
that starts up is this web application
project which in turn will use this
class library project if at all if we
have referenced that project within this
web application project we will be
talking about referencing other projects
in a later session I can also change my
starter project simply by right-clicking
on a project and selecting set a starter
project and look at this the moment I do
that it removes the boldness from web
application one and now class library
one is bolded indicating that this is
the starter project within my solution
so to view the solution Explorer window
from the view menu select solution
Explorer or you can use the keyboard
shortcut control WS on the solution
Explorer use the auto hide push pin
button to either show or hide solution
Explorer if you look at the solution
Explorer it's docked here if you want to
auto hide this you can use this tiny
little pushpin here so when I click that
it gets automatically hidden okay
so when I hover my mouse over it appears
and as soon as I move my mouse away it
gets Auto hidden and to toggle that
behavior I can use this tiny little
pushpin on the solution Explorer vendor
visual studio organizes applications
into projects and solutions the solution
file will have a dot SL an extension
whereas the project file will have a dot
CS proj or a dot VB proj depending on
the programming language that we have
chosen to create that project start a
project in solution Explorer is bolded
to change your starter project simply
right-click on the project and select
set a start project and remember you can
only have one project as the start
project start a project within the
solution you cannot have more than one
project I start a project
the next window that we'll be looking at
today is the tool box window so I have
this webform for example you know when
we created this web application project
obviously there is a web form which is
created default.aspx about dot aspx we
will be talking about web forms in a
great detail in later video sessions so
if I open this web forms and keep in
mind web forms in dotnet has the
extension of dot aspx and now let's say
on this web form
I want to drag and drop a button or I
want to use a button control okay I can
flip the web form into design mode by
clicking on that design button on the
bottom left hand corner now let's say I
want to use a button control on this web
form and to do that I need to drag and
drop that button control from the tool
block box and at the moment if you see I
don't have the tool box visible here so
obviously if you want the tool box to be
shown you can go to the View menu and
select toolbox from there look at this I
am I want to open the toolbox window now
within visual studio if you want to open
any vendor that's closed you go to the
View menu and select it from there
that's one way another way to obviously
is to use the keyboard shortcut and look
at this most of the vendors to open them
they have a common prefix I mean ctrl W
and then s for solution Explorer M for
team Explorer l for server Explorer and
probably for toolbox it is X okay so I
can either choose you know from the View
menu toolbox Eric or I can use the
keyboard shortcut so from the toolbox I
can simply drag and drop the button
control so I drag that drop it here and
I am able to use the button control on
my web form so to view the tool box
select toolbox from the view menu or use
the keyboard shortcut control W and X
and obviously toolbox contains the
controls and components that you want to
use on your web application project and
the other window that we'll talk about
today is the properties window
obviously the properties window is used
to change the properties of a control or
a webform in your web application
project now let's say if you look at
this button control the text it uses
this button which doesn't really make
sense to the end-user so let's say I
want to change this to click me or
something along those lines and to do
that I need to do that from the
properties window at the moment
properties window is shown here but
let's say it's not visible now how do I
get to the properties window
simply right-click the button control
and select properties from there or as
usual go to the View menu and select
properties window from there so
properties window or you can use the
keyboard shortcut control wnp so that
should bring up your properties window
and I mean just like any other window
within solution a tab within visual
studio if you want to dock that use that
tiny little pushpin and once you select
the button control the button properties
will be shown in that properties window
and let's say I want to change the text
that is visible here I change the text
property to something along I click me
finally today we'll be talking about web
forms we have already spoken that web
forms have the extension of dot aspx now
if you go back to the solution explorer
now we didn't create this webform it got
automatically added when we created a
new web application project okay and if
you look at this webform what is this
this web form contains the HTML so and
if you look at the waveform itself there
are three modes in which you can you
know change or design this webform one
is the design mode where you can
visually change things for example
welcome to asp.net training I want that
message to be shown on this platform I
can visually change it here in the
design mode or I can do that in the
source mode welcome to asp.net training
at pragya and then when I flip to the
design mode you can see the design of
that page there reflecting that change
that we made in the source mode or you
also have the split
mode which will actually split the page
into half-and-half here ICD source and
here I see the design for example
welcome to HP dotnet training at
pledging technologies and the moment I
do that and save it look at that it will
be reflected in the design and another
thing to keep in mind is that a webform
has a code behind file and to view the
code behind file of the webform let's
put this in the source mode now all your
webform will contain is the HTML the
presentation piece only the HTML in
general now the c-sharp code okay will
be present in the code-behind file and
to view the code-behind file there are
several ways one way is to obviously
right-click on this and select view code
which will bring up the code-behind file
or you can go to the solution explorer
you know behind that default at aspx you
should see default dot aspx dot CS which
should bring up the code behind file
there now another thing to keep in mind
is that we have chosen c-sharp as the
programming language that's why your
code behind file has the extension of
default dot aspx dots here on the other
hand if you have chosen Visual Basic as
the programming language then the code
behind file would have had the extension
of default.aspx dot VB and another file
that you see here is the design of file
default that aspx dot designer dot CS if
it was maybe it would have been default
or aspx dot design or dot CS now what is
this design of 5 now the code behind
file contains the code that user writes
for example on the page load what should
happen you write that code here this
contains the user code along the same
lines let's say I have this button
control here when I click this button
control what should happen I write that
code here within the code behind file
but on the other hand there is some code
that's automatically generated by visual
studio when I drag and drop for example
this button
roll okay so there has to be a
declaration for this button control so
where is this auto generated code
present that code is present in this
design of Y file now if you look at this
button control if I right-click on that
and select properties if you look at
this the ID of this button is button one
okay now where is this button one
declared okay
that is declared in the designer file so
if I open this designer file look at
this button one is actually a variable
of type 'button class okay so the
designer file contains the auto
generated code and the code-behind file
contains the code that user rights and
the aspx file contains the presentation
present that is the HTML and look at
this
how does visual studio know this default
dot aspx dot CS file is the code behind
file for this aspx page that is with the
help of the page directive now if I flip
to the source mode of this default dot
aspx page you see there this page
directive and this page directive has
got an attribute code behind attribute
which tells you know which is the
code-behind file for this aspx page its
default or aspx dot c s so the aspx and
its code behind are associated with each
other using this code behind attribute
so webforms has the extension of dot
aspx a webform also has a code behind in
designer files which are auto-generated
code behind files has the extension of
dot aspx dot CS or dot aspx dot VB
depending upon the programming language
that we have chosen along the same lines
the designers have the extension of dot
aspx tour designer dot cs or dot aspx
tour designer dot pbeing code behind
files contains the code that user writes
whereas the design of file contains the
auto generated code and one thing to
keep in mind is that you shouldn't
change the code in the design of file
because the code might later be modified
by Visual Studio
and your changes could be over returned
that's why it's called designer file
which means it contains the designer
generated code and we also we have also
seen that a webform is associated with
its code-behind file using the add page
directive using the code-behind
attribute and we have also seen that a
performs HTML can be edited either in
source or design mode or you can also
choose the split mode which shows both
design and the source at the same time
on this slide you can find resources for
asp.net c-sharp and sequel server
interview questions that's it for today
