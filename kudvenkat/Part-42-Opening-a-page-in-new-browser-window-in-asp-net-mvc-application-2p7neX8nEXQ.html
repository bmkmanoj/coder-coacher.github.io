this video we'll discuss opening a page
in new browser window and along the way
we'll discuss using you a hint attribute
please watch but 41 before proceeding
we'll be using the same example that we
started in part 4 day of this video
series notice that at the moment when we
navigate to details action within the
home controller and then when we pass an
employee ID of 1 we only see that
employees full name that's because of
the changes that we have done in part 41
let's undo those changes so that we can
view this employees full details let's
flip to visual studio within the home
controller within this details action
method let's create an instance of our
sample DB context class and this class
has got employees property which is
going to retrieve all the employees from
the database out of which we need a
single employee where the ID of the
employee must be equal to the ID that we
are passing into this details action
method the single method is going to
return a single employee object back
which we are going to store in this
object we are going to pass this
employee object as the model for
overview and within details view let's
add the model as employee object and
then I'm going to make use of div tag
right here and we are going to set the
style attribute let's set font family as
area and within this div tag I'm going
to use this HTML helper display form
model this helper method is going to
walk through each property within this
employee object and it's going to render
the UI for us to view the employee full
details let's fill these changes let's
refresh the sphere at this point we
should be able to view employees full
details and notice that this personal
website property is rendered as a
hyperlink and that's because if you
remember within this employee class we
have decorated
personal website property with data type
attribute and notice that we are using
this data type enum here and specifying
that this is a URL and notice this when
we view the page source look at the
anchor tag that is generated right here
it has the href attribute but it doesn't
have the target attribute if we want
URLs to open in a new window then we
need to set target attribute to
underscore blank since this anchor tag
doesn't have the target attribute when
we click on this hyperlink the target
page is going to open in the same vendor
let's see how to open these URLs in a
new window I'm going to make a few
changes first of all I'm going to
right-click on this views folder add a
new folder and I'm going to name this
shared folder so anything that you want
to share with all the views put that in
the shared folder and within this shared
folder I'm going to add another folder
I'm going to call it display templates
and within this display templates I'm
going to add a view and I'm going to
name this URL and I'm going to make use
of rays a view engine and notice the
name of the view here it matches you
know this enum value data type dot URL
let's click add that should add URL dot
CS HTML and then here I'm going to build
this anchor tag
let's set the HVF attribute
so the href attribute value is going to
come from view data model and then
notice that I'm going to set the target
attribute as well and I'm going to set
that to underscore blank this is what is
required to open a URL in a new window
and then the text for this anchor tag is
also going to come from view data model
so with these changes let's build a
solution let's go ahead and refresh this
page and then let's right-click and view
the page source and notice the anchor
tag right here we have the href
attribute and we also have this target
attribute which is set to underscore
blank okay so now when we click on this
link the URL should open in its own
window so what's happening now how is it
working so anytime you know we have
these properties that are decorated with
this data type attribute okay we have
used this enum to specify that this is a
URL it's going to check okay is there a
display template in the same name that
is URL and it will look for that display
template inside display templates folder
and this display templates folder can
either be in the shared folder or in the
home folder okay if it's present in the
shared folder then those display
templates are available for all the
views that's present in the home folder
then they were they're available only to
the views within that home folder okay
so if a match is found it's going to
pick up the template to render that
property but the downside of this
approach is that from now on all the
links will open in a new window but
let's say our requirement is such that
we want only this property to open in a
new window rest of the lengths within
our application needs to open in the
same vendor okay so how do we achieve
that we need to make two simple
modifications okay the first thing is
let's change the name to something else
I'm changing the display template name
- something like open in new window okay
now since the name of the template is
something else you know when this
property is rendered it doesn't find a
template with the name as URL so it is
not going to use this template okay so
by default it's just going to render you
know generate this property as a
hyperlink without the target attribute
okay but then we want to tell somehow to
the MVC you know especially for this
property to make use of this display
template and how do we tell that by
using UI hint but before without using
that UI hint attribute let's actually
refresh this view and then let's click
on this one notice that it opens in the
same vendor because at the moment this
property is not using this display
template for rendering okay so to force
you know to make use of this display
template I'm going to use UI hand
attribute and then we specify the name
of the template to use in this case it's
going to be open a new window
let's build and then let's refresh or
changes let's view the page source and
notice that we have this target is equal
to underscore blank so obviously when we
click on this link the URL is going to
open in a new window so you I hand
attribute is used to specify the name of
the template to use to display that
specific property on this slide you can
