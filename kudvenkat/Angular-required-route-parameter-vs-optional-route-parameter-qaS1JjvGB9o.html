tutorial in this video well discuss some
of the common differences between
required route parameters and optional
route parameters this is continuation to
part 43 so please watch part 43 before
proceeding here is the first difference
required route parameters are part of
road configuration whereas optional road
parameters are not let me explain what I
mean take a look at this employee
details route employee ID in this road
configuration is a required route
parameter because for us to be able to
view an employee details we need to know
his or her ID
hence ID is required route parameter and
since it's a required route parameter
it's part of the route configuration at
the moment we are on the list route to
view a specific employee details they
click on that respective employee panel
and then we are redirected to the
details route on this details route IDE
is a required route parameter and a
value must always be passed whenever
this route is activated in this case the
ID road parameter value is true as you
can see in the URL at this point when I
click on this back to list button
we are redirected to the lestrade and
notice by passing ID route parameter to
the list route this parameter on the
list route is an optional parameter if
it's available then we are styling that
respect to employee panel with a
different color indicating that we have
just viewed his or her details since ID
is an optional parameter on the list
route in some cases we may not pass a
value for it for example if we go to the
3/8 route first and then if we go to the
list route notice we are not passing the
ID parameter to the list route so since
ID is an optional parameter on the list
route if we take a look at the list
route configuration notice the ID
parameter is not part of this
configuration on the other hand if we
take a look at the details route ID is
required route parameter hence it is
part of the route configuration so since
required route parameters are part
route configuration they are also used
in pattern matching that is been mapping
an incoming URL to a named route in our
application on the other hand since
optional parameters are not part of
route configuration they are not used in
pattern matching let me quickly explain
what this means with an example to
understand this better let's change the
name of this list route to employees
let's also change it here and let's move
the employee details route next to the
employees route notice the only
difference between the first two routes
is this required route parameter ID if a
value for this parameter is present in
the incoming URL then this route is
activated if a value is not present then
this route is activated so if we take a
look at the browser notice in the URL we
don't have a value for the ID route
parameter
hence the employees route is activated
and we see the list of employees on the
other hand if a value for the ID route
parameter is specified then the employee
details route is activated and we see
that specific employee details so the
bottom line is since this ID is a
required route parameter and if in the
incoming URL if there is a value for
this ID road parameter then this route
is activated if it is not present then
this route is activated so the important
point to keep in mind is the more
required route parameters you have on a
given route the more complex the route
pattern matching can get now let's undo
the changes we have done on this list
route we know we've got an optional
route parameter since option road
parameters are not part of route
configuration we don't specify them in
the route definition right here instead
we only pass them when we activate the
route so that's the reason we don't see
that optional route parameter right yeah
and we also know optional route
parameters are not involved in route
pattern matching this means in the
incoming URL irrespective of whether
there is a
value for that optional ID road
parameter or not this same list route is
activated notice when we activate the
list route without a value for the
optional ID road parameter we have that
same list route activated and we see the
list of employees on the other hand if
we specify a value for the optional ID
road parameter in the URL notice we
still see the same list route activated
and we also see the same list of
employees the only difference is this
employee panel whose ID is - is styled
differently another important difference
is option road parameters must be passed
after the required route parameters
prefer a required road parameter when
the value is simple and mandatory for
example to view a specific employee
details the ID parameter on the details
route is mandatory and it is also a
simple integer on the other hand prefer
an optional road parameter when the
value is optional and complex for
example let's say we have an employee
search form and on this search form we
have these four search fields first name
last name department and gender what we
want to do now is pass these search
fields and their values to another route
let's call that route list for example
now if we use required route parameters
to do this our route configuration will
look like this with so many parameters
in route configuration pattern matching
that is mapping incoming URLs to in
named route in our application can get
very complicated when this route is
activated an incoming URL may look
something like this
the problem here is we wouldn't know
which value is for which route parameter
unless we look at the route
configuration another problem is this is
a search page so we may not always have
values for all of the search fields so
if some of the search fields are
optional
then what values would we have to pass
for the corresponding required route
parameters this is one of those
scenarios where
we could use optional road parameters
since optional road parameters are not
part of route configuration they're also
not used in route pattern matching also
if some of these search fields are
optional for example let's say gender
and Department are optional now when
activating the route with optional route
parameters if you don't want to pass
values for those two search fields we
simply knock off those respect to key
value pairs from the route
like that so prefer optional Road
parameters when the value is optional
and complex that's it in this video
