venket this is part three of radial or
net video series in this session we'll
learn about storing connection strings
in a configuration file reading the
connection strings from these
configuration files such as web config
and AB dot config files what are the
disadvantages of storing connection
strings in application code advantages
of storing connections shrink in
configuration files such as web config
and applet config before continuing with
the session I strongly recommend to
watch parts 1 &amp;amp; 2 of this video series
now in part 2 of this video series we
have seen you know to connect to a
sequel server in our database we create
the connection string first which is
nothing but a string of name value pairs
and then we instantiate the sequel
connection object using the connection
string and then we prepare the sequel
command open the connection execute the
commands have those results as the
datasource property of the gridview and
then data bind and we are not closing
the connection here because the using
statement will force the connection to
be automatically closed we don't have to
call that manually okay so this using
statement ensures that the connection is
always closed irrespective of whether
there is an exception or not ok but then
this code is properly latent but there
is one problem with this code that is
hard coding the connection string in the
application code this is not suggested
and it's not a good practice why let's
understand the problems of storing
connection strings in code ok the first
problem is you know tomorrow if I have
to point my application code to another
database then I need to change this
connection string so when you change
application code obviously you have to
rebuild the application and redeploy
that so obviously building and
redeploying is going to consume time ok
so that's one problem every time you
have to change your application database
then you will have to rebuild and
redeploy you if you're wondering what is
the reason why do we want to change the
database to which my application is
pointing in real time
you know constantly there is a need for
the know you know if I am testing the
application the application code will be
pointing to a testing database on the
same lines if there is you ad testing
going on then the application code needs
to point to you a T database and when I
move the application code to production
environment then the application code
has to point to the production database
or if we are just developing it then the
application code has to point to a
development database so definitely there
is a need for the application code you
know to point to different databases and
during that time we don't want to be
changing the application code because
that requires a rebuild and redeployment
which is time-consuming and there is
another major problem another problem is
let's say in my application I have you
know maybe 100 or 200 web forms
depending on the complexity of the
application you have so many web forms
now if I have to obviously if if I have
the connection string hard-coded on all
the web forms like this then we need to
change that on all those hundred web
forms which is definitely error-prone if
you forget to do that on a few of the
files just imagine you know some of the
files will be pointing to one bit one
database and another set of files are
pointing to another database definitely
error prone that's why you know it's a
good practice to store these connection
strings in a configuration file so if I
have an asp.net web application then
this asp.net web application has got web
config the configuration file and if I
want to store the connection string in
web config file you know in the
configuration section look at this we
already have this connection strings
element so within the connection strings
element I can add a meaningful you know
a connection string so give a meaningful
name let's call this you know DB CS for
shortcut database connection string and
within your connection string all you
need to do is you need to specify the
data source the database name as usual
the same connection string so I'm going
to copy this
and then paste that in our connection
string property here and then provide a
name system dot data dot sequels lines
since we are interacting with sequel
server the provider name is going to be
system dot data dot sequel of line okay
so we now have the connection string
stored in web config file so we can get
rid of this particular line here okay so
we stored it in the configuration file
but we need to tell our application to
read from that connection string so how
do I tell my application to do that to
do that you know in dotnet framework we
have a class called configuration
manager look at the name the name is
also meaning meaningful configuration
manager so this class is going to manage
the configuration for my application so
we can use that class and then read the
connection string from web config file
okay so configuration manager let's use
that class and if I try to type it I
will not find it here
that's because configuration manager
class is present in a different name
namespace called system dot
configuration look at this even the
namespace is meaningful now I want to
deal with the configuration from web
config file so i am using configuration
manager class which is present in system
to configuration namespace so import
that namespace using system dot
configuration so within that we have
this configuration manager so
configuration manager dot there is a
property called connection strings okay
now if you just use this connection
strings it's going to return all the
properties all the connection strings
because it's possible to have multiple
connection strings in web config file
but I don't want all the connection
strings I just want a connection string
that has got DB CSS the connection
string name so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to use that so you can here
either specify an integer index if I use
0 I will automatically get the first
connection string from this section
since I have only one I will get this
but then it's it's good practice to
actually use then
so that you know which connection string
we are referring to so let's call DBC s
is our connection string name and then
dot we want the connection string so I
use that property so store that in a
variable string connection string is
equal to that one and then what we do
simply use that as a parameter to your
sequel connection object that's it we
are done we have stored our connection
string and web config file and we have
seen how to actually read it from the
web config file so if we press ctrl fi
what's going to happen there I mean in
the application code behavior it's not
going to change in any way it's just
that we have written this application
you know in a good way we are storing
your connection strings in web config
file so tomorrow even if you have you
know 100 different web forms here and
then all the wave forms if you are using
database connections then obviously you
are creating this connection object but
still since you are reading from one
location to more if you have to change
your database all you have to do is
change this web.config file connection
string I change the name of the server
and the database that's it all pages are
now pointing to a different server and
the different database and this is not
error-prone you have only one place to
change and you don't have to redeploy
your application because it's a web
config file so you don't have to
recompile all right so if it's an
asp.net web application then we have got
web config file but if it is a Windows
or a console application then they don't
have web config file it's AB dot config
file I mean it's the same logic if it's
an app dot config file
all you do is you specify you know the
connection string in the same way and
you use the configuration manager class
to read from that let's actually open
let's close the solution and then open a
Windows application I already have a
Windows application that we have been
working with before so let me open this
Windows application which again talks to
the same database and then pulls that
data
look at this even in this windows
application we have this connection
string hard-coded we don't want to do
that we want to store that in a
configuration file and to do that first
of all we need to have a configuration
file a web application gets web config
by default but for Windows application
you don't get that you have to add that
and to do the right click on the
application name add and then a new item
and you can specify application
configuration file look at this and the
moment I select it look at the name app
config click add the configuration file
gets added and all you have to do is
specify the connection string so add a
m-- you know instead of opening typing
all that I'm going to copy that from our
a do demo ed your demo you should have
web config file so let's copy it from
there it's just going to open up now
actually we should have opened that with
a notepad which should have been much
faster okay here we go so let me copy
that connection strings node from there
I'm going to paste that within our
Windows application ok so we have the
connection string here all we have to do
in our code behind file is read that ok
so I don't want to hard code it like
this instead I want to read it from
using the configuration manager class
configuration manager is present in
system dot configuration and let's use
the configuration manager plus as usual
so configuration look at this I don't
find configuration manager in spite of
importing the system dot configuration
namespace that's because the assembly
reference might not be there so you need
to add system dot configuration assembly
reference and to do that right click on
you know that's only or will get
automatically referenced if it is an
asp.net web application but if it is a
Windows application it doesn't get
referenced but you can out always had
that so ant reference
and then from the dotnet tab we will
select the system dot configuration
assembly so scroll down to system
configuration and then add that so I
have system configuration click OK that
assembly should get added now if I type
configuration manager you should see the
class so in the same way configuration
manager dot connection strings of DB CS
is the name of the connection string dot
connection string and I want to store
that in a variable string CS or if you
don't want to store it in a variable you
can simply use this property directly in
the constructor of sequel connection
class and we are done that's it now when
once we run this we are now reading the
configuration information from web
config file we don't have it hard-coded
here even console application has app
config file so if if your console
application is interacting with database
then use you know app dot config file to
store your connection strings on this
