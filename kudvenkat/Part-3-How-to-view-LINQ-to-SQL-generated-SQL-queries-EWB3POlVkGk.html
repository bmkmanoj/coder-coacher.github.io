tutorial in this video we'll discuss how
to view the sequel statements that are
generated by link to sequel
this is continuation 2 part 2 so please
watch part 2 before proceeding for
debugging purposes it is necessary to
view the generated sequel statements
there are several ways we can do this
one of the easiest ways is to write the
generated sequel query to the asp.net
web page or to the console window if
it's a console application let's flip to
in studio this is the same example that
we worked with in the previous video
session the LINQ query that we have
caught here will be translated into
transact sequel by the underlined link
to sequel provider and what we want to
do is write that generated sequel
statement to the asp.net web page and to
achieve that we are going to make use of
the log property of the data context
object so basically here we are telling
to log the generated sequel statement to
the response stream so in this case the
generated sequel statement will be
returned to the asp.net web page so
let's see if that's going to be the case
and we click this clear data button
notice that along with the employee data
we also have the generated sequel
statement so this is the sequel that
will be executed against the underlying
database now if it's a console
application and if you want to log the
sequel statement to the console window
then you will set the log of property to
console dot out so in this case the
sequel statement will be printed on the
console vendor so one option is to use
the log property of the data context
object we can also use the to string
method to achieve the same thing let's
see how to use the true string method
now let's actually rewrite this link
query using the standard query operators
from employee in DB context dot
employees select employee let's actually
move this linked query into a different
variable let's call the variable linked
very equals and then move this link very
into that variable and let's set the
data source of the
control to the results of this query all
right now let's create a variable of
type string and let's call this sequel
query so all I'm going to do here is
convert the link very to string so we
are invoking the two string method on
that link very and let's write this
string to the response stream using
response dot right so let's run this
notice that the generated sequel is
again printed onto the web page so here
we are using the two string method to
view the generated sequel statement now
there is a third option as well
this dbcontext object has got get
command method so we can make use of
that method as well so let's see how to
use that method now so dbcontext
dot get command and if you look at this
method you know it is expecting
something that implements iqueryable and
if you look at the link query that we
have caught here notice what it is
returning back it is returning a
variable of employee meaning we can pass
this link very as an argument to this
method and if you look at what this get
command method returns notice from the
intelligence it's returning an object of
type DB command and this DB command
object is called command text property
so this property is going to give us the
generated sequel statement so all that
is left now is to write the command text
to the response stream using response
dot right so let's run this let's click
get data and notice that again the
generated sequa is printed on the
webpage so we have got three options we
can either use the log property of the
DB context object or we can use the get
command method of the data context
object or we can use the two string
method now there is another option as
well we can use sequel profiler also to
view the generated sequel statement
so let's see how to use this equal
profiler so we go to sequel server
management studio click on tools and
select sequel profiler so that's going
to fire up sequel profiler connect to
the sequel server and then run a new
trace and let's run our application now
and let's click this get data button and
then let's go back to sequel profiler
and if you notice so this is the sequel
that is generated so in this video we
have seen the different options to view
the generated sequel statements that's
it for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
