in this video we'll discuss the
advantages of using strongly typed views
please watch but 50 before proceeding
there are several ways that are
available to pass data from a controller
to a view in an MVC application we can
use view bag of view data dynamic type
or strongly typed view strongly typed
views we get intelligence and compile
them error checking whereas when we use
view bag of view data or dynamic type we
don't have these two advantages let's
understand that with an example let's
say we want to display employees full
name and gender in a view then we have
to pass that employee data from the
controller to the view and to do that we
can use one of these techniques in the
first image here we're actually using
view bag object to pass the data from
the controller to the view so within the
controller action method we are using
this dynamic expression employee data to
store the employee object into the view
bag and then within the view we are
using the same dynamic expression to
retrieve the employee object out of view
bag and then we are using full name
property to retrieve the value for full
name and similarly gender property to
retrieve the value for gender okay at
compile time this view will not have any
idea of what model it is going to work
with it is resolved only at runtime at
runtime it's going to look at the object
that's stored within this key within
this dynamic expression and then it's
going to check if there is a full name
property if there is then it's going to
retrieve the value of the property and
display that on the other hand you know
if you misspell this property name
instead of full name if you type it as
full name one okay at runtime it's going
to look that object that is stored you
know in this dynamic expression
obviously it's not going to find full
name one property so it's going to throw
an exception at that point of time at
compile time you will not get any errors
okay and another disadvantage is that
you will not have intellisense as you
type these properties on that dynamic
expression okay let's actually look at
that in action and speed things up I
have this exact same HTML already type
so here it is
we copy that and let's go back to the
project that we have been working with
within home controller at the moment we
are passing the employee object to the
view but I am NOT going to do that we
want to store that employee object
within view bag or object and I'm going
to use the same key which is employee
data and then we are going to store the
employee object in the view back using
that key and then within the view I'm
going to get rid of this HTML I'm going
to paste this so let's keep this view
simple so we are just displaying two
properties from the employee object full
name and gender let's build a solution
so we know that employee object now has
got full name and gender properties
notice the in the status bar it's
building the solution so let's navigate
to the view let's refresh that so here
as you can see bills succeeded now we
see the full name and gender of the
employee let's go ahead and change this
to full name one and then let's build a
solution so right click on the project
well notice that in the status bar it
says bill started look if this employee
object doesn't have full name one
property but in a bit you will see that
look at the status table it says bill
succeeded at compile time I don't have
any error checking whatsoever
and similarly look at this as I start
typing I don't get any intelligence as
well okay so we still we don't have
intelligence and we don't have compile
time error checking so now when we
actually navigate to this view look at
that when we refresh that we get an
exception at run time at compile time we
don't have any error checking all right
similarly when we use dynamic types so
how do we use dynamic types within the
home controller you know I'm going to
pass this employee object to the view
and let's get rid of this line because
we are not going to store the employee
object within the view back we are going
to pass that to the view and then within
our view I'm going to say the model for
this view is going to be
dynamic okay so at compile time it will
not have any idea of the model that this
view will be working with and then to
retrieve the employees full name I can
simply say that model dot look at that I
don't get intellisense number one so I
can type the name you know the property
name it is full name here and similarly
we want gender so model dot gender now
look at this when I build the solution
gable progresses it has started the
birth so here we are using dynamic type
at compile time this view does not have
any idea you know about the model that
it's going to work with will succeeded
let's go ahead and refresh this view it
should work now because our employee
object has both full name and gender
properties on the other hand let's
include you know an error in the
property name we don't have full name
one property so let's build it the build
has started notice that at compile time
will not get any errors so it says we'll
succeed it and will not have
intellisense as well but then when I
navigate to this view look at this as i
refresh this we get the exception at
runtime so when we use dynamic type of
view bag of view data we don't have
these two advantages intelligence and
compile them error checking let's see
you know when you know with strongly
typed views if we have those advantages
so how do we make our view a strongly
typed view we will tell it the model
that we are going to work with at design
time so here we are going to say MVC
demo models dot employee class so this
employee class is going to be the model
for this view so at compile time this
view has the knowledge of the model that
it is going to work with that's why this
view is called as a strongly typed you
look at the moment we have done that I
already have an error here stating full
name one doesn't exist let me actually
compile this and see if we get that
error and by the way to compile your
solution ctrl shift B is the keyboard
shortcut notice that we get the error is
expected so we have compile time error
checking number one and number two
notice that
as a plus dot I get the full list of
properties that are available within
this employee object so you will have
intellisense as well as compile-time
error checking when we are working with
strongly-typed we use
okay so let's select full name there
let's build the solution will started so
we shouldn't get any errors now because
full name and gender properties are
available on the employee object notice
that will succeeded let's refresh the
view we should be able to feel the full
name and gender all right on this slide

questions that's it for today thank you
for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
