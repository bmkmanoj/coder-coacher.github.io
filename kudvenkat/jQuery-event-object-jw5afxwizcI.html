in this video well discuss how to
retrieve even data using event object
and how to convert a JavaScript event
object to a jQuery event object whenever
an email occurs like the click event
mouse over Mouse out mouse move etc the
relevant data about that event is placed
into the event object for example the
event object contains even data like the
x and y coordinates of the mouse pointer
the HTML element that fired the event
which mouse button is clicked etc
obtaining the event object is
straightforward the event object is
always passed to the event handler
method let's understand this with an
example
so on this form we have this button when
we click this button we want to capture
all click event related data so here we
capturing the event type which is click
the x and y coordinates of the mouse
pointer when that click event occurred
the target element on which the click
event occurred in this case it's button
and the target tag name so the tag name
that we use to create the button element
it is input tag name so let's see how to
capture all this click event data let's
flip to visual studio so here we have
the button element and the development
to display the result and within our
script section we have the ready
function wired up
now since this button has got an ID
let's use the jQuery ID selector to find
that button and the button ID is BTN so
we want to handle the click event of the
button element so this anonymous
function is going to be our click event
handler method remember the event object
is always passed to the handler method
so this function is going to receive the
event object okay and we're going to use
this event object to retrieve the data
that we want so it this will be passed
automatically to the handler method so
what is the even data that we want to
display we want to display even type x
and y-coordinates target type and target
tag name so let's create a variable here
let's name this event
details equals so we want this word
event equals and then the event name and
to get that we are going to use the
event object and it has got the type
property which should give us the even
type and then to this lets append an
HTML break okay so let's make a copy of
this next we want
x-coordinate of the mouse pointer so x
equals event dot page x should give us
the x-coordinate similarly we want the
y-coordinate and to get that we use page
y and then we want the target element so
target element equals we can use the
target property of the event object and
then use the PI property on that and
then we want target element tag name
equals even dot target dot tag name
should give us that okay so this string
now contains all the even data that we
need all that is left is to find this
development and then display that string
within that development this development
also has got an ID so let's use the
jQuery ID selector again and this time
the ID that we want to find is div
result and then let's use the HTML
method and then pass to it this string
that contains our event data all right
so let's save the changes and let's
reload this page and look at this when
we click the button notice that the
event is clicked we get the x and y
mouse coordinates the target element is
button and the tag name is input okay
now let's also see how to capture mouse
over and mouse out event details to
capture mouse over and mouse out even
details you can simply change the events
together and
so here at the end I'm going to simply
say mouse-over
and this is going to be our even handler
function and then we are going to
duplicate all this code within this
function instead of that what we can do
is actually create another function so
with an already function let's call this
get event details and to this function
we are going to pass the event object
and let's actually take all this code
and move it into this function you can
also move this line and then within the
even handler method we are just going to
call this get even details function and
then to that pass the event object that
this handler method receives okay and
let's do the same thing on mouse-over
and we can also change similarly Mouse
out event
and again onmouseout we want to call the
same function so now we should be able
to capture a mouse over Mouse out and
click event details so let's save the
changes let's reload this page and you
know in all the cases we are passing the
event object so here you know let's pass
the event object to the handler function
and the same here okay so this function
receives the jQuery event object and
that is automatically passed to this
function and this function retrieves the
event details and then displays them
within the development so let's save the
changes now reload the page and look at
this as we mouse over we should get
mouse over even details and then when we
click click event and onmouseout we get
the mouse out details okay so this
example is going to work work across all
browsers including IE 8 and earlier
versions as well so let's actually
browse this page with Internet Explorer
at the moment the version of Internet
Explorer on my machine is ie 11 so at
the moment
look at that mouse over Mouse out click
all the events work let's change the
browser mode to IE 7 ok so it's running
in IE 7 mode now and let's reload that
and look at this mouse over mouse or
click everything works now now the
reason this works across all browsers is
because this event object which this
handler is receiving is a jquery event
object and jquery is cross browser so
this code is going to work across all
browsers now what do you think is going
to happen if I don't pass this event
object to the handler so I'm going to
remove it from this anonymous function
which is the handler for the click event
similarly I'm going to do it for mouse
over and mouse out even's as well ok so
the handler function to the handler
function we're not passing the teammate
object
and within that anonymous function we
are calling this get even details
function and to that we are passing an
object and that's called event here
right and you know we are retrieving
whatever even data that we want right so
the event object gets passed here to
this get even details function but that
event object is not the jQuery event
object it is the raw JavaScript event
object okay so and because that's raw
JavaScript event object and in ie8 in
the earlier versions page X page Y
target you know all these properties are
not supported in and those versions of
you know Internet Explorer as a result
this code is not going to work in IE 8
in the earlier versions let's actually
prove that so let's close this browser
now let's actually reload this in google
chrome and prove that it's going to work
look at that in Google Chrome it still
works
after our changes now let's browse this
with IE
and it since this is running an IE 11
mode it should still work now let's go
ahead and change the mode to IE 7
and look at this the moment I move the
mouse over we get an error and look at
this when I hover the mouse over type
you know it says it's mouse over that's
fine but look at this page X is
undefined page y is undefined
similarly target is undefined okay so
this piece of code is not going to work
in ie8 and earlier versions that's
because you know this event object is
raw JavaScript event object and page X
page Y target these properties are not
supported in ie8 and earlier versions
now for this code to work in all
browsers if you want a cross-browser
solution one way is to pass the event
object to this handler function so when
you do that this event object is
automatically take the event object and
that's what is passed to this function
since that is jQuery event object this
is going to work across all browsers and
we have just seen that that is one way
the other way is to convert this event
object explicitly to a jQuery event
object we know this is a raw JavaScript
event object and to convert this to
jQuery event object you know we use
dollar dot event dot fix method and to
this fixed method we are going to pass
this raw JavaScript event object and
that method is going to convert that to
a jQuery event object and at all these
places let's use ie now
all right so let's save the changes and
let's reload this so at the moment this
is running in IE 11 so it should still
work and let's go ahead and change the
mode to IE 7 and look at this it works
now and even in google chrome when we
reload this it should still continue to
work okay and here is that example which
we just discussed so to convert a
javascript event object to a jquery
event object use dollar dot even dot fix
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
