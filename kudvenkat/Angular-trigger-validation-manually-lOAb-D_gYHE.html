in this video we'll discuss how to add
or remove validation styles to a group
of elements and how to trigger
validation manually at the moment the
problem that we have with this confirm
password field of validation is that
when the passwords do not match notice
only the confirm password field is
styled with this red border we also
would like the password field to be
styled at the same way that's easy all
we have to do for that is group password
and confirm password fields together and
then apply the bootstrap validation
class has error so to group these
elements together we're gonna make use
of this ng-model group directive
provided by angular notice here we have
placed the password field and confirm
password field in another development
with ngmodel group directive said and I
said the name of this ng model group
directive to password group we can give
it any meaningful name we want so this
name will be used by angular as the key
for the nested object in the form model
and these two properties will be in that
nested object if this doesn't make sense
at the moment don't worry we look at
this in action
in just a bit notice within our view
template the password field is here and
the confirm password field is here just
below it now let's group these two
developments using the ng model group
directive provided by angular so I'm
going to place another development right
here and then set ng model group
directive and let's set its name to
password group and then move the close
in there right here let's save our
changes and then take a quick look at
the browser notice now in the Angela
generated form model we have a group
here and the key of that group is
password group which is the name we have
given for our ng model group directive
right here and as we type
a value for password and confirm
password fields notice those two
properties are within that group and if
you look at our own employee model we
don't have such grouping right here the
password and confirm password properties
are present just like the other
properties we'll discuss how to get this
grouping within our own employee model
in a later video for now what we want to
do is style the password field just like
the confirm password field if they don't
match so we want to apply this red
border so we're going to apply
conditional binding conditional class
binding on the group that is on this
password group so on this development
which has got the ngmodel group
directive let's apply the conditional
class binding so if the confirm password
field is touched and if it is invalid
then add this class has error to this
development which is the container div
for both our password and confirm
password fields so when the confirm
password field is invalid this class
will now be applied to all the form
controls within that group
so both the password field and the
confirm password field will be styled at
the same way notice now when the
passwords do not match we get the red
border as expected and when they match
the red border is removed from both the
controls so it's all seems to be working
as expected but there is a small problem
here notice when I delete the value from
the confirm password field you know both
the controls turned red and the
validation error message that you see
here is confirm password is required now
we do not want the password field with a
red border when only confirm password
field is required and the reason we are
getting both of these controls styled
this way is because of the class binding
that we have right here notice we are
saying that this class has error to the
group when they confirm password field
is touched and when it is invalid they
confirm password field is invalid when
it fails
require validation also and when it
fails required validation we don't want
this border to be applied to the
password field so I'm going to include
an additional check here so apply this
has error class when the confirm
password field is touched and when it is
invalid and when the confirm password
field errors collection does not have
this required K we want to check for
negation so let's apply the not operator
here notice now when the passwords do
not match the red border is applied to
both the controls and when the confirm
password field fails required validation
the red border is applied only to the
confirm password field and when they
match the red border is removed from
both the controls there is another
problem here if we change the confirm
password field after the password field
and if the passwords do not match we get
to see the validation error as expected
and when the passwords match the
validation disappears but now look what
happens if we change the password field
after confirm password field
now here both the passwords are
different but still our custom
validation is not triggered and we don't
get to see that validation error message
so let's understand why in this specific
scenario our custom validation is not
triggered if we take a look at our
confirm password field notice our custom
validation directive is placed on this
confirm password field so when this
confirm password field value changes
this custom directive is going to
trigger our custom validation compare
the value that we have in confirm
password field with a value in the
password field if they don't match
validation fails and we see the
validation error if the match the
validation passes and the error message
is cleared but when the password field
is changed there is nothing here to tell
Angela to kick off of a custom
validation because we don't have this
custom directive placed on the password
field so if I expand the password field
notice we don't have this directive
placed on this password
so Angela does not know to trigger our
custom validation when the password
field changes so we have to manually
trigger so to trigger a specific
controls validation we can use this
method update value and validity notice
here we are using event binding and this
event binding is on the password field
so we are binding to the change event of
the password field meaning whenever
someone changes the password in the
password field then execute this
statement right here and look at the
statement closely we are using the
confirm password template reference
variable and on that by using the
control property to get the confirm
password field control and then calling
its update value and validity function
this triggers all the validators on the
confirm password field including our
custom validator and that's what we want
so let's go ahead and include the change
event binding on the password field our
password field is right here so I'm
going to bind to the change event now
let's change the confirm password field
first and then the password field at the
moment the passwords do not match and we
get to see the validation error when the
passwords match validation passes and
the error messages are cleared so it's
all working as expected at the moment we
are binding to the change event of the
password field and keep in mind the
change event is not triggered until the
control loses focus so this means when
we changed the value in the password
field the change event is not triggered
right away it's only triggered when this
control loses focus notice that's when
we see the validation error but if you
want our custom validation to be
triggered as we are typing in the
password field and if you don't want to
wait until the control loses focus then
bind to the input event instead of the
change event notice now as we type in
the password field of our custom
validation is triggered we
have to wait until the control loses
focus that's all I wanted to cover in
this video thank you for watching and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
