in this video well discus object
reflection in JavaScript with an example
object or in the programming languages
like C sharp and Java support reflection
reflection allows us to inspect metadata
of assemblies modules and types since
JavaScript is also an object-oriented
programming language it also supports
the concept of reflection let's
understand object reflection in
JavaScript with an example we'll be
using this employee object in this demo
notice that this object has got four
public properties that is first name
last name gender and email in addition
it also has got three public methods get
full name get email and get gender and
here by constructing an employee object
using this employee constructor function
now let's see how to use object
reflection in JavaScript to retrieve all
the public properties and methods of
this employee object so we want the
output to be something like this so
notice that we have all the four public
properties and then all the three public
methods of the employee object so if we
flip to visual studio here we have the
exact same code that we have seen on the
slide here we have the employee
constructor function and here we are
defining our three public methods of the
employee object and then finally we are
constructing the employee object using
the employee constructor function now
let's use a for loop and let's name this
variable property in employee object so
basically we are going to retrieve all
the properties and public methods of the
employee objectives in this for loop and
then what we want to do is write the
names of those properties and methods to
the web page and let's also append an
HTML break so we get the each property
and method name on a separate line so
this change let's go and run this and we
should get all the public properties
first name last name gender email and
all the public methods get full name get
email and get gender of the
employee object now the moment we only
have the property and method names now
let's say we also want to retrieve their
values so if you look at the employee
object here these are the values for
first name last name gender and email
properties of the employee object so we
want to display the values as well you
know along with the property and method
names so let's see how to achieve that
so we have the property so this is going
to print the name of the property and
method and let's separate the names and
values with a colon symbol and then
these properties and methods they belong
to the employee object so I can use the
employee object and the property name
like this to retrieve the value of that
property within that employee object so
let's save these changes and reload this
page notice that now along with the
property names we also get the values so
first name the value is mark for gender
the value is male and for email it is a
at a comm and if you look at the methods
notice that we get the method definition
as its value so that's the you know get
full name function implementation and
this one is the implementation for get
gender now let's see how to retrieve
only the public property so here we are
getting both the public properties as
well as methods now let's say our
requirement is to retrieve just the
public properties of the employee object
and not the methods method names should
be excluded now to achieve that we can
use an if condition here if we use the
type of keyword so type of
you know employee of property if that is
not equal to function only then print
the name of the property and its value
so now when we reload this notice that
we only get the public properties
functions we are filtering them out
so if employee property you know the
type of that is not equal to function
only then right the property and its
value now on the other hand if you want
just the public functions of the
employee object change this to equal to
and now when we load this page we should
get only the public functions of the
employee object so notice that we have
got the three methods get full name get
email and get gender now when two
objects are related through inheritance
the child object will have access to the
parent object methods and properties now
at the moment if you look at the example
that we have we don't have any
inheritance relationship here we only
have the employee object now let us go
ahead and create you know a permanent
employee object and make it inherit from
the employee object so I'm going to
create another function here I mean
construct a function let's call this
permanent employee equals function
annual salary so this permanent employee
object is going to have one public
property annual salary and we are going
to make this permanent employee inherit
from the employee object so permanent
employee dot prototype equals employee
object so we already have created the
employee object since we have made the
employee object the parent of the
permanent employee
now this permanent employee object will
have access to all of the employee
objects public properties and methods
okay
when we use you know the same code for
the permanent employee object now let's
go ahead and create a permanent employee
object let's name this PE equals new
permanent employee and let's pass 50,000
s annual salary so now we are going to
loop through this permanent employee
object so for via property in permanent
employee let's remove this so now when
we run this notice what we get so now we
are looping through the properties of
the permanent employee object so and we
reload this page notice that we get the
annual salary property which belong to
permanent employee now it says the value
of the permanent employee annual salary
it says undefined why is that now look
at this when we construct the permanent
employee we are passing 50,000 as the
annual salary but here the values is
undefined that's basically because here
we are indexing it using the employee
object and not the permanent employee
object so let's use permanent employee
object here and that should give us the
value for annual salary so let's reload
this page notice that we get the annual
salary as 50,000 this annual salary
property is defined within the permanent
employee object but all the other
properties and methods belong to the
employee object which is the parent of
permanent employee now in your project
you may have a requirement where you
want to retrieve just the properties
that are defined within the permanent
employee object so if you look at this
permanent employee there's only one
property within that object which is
annual salary so my requirement is I
want to retrieve only the properties
that are defined within this permanent
employee
and I want to exclude the public
properties and methods that are
inherited from its parent now in order
to do that we can use has owned property
method so if
the object is PE permanent employee dot
has owned property and then we passed
the name of the property so what is this
method going to do has owned property
this method will return true if that
property is defined within the permanent
employee object it returns false if it
is inherited okay so if this method
returns true then we know that that
property is defined within the permanent
employee object in that case print the
name of the property and its value so
let's see if these changes reload this
page notice that now we get only the
annual salary now if you want to load or
if you want to print all the public
properties and methods that are
inherited but not defined within the
permanent employee object then you can
simply use not operator like this so
this is going to print all the public
properties and methods that are
inherited so let's save these changes
and reload this page notice that except
annual salary which is defined within
the permanent employee object we get all
the other public properties and methods
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
