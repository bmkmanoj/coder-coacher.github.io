in this video we'll discuss timing
events in JavaScript in JavaScript a
piece of code can be executed repeatedly
at specified time interval for example
you can call a specific JavaScript
function every one second this concept
in JavaScript is called timing events
the global window object has got these
two methods set into a and set timeout
these two methods allow us to execute a
piece of JavaScript code at specified
time into our set interval method
executes the specified function
repeatedly at specified time into our
this method has got two parameters func
and delay the front parameter specifies
the name of the function that we want to
execute and the delay parameter
specifies the time in milliseconds to
wait before calling the specified
function again set timeout executes the
specified function after waiting a
specified number of milliseconds this
method also has got two parameters func
and delay long parameter specifies the
name of the function that we want to
execute and the delay parameter
specifies the time in milliseconds to
wait before calling the function again
the actual wait time may be longer using
this delay parameter we can only enforce
the minimum wait time depending on the
other things the actual delay time may
be longer
let's look at an example what we want to
do is display current date and time in a
div tag
so first let's include a div tag and
give it an ID let's call this time dev
now let's write a function to get the
current date time in JavaScript to get
the current date time we use the date
constructor
we want to display the current date time
within this div tag so let's use
document dot get element by ID and then
pass the ID of the div tag to this
function and then we want to set in a
HTML of the div tag and then call get
current date time function so when we
run this we expect the current date time
to be displayed within the div tag here
we've got the date and then here we have
called the time at the moment time is
static we want this time to be dynamic
in the sense the time should be
automatically updated every one second
let's you have to solve this to solve
this we should be able to call this
function repeatedly every one second if
we can do that this function will
compute the time at that point and then
displays the current date and time
within the div tag so if we can call
this every one second
the time will be automatically updated
every one second
so in JavaScript we have two methods to
execute a function repeatedly set
interval and set timeout so let's make
use of set interval function so set
interval has got two parameters the code
of function that we want to execute
repeatedly so which function we want to
execute repeatedly get current date time
and then the delay between each
execution what is the time delay we want
the time delay to be one second that is
thousand milliseconds so now let's run
this and we expect now that time to be
dynamic on the page notice that it's
automatically updated every one second
there is another method called clear
inter valve so what is this method going
to do it's going to cancel the repeated
execution of the method that we have set
up using set interval okay so what is
the repeated action here the repeated
action is calling this get current date
time every one second so if you want to
cancel that repeated action then you use
clear interval method clear interval
method has got a parameter interval ID
so what is this interval ID parameter
it's the identifier of the repeated
action that we want to cancel so where
do we get that interval ID from the set
interval method is going to return the
interval ID let's look at an example and
that should make all this clear so now
what we want to do is include two
buttons on this page start clock and
stop clock when we click stop clock it
should make the time on the page static
and when we click start clock it should
make the time dynamic basically starting
and stopping this clock right here okay
so let's see how to achieve that
so let's include an HTML break and then
two buttons here input type equals
button and then the value on that is
going to be start clock let's have
another button here and on this button
lets include stop clock text so now I'm
going to create a function here I'm
going to call this start clock and this
is the function which is going to call
set interval and this function is going
to make sure that this get current date
time method is called every one second
and this method is going to display the
current date and time within the div tag
now I'm going to create a global
variable here I'm going to call it
interval ID
and I'm going to initialize this
variable using the return value of set
interval method so what is the set
interval method going to return it's
going to return the identifier of the
repeated action so what's the repeated
action here calling this kept current
date time method every one second okay
so it's going to return the identifier
of that repeated action in a bit we'll
understand the purpose of that ID now
I'm going to write another function I'm
going to call this stopped clock and all
this function will do is call clear
interval function now what is this
function going to do it's going to stop
you know the repeated execution it's
going to cancel the repeated execution
in order for that method to be able to
do it
it requires the identifier of the
repeated action and where do we have the
identifier now it's present in this
variable interval ID so I'm going to
pass that interval ID to this clear
interval function that's it so this is
going to cancel that repeated execution
so when we click start clock button we
want to call this start clock method
similarly when we click stop clock
button we want to call this stop clock
method all right so let's run this now
so now when the page loads initially we
don't have the date and time display but
when we click start clock notice that it
displays the date and time and the time
is dynamic the moment we click stop
block it stops it we click start clock
again it starts it now for some reason
if you want the current date and time to
be displayed when the page initially
loads you simply have to call get
current date time function manually once
that's going to ensure that the current
date and time is displayed on the page
but that is going to be static once you
click start clock it's going to make it
dynamic
if you click stop clock it's going
stop it so a very simple example that
demonstrates the use of set into well
and clear interval methods now in
addition to these two methods we also
have two other methods those are these
methods here set timeout and clear
timeout so these two methods are also
very similar to set interval and clear
interval the syntax is very much similar
and the functionality is very much
similar let's understand the usage of
those two methods with an example so
what we have want to do now is design a
countdown timer so within the textbox
control we are going to have you know
any value for example here we have 10
and then when I click start timer it
should start counting that number down
ten nine eight and then count down
should happen every one second and then
I click stop timer it should stop
counting down and if I click start timer
again it should resume the countdown
from where it has left and then the
moment the value reaches zero we want to
display it down within the textbox
control so let's see how to achieve this
now we want to achieve this using set
timeout and cleartimeout functions
instead of set interval and clear
interval so we would require interval ID
global variables so let's leave it there
and instead of the div tag here we need
a textbox control so let's go to and
include a textbox control so input type
equals text and the value on that is
going to be 10 and let's give it a 90
let's call it txt box and now let's
create a function let's call this start
timer and to this function I'm going to
pass a parameter I'm going to call this
control ID now remember the initial time
is present in this text box so I'm going
to pass the ID of this text box to this
function
okay and here I'm going to create a
variable I'm going to call this control
and I'm going to use document dot get
element by ID we pass the control ID to
this function so what is this function I
mean what is this going to return it's
going to return that text box control
okay and this variable is holding that
so now we are going to create a variable
let's call it seconds and where are we
going to get the seconds from from this
textbox so we will pass the ID of that
textbox to this function when we call it
so at the moment you know this variable
is holding a reference to that text box
control so we can simply say control dot
value which is going to return as the
value that is present within this
textbox okay and we want a countdown
timer so seconds equals seconds minus 1
now if the value within the seconds
variable is zero then what do we want to
display within the textbox we want to
display the message done so control dot
value equals done and once that is done
we want to simply return from the
function okay on the other hand if
seconds is not zero then what do we want
to do we want to display the value that
is present within the seconds variable
in the textbox
okay so pretty straightforward logic
there read the value from the textbox
okay subtract the value I'll subtract
the value and if seconds is zero display
done within the textbox control and then
return from the function otherwise
display the updated value within the
textbox okay so now we want to call this
function repeatedly and we're going to
make use of set time mode function for
that so set timeout again this function
expects two parameters the function that
we want to call repeatedly and the time
delay between each call okay so which
function do we want to call we want to
call start timer function so I'm going
to use a slightly different syntax here
so I'm going to specify an anonymous
function here and this anonymous
function is going to call this start
timer function and this start timer
function expects control ID to be passed
and we want to pass the ID of this
textbox so that's the first parameter
and the second parameter is going to be
the time delay and we want the time
delay to be thousand milliseconds
remember with set timeout function you
can only specify the minimum time delay
but depending on the other things you
know the actual delay may be even longer
and just like set interval function set
time mode function is also going to
return the identifier of the repeated
action and we want to store that within
this interval ID variable so interval ID
equals whatever ID we get back from that
function so now let's create another
function here and this function is going
to be stop timer
and within this function we are going to
call cleartimeout function just like
clearinterval function this cleartimeout
function is going to you know cancel the
repeated execution okay so to this
function we need to pass the timeout ID
and that's present at the moment in this
variable so let's pass that to this
variable and that's it so we have the
start timer and stop timer functions
when we click the button that is this
button start timer let's actually change
the text here to stop timer so when we
click start timer we want to call this
start timer function and this function
expects control ID to be passed as an
argument so we want to pass this textbox
ID and when we click stop timer we want
to call stop timer function all right so
let's run this now so initially within
the textbox we have got value 10 the
moment we click start timer notice that
it's counting the value down every one
second
when I click stop timer it stops when I
click start timer again it should resume
and the moment it reaches 0 it should
say done and it should return from the
function call thank you for listening
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
