17 of the design patterns tutorial in
this session we will discuss what is
adapter design pattern implementation
guidelines of adapter design pattern and
we'll take a look at an example to
implement adapter design pattern please
refer to the previous parts of the
tutorial before proceeding as per the
Gang of Four definition adapter match
interface of different classes which
means an adapter allows two incompatible
interfaces to work together in software
engineering the dr. pattern is a
software design pattern that allows the
interface of an existing class to be
used from another interface it is often
used to make an existing classes work
with others without modifying their
source code leveraging on adapter
pattern improves reusability of older
functionality having said that adapt a
pattern works as a bridge between two
incompatible interfaces which means this
type of design pattern comes under
structural pattern as this pattern
combines the capability of two
independent interfaces
now the question comes when do we need
to choose adapter design pattern we need
to choose adapter design pattern when a
class needs to be reused that doesn't
have an interface that a client expects
also when we need to work through a
separate adapter that adapts the
interface of an existing class without
changing it also we need to choose this
pattern when client don't know whether
they work with a target class directly
or through another adapter with a class
that doesn't have the target interface
I'm sure this is confusing at this
moment but don't worry we'll take a look
at this with an example now when we talk
about example the perfect example of an
adapter design pattern is the AC adapter
the AC adapter knows how to deal with
both sides isn't it it acts as a
middleman between two sockets that is a
perfect example of adapt a design
pattern let's now take a look at the
representation diagram of adapter design
pattern the Klein class over here is
used to communicate with adapter class
that implements the AI target interface
in other words this is the class used
for creating the instance of adapter
class now the eye target here represent
an interface created to make client
achieve its purpose whereas the adapter
class implements the eye target
interface and inherits the adapter class
as well hence we can see that this works
as mediator between eye target interface
and adapte class finally the adapte
class contains the main functionality
that a client is expecting let's now
switch to visual studio and understand
the adapter design pattern with a very
simple example to save some time I have
already created a console application
which has
employee and employee manager classes
employee class has properties of
employee ID and employee name this is
basically a very simple employee class
now the employee manager has a method
called get all employees that returns
all the employees as XML string before
returning the employees we assume that
the employees are already present in the
system to simulate that I have created
few employees in the constructor of this
class now it looks all perfect till this
moment what if I need details related to
employees in JSON format instead of XML
format to achieve that I cannot use this
method directly but somehow I need a
leverage on this method to get the
employee details in JSON format that
means we need to create some more
interfaces and classes that a client can
leverage on to reuse the existing
classes and return the required output
for that this employee manager need to
become an adaptive class I repeat this
need to become an adaptive class and we
need to create adapter to combine two
incompatible requests and responses to
achieve that let's create an interface
and name it as AI employee right click
on this project and new item
choose an interface and name this as AI
employee this I employ interface returns
the get all employee details in the form
of JSON which means I employ interface
serves as target for the client to
interact so let's create a method which
returns a string which is get all
employees let's also make this interface
as public let's now create a new folder
right click a new folder and name this
folder - target
let's move this I employee into the
target folder it's not mandatory to
create folders and move these classes or
interfaces under these folders and
following this folder structure
presentation to make this example simple
to understand based on our
representation diagram let's right-click
and add new folder and name this folder
as adapting as mentioned earlier the
employee and employee manager are
adapting over here
let's move this class file under
adaptive folder let's click on ok so we
now have adaptee and target related
classes we need to create adapter
related classes let's right click on
this project and new folder and name
this folder as adapter let's right click
on this adapter folder and new item and
choose a class and name this class as
employee adapter this employee adapter
class implements the employee manager
Villas inherits that I employee let's
make this class as public and let
overwrite the method of the employee
manager if you notice that we have
created this method as virtual method so
let's overwrite this virtual method
public overwrite get all employees so
let's say string get all employees look
at that it has pre-populated the details
instead of returning the based or get
employees we need to change the XML to
JSON and return it back let's see how we
can do that let's create a variable
called string return XML equal to base
dot get employees now that we had this
XML we need to convert this XML to JSON
let's create XML document name it as
dark equal to new XML document that
resolve these issues by using system dot
XML and let's load this return XML into
this document document dot load XML and
say the written XML now we can use the
Newton's of JSON over here and convert
this XML to JSON string let's say Jason
convert dot let's resolve this issue by
using Newton's of broad jason and say
serialize object by passing this
document
comma gisun serialization formatting dot
indented we need to return this json
string as per the requirement so let's
return it back let's format this method
now that we have created adaptee adapter
and target related classes and
interfaces let's invoke the adapter from
the client
let's switch to the main program to save
some time I have already kept the core
ready in the client program notice that
using the target interface which is I
employ over here we are creating a new
employee adapter class and invoking the
gate employee details now let's run this
application and step to the code to see
if we are able to retrieve the JSON
details of the employee let's just put a
breakpoint over here let's run this
application
let's step into the gate employees
notice that we are calling the based or
gate employees and returning the XML
file and the XML document which we have
written over here is loading the XML and
using the Jesus and convert we are
converting this XML into a JSON format
notice that we have successfully
converted the XML into the JSON format
with this we have successfully connected
two incompatible classes and interfaces
using adapter pattern I hope now you
have a good idea about the adapter
design pattern in the next session we
will discuss bridge pattern till then
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
