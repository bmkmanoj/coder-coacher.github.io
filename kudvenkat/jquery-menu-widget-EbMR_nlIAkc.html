this video well discus jQuery menu
widget to get this simple jquery menu
widget on your web page there are two
simple steps the first step is to create
an HTML structure with strict
parent-child relationship you can use
any HTML element for that purpose the
most commonly used HTML element is the
unordered list so if you look at this
jquery menu at the top we have got 4
country names USA india UK and australia
so to get that we have an unordered list
with ID equals menu and notice this
unordered list has got 4 list items at
the top USA India UK and Australia and
if you look at USA a list item it has
got another unordered list as a child
and that unordered list has got two list
items Virginia and Maryland so those are
the children of this list item USA
similarly list item India has got three
children aap MP and Karnataka the states
within India and if we look at Karnataka
State it has got three list items as its
children the cities within Karnataka
State and if you look at list item UK
and Australia they don't have any
children okay so here we have an HTML
structure with parent-child
relationships so that's the first step
the second step is to write this one
line of jQuery code so what are we doing
here we are finding this menu item I
mean the unordered list item using its
ID so we are using the jQuery ID
selector finding that unordered list the
topmost
unordered list element and on that we're
calling the jQuery UI menu function so
with this HTML and this one line of
jQuery code we will get this jquery menu
so let's look at this in action i've
already typed all this HTML on the
webform so let's flip to each other to
do so here is the same HTML that we have
seen on the slide at the moment within
the ready function i am not calling the
jquery UI menu function so if we view
this page in the browser this is how it
looks like so by default this is how an
unordered list will be rendered by the
browser now let's turn this unordered
list into a jquery menu by using the
jquery UI
menu function so let us go ahead and
find the unordered list element so I'm
using the jQuery ID selector the idea of
the outermost unordered list element is
menu on that let's go ahead and call
jQuery UI menu function let's save our
changes look at this when we reload this
this unordered list will be transformed
into a jQuery menu so let's reload this
and look at this we get the jQuery menu
but then by default look at this the
width of this jQuery menu is spanning
across the entire width of the webform
now let's see how to control the width
of this menu there are several ways we
can do that one of the easiest ways is
by modifying the CSS class that's
applied by jQuery to this menu so to see
what are the classes that are applied to
this menu you can launch browser
developer tools by pressing f12 so we
want to find the menu so within the body
section there is a form section so if we
expand that so there is a development a
hidden div element which will be
generated by asp.net and then we have
the unordered list element which is
actually creating this menu for us and
look at the ID its menu and look at the
classes that are applied the CSS classes
we have UI - menu UI - widget etc let's
good and modify you know the properties
using this style class UI - menu so I'm
going to include this class on my web
page so let's go ahead and include a
style section here and the name of the
class is UI - menu and I'm going to
override some of the properties for
example let's say I want to set width to
maybe 150 pixels okay so I'm going to
set that and save our changes let's
reload our page and now look at this the
width of this menu is now 150 pixels and
we now hover the mouse over us a we get
the two states within that similarly we
have got three states within India and
Karnataka State has got three countries
whereas UK and Australia they don't have
any
children okay now for some reason if you
want to disable some of the list items
here you can do that as well by applying
classes so for example here within the
example right here we are disabling MP
state okay and the way we are doing it
is by applying this class to that list
item UI - Tate - disable so let's go
ahead and do that so let's say for
example we want to disable this list
item so I'm going to apply that CSS
class so plus equals UI - state
- disabled so let's save our changes at
the moment notice that all of the list
items are enabled let's reload this page
and look at the state MP it's this
disabled so we cannot really select that
now one way to control the width is by
modifying the properties of these CSS
class that supplied by jQuery to our
list items
another way you can control the width of
the menu widget is by placing it as a
child element in another parent element
and then setting the width of that
parent element so let's go ahead and
comment or remove the style class from
here save our changes and when we reload
this we should be back to what it was
look at as the width of the menu is
planning across the width of the webform
another way to control the width is by
including maybe another development on
our page so this is going to be the
parent for this unordered list element
so I'm actually going to cut this entire
HTML and paste that within that div
element and then on this development I'm
going to set the style attribute style
equals with colon 150 pixels so let's
save our changes reload this page and
look at this the width of the menu is
now 150 pixels
you can add an icon to a menu item by
applying class names and for the list of
all icons provided by jQuery UI visit
this URL now if you look at this menu
right here notice that there are no
icons associated with any of the list
items for some reason if you want to
associate icons there are several icons
provided by jQuery UI and you can see
that complete list here you know at this
URL so there are loads of icons
available okay now for example let's go
ahead and associate maybe this flag icon
with one of the country names
okay let's associate it with USA okay at
the moment we don't have any icons okay
and to do that all we are doing here is
including a span element and applying
the CSS class class equals UI - icon and
the name of the image UI - I can - flag
so if you look at the flag icon here
that's the name UI - I can - flag so
let's copy that name let's go ahead and
modify our HTML so here we have caught
the list item USA so I'm going to
include a span element here and then I'm
going to set the class UI - icon so
that's one of the classes and then UI -
I can - flag okay so let's go ahead and
save our changes reload our page and
look at that against the country USA
we've got a flag now to associate a
different icon to a submenu use icons
option now if you look at this submenu
you know we've got right you know
angular bracket there okay so that's
what when you point all that we know
that that indicates that there is a
submenu on the USA and India now if you
want to associate a different icon for
the submenu then again you can do that
by using the icons option and then
specifying the name of the icon
okay so we are using the icons option
and then we are using a JavaScript
object and then we are setting this
property submenu to the icon that we are
interested in okay so let's go and do
that so within our jQuery ready function
we are calling the menu function so
let's use a javascript object and
specify the options that we are
interested in so I'm going to use the
icons option and I'm going to use
another JavaScript object here and
specify submenu and let's go ahead and
choose an icon
so let's wizard this URL and here we can
find all the images so let's go ahead
and use this icon right here a right
arrow so let's copy that and specify it
here save our changes reload this page
now look at this the image is replaced
and to disable the menu you can set the
disabled option to true so at the moment
the menu is active so if you want to
disable that we can use the disabled
option so let's go and set that to true
save our changes reload this page and
look at that the menu is disabled
nothing happens when you hover over the
menu items to get the selected menu item
text use the select event so let's go
ahead and enable this and I'm going to
set disabled to false and whenever we
select let's reload this page whenever
we select a menu item we want that
selected item text ok for that we are
going to use the select event so
whenever you select an item from the
menu select event is raised so we are
going to handle that so this is the
function that gets called and we select
a menu item and to this function there
are two parameters the event object
itself and the jQuery UI element that
triggered this event okay so what do we
want we want the selected items text
let's alert that using JavaScript alert
function so we have the UI dot item dot
on that I'm going to call the jQuery
text function so let's go and reload
this and look at this when we select UK
so we get the text of that similarly
when we go to India
Karnataka Bangalore we get the selected
item text
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
