in this video well discus providing
visual feedback using loading element ID
Ajax option this is continuation to part
93 so please watch part 93 before
proceeding one of the problems with
partial page updates is that they do not
provide any visual feedback if the
request is taking a long time to process
with full page post backs we don't have
this problem because the entire page is
posted to the server and the hence the
user knows that something is happening
for example let's say a request in our
Ajax enabled application takes 10
seconds to complete and the user clicks
the button and if we don't provide him
with any visual feedback that the
request is still being processed then
the user may think that the website is
not working and he may click the button
again so it's very important that we
provide some visual feedback let's
understand this with an example so this
is the application that we have been
working with in the previous sessions
now look at this at the moment when I
click on this all link we get the result
instantaneously so this is not a problem
but let's try and introduce some late
and say so let's use system dot
threading dot
sleep and let's make the current thread
sleep
maybe for three seconds so system dot
threading dot red dot sleep and we have
to specify the time in milliseconds so
if we want the thread to sleep for four
seconds then we have to specify 4,000
milliseconds so let's do it for all
action method top three action method
and bottom three action method okay so
let's run this once again and now when
we click on a link it's going to take at
least four seconds to load look at this
when I click all it's going to take four
seconds now since this is a partial page
postback you know the entire page
doesn't get posted back to the server so
that's why the user doesn't know whether
if the request is being processed or
whether the application is not working
look at this when I click on top three
now you know there is no
blew on if the request is still being
processed okay so what we want to do is
we want to provide some form of visual
feedback to the user you know so that he
knows the request is still being
processed okay so for example maybe I
want to display an image like this so
when I click on a link I want to display
an image like this so which indicates
that the request is being processed and
then as soon as they serve a completed
processing we want to immediately load
the data so let's see how to achieve
that okay the first step is obviously I
need this image so I have already
downloaded that onto my machine so
within the sequel and images I have this
animated gif image now if you want to
create these animated spinner gif images
here's a very good website that I have
come across spiffy gif calm okay so that
website allows you to create animated
spinner images okay let's say for
example if you want the size of those
arrows to increase you can customize and
then you can download that image using
this link alright so after you have
downloaded the image create images
folder within you our MVC application
and let's copy this image into that
folder okay so that's the first step and
the second step is on the index view I'm
going to create a div tag okay so
basically I want the image to be
appearing just above the table where we
display these students okay so I'm going
to include a div tag here and then let's
give it an ID maybe let's call it div
loading and then we need to set style to
display colon none because we don't want
this to be initially displayed okay
display colon none and then inside this
div tag I'm going to use an image
element and I'm going to set source to
till the four slash images directory and
within that what's the name of our image
spinner dot calf so let's specify the
source here alright so that's the second
step included div tag give it an ID and
set the initial display to none and then
use an image tag specify the source and
then within our Ajax action link we have
you know this Ajax option object let's
got this property loading element ID
okay so the loading element ID should be
set to the ID of this div okay so let's
take this div and set it here okay so
let's copy this and paste it with the
other ajax action links that's all there
to it so let's save everything let's go
ahead and run this now
okay so let's click top three look at
that we have the image you know rotating
which indicates to the user that you
know the request is being processed and
look at this when I click bottom three
the images again rotating and then as
soon as the request finishes processing
I get bottom three
if I click all you know the same idea
okay but then let's say for example you
know I have all students here when I
click top three I want to clear this
result you know whatever the result
that's present here and then I just want
to show this image okay so how to
achieve that we'll discuss that in our
next video session alright that's it for
today thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
