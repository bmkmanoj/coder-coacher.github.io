venket this is path 34 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll learn about
hidden fields in asp.net when to use a
hidden fear hidden field alternatives
advantages and disadvantages of using a
hidden field the hidden field control is
used to store a value that needs to be
persisted across post to the server but
you don't want the controller its value
to be visible to the user for example
when editing and updating an employee
record we don't want the user to see the
employee ID so we will store this
employee ID in a hidden field which then
can be used on the server to update the
correct employees record let's actually
look at this example in action I have a
simple table here called TBL employees
which stores the ID name gender and
department name columns let's display
this on a webform so that the end user
can edit them so I have a simple asp.net
web application project here let's drag
and drop a hidden field a control onto
the webform like any other standard
asp.net control the hidden field control
has an ID and run it is equal to server
attributes now we want to display the
name gender and department name columns
on the webform so we need you know the
respect to test text box controls to
display them so just to save some time
in typing I have this HTML already you
know typed here and if you look at the
HTML it's pretty straightforward there's
nothing you know strange there it's a
simple table and then we have TR and to
Dedes within that you know basically one
TD to display a deal you know the text
name and then a text box control for
that
similarly for gender and Department okay
so obviously you know when I load the
page when the wave form gets loaded we
want to load the data again we need to
write ad or dotnet code for that we need
to connect to the sequel server so in
web config file we have the database
connection string and we have spoken
about all these in the area dotnet video
series so if you haven't watched radio
dotnet I would strongly encourage you to
do so before continuing with the session
so I have written a simple method here
to load the employee details and all
this method does basically it reads the
web.config connection
strained and then loads the data from
the database table so if you look at
that we have the connection strain we
created the connection object and we
have this query select ID name gender
from that table and we are only loading
one employee's record here to 0-2 which
is Steve's record and then what we are
doing here is after we execute the query
we are using the reader looping through
each row and then taking the name gender
department ID department name and the ID
if you look at that the name gender and
department name are stored in the
respective text boxes txt name txt
gender and txt department those are the
text box IDs that we have here okay but
then the interesting thing to note here
is that we are not displaying on the
form if you look at that we don't have
the ID being displayed okay but then we
are storing the ID within the hidden
field and look at that hidden field ID
the ID of the hidden field control is
hidden field one and we are using the
value property of the hidden field to
actually set store the value within that
for example if we want to store a value
within a text box we use the text
property but to store a value within the
hidden field we use the value property
and you will understand just in a bit
why are we actually storing this ID in
this hidden field what is the purpose of
that the purpose of this is later when
we actually use the update button when
we click that we need to know which
employee record we are updating and we
will read this ID from this hidden fear
and then perform the update on the
correct record okay since this is a
hidden field
you know this is not visible now when we
actually run this now we only have this
method here let's call this on the page
load so if not is post back in the sense
if it's not a post back if it is the
initial get request call the load
employee method so obviously when we run
this now what's going to happen the
application is going to execute that
query load the data you know the name
gender and department name will be
displayed in this text boxes and the
hidden field the ID column value will be
stored in this hidden field okay now
let's actually have a button control
on the web form which can actually
update the employees record and
obviously to do that let's drag and drop
a button control so let's use another PR
here and then let's use a TD and another
TD because each TD contains two cells
one will actually update the employees
record so let's say this button is used
to update the record after we update the
record we want another button control to
actually load the updated employees
record so let's call this load employee
so we have two buttons ok so when we
click this update button we actually
want to update the employees record and
I have this already typed so just to
save some time again so this is all I do
dotnet code beyond the scope of this
article so I have just typed this to
save some time and typing so if you look
at this again all we are doing here as
we are reading the connection string and
we are creating a sequel connection
object we're using a parameterised query
here update TBL employee set name is
equal to add name gender is equal to add
gender department name is equal to add
department name so all these are
parameters so we need to supply the
values for these parameters and then
we're ID is equal to at ID again that's
that's a parameter okay now you know
that whenever we run this application on
the UI you know when we run this now it
actually loads the data into the respect
to text box controls and then it
displays the name gender Department
let's say for example I change the
department to IT and then when I perform
update so Steve you're updating Steve's
record but then within your table there
might be multiple Steve's so how will
you know which Steve record you want to
update ok that's why we use IDs but then
if you look at this webform we don't
have the employee ID displayed here but
then if you remember when we actually
loaded this data we stored the employee
ID value within this hidden field
okay so we can use the value from that
hidden feel and then update the correct
employees record if you look at this
here after we prepare this equal command
using this parameterised query we are
adding the values for these parameters
so for that name the value is coming
from this txt name textbox gender from
that txt gender and Department name from
txt Department text box but then the
employee ID where is that coming from
that is coming from the hidden field and
then what we are doing we are opening
the connection commander to execute non
very losing the connection and we are
just emptying the text boxes just to
indicate that we have actually performed
the update okay
and then we have another button after we
actually update that we want to load the
data so let's go ahead and call this
method once again on the button click OK
so all we need to inspect here is let's
put a breakpoint in this load employee
method because this gets called when the
webform first load so that we can
actually check you know is they employee
ID being loaded into that hidden field
so as the page hits the breakpoint
okay so f10 F then let's navigate
through and look at this when we get to
this point okay so if you look at this
hidden field it's empty at the moment
when I press f10 look at that it
actually stores that to zero - as we
press f5 the page get displayed and we
can change let's say for example its ID
we are changing Steve's department
currently it's payroll we are changing
that to IIT and when we hit the Update
button it should perform the update and
if you remember this is the update
button code and now it's trying to
retrieve the value from the hidden field
because we need the ID to update the
correct employee's record okay so let's
put the breakpoint there and let's try
to click this
Update button so the moment we click the
Update button it gets into this code
block let's loop through okay now if you
look at this hidden field dot value look
at that two zero two we are able to
retrieve that so to set or get the value
from the hidden field we use the value
property and then it updates the correct
record so let's press f5 and if you look
at that it emptied those labels and when
I click load data load employee again
this method gets called and we should
have the updated department there so
basically here we have seen how to use
the hidden field to store the values
that we don't want to show to the
end-user but then we are using them for
a purpose for example when we are
updating this employee record you know
just to make sure that we are updating
the correct employees record we are
storing the employee ID in that hidden
fear so value property of the hidden
trail is used to get or set the value
the value is stored as a string so if
you look at this value property of the
hidden field its data type is string so
if you are storing I mean basically can
store anything dates numbers etc but
then since it is storing them as strings
when you try to do some comparisons or
something you need to cast that to the
appropriate type okay so the value is
stored as string in the hidden field
view state in fact uses hidden field to
maintain state across postback now if
you remember if I right click on this
you know these controls they are
maintaining their state across post
backs we know that web applications work
on a stateless protocol but how are
these controls this asp.net controls are
able to remember their state because
they are using a built-in mechanism
called a view state and what is this
view state it's actually a hidden field
it's making use of hidden field behind
the scenes for if I right click on the
page and save view source look at that
there is this underscore view state and
that look at that its input type is
hidden so this view state field uses I
mean it uses hidden fields to retain
state across postback hidden field is
rent rendered as input type is equal to
hidden so that's another thing
you know from an asp.net perspective
this is a hidden field control but then
you know when it gets rendered it gets
rendered as an HTML element whose input
type is hidden and that's what we have
just seen so if I right-click on that
and say view page source our input our
hidden field name is hidden field 1 and
if you look at that it is rendered as
input type is equal to hidden
alternatives for hidden field now why
did we use this hidden field basically
to store that employee ID we should we
don't want to show to the end-user
because that's not editable and it
doesn't make any sense to show that
field to the end-user
now do we really have to use hidden
fields for this purposes no in fact you
can store that in the text box and then
you know you can set the display style
to none it won't even show that so
that's one of the ways other
alternatives for the hidden fields are
to use view state or query strings
session state and cookies and if you
remember view state in fact uses hidden
fields behind the scenes okay but then
view state query strings you know these
are used as alternatives for the hidden
fear but the problem is session state
and cookies they will be accessible from
other pages as well now here we just
storing the hidden field on this page in
that hidden field and then when I
navigate away from this page it's
automatically lost but then whereas
session and cookies they will be there
until their timeout expires okay but
whereas view state and hidden field data
is available only on that page and it is
automatically lost when we navigate away
from the page so depending on the
application requirement we choose the
appropriate technique to you know
basically store the values advantages of
hidden field hidden field data is lost
when we navigate away from the page so
it doesn't require any explicit cleanup
tasks and another advantage is that it
is accessible from the client-side
scripts let's actually look at this in
action we know that when the page gets
loaded it's actually storing the hidden
fear or the value within the hidden
you if you look at this webform we are
storing the employee ID within that
hidden field let's say I have a button
here and another button for example
let's put another button there but then
I'm going to put let's stop the
debugging first so let's put an HTML
button there so when I click this HTML
button what I want to do basically is I
want to write a JavaScript function
which can go and retrieve the value from
that hidden file basically we want to
prove the fact that JavaScript the
client-side scripts can access the
hidden field data so all you have to do
is let's write a simple function so
script language is equal to type slash
JavaScript so I'm going to write a
function here so function let's call
this get hidden field data and all this
function does is within this document
there is a function called get element
by ID we'll talk about JavaScript in
detail in a later session but here the
whole idea is to prove that view hidden
field data can be accessible by
JavaScript so get element by ID and if
you look at the ID of the hidden field
here it is hidden field 1 so I am going
to pass in that dot value will give us
that value back and all I want to do is
I want to use an alert JavaScript alert
function to show that value so probably
we want to append that to my employee ID
is equal to whatever let's return back
and we want to call this function when
we click this button so I'm going to
call this within that button 3
underscore click this is the HTML button
so on the client click event we are
calling that javascript function
so now when we run this when the page
gets loaded we know that the employee ID
will be stored on this hidden field and
when I click this button look at that
employee ID is equal to - zero - so
basically this proves the fact that
hidden field is accessible to
client-side scripts and the
disadvantages of hidden field hidden
field data can be seen by viewing the
page source and we have just seen that
so if we right click on the page and say
view page source you know you can
actually see that hidden field and the
data that is stored in that so input
type is equal to hidden and you look at
the value to 0 - it is stored in a plain
text format so obviously hidden field is
not you know it never should be used to
store confidential data on this slide
