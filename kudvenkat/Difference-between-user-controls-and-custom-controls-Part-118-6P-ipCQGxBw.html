I am venket this is part one one eighth
of asp.net video series in this video
we'll discuss about the differences
between user controls and custom
controls in parts 104 to 109 of the
asp.net video tutorial we discussed
about user controls and in parts 112 to
117 we discussed about custom controls
in this video we'll discuss about the
differences between them in fact this is
a very common interview question as well
one of the differences between them is
that custom controls are compiled into
their own assembly whereas user controls
are not user controls are compiled into
the assembly of the web application
project that contains them let's
understand that with an example let's
flip to this custom controls project
that we have been working with if you
remember within this custom controls
project we have this custom calendar
control now this custom calendar control
since it is present in custom controls
project when I compile this solution we
get an assembly generated for this
custom controls project so if I open
that in Windows Explorer let's go to the
bin debug directory I can see this
custom controls DLL now into this
assembly we will have this custom
calendar control compiled okay so on the
other hand if you look at the asp.net
web application project here we have
been working with this calendar user
control now if I compile this asp.net
web application project
this calendar user control will be
compiled into the web application
projects assembly now it's not possible
to compile user controls into their own
assemblies the fact that custom controls
can be compiled into their own
assemblies allows custom controls to be
added to Visual Studio toolbox in fact
that's the second difference between
custom controls and user controls custom
controls can be added to the visual
studio toolbox
whereas user controls cannot be added
and if you remember we actually have
added this custom calendar control to
this visual studio toolbox we also have
associated a custom image with that
control now
can we add user controls to Visual
Studio toolbox no we cannot do that and
if I have to use
custom control on a waveform I simply
drag and drop it from the toolbox on to
the waveform just like any other built
in asp.net control but if I have to use
a user control I drag it from the
solution Explorer on to the waveform not
from the toolbox okay so that could be
another difference another thing to keep
in mind is that user controls are easier
to create as they are very similar to
creating web pages if you look at the
calendar user control that we have
worked with in the previous sessions of
this video series it has got this ASC X
page and then if I open up that you know
it's just like a webform it has this
HTML and this user controls also have a
code behind file just like our waveforms
okay and another important thing to keep
in mind is that this user controls have
a designer associated with them so if I
have to create the UI for my calendar
user control I I simply drag and drop
those controls that I need from the
toolbox at design-time declaratively
because i have a designer a graphical
designer but if i have to do the same
thing with a custom control then it's a
relatively complex job because with
custom controls I don't have a designer
associated I have to do everything in
code in fact in fact we worked with this
custom calendar so obviously there also
we require the text box image but in
calendar look at this since I don't have
a designer I have to do everything from
declaration to rendering within court
so here I'm declaring declaring these
controls first and then within check
create child controls method we specify
the ID width and any of the properties
that we are interested in and finally
using the render method we actually
render the controls so everything done
in core but on the other hand with user
control since we have a designer we can
declaratively specify the controls and
properties like ID run at image URL etc
everything declaratively at design time
okay so since the custom controls
doesn't have a designer associated with
them this fact makes makes them a little
complex to work with custom
trolls then use the controls and another
difference is that a separate copy of
user control is required in each
application where you want to use that
user control so if you look at this now
the asp.net web application project here
we have this calendar user control
that's present in this project now let's
say I have another 10 a squidward web
application projects where I want to use
this calendar user control in that case
I have to have a copy of this calendar
user control in each of those ten
different asp.net web application
projects where I want to use this
control so what's the problem of having
multiple copies maintainability so
tomorrow if for some reason the calendar
user control has to change I have to
make that change in all of those 10
different applications where we are
using that control so maintainability
becomes a little problematic to these
user controls but various with custom
controls I don't have that problem I can
reuse a custom control with multiple
projects without having multiple copies
ok so those are some of the differences
but however when working with custom
controls there are some points that have
to be kept in mind which is what we will
discuss now so when we drag and drop a
custom control from the toolbox onto the
web form designer then the following two
things can happen ok let's actually look
at that in action so I have this custom
calendar control that's available I know
in the visual studio toolbox let's say I
want to use that in this web on this
waveform 9 dot aspx in this you know
demo asp.net web application project now
look at the references I don't have a
reference to custom controls project but
the moment I drag and drop this on to
the web form look at this a reference to
that assembly is automatically added
custom controls assembly ok and now let
me go ahead and build this solution and
look at the properties of this assembly
so I am right click on that custom right
clicking on that custom controls and
then clicking properties copy local
property set to true me
this assembly will be copied locally
into this asp.net web application
project and why is that because at the
moment custom controls project so if you
look at this custom controls project
within that we have this custom calendar
and obviously when we compile this as
you might expect we have an assembly
generated now since this custom controls
assembly is not as strongly named
assembly I cannot install this assembly
into the gag into the global assembly
cache okay so if I don't have this
assembly this custom controls are some
lay in the gag and if I add a reference
to that assembly in the asp.net web
application project then a copy of that
assembly will be made into the bin
directory of my asp.net web application
project so that's one thing that can
happen so if the custom control assembly
is not installed in gaghe then custom
control assembly is copied into the bin
folder of the application so in this
case if you need to use this custom
control in multiple applications then a
copy of the custom controls assembly
will be made into the bin folder of
every application where you're using or
referencing that custom control so if
you check this asp.net web application
project if I right-click that if I open
that in Windows Explorer get to the bin
directory look at that custom control
store DLL that specific assembly is
added error as a reference to this
project now on the other hand if the
custom controls assembly is installed in
CAG now we spoke about what is CAC and
how to strongly name an assembly and
then add that assembly into gag in the
previous sessions of the you know dotnet
basics video tutorial in fact in part 3
of the dotnet basics video tutorial we
discussed about strong naming and
assembly and in part 4 we discussed
about what is CAC and how when when to
install an assembly into that so if
you're new to these concept I strongly
recommend to watch you know parts three
and four from the dotnet basics video
tutorial but remember if the custom
control assembly is installed in kayak
then the custom control assembly is
directly referenced from the GAC so in
this case a
copy of the custom control can be used
in multiple projects so let's actually
look at that in action now look at this
here you know in the bin folder of our
asp.net web application project let's
actually get to the bin folder of the
asp.net web application project so I
right click on the project go to open
folder in Windows Explorer bin look at
that a copy is made okay why because the
custom controls assembly is not strongly
named so to strongly name and I mean
it's not installed into gap so obviously
to install an assembly into gag we need
to first strongly name the assembly and
strongly namely as a name and assembly
we need to use the strong naming tool so
let's go to start all programs Microsoft
Visual Studio 2010 and we shall studio
tools and within that I have visuals to
the command prompt right click on that
run as administrator and we have to run
you know the strong naming tool from
there so CD backslash let me change the
directory to sweet drive and I have to
use the strong name tool strong name exe
- Kay to generate the key file I am
going to specify the name of my file
ASCII file dot s NK + I + enter the tool
should write a key file that contains
the private and public key into my C
Drive so obviously now if we go to the C
Drive they should see the key file so
key file dot s and K okay now using this
key file we want to strongly name our
custom controls assembly and to do that
we get into the properties folder and
then assembly info dot CS here within
this assembly info dot CS we need to
specify an assembly level attribute so
assembly colon assembly key file
attribute and then let's use the
verbatim literal to specify the path of
the key file so the key file is present
in C Drive backslash and the name of the
file is key file dot SNK
so let's go ahead and build the solution
now so now at this point since we have a
key file associated and avert assembly
version number as well when we build
this project a strong name will be
generated for us for our assembly now
once we have a strong name generated we
can actually install this assembly into
the gag so if I open this folder in
Windows Explorer go to the bin debug so
this is our custom controls assembly I
want to install this into the gag so to
get to the GAC I can open C colon
backslash windows and as I told you we
discussed about what is CAC how and when
to how when when to install an assembly
into GAC we discussed about all these
concepts in the.net basics tutorial so
please watch those videos if you are new
to these concepts so let's get to see :
windows microsoft.net assembly folder
where we have all the you know
assemblies so we have all the assemblies
here now at the moment you don't see
custom controls you know folder here
which means custom controls assembly is
not yet present in the gag and to
install an assembly into GAC there are
several ways I'm going to use the GAC
utility tool so GAC utility sokak util
dot exe - I to install the assembly into
the gag and then we need to specify the
assembly path you know which we want to
install into the gap so the assembly is
present at this path C colon custom
controls bin-debug so that's the butt
let's copy that paste it here and a
backslash let's specify the name of the
assembly which is custom control store
dealer let's paste there and then when I
press ENTER look at that assembly
successfully add it to the cache now if
we go back to the gag MSI l and refresh
this we should actually see custom
controls folder there and if I expand
that look at that I have custom control
store DLL which is added to the gag okay
now let's go back to visual studio and
before I remove this you know
this custom calendar let me actually
right-click and select choose items and
then within the choose items dialog box
let me show you custom calendar here
so if you notice custom calendar here
this is actually coming from C Drive
custom calendar custom calendar bin
folder so this is not coming from the
GAC but whereas look at this the other
assemblies like system dot web dot UI
dot web controls where is that coming
from that is coming from global assembly
cached gag okay now since I have
installed our custom calendar control
into gag I want I want that to be you
know coming from GAC rather than you
know from that local path which is you
know not as strongly named assembly so
I'm going to delete that from here and
then re-add the custom calendar control
but then before that let's remove this
control as well and then let's also
remove this reference and let's actually
go to the bin directory and rym delete
it from there actually let's delete
everything okay so we have all that gone
I'm going to close all these folders
let's go back to visual studio let's
make sure everything still builds so
build succeeded now let's add the custom
control so choose items so very sever
you know strongly named assembly present
it's present in the GAC now so I'm going
to go to the path of CAC which is
present in C colon backslash Windows
backslash microsoft.net backslash
assembly and within that GAC MSI l and
we have custom controls and the assembly
so the moment I added that control look
at that custom calendar and look at the
directory from where it's coming now
it's coming from global assembly cache
so I click OK the calendar gets added
now before we do anything let me open
you know the web application projects
bin folder so within the bin folder at
the moment I only have demo dot DLL and
then look at this I'm going to drag and
drop the custom calendar control onto
this waveform
okay as soon as I do that now look at
this in the references I have custom
controls assembly added because that's
where the custom calendar control is
present now if I click on properties and
select the properties look at from where
it is coming it's coming from gag and
then look at this copy local attribute
is that set to true or false it's set to
false because if the assembly is coming
from the gag there is no need for that
to be copied locally into the bin folder
of this race p.net web application so
obviously now when I build a solution
and when I go into the bin folder of the
project I should only see demo DLL
I don't see custom controls to a DLL
because that is now coming from cat no
it's very similar to how let's say for
example I drag and drop the standard
text box control here or a button
control whatever this is standard
button control which is present in
system dot fab assembly okay now if I
right-click on system that webassembly
and go to the properties even this is
coming from gag okay
so system dot web assembly is coming
from the gag and then so obviously for
that reason if I go to the folder and
bin directory I don't have here system
dot webassembly locally copied so just
how the standard asp.net assemblies are
working our custom calendar I mean
custom controls assembly it's also
working in the same manner because we
have it deployed to the gag okay so I
can run this application and it works so
keep that in mind if the custom controls
are someplace installed in gag then
custom controls assembly is directly
referenced from the gag so in this case
a single copy of the custom control can
be used in multiple projects all right

asp.net c-sharp and sequel server
