tutorial in this video well discus
angular ng F structural directive with
an example
along the way we'll also discuss how to
prevent a button from submitting the
form so here is what you want to do on
our create employee form we want to
include a field to capture the photo
path of the employee so when this form
initially loads we want to include this
photo path field where the end user can
type the part of the photo and we also
want to display this show preview button
so when they click this show preview
button we want to display the preview of
the image available at this specified
path and then the text on the button
should dynamically change to hide
preview and then when they click this
hide preview button we want to hide the
preview of the image and the text on the
button should change back to show
preview the first step is to include the
required HTML for the photo path field
it's going to be very similar to this
phone number field so let's copy and
paste this HTML and then we'll change
the bits that are required I'm going to
place this HTML just below the date of
birth field let's change the text on
this label to photo path and along the
same lines let's also change the for
attribute of the label ID of the input
field name and ng-model to photo path
since we have set the name property of
the input field and any model directive
of the input field to photo path angle
generated for model is going to create a
property with the name photo path and
it's going to keep track of what we type
into this photo path input field notice
we have the photo path field as expected
and as we type into this photo path
field
notice this photo path property within
this angle I generated for model
whatever we type Y is being captured by
the angler auto-generated for model now
we want to include an image element just
below this photo path field so it can
preview the image available at the
specified photo path so
just below the photo path field let's
include the image element notice we are
setting the image elements height and
width to 200 pixels and we are binding
the photo path property to the source
property of the image element let's save
our changes and then take a look at the
browser notice we have our image element
just below the photo path field
let's launch browser developer tools
notice we have four zero for error on
the console tab by getting this four
zero for error because on the initial
form load the photo part property is now
and we are binding that photo path
property to the source property of the
image element since this photo path
property is now we're getting the four
zero for error notice at the moment we
only have one four zero for error we can
see that one error right here now notice
what happens as we type into this photo
path input field every time a character
is typed into this for the path input
field we have f404 error this is because
every time we type into this field
angler is trying to bind the
corresponding property that is the photo
path property with the source property
of the image element because we have
specified that binding right here since
we have not completed typing a valid
photo path angler is not able to find a
photo at this specified part and that's
the reason we are getting this for zero
for error
once we complete typing a valid photo
path we get to see the photo as expected
on our initial form load we do not want
to display the image element we don't
want to render it at all only when we
click the show preview button that's
when we want to render the image element
and then show the preview of the image
available at the specified path so to
keep it hidden within our create
employee component class I'm going to
create a boolean property I'm going to
call it preview photo and I'm going to
initialize that to false next in the
view template on our image element I'm
going to use the ngf structural director
I'm going to set its expression to the
boolean property that we have just
created within our component class so
let's set the expression of this NDF
structural directive to that boolean
property since we have initialized this
property to false when the form
initially loads this image element is
not added to the browser Dom meaning
it's not rendered at all so if the
expression is false say this image
element will not be rendered if it is
true thee only then the image element
will be rendered so on the initial form
load notice we don't have the image
element displayed and as we type into
the photo path field notice we don't
have any four zero four errors logged to
the console next we need this show
preview button to show and hide the
photo preview so between the photo path
input field and the image element let's
include show preview button notice here
we're using the bootstrap BTN and BTN
primary button classes for styling next
we need to wire up the button click
event handler so when we click this
button we want to call a method on our
component class we don't have this
toggle photo preview method yet we'll
clear that in just a bit and notice the
syntax right here we are using
parentheses so this is even binding we
discussed even binding in detail in part
14 of our angular 2 tutorial so if
you're new to even binding please check
out our angular 2 course now all we want
this toggle photo preview method to do
is toggle the value that we have in this
preview photo property now we have a
typo here we are missing Oh so let's
correct the typo and let's create this
method on our component class so just
after the constructor let's create the
toggle photo preview method and all this
method is going to do is toggle the
value that we have in preview photo
property so this dot preview photo
equals not this dot preview photo let's
say what changes
and take a look at the browser notice we
have show preview button as expected so
within the photo path property let's
type a valid photo path so we have this
mark dot PNG within the images folder in
the assets folder so if we take a look
at our project notice within the assets
folder we have images and within that we
have mark dot PNG at the moment we are
assuming we already have the employee
photo in our upcoming videos in this
series will discuss how to upload files
using angular for now let's assume we
already have the employee photo and we
are just capturing the path using this
create employee form so once we have
this valid photo path when we click show
preview we see the employee photo and
when we click this button again the
preview is hidden so it's all working as
expected but we have two problems here
and here is the first problem they text
on the button is not changing
dynamically when we don't have the
preview we want the text to be show
preview but when we click it and when we
see the preview we want the text to be
hide preview so when we click on it
again the preview will be hidden so we
want to change the text on the button
dynamically depending on whether the
preview is available or not and then
look at this console here let's clear
out everything that we already have now
every time I click the button notice
we're actually logging the anglo
generated form model to the console
notice the code to log the employee form
to the console is present in the same
employee method and we are binding the
same employee method to the ng submit
directive on our form element so when we
submit the form we want to call the same
employee method passing it the employee
form under the moment on our form you
only have one submit button and that is
our Save button so notice that type
attribute on this button it is set to
submit so only when we click the Save
button we get the form submitted and
then we want the code and save employee
method to be executed which logs the
employee form to the console but every
time you are clicking this
preview button you know the form is
locked to the console and we don't want
that to happen
notice this again we clear the console
and every time we click this show
preview button we have it logged to the
console so let's fix this problem first
the reason we have this problem is
because there show preview button is
behaving as a submit button and the
reason it's behaving as a submit button
is because we don't have the type
attribute set explicitly when we don't
have the type attribute set explicitly
the button behaves as a submit button
now we don't want this button to behave
as a submit button so I'm going to set
the type attribute explicitly and set it
to button notice now the show preview
button is not behaving as a submit
button every time we click the button
notice now we don't have the employee
form logged to the console next let's
fix the text on the button we want the
text on the button to change dynamically
depending on whether we have the preview
visible or not to set the text on the
button dynamically we are going to make
use of interpolation so instead of
hard-coding the text let's use
interpolation and then make use of this
property preview photo so if the value
of this property is true so let's use
ternary operator here so if the value of
preview photo is true then that means we
have the preview available so at that
point we want to display hide preview on
the button so if this property value is
true it's going to append this text to
this text so we will have hide preview
on the other hand if the preview is not
available meaning if the value of this
property is false then we want show
preview as the text on the button so
let's format the code save our changes
and then take one final look at the
browser notice at the moment we don't
have the photo preview so the text on
the button is show preview when we type
in a valid photo path and click the
button we have the preview and the text
changes to hide preview when I click the
button again the preview is hidden
and the tax changed back to show preview
here is the code that we just discussed
when we click the show preview button we
are calling this toggle photo preview
method and all this method does is
toggle the value that we have in preview
photo property and we are using this
preview photo property and the nga
structural directive to add or remove
the image element from the Dom we're
also using the same property to
dynamically set the text on the button
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
