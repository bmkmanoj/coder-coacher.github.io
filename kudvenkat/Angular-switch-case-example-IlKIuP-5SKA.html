tutorial in this video we will discuss
anglers ng-switch directive with an
example so here is what we want to do
notice on our list page at the moment we
are displaying employees Department ID
for an end-user this department ID does
not make any sense so instead of
displaying the department ID let's
display the corresponding department
name here is our department data if the
department ID is one then we want to
display its corresponding department
name helpdesk if it's two then HR so on
and so forth if you have experience with
any of the object-oriented programming
languages like C++ C sharp or Java then
chances are you are already familiar
with switch case statement in one of
these languages angler switch case is
very similar it's actually a combination
of three directives ng-switch ng switch
case and ng-switch default let's look at
these directives in action this is the
development that displays the Department
row on our list page so this expression
right here returns as the department ID
now what we want to do is depending on
the department ID we want to display
their department name so on this
development let's use ng switch
directive and we want to bind this to
employee dot Department property since
we are binding to a property let's wrap
ng switch within a pair of square
brackets now we always need this : so
I'm going to leave that alone and we no
longer need this expression so let's
delete that and we know this department
property is going to return us the
department ID so if the department ID is
1 then we want to display its
corresponding department name
desk so for that let's use ng-switch
case I'm going to include it on a span
element ng-switch case is a structural
directive
so let's prefix it with an asterisk so
if the department ID is one then the
name of the department that we want to
display is help desk similarly if the
department ID is two then the department
name is HR if it's three then the
department name is ID and if it is four
then the department name is payroll
let's also include a default case if the
department ID value is not one two three
or four then we want to display
something like invalid department or not
applicable or something else that makes
sense as far as your requirement is
concerned I'm going to display not
applicable so instead of using ng-switch
case we use ng-switch
default with the default case we don't
check for any value so let's remove this
equals here and the text that we want to
display is n/a for not applicable let's
save our changes and then take a quick
look at the browser notice now for all
the existing employees we have the
department name displayed as expected
now let's create a new employee and
quickly verify now let's select payroll
as the department let's save our changes
here is our newly created employee
Robert and look at his department it
correctly displays the department name
here is the same example which we just
discussed now one important point to
keep in mind is if multiple switch cases
match the expression value then all
those which cases are displayed let me
actually show you in action what I mean
notice here we already have an NG switch
case with a value of 3 I'm also going to
change this switch case value to 2
so now if this expression employee Don
Department if it returns three then both
these which cases will become true so
against that employee we will see the
department as HR and ID now notice this
first employee mark his department ID
value is three so we see his department
as HR ID and the same is true for this
last employee John now if we take a look
at the second employee Mary look at her
department name n/a why is that
that's because HUD Department ID value
is two and four - we don't have a
matching ng-switch case so it falls to
ng-switch default and we get to see na
against Mary now we don't want to be
checking for three twice so let's undo
our change that's it in this video thank
you for watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
