am venket this is part 71 of asp.net
video series in this session we'll
discuss about custom errors in asp.net
in the previous session of this video
series we have discussed about error
events error events can happen at the
page level and at an application level
let's quickly recap what we have
discussed in the previous session of
this video series I have this waveform 1
dot aspx and on that i have a grid we
control I also have this XML file which
lists the countries we want to display
these countries within the grid view
control on this waveform 1 and to do
that we are creating an instance of the
data set object and then we are invoking
the read XML method which can read the
XML data from the XML file into the data
set and that data set in turn is used as
the data set data source for the grid
view control and we are calling the data
bind method and as you might expect once
we run this application it reads the XML
data loads into the grid view control
and we have it on the web form as
expected now just imagine what's going
to happen if somebody deletes this XML
file so if we delete that and if we try
to access that waveform one dot aspx
again it tries to read that file and we
will get an exception and at the page
load event procedure level we don't have
a try-catch block so obviously that
exception gets propagated to the page
level and at the page level we don't
have you know page underscore error
event handler so it's not handled at the
page level as well so it gets propagated
till the application level and at the
application level we have application
underscore error event handler within
global dot ASX file now if i uncomment
this okay look at what we are doing here
we are getting the exception using get
server dot get last error method and
then we can do whatever we want with
that exception maybe we can log it to a
database or to the event viewer or we
might even send an email to the
development team notifying them about
the exceptional condition and then we
are clearing the error and finally we
are redirecting the user to errors dot
aspx page and if you look at errors dot
aspx page it's a pretty simple page that
has caught this HTML which notifies the
you
that there is an application error okay
so now if we run this once again as you
might expect instead of you know we get
an exception but since there is a
centralized exception handler in global
dot ASX file we get redirected to that
errors dot aspx file as expected but for
the time being let's comment
what's there in global dot is a X file
so now we don't have any kind of
exception handling so obviously when we
run this we get that ello screen of
death and displaying that screen is bad
for many reasons ok so we get this hello
screen of that now let's actually see
how to use custom arrow pages now we can
configure custom arrow pages at two
levels at the page level and at the
application level first let's see how to
configure custom arrow pages at the
application level now to configure the
custom error pages at the application
level we use custom errors element ok
and we said the more attribute to own in
fact it it can also take values like off
and remote only we'll talk about that
just in a bit and then default redirect
we are saying default error page dot
aspx and then look at this here we are
using some error status code so what are
these these are called HTTP status codes
ok now there will be HTTP response codes
coming back you know depending on the
HTTP response code of status code we can
actually redirect the user to specific
pages for example you know if we have if
we are navigating within an application
and we are trying to type in the URL of
a page that does not exist then you know
obviously we get an error message saying
page not found so under those
circumstances for example where the
status code is 404 I want to redirect
the user to my own custom error page
page not found error page I can do that
using these HTTP status codes
unauthorized if you are trying to access
an unauthorized page then you will get
an HTTP status code of 401 and similarly
if there is an unhandled exception
happening on the server then it's called
as status code 500 that's internal
server exception ok so depending on the
state of data
scores you can redirect the user to
specific pages okay
so let's see how to do how to configure
that so within web config file I'm using
this custom errors element let me
uncomment this now so now the mode is
set to on default redirect is this one
okay now let me actually run this
application so we have webform one dot
aspx okay now we get you know an
internal server exception why because we
have an exception here and then if you
look at web config exception is status
code 500 and we are redirecting the user
to internal server error page and if you
look at that page it's a pretty simple
aspx page that has just this h1 saying
this message internal server error so we
are redirecting the user to that page
and that's being done automatically for
us look at the user URL
internal server error okay on the other
hand if you don't have that status code
for example in web dot config file let's
say if I don't have the status code then
what's going to happen let me try to
access this if I don't have that status
code then the default redirect page will
be you so default error page and what is
that one look at the URL it's default
error page tour aspx so what is that
page where is that configured that is
configured in default redirect since I
don't have that status code here this
default redirection page will be used on
the other hand if I try to navigate to
maybe you know some garbage like this I
don't have this wave form a web form
with that name and for 404 page not
found status code I have configured I
not show this page page not found error
page which simply says no page not found
and that's what we see here so custom
error pages you know depending on
different HTTP status codes you can have
users redirected to you know specific
error pages that you specify within your
web config file it is also possible you
can have custom error pages at the page
level and how do we do that using error
page at
buuuut so for example if at all if there
is any error on this webform one dot
aspx then for this webform alone i want
to show a specific custom error page is
that possible absolutely and how do we
do that we use this error page attribute
at the page level and then you can
specify whatever you want for example
let's say I want to show this
unauthorized error page tour aspx and if
just to make sure we are not using that
here so if there is an unhandled
exception on this page then I'm going to
get that exception I mean get to that
page
unauthorized the page and that's what we
see here okay
and now the important point is you know
the mood attribute in fact this is asked
as a very common interview question as
well you know what are the different
attribute I mean what are the different
values that a mode attribute can take
and what happens when we set it to offer
on or remote only now first before we
discuss about these attributes let's
discuss about the way a web application
is accessed and the terms used in
accessing that now on my machine I have
the web server the application is
running on my machine so if I access
this on my machine then I'm accessing it
locally but then if this web application
is present in an intranet or an Internet
then this web application can be
accessed from a remote machine as well
all they have to do is fire up the
browser type in the URL of this
application and you are accessing that
from a different machine so which means
you are accessing that remotely on a
remote machine whereas if I access this
on this website on this laptop then this
is I'm accessing it locally okay so when
you set the attribute the more attribute
to on then customary pages are displayed
both on the local machine and remote
machine whereas if you set it to off
then customary pages are not displayed
anywhere instead that exception page is
shown whereas if we set it to remote
only then on local machine you know the
exception page is shown so that the
user's you know the developers who are
debugging the application on the local
machine can figure out what what is that
exception and resolve it but whereas for
remote users the configured
Mehta pages are shown and that's why you
know this remote only is the default and
that's okay because to show the
customary pages on local machine is fine
okay
now another important point to keep in
mind is if the redirection is done in
application underscore error demon
handling global dot asex custom error
pages will have no effect so which means
in global dot asex file let's go ahead
here and let me uncomment this so if you
look at this here
I am redirecting the user to errors dot
aspx page ok and the application enters
we are doing that within this
application underscore error event
handler so when we run this now if you
look at this waveform it also has got
error page now if you look at this
waveform one dot aspx it has got this
error page attribute we have configured
custom errors in web config file and
within global dot a si X file we have
this redirection happening here
okay now which one will have precedence
will this errors dot aspx PHP shown or
will unauthorized error page be shown or
whether this default error page be shown
now it turns out that this error page
attribute at the page level will have
higher precedence over global dot SI x
and then in our web config but then if I
get rid of this error page attribute
then the user will be redirected to you
know errors dot aspx on the other hand
if I don't have this redirection here
and if I am NOT doing the exception
handling here then web config so that's
the Proceedings error page attribute at
the page level global dot a say X 3
direction and then web config custom
errors okay but then in real time it's
not common it's not very common to
actually use error page attributes at
the page level we either use custom
error pages or except you know reader
exception handling and redirection in
global dot AAS ax you know I personally
haven't used custom error pages a lot
you know a lot of time in lot of the
projects you know
use application underscore error because
we can handle the exception do whatever
we want and redirect the user wherever
we want okay so we have greater
flexibility here then you know using
custom error pages but in interviews a
lot of questions are surrounding this
custom error pages so it's good to
understand these concepts as well okay
so if the redirection is done in
application underscore error event
handler and global dot aax custom error
pages configured in web config they will
have no effect okay in your application
if you have to display specific custom
error pages for specific HTTP status
codes then use custom errors if you just
have one generic error page then global
dot a si X can be used and please note
that the exception object needs to be
retrieved before the user is redirected
to a custom error page because a custom
error page is displayed three reaction
the context of the error is lost and
silver dot cat last error returns
nothing from the target customer page so
what I mean to say by this is for
example if you look at what's happening
let's close all these windows let's go
to window closed all document let's save
that and let's go to global dot ASX file
okay
now let's say I'm not handling the
exception here I'm just you know an
application underscore error even
handler
I'm just redirecting the user to errors
dot aspx page and within errors dot aspx
I am trying to retrieve the exception
and then kind of to my exceptional
handling and logging there will I be
able to do that will I be able to
retrieve the exception here let's see
that okay so let's put a breakpoint here
and let's also put a breakpoint in
application underscore error and let's
try to access this waveform let's put
that in debug mode obviously on the page
I don't have a try-catch block so but
there is an unhandled exception on that
page so it gets all the way to
application underscore error event
handler within global dot a si X file
okay so in page load I don't have try
catch I press f5 so it gets to
application underscore error but I
not you know handling the exception here
I am simply redirecting the user to
errors dot aspx and then when I get to
the page load of errors dot aspx let's
see what happens so look at that
you know the exception object is not so
you will have to retrieve that within
that application underscore error
because you will not be able to retrieve
that on this error page where you have
redirected the user because you know
since the user landed on this page
through a redirection the error is lost
on this slide you can find resources for
asp.net c-sharp and sequence of
interview questions that's it for today
thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
