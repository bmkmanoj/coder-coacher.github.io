in this video we'll discuss the concept
of even bubbling in JavaScript let's
understand even bubbling with an example
let's first design a web page that looks
like this we are going to have three
elements div span and a button and we
want these three elements to be nested
inside each other we want the button
element to be present inside span
element and the span element should be
present inside the development so here I
have HTML with head and body sections
within body section first let's include
the development and let's include on
click attribute for the development so
when we click the development we want to
alert the message saying they've clicked
and within there we want to display this
message div element and inside there if
we want to have span element and even
with span element we want the on click
attribute and on click off the span
element we want to alert span clicked
and within span element we want to
display this text and then inside span
element we want to include a button so
input type equals button value equals
click me and again with the button we
want to have on click attribute so and
on click of this button we want to alert
the message saying button clicked all
right so with this let's run the page
now the look and feel of this is not the
same as what we see on the slide so in
order to get this look and feel we need
to apply styles for span and
developments so within the head section
let's include a section for style and
here let's define a style class let's
actually name it style class so we want
this div to be displayed like a table
cell so I'm going to use the display
style
display:table-cell and then we want a
border of one pixel solid black and
let's include padding of 20 pixels and
then finally we want the text to be
aligned in center so now let's apply
this tile glass to the de Vence pan
elements so style equals our style class
is actually it's not style we use the
class attribute to associate a style
class with an element and we want to
apply the same style to span elements as
well right so with this change let's
reload the page notice that now the look
and feel is the same as what we see on
the slide now notice that all the three
elements have click even handlers
associated now let's click on the button
and see what's going to happen so when
we click on the button the event is
phrased with a button button control has
got the click event handler so click
even handler process the even so it says
button clicked and then now notice once
I click OK look at this span clicked so
what had just happened now once the
event was handled by the button it got
bubbled up to its parent so buttons
parent element is span element so span
element handled the event and then once
span element has handled the event
it got bubbled up from span to the
development and development also has got
and even handler for click event so div
element was able to handle that event so
that's even bubbling so the process of
even bubbling starts with the element
that triggered the event and then
bubbles up to the containing elements in
the hierarchy now let's see what's going
to happen when we click on this pan
element notice that in our span element
handles the event and from there it
bubbles up to the development
now let's go ahead and remove the event
handlers for span and developments now
we have the event handler for click
event only for development and let's
slightly change this message click event
handled by div element so these changes
let's reload the page and let's click
the button now remember click and span
elements doesn't have even handlers for
click event so when I click on the
button notice that click event handled
by development
let's click span element click event
handled by development now let's click
on development it says click even
handled by development so due to the
concept of even public though buttons
fan elements doesn't have their own even
handlers for click event since they are
nested inside a development which is the
parent you know the event and and
because of the concept of even bubbling
you know the click event is still
processed by the div element so that is
even bubbling when the even gets bubbled
the keyword this reference that's the
current element to which the event is
bubbled to let's understand what we mean
by the statement with an example so we
want to have three developments like
this they want Eve to dip three nested
inside each other now when I click on
div three we want to change the border
color of all the three developments to
red color as you can see okay so let's
see how to achieve this first of all
let's arm you know include three
developments on the page so dev let's
give this an ID of div one
and let them give one we want to display
this text give one and inside the one we
want another div so let's copy that and
change the text to div two and inside
div 2 if we want another div tag so ID
is going to be deep three and the text
on that is going to be different now
let's change the border of div to five
pixels let's reload this page so we need
to apply this tile class so that we get
the look and feel that we see here so
let's apply this tile class to all the
divs
all right so with these changes let's
reload the page so we have all the three
three divs there now with the black
border because that's what we have
initially specified in the style now
let's include a script section
and here let's create a variable let's
call it div elements then let's use the
document object so document dot get
elements by tag name so we are going to
get all the elements which are going to
have this div tag so this is going to
written as all these three developments
now let's use a for loop here
so for VAR i equals zero I less than
developments dot length i plus plus dev
elements of i dot on click so we are
going to associate an even handler for
the click event for each development so
this is the function that we want to be
executed when the click event happens on
each of the developments so now notice
within this function I'm going to use
this keyword so this dot style dot back
border color
as they equal to red and let's alert the
message you know saying which of the div
elements border is changed now notice
each development has got an ID
associated with it so let's retrieve
that ID and again to do that I'm going
to use this keyword this will reference
the current element on which the event
is triggered so this dot get attribute
and then to this function
let's pass ID so we want to retrieve the
ID attribute value and then put that
let's append you know border color
changed
all right so now let's go ahead and run
the page notice that when I click on tip
3 so the background color is change I
mean the border color is changed to red
this tip 3 border color change now once
I click OK though we have clicked inside
div 3 they even get bubbled up so it
goes to its parent that is div 2 so once
I click OK notice that div 2 border is
changed once I click OK on that it gets
bubbled up till div 1 okay now is it
possible to stop even bubbling by
default the events above all but is it
possible to stop even bubbling yes you
can to stop even bubbling within ie8 in
the earlier versions we use this even
dot cancel bubble equals true with IE 9
and later versions and all the other
browsers we use this top propagation
method on the event object
remember event objects get passed to the
event handler method so within that even
handler method we can stop the
propagation you know from bubbling so
let's look at that in action so what we
basically want to do is you know when we
click on let's say for example on div 3
we want to change the border color of
only dip 3 we don't want that even to be
bubbled up and then ending up changing
the border of div 2 and dip 1 as well
okay if I click on d3 only div 3 border
should be changed if I click on the 1
only the one border should be changed at
the moment notice if I click on give to
give to and div 3 border I mean the one
border will be changed if I click on div
3 then all the three borders will be
changed we don't want that you know
bubbling up so let's see how to stop
even bubbling so here this is the even
handler function now we know that then
the event is raised to the handler
function the event object gets passed we
discussed that in our previous video
session so the event object once we have
the even table
I'm going to say event equals event or
vendo event the reason we have to use
window dot event is because in Internet
Explorer 8 and earlier versions if you
want to get the event object you have to
use the window dot event okay so for
compatibility reasons I'm using or
window dot event otherwise we can just
use this event object
now if event dot now what is the method
that we use with ie9 and later versions
stop propagation so if even dot stop
propagation if this method is supported
then you know we want to use that so
basically this is for ie9 and later
versions and all the other browsers okay
because this is the method that we use
to stop propagation in those versions of
the browsers else we need to account for
IE 8 and earlier versions with IE 8 and
earlier versions we use even dot cancel
bubble equals true so event dot cancel
bubble equals true so these changes
let's go ahead and run the application
so now we have stopped even bubbling so
now when I click on dip 3 notice that
the background color is changed once I
click OK notice that the event is not
bubbled up let's reload the page let's
click on div 2 so div 2 border color
changed but the event is not Bubble DAP
ok that's because we have stopped even
bubbling thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
