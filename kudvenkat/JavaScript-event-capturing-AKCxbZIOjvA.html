in this video well disk is even
capturing in JavaScript in part 40 of
this video series we discussed what even
public is in detail with even bubbling
the events get bubbled up from the
innermost element to the outermost
element in the Dom hierarchy with even
capturing the opposite happens the even
gets captured from the outermost element
to the innermost element in real world
event capturing is rarely used let's
understand even captioning with an
example let's flip to visual studio so
notice here within the body section
we've got three developments nested
inside each other and look at the IDs of
these developments we have set them from
Devon to live three and also notice for
each of the developments we have set
their style class to div style which is
defined within the head section so this
style class is going to make the div
element display like a table cell with
five pixels solid black border and when
we run this page it looks like this
notice the div elements are displayed
like a table cell with five pixels solid
black border nested inside each other at
the moment when we click on these
developments notice nothing happens
that's because we haven't assigned an
even handler function for the click
event now let's go ahead and assign a
click event handler function and let's
do that using add event listener method
so within the HTML within the body
section let's include a section for our
script script type equals text slash
JavaScript first let's get all the
developments so I'm going to use a
variable called divs let's use get
elements by tag name function to get all
the developments and we want to get all
the elements that has got div tag so
this variable now is going to contain
all these three div elements now let's
go ahead and use a for loop
so for VAR i equals zero I less than
devs dot length I plus plus gives of I
dot now let's use add event listener
method and remember we dismiss this
method in detail in part 40 of this
video series this method has got three
parameters the first parameter is the
event for which we want to assign the
handler so the event is clicked event
and the second parameter is the name of
the even handler function at the moment
we don't have a click event handler
function so let's first go and write
that function let's call this click
handler and all this function is going
to do is display a message saying which
div element click event is handled for
example if it is div 1 then we want to
display message saying dev one-click
even handle so for that we need the ID
of the development on which we have
clicked and to get the ID attribute
value we are going to use get attribute
function so this dot get attribute of ID
so that's going to return us the ID
value of the development upon which we
have clicked and then 2 that lets up in
this message click event handle
so the second parameter is going to be
the name of the event handler function
in this case click Handler and remember
the third parameter is called phase and
with even bubbling we have set that
parameter to false now when you set the
third parameter to true then even
capturing is enabled if we set it to
false then even bubbling is enabled so
at the moment even bubbling is enabled
so let's save these changes reload the
page and now let's click on live three
element notice that it says give three
click event handle and then the even
gets bubbled up to live too so that's
the reason it says give do click even
handle from there it gets bubbled to its
parent which is different so it's SD one
click even handle so with even bubbling
the even is bubbled from the innermost
element to the outermost element in
drama hierarchy with even capturing the
opposite happens the even gets captured
from the outermost element to the
innermost element that is from div 1 to
div two and then to live three so let's
look at that in action so to enable even
capturing all you do is set this third
parameter to true see if the changes
reload the page and look at what's going
to happen when I click on this div three
element look at that it says do one
click even handle and then it gets
captured two div 2 so it says to click
event handle and then from there it goes
to the 3d 3 click event handle
so with even capturing the even gets
captured from the outermost element to
in the most element from d1 to live to
and then to div three now ie8 in the
earlier versions does not support
addeventlistener method this implies
that even capturing is not supported in
ie8 and earlier versions so obviously
that also implies that this piece of
code will not work in IE 8 and earlier
versions because this add even listener
method is not supported in ie8 and
earlier versions stopping even capturing
is very similar to stopping even public
now we use store
propagation method on the event object
so let's see how to disable or stop
event capturing so this is the even
handle function to this function I'm
going to pass the event object and then
on the event object I'm going to call
stop propagation method
so now let's reload the page and click
on div three notice that it says the one
click event handle and then once I click
OK it doesn't get captured further okay
so when I click div - it still says d1
click vehement
handle and it doesn't get captured
further once you click on Devon it still
says the same thing
now using addeventlistener method with
the last argument set to true is the
only way to enable even capturing if the
third parameter is set to true even
captioning is enable and if it is set to
false even bubbling is enabled if you
want both bubbling and capturing to be
enabled then assign handlers two times
once with the phase parameter set to
false and once with the phase parameter
set to true as you can see here so with
both even capturing and bubbling enable
even so first captured from the
outermost element to the innermost
element and then bubbles up from the
innermost to the outermost element so
let's look at that in action first let's
remove this even dot stop propagation so
now at the moment now we have not
stopped even bubbling or capturing and
here with this third parameter set to
true we have enabled even capturing now
let's go ahead and enable even bubbling
by setting this parameter to false save
the changes reload the page notice that
when I click on div three what's going
to happen so the first the event is
captured from Devon - div - and then -
day 3 and notice that because of that we
get the one click even handle it says
tip - click event handle and
then dip three click aim and handle now
after the captioning phase it start the
bubbling phase so it starts again with
the div 3 and then bubbles from dip 3 to
live - and then - div 1 so once I click
OK it's going to say again div 3 click
event handle and then it starts bubbling
up - div 2 and then - Devon thank you
for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
