in this video well disc is creating
two-dimensional arrays in JavaScript
JavaScript does not have any special
syntax for creating multi-dimensional
arrays instead we create an array of
arrays the example that we have here
creates a two dimensional three by three
array that is an array which is got
three rows and three columns if you look
at element one that's present in row 0
column 0 element 5 is present in Row 1
column 1 and element 9 is present in Row
2 column 2 let's see how to create this
two-dimensional array with three rows
and three columns now a
multi-dimensional array in a Java Script
is actually an array of arrays now in
this example we want to create an array
with three rows and three columns so
first we need to create an array let's
name it my array 1 equals new array and
the size is going to be 3 because we
want 3 rows and what is a
multi-dimensional array in JavaScript
it's an array of arrays we already have
an array with 3 storage locations now we
want to create an array of arrays so
within each storage location of this
array we are going to create another
array with 3 elements so to loop through
each storage location in my array 1 I am
going to use a for loop so for where I
equals 0 I less than 3 I plus plus
my RA one of I equals new array of three
so what is this code going to do for us
within each storage location of this my
array one we are creating another array
with size three okay so now we have got
an array with three rows and three
columns so now we need to populate each
storage location within this my array
one so my array one of true zero column
zero we want to store number one
similarly in my array of row 0 column 1
we want to store number 2 row 0 column 2
we want to store number 3 in the second
row we want to store 4 5 6 so in column
1 we want for column 2 5 and column I
mean column 0 for column 5 1 and column
2 6 of Row 1 to speed things up I have
already typed the required code so let's
paste it here so in the second row we
have 4 5 6 and in the third row that is
the row with index position 2 we have 7
8 9 so we have populated all the storage
locations within this my array 1 now
let's use a nested for loop loop through
each storage location retrieve the
number and then write it to the web page
so I'm going to use a nested for loop
here so for where I equals 0 I less than
3 I plus plus so let's make a copy of
this one and paste it there and let's
rename this variable to j
so we have a nested for loop here
retrieve my RA one of I J and we want to
write the value that is present at that
storage location to the document so
let's use the write method after
printing each number we want a tab space
so I'm going to use ampersand EMS P
semicolon and after printing each row of
numbers we want an HTML break so outside
of the inner for loop I'm going to use
another document dot write and then spit
out HTML break alright so with all these
changes let's run this and as you might
expect we should have numbers from 1 to
9 printed on the webform now if you look
at the code that we have here we have
hard-coded the index positions here and
then storing the numbers within each
individual storage location of this
array to reduce the amount of code we
have to write we can use a nested for
loop like this and then store the
numbers so let me make a copy of this
nested for loop and let's paste it right
here so we can get rid of this HTML
break and now I'm going to use my array
1 of I of J so we need to populate this
with a value for that what I'm going to
use is another variable here let's call
it start initialize that to 1 and then
we are going to store whatever value we
have in this start variable and every
time we want to increment that by 1 so
now when we run this we should still get
the same output that is numbers 1 2 9
printed in three rows okay so obviously
using this nested for loop has reduced
the amount of code that we have to write
and that is this example
now let's see how to perform an addition
between two two-dimensional arrays in
JavaScript so what we want to do is we
want to have a three by three array like
this which is going to store numbers
from one to nine and we want another
two-dimensional array which is going to
store numbers from nine to one okay and
we want to add these two two-dimensional
arrays and the result should be stored
in another two-dimensional array and we
should get this result so when we add
nine to one the result is ten similarly
when we add 8 to 2 the result is 10 5 to
5 it is 10 so in all these storage
locations within the result we should
get number 10 so let's see how to
achieve this so at the moment we have we
already have one two-dimensional array
which has got numbers from 1 to 9 so
that's my array 1 so what I'm going to
do is actually make a copy of this one
and after you know the first array we
want this plus symbol so what I'm going
to do is document dot write write an
HTML break and then let's actually use
ampersand EMS P semicolon which is going
to give us that tab space and then let's
print that plus symbol and then let's
plant to HTML breaks and now we want our
second array so let's make a copy of
this piece of code here and paste it
right here and let's rename this array
name from my array 1 to my array to my
array 1 let's rename that to my array to
replace all occurrences
and in myarray - we should have numbers
from nine to one so we should be
decrementing it okay so by the time it
has reached this line this start
variable will have a value of ten okay
so now in here we are creating my array
two with three storage locations and
then within each storage location we are
creating another array with three
elements so again this is a two
dimensional three by three array now we
don't have to initialize this variable
once again we already have the start
variable and its value at the moment is
number ten so what I'm going to do is
actually move this right here and then
subtract one from it
so ten minus one start variable at the
moment contains nine and we are storing
nine in zero comma zero that is row 0
and column zero and this loop will
continue to populate all the storage
locations from nine to one and then
finally we are using a nested for loop
and printing out the values to the web
page so let's quickly run this and see
if we get the output that we expect so
at the moment we should have two arrays
first array should have one to nine and
second array should have nine to one now
we want to perform addition operation
between those two arrays so first of all
let's make a copy of these lines and we
want equal to symbol so instead of that
plus let's paste that equal to I'm going
to make a copy of this piece of code so
let's copy that
and paste it right there and let's
rename my RA to two myarray three
replace all the occurrences so this is
what is going to populate the storage
locations within my RA 3 now what do we
want to store in my array 3 we want to
add the elements that are present in my
RA 1 and my RA 2 in the respective
storage locations and whatever is the
sum that we get we want to store that in
the corresponding storage location of my
RA 3 so we don't need this start
variable here so let's get rid of that
and then here we are going to use my RA
1 of I of J plus my RA 2 of I of J and
then finally retrieve the values and
print them to the console I mean to the
document using this nested follow so
let's quickly run this and see if we get
the output look at that we get the
output that we expect so pretty
straightforward example there now so far
we have seen how to create a
two-dimensional 3x3 arrays now let's
look at another example of creating a
two-dimensional 3x5 array that is 3 rows
and 5 columns so I'm going to get rid of
all this code so let's delete this code
so at the moment we have the code for my
array1 and if you look at this my array
one it has got three storage locations
now we want to create a two-dimensional
array with three rows and five columns
meaning you know the outer array is
going to contain three storage locations
and within each storage location we want
to have five elements right so this for
loop right here is going to run until
five and we are going to create another
array with five elements so this
actually going to run till three because
in the outer story our array we only
have three storage locations so three
rows and within each row we want five
columns so from 0 till three and then
within each storage location of this
array create another array with five
elements and we are going to start at
100 so we are using a for loop here to
populate each storage location within
the array so the outer for loop is going
to run from 0 to 3 the n now for loop is
going to run from 0 to 5 and we are
going to increment you know the start
variable by 1 and within each storage
location we are storing whatever value
we have caught in that variable and
finally we use another nested for loop
here to print out the values so the
inner for loop should run from 0 to 5 so
when we run this as you might expect we
should have an array with 3 rows and 5
columns so it's that simple to create a
two-dimensional array in JavaScript
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
