tutorial in this video we discuss
writing a transact sequel query to list
all the tables in a sequel server
database this is a very common sequel
server interview question within sequel
server management studio we can use
object Explorer to list all the tables
that belong to a specific database for
example if we have to find the tables
that belong to the sample database we
can simply expand the database with an
object Explorer and then expand the
tables folder and then you can find the
list of tables that belong to the sample
database on the other hand if I have to
write a query to achieve the same then
we can make use of three system views we
can either uses objects cyst or tables
or information underscore schemas or
tables views the SIS objects-- view is
available in sequel server 2000 2005 and
2008 whereas these two views are
available in sequel server 2005 and 2008
only they are not available in sequence
over 2000 now let's see how to use the
cysts or view to retrieve all the tables
that are present in the sample database
let's flip the sequel server management
studio so select star from sis objects
now when I execute this query I get all
the objects that are present NS in the
sequel server sample database you know a
sequel server can have different types
of objects like tables views functions
tool procedures so this view contains
all those objects now if I just want the
tables then I filter on this X type
column so where X type is equal to you
and I execute this query notice that I
get the three tables that are present in
the sample database TBL customer
department department and employee now
this X type you know what does these
codes mean you means user table so we do
I have this list actually you can visit
this MSDN link for all possible X type
column values and
they represent so this URL you can see
that you know F n stands for scalar
function so if you want all scalar
functions then you simply you know
filter on that so I set X type s FN when
I execute that I get the functions that
are available in the sample database if
I want stood procedures on the other
hand the X type for that is P so I
simply say X type is P execute that I
get all the stored procedures similarly
if I want just views then I replace that
with V and I get views so notice that
this one view view employs and I can see
that all right now if I want to know
what are the different types of objects
that are available in the sample
database I can find that out by issuing
a distinct query so select distinct X
type from this objects table so this is
going to tell me the different types of
objects that are available in the sample
database so f n stands for scalar
function so I have scalar functions in
this database i t internal table so it
has got some system tables as well P
stands for procedures that a stored
procedures PK is a primary key
constraint so these are the different
types of objects that are available in
the sample database all right now let's
see how to use the cyst or tables view
you simply say select star from cysts or
tables that's going to return all the
tables in our sample database so select
star from says dot tables so we get
those three tables similarly if I want
views I can simply say it says dot views
and if I want procedures stored
procedures I simply say cyst or
procedures so I see all the stored
procedures within the sample database
notice that there are on 23 stored
procedures
now let us see how to use this
information underscore schema doc tables
view so select star from information
underscore schema tables is going to
give us all the tables as well as views
so if you want just the tables then
filter on the stable type column
similarly if you want just the views I
can use information on schema.org it
only that view which is available in the
sample database view employees now if I
want stored procedures look at that I
don't have procedures instead it's
called routines so when I execute
routines you know select star from
information schema dot routines notice
that I get 24 so it's not only stored
procedures it's also going to return
look at that routine type functions as
well so if you want just the stored
procedures then probably filter on this
column right here alright on this slide
you can find resources for asp.net

questions that's it for today thank you
for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
