this video will discuss why deleting
database records using get request is
bad please watch part 22 before
proceeding with this video first let's
discuss deleting data using ket requests
and then we'll discuss why it's bad to
do so at the moment when I click on this
delete link we get an error the resource
cannot be found look at the URL we are
trying to navigate to a delete action
with an employee controller but within
the employee controller do we have
delete action method no we don't that's
the reason why we get that error to get
rid of this error we need to implement
delete action with an employee
controller but before we do that first
let's implement a stored procedure
that's capable of deleting employee's
data so let's flip to sequel server
management studio so here I have the
stored procedure SP delete employee
which has got this input parameter ID so
once we give it an employee ID the
stored procedure is going to delete that
employees record from this table TBL
employee so this is our first step to
create the stored procedure that's
capable of deleting employee's data once
that is done we need to add a method to
our employee business layer class at the
moment this employee business layer
class has got two methods add employee
save employee let's go ahead and add a
method delete employee which is going to
execute the store procedure that we have
just created so let's give it the ID of
the employee that we want to delete and
here we need to write bit of radio
dotnet code to execute the stored
procedure and to speed things up I have
that already implemented so let's copy
this code and paste it within our delete
employee method and if you look at the
implementation it's very straightforward
all we are doing here is using the
configuration manager class we are
reading the connection string from web
config file and using that connection
string we are building our signal
connection object and then we are
building our sequel command object here
notice that we are specifying the name
of the stored procedure so we have to
tell the command object that it is going
to execute a stored procedure
and we are doing that using the command
type property and next we are building
our signal parameter object because this
stored procedure has got a parameter so
here we are building the parameter
object itself specifying the name of the
parameter and then the value finally
associating that parameter object with
the command object and then we are
opening the connection executing the
command so very straightforward ad or
dotnet code so that's the second step
implement delete employee method within
our business layer and finally with an
employee controller class we need to
implement delete action method so let's
go ahead and do that this method is
going to return action result and let's
call it delete let's give it the ID of
the employee that we want to delete
within this delete action method let's
go ahead and create an instance of our
employee business layer class and then
this class has got this method delete
employee which can actually delete
employees data so we need to pass it the
ID of the employee that we want to
delete and once that is done we want to
redirect the user to index action which
is going to list all the users that's it
these changes let's go ahead and run
this and see if it's going to work as
expected let's navigate to employee
controller and index action and let's
click on this delete and see if the
record gets deleted look at this we have
this Marc record click delete Marc
record is gone so when we click on that
link it's going to issue a get request
to that URL but keep in mind deleting
database records using get request opens
a security hole and it's not recommended
by Microsoft
just imagine what can happen if there is
an image tag in a malicious email as you
can see here so what's going to happen
when we open that email you know the
image tries to load from that URL so it
issues a get request to that URL and
then obviously our controller delete
action method with an employee
controller will be invoked passing in
the ID there
this case employee-id - so the moment we
open the email the employer will
automatically be deleted because it
issues a get request
ok let's actually see that in action so
here I have the same image tag let's go
to this folder here let's create a
notepad so new text document and let's
call it email dot HTM I'm changing the
extension from txt today to HTM so that
I can open that with a browser let's
right-click on that open the HTML file
with a notepad and I'm going to paste
this image tag there so notice the URL
source is equal to we are trying to
navigate to delete action with an
employee controller passing it ID too so
let's save and close that file and let's
check the rules that we have within this
database table at the moment we have
that record that ID is equal to 2 now
let's go to this folder and let's try to
open this and see what's going to happen
of this browser error
let's relaunch the browser look at this
I don't want to restore the previous
session but then the file has loaded but
let's now go ahead and check the table
look at what happened to record with ID
is equal to 2 it's automatically deleted
okay now let's actually change this HTML
to another way so let's open this HTML
file let's get rid of the HTML that's
already there and let's copy this HTML
and paste it so if you look at this HTML
it's very straightforward again within
an anchor tag I have an image tag so
within the image we are saying okay
the source is this one so in sequel and
images folder have the sample image so
which is this one and then that image
tag is actually wrapped inside an anchor
tag so obviously when I save this and
look at the H ref of the anchor tag so
we are trying to navigate to that URL
delete action with an employee
controller passing it the id3 employee
83 at the moment if you look at in
we have that record employees record
with ID is equal to three now let me
open this and see what's going to happen
look at that it shows this image click
to play and we think that it's a video
and once I click on that image it's
going to play that video but then what
is actually going to happen look on the
status bar right here when I hover my
mouse over on that image it's going to
navigate delete action with an employee
controller passing it that ID 3 so I
click on that it deletes that record
that employee ID 3 navigates me back to
index action and look at that I only
have the rest of the two records there
ok so that's why it's not good to delete
employees state I mean to delete data
using get requests so again another
problem if you have you know get
requests deleting data when search
engines index your page they should get
requests and which would automatically
delete the data ok that's why in general
get requests should be free of any side
effects like this meaning it should not
change the state in any way deletes
should always be performed using a post
request we'll discuss are implementing
deletes using post requests in our next
video on this slide you can find
resources face p.net c-sharp and
sequence of interview questions that's
it for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
