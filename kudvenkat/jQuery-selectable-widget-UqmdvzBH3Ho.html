this video well discuss jQuery selector
will reject jQuery selectable widget
allows us to select elements
individually or in a group using the
mouse let's understand this with an
example on this page right here we've
got the weekdays from Monday to Sunday
we want the user to be able to select
the days he or she is available once
that selection is complete we want to
display the selected days as you can see
here so let's see how to achieve this
let's flip to visual studio so on the
page right here if you've got an
unordered list with an ID and then we
have got list items from Monday to
Sunday and then we have this literal
text followed by this development which
is going to display the selected days so
if we view this page in the browser by
default the list items will be rendered
like this but we want those list items
to be rendered like blocks so let's
apply a style class to the list items so
within our page let's include a section
for style and I'm going to specify style
for list items so first of all I'm going
to set the display style property and we
want to display that as inline block and
let's set padding of 20 pixels and a
border of one pixel solid black so let's
save the changes and let's view this in
the browser look at that now the days
are rendered as blocks and another thing
that we want to do is when we move the
mouse cursor over the list item element
we want the mouse cursor to change to a
hand symbol so I'm going to set the
cursor property as well and let's set it
to pointer so let's save the changes
reload this page and look at this the
pointer is now a hand symbol alright now
we want to make those list items
selectable so with our jquery ready
function we are going to find this
unordered list using its ID
so let's use the jQuery ID selector and
on that we are going to call jQuery
selectable function so this is going to
make those list items selectable let's
save our changes and reload this page
all right now I can actually select
these elements so I have selected now
Monday Tuesday Wednesday but there is no
visual feedback saying that these
elements are really selected behind the
scenes what jQuery is doing is it's
actually applying a style class to the
elements that we have selected and to
see what that style class is
let's launch the developer tools by
pressing f12
so within developer tools let's click on
this magnifying glass and find this
Monday list item and look at that that
list item is selected and look at the
class it's applied UI - selected so for
Monday Tuesday and Wednesday it has
applied UI - selected for the other list
items that is from Thursday to Sunday we
don't have that class applied so if you
want to change the style of the selected
list items then use this class on your
page so let's go ahead and do that so
the name of the class is UI - selected
so within our style section I'm going to
include a class UI - selected and for
the selected list items let's change the
background color to green and font color
to white okay so let's save our changes
and let's go ahead and reload this page
and look at this now I'm selecting
Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday and look
at that the background color is changed
to green indicating that those list
items are selected now when we are
actually selecting an item during the
process of selecting you know it doesn't
change the style of the element in any
way now when the item is in the process
of being selected you know a different
class is applied and that is UI -
selecting so
we can override that class as well UI -
selecting and while we are selecting
let's say we want to change the
background color of the element to gray
okay so let's save the changes reload
this page and look at this when I click
on it to select before leaving the mouse
look at that it's gray and when I leave
the mouse it turns to green at that
point that's actually selected look at
that as as I'm dragging the mouse across
look at that the gray style is applied
and as soon as I leave the mouse on
mouse happy when the items are selected
and UI they're selected class is applied
alright so we have selected the day so
now we want to display this selected
days within the development now we know
that for all the selected day days
jQuery is going to apply that you I -
selected class so what I'm going to do
is with our jQuery ready function I'm
going to handle stop event so when is
this event is raised this event is
raised at the end of selection operation
ok so I'm going to associate a function
with this event and how do I know what
are the list items that the user has
selected now any high element that has
got that uy dash selected class applied
we know that that element is selected so
I'm going to find all the elements that
has this class applied UI - selected so
that's our class selector there and I'm
going to use you know the each function
to loop through each selected element
and then I'm going to retrieve you know
the text of it and display that within
the development so let's create a
variable here and let's call that result
and let's initialize that to an empty
string
result says we are looping through each
element result plus equals dollar desu
and this refers to the list item that we
are currently looping over and I'm going
to use the text function to retrieve the
text of that list item and let's append
an HTML break and then finally once we
are done you know looping through each
list item we want to display whatever we
have caught in this result variable
within the development and the
development has got an ID and it is
result so let's use the jQuery ID
selector and find that development so
the ID of the development is resolved
and I'm going to use the HTML function
pass of a variable result all right so
let's save our changes reload this page
and look at this when I select Monday it
displays Monday if I select Monday
Tuesday Wednesday all those three days
are displayed along with it if I select
Friday look at that it's updated and
Sunday so here we have the HTML CSS and
the jQuery code thank you for listening
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
