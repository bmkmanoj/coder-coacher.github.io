venket this is part 95 phase B dotnet
video series in this session we'll
discuss about implementing password
reset link in XP dotnet now if you have
forgotten your password to an
application some of the applications
actually help you recover your forgotten
password so they will ask you a series
of security questions and if you answer
them correctly they will send you an
email with the forgotten password and
remember the forgotten password is sent
in a plain text format to your email
which is definitely not secure that's
why most of the applications these days
actually will email you a link where you
can reset your password okay so in this
session we'll discuss about how to
generate and email that password reset
length let me actually show you how the
password reset link it looks like so
this is how the password reset link
looks like so here you know I have just
generated this using asp.net so if you
look at this it says dear test test is
the username so dear test please click
on the following link to reset your
password and then the link itself and
then finally a signature prism
technologies and if you look at the link
it says HTTP colon four slash four slash
localhost because the application is
running my on my machine so localhost
web application one is the name of the
web application and within this web
application one I have registration
folder
so within registration folder we have
that change of password ok change
password dot aspx change password dot
aspx and then the most important thing
to identify here is it is expecting a
query string I mean it has a query
string parameter their UID and then a
unique number there ok now what is the
purpose of this unique ID we'll bill
discuss about that in the next video
session when we actually reset the
password in this session we'll discuss
about generating this reset link itself
ok so obviously now when I click this
link I will you know access the change
password page and tomorrow using this
unique identifier we'll take this unique
identifier look up the user ID and
then you know provide fields here for
the user to actually change his password
that will be in the next video session
okay now another important thing to
understand is why did we add a change
password register reset password all
these pages to registration folder
that's because within registration
folder may have this web config file and
it says in the authorization element
I'll of users is equal to star meaning
it's going to allow every user access to
this page in spite of whether they are
authenticated or not including the
anonymous users okay and it makes
perfect sense because why will ever any
user get to these pages if they don't
have a username to log in they want to
register with your application so we
should allow anonymous access that's why
register pages within registration
folder and why we'll ever a user get to
Change Password Reset password page
that's because if if they have forgotten
the password they want to reset and
change their password so there's no way
for them to log in and that's why we
have to allow anonymous access to those
pages as well that's why all these pages
are actually present in registration
folder okay now let's go ahead and look
at the steps that are required to
generate this password reset link
obviously the first step is to create
this reset password page itself so I
have this reset password page and if you
look at this page it has very simple
HTML the plain text reset my password
username and then we have a text box
where the user can enter their username
for which we want to reset the password
and then they click this reset password
button upon which we want to generate
that link and then send him send that
link to the registered email okay and
obviously a label control to display the
success or failure of sending that reset
password link okay so that's the first
step we have designed that very simple
HTML I'll have this HTML posted on my
blog as well just in case if you want to
have a look at that later and then when
I click this that's when we want to
actually generate the reset link okay so
the next step is to actually create this
table TBL reset password request now
this lot of text here in this paragraph
we'll worry about that in just a bit
but let's go ahead and create the table
so if you look at this table TBL
Password Reset requires it has got three
columns ID user ID and reset a request
date/time so reset request date/time
that's going to be pretty simple and
straightforward whenever the user
requests the reset link to be sent
that's the date and time and then the
user ID which user ID so if you look at
TBL user's table every user name has got
an ID associated with that so that's the
ID user ID okay which is Cindy that's
this user ID and look at that that's a
foreign key referencing TBL users table
and the ID column and then ID this is
important and that's what you see within
this email that we received the globally
unique identifier it's a 32 bit a unique
number okay so that's that you that's
that's that column UID
I mean ID and that's going to act as the
primary key for this particular table
okay so we want to create this table I
have already created that so if you look
at that table it's going to have that ID
column which is a grid and then user ID
foreign key to the table users table and
reset request date time
okay so what's the next step the next
step is to actually create a stored
procedure okay and let's look at what
the stored procedures is doing hopefully
you'll understand the purpose of that in
a bit okay so if you look at this stored
procedure it's very simple and
straightforward okay
so SP reset password that's the name of
the stored procedure so this stored
procedure is taking in a username so
whatever username that we enter within
this page reset password so whatever
username that we enter in this text box
we will send that to this stored
procedure and what is the stored
procedure going to do that with that
username its Elex okay is there you know
user ID with that username do we have a
user in this TBL users table okay that's
what we are checking where user name
is equal to at username if there is a
record then pick up the user ID which is
t ID and email of that user and store
them in these two variables that we have
okay
and then what we are doing here this is
again very simple here if at user ID is
not now so if the user ID is there if
it's existing in the table then the user
name that he has supplied it's a valid
username for which we want to reset the
password okay so if username exists what
we are doing look at that it globally
unique identifier I'm creating a
variable of type unique identifier and
then I am assigning that to this
variable why am i doing that because we
want to insert a row into this table TBL
reset password requests table okay so we
are going to insert a new row into that
table look at that it has three columns
ID user ID and request reset request
date/time the values are this new grid
that we have just generated and the user
ID where is that user ID coming from
from this variable okay based on the
username we have retrieved that and then
finally the current date and time using
the get date function so we are
inserting that into this table and then
finally since the username exists and we
have inserted a row into this table okay
we you know this it's a success the user
name is there so we want to reset the
password for that user so we are
selecting one as the return code
indicating success and then the grid
itself the globally unique identifier
the 30 to put unique identifier that you
can see here and then the email of the
user to which we want to send the link
okay so we we select them otherwise if
the user name if the user ID does not
exist for the given username then we are
selecting 0 as written code null as the
unique ID and now less email so your
output will look something like this
okay so based now we will go ahead and
create the stored procedure
then we will invoke the stored procedure
from our dotnet application and based on
what we get back from this stored
procedure we then you know either send
an email after forming the reset
password link otherwise we'll display an
error message saying that the user name
is not found okay
so I have already created the stored
procedure here so they expand program
ability and then stored procedures you
should see that SP reset password stored
procedure that's exactly the same stored
procedure that we have here okay now
let's go ahead and invoke this on the
reset password link button click event
okay so I have this here and before that
you know I actually have a function
which sends an email to the end user so
let me copy that function to say private
function because I just want to use this
function in this page so that's why I
made this private okay now first of all
let's get rid of these compliation
errors mail message class this is
present in system mail now we have
discussed about sending emails in the
previous sessions of this video series
if you haven't watched that I would
strongly encourage you to do so before
continuing with this session I will
however have a link to sending emails
asp.net video in the description of this
video when I upload that
okay so system dotnet dot mail that's
the namespace which in which we have
mail message class and stringbuilder
class is present in system dot text
namespace so let's go ahead and import
that as well so using system dot text
okay
so what are we doing here this I mean
this method send password reset email
method this method is taking three
parameters the email of the user to
which we want to send this email and the
username because if you look at the
email it says dear test what is test if
you look at the TBL user table test is
the name of the user I mean that's the
user name okay so we need the user name
we need the two email address and we
need this globally unique identifier as
well so these are the things that
are actually passing to this send
password reset email method okay so what
we are doing here we are creating a mail
message object okay
with the from and two emails okay now to
email I'm using the parameter as it is
because when we invoke this method
that's when we will passed it to email
and then look at this all these lines
are actually building that link that you
see here I mean basically this body we
are building this body here so how
should our body look like you know dear
username where is username coming from
it's coming as an input parameter to
this method so dear username and then to
HTML breaks that's why you see two lines
here between da test and then please
click OK and then please click on the
following link to reset your password
and that's what you see here and finally
one HTML break and then look at the link
I am forming here HTTP colon four slash
four slash
localhost web application one
registration folder change password aspx
UID is equal to whatever unique ID that
we are going to pass in to this method
we are appending that to that link and
then again to HTML break so that we get
two line breaks and then finally presume
technologies within bold HTML so that is
the entire body
okay email body and that's what you see
here okay so once we have the email body
look at that this is important mail
message is body hTML is equal to true
otherwise this break elements will be
shown as literal text on the email so
you have to set that to true okay
because we are using HTML within the
body all right
and then we are setting the body
property to that string builder object
now if you're wondering why I be using
string builder object because if you are
modifying a string it's always better to
use string builder object because they
are mutable there are strings of type a
string object or immutable that's why
from a performance perspective use
string builder object if you are
modifying it multiple times okay and
then we are setting that as the body and
then the subject is reset your password
and that's what you should see here
within the subject
- your password and SMTP client
basically I am using Gmail SMTP client
so smtp.gmail.com the port number at
which Gmail SMTP works is 587 so that's
the port there and then obviously we
need to specify the credentials I don't
have my credentials here if you are
sending an email from your account to
somebody else then you use your email
and your password your gmail password
your SMTP client will authenticate and
it is the right password it's going to
send from your account
you know from email address to that
email address an email and finally
Google works on HTTPS so if you look at
this Gmail it works on HTTPS so we have
to set enable SSL to true and finally
send the mail message itself so this is
the method which is doing the work of
sending the email okay but then we need
to provide to this function the to email
the username and the unique ID okay and
where are they coming from they are
coming from your stored procedure so if
you look at the stored procedure you get
the two email and unique ID and where
will you get the username from the
username will actually come from the
reset password page itself on the
textbox they enter the username okay so
we are going to make use of all those
three fields pass them to this method
and you're done okay but then before
that you actually have to invoke the
stored procedure depending on what the
stored procedure is going to return back
to you you know you make a decision
whether to send an email or to show an
error message to the end user
okay so again I have that here and again
it's going to be very simple ad or
dotnet code so let me copy the
implementation of the button click even
there and paste it there okay now let's
get rid of those errors the compilation
errors the configuration manager class
is present in system configuration
namespace and sequel connection sequel
command they are present in system dot
data dot sequel client namespace
and the parameter type the command type
is actually present the command type
enum is present in system dot data
namespace so let's go ahead and import
that okay so that should get rid of the
compilation errors and now if you look
at this this is pretty straightforward
ato dotnet code okay so and we have
discussed about ATO dotnet in a very
great detail I'll have a link to the
area dotnet video series as well if
you're new to that alright so what are
we doing here we're creating I can I
mean the connection string we are
reading the retrieving the connection
string value from web config file so we
have the connection string and web
config file which we are retrieving
creating the sequel connection object we
are using the using statement because
the connection object will automatically
be closed when the scope of that is lost
and then we are creating the sequel
command object and if you look at that
we are invoking the SP reset password
which we have just created so that is
this password that is that's stored
procedures and then we are using the
connection object which we have created
command type we are specifying that it's
a stored procedure and this stored
procedure if you look at that it expects
a username parameter so we need to pass
that to the stored procedure which we
are doing by creating the sequel
parameter object and where is the value
for that username parameter coming from
that's coming from the textbox that's
present on this page so that's the
textbox and then we are adding the
parameter to the command object using
the parameters collection property open
the connection execute the reader and we
are using execute reader because we are
getting a row of data back from the
stored procedure okay and then what we
are doing we are using a while loop to
loop through that reader and then we are
checking the return code so if you look
at what is the return code that we are
getting back so if the username exists
then we are inserting a row into that
table and then we are selecting one as
the return code meaning the username is
present this is the unique identifier
and this is the email of the user now if
you are wondering why we are using a
unique identifier don't worry about that
well discuss about that in the next we
your session when we actually change the
password okay
so select one as the return code
globally unique identifier and the email
of the user okay so we check the return
code it will either be 1 or 0 ok so we
can convert that to a boolean type so
convert the to bully and if it's 1 it
will be converted to true and if it is
true then what we are doing we are
invoking that send a password reset
email method this method that we have
just discussed about it requires an two
email so where is two email coming from
you know in this column as email let's
quickly test this so that you can
understand this properly so I'm going to
pass a username so if you look at TBL
users table so there is a username
called a test so I'm going to send that
as test okay look at that when I execute
the stored procedure look at what I'm
getting back I'm getting one as the
written code a unique ID and the email
that is associated with that username
okay so this is how the data will come
back to the application so within the
application what we are doing we are
converting the return code so what's the
return code that's one that will be
converted to true so it comes inside the
if block and then we are retrieving the
email from this email column and passing
it to this method and similarly we are
retrieving the username where is the
username coming from the textbox itself
and finally the unique ID again the
column name is unique ID so we are
passing that to this method which will
send the email and then finally we
display a message to the user stating an
email with instructions to reset your
password is sent to your registered
email otherwise if if the username is
not found then we display you know
username not found error message which
is simple and straightforward okay now
if you look at what has just happened
you know since we have tested this if I
plus a five you know select star from
that TBL reset password request look at
that it generated that unique identifier
user IDs one if you look at TBL users
stable so for tests what is the user ID
that's one and this is the date and time
I have requested a reset link to be sent
okay so actually if I run this now this
is not going to practically send an
email now because I don't have my actual
Gmail username and password here okay
but if I enter an invalid user name here
and click reset password look at that
username not found but if I enter a
valid email address it's going to fail
now after some time it will throw an
exception and will fail look at that
button it's sending an email it fails
because the SMTP server requires a
secure connection or the client was not
authenticated so I didn't provide a
valid email address here and the
password that's why it didn't fail but
if you are testing it give your email
address in your Gmail password it's
going to send an email just like this to
your inbox okay so in this session we
have discussed about how to actually
send in a password reset link in the
next video session we will see how to
actually change the password using that
reset link and in that process we will
also understand why are we using this
globally unique identifier why can't we
use this integer user ID instead of that
on this slide you can find resources for
asp.net c-sharp and sequence of
interview questions that's it for today
