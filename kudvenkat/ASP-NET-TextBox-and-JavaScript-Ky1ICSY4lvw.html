asp.net tutorial in this video we'll
discuss javascript focus and select
methods and how to count the number of
characters as you type in a text box and
display that count in a label control
first let's discuss the JavaScript focus
method focus method is used to put the
keyboard cursor in a particular text box
when the web page loads so that we can
start typing without having to first
click in the text box with the mouse
let's understand this with an example on
this webform we have this little text
name followed by the asp.net text box
control let's load this page and look at
this if we have to type something into
this name textbox notice that at the
moment the textbox control does not have
the keyboard focus so for that control
to receive the keyboard focus we will
have to first click with the mouse in
the text box so now it has got the
keyboard focus and that's when you know
we can type and whatever we type is
going to be displayed within the textbox
control now what we want to do is as
soon as the web page loads we want to
set the keyboard focus to this
particular textbox and to achieve that
we can use focus method notice here we
are calling focus method on this text
box one control let's save these changes
now when we reload this page it's going
to receive I mean this text box is going
to receive the focus automatically look
at that when I reload the page look at
that the text box receives the focus
automatically without we having to click
with the mouse in that text box so
that's the use of focus method focus
method can be used with most HTML
elements as we look at the example right
here on this web page we've got a text
box control for name and a drop down
list for gender now let's save in the
web page loads we want to set focus to
the drop down list so when we set the
focus to the drop down list we can make
a selection in the drop down list
without using mouse you can simply click
the alt and down arrow
keys simultaneously and then make your
selection so in this example we are
setting focus to the drop-down list to
speed things up I already have typed the
required HTML so let's copy that HTML
and paste that into this webpage so at
the moment we are not setting focus to
any of the controls on the webpage so
when this page loads no control that is
text box or drop-down list none of them
will receive the focus now we want to
set focus to this drop-down list so
document dot get element by ID and the
ID of the drop-down list is drop-down
list 1 and on that we are calling the
focus method let's save the changes
reload the page look at that when I
reload the page look at that there is a
blue border around the drop-down list
indicating that it's already having the
focus so now when I press Alt + down
arrow key simultaneously on the keyboard
I can see the selections and I can make
you know whatever selection I want from
that drop-down list so using focus
method you can focus any element on the
web form I mean it works with most HTML
controls now let's look at the Select
method select method is used to select
the contents of a text field so when you
start typing the new text that you have
typed will automatically replace the
existing selected text you can use
select method with text box and text
area controls now in this example we've
got a single line text box and the
multi-line text box now what we want to
do is within the multi-line text box we
want to display this default text which
says type your comments here and then
when the web page loads we want that
select you know the text within the
comments text box to be selected so that
when we start typing you know the new
text that we type will automatically
replace the text that is already there
now to get a multi-line text box in
asp.net all we do is use the regular
text box and
the text mode to multi-line so let's
look at that in action so instead of
this drop-down list let's include a text
box control let's actually make a copy
of this and let's change the text here
to comments and let's set text mode to
multi line and then default text to
something like type your comments here
okay now let's go ahead and reload this
page look at that we have the name
textbox and comments textbox and within
the compact comments textbox we have
this default text that we have specified
using the text property but then at the
moment that text is not selected so if I
have to type something into the comments
text box I will have to first select the
entire text and then I have to start
typing my new text so that is going to
replace that existing text okay now
don't you think it would be better if we
select that text already when the web
page loads so that when we start typing
whatever text that we type that is going
to replace you know the existing default
selected text okay and obviously to
achieve that we can use select function
and we want to select the text that is
present within textbox to control so
let's use that ID here and then when the
page loads look at that type your
comments here that's already selected I
click away let's reload this one more
time look at that type your comments
here that is selected now if we start
typing the new text is going to replace
that existing text now let's look at an
example of counting the number of
characters as we type into the textbox
look at this here we have a textbox
control now as we type the number of
characters that we have typed into that
textbox control should be displayed in
this label control so let's see how to
achieve that
so here we have that name text box as we
type into the name text box we want to
display the count of characters and
let's display that count in a label
control so this is an asp.net label
control let's get rid of this default
text and let's write a JavaScript
function let's call this count
characters so the ID of the text box
that we are going to type into is this
text box one control so document dot get
element by ID and the idea of the text
box control is text box one dot value is
going to give us the value that the user
has typed into the text box and length
property is going to give us the number
of characters that are present within
that text box now we want to display
that length within the label control so
document dot get element by ID and the
ID of the label control is label 1 dot
inner HTML equals the length and then we
want to display you know up in this word
characters as well
so let's save these changes load the
page and look at this as we type the
number of characters should be displayed
in the label control but it's not
displaying them that's because we are
not calling that function so let's call
this function on key up event so on key
up
we are calling this Count character so
every time we release a key on the
keyboard this function will be called
and it's going to figure out you know
how many characters we have type into
the textbox using the length property
and then it's going to display that
within the label control so let's save
these changes reload this page one more
time now look at this as we type the
number of characters are displayed in
the label control thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
