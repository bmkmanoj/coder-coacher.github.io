this video we'll discuss jQuery class
selector that is selecting elements
using this CSS class name here is this
impacts to the jQuery dollar function we
pass this CSS class name with a dot in
front of it and within quotes so this is
going to find all elements with that
class name jQuery class selectors use
javascript native get elements by class
name function behind the scenes if the
browser supports it we have a few
examples here notice within the first
function we are passing small as the CSS
class name so this is going to find all
elements with that class the second
example is going to find all elements
with plus small or class bag and the
third example is going to find all
developments with class small and any
element with class big let's look at
these in action now let's flip to visual
studio so here we have a span and a
development and both of these elements
have class small and we have another
span at a paragraph elements here and
both of these elements have class pic'
now what we want to do is find all
elements with class small and set a 5
pixel solid red border around them so we
want to find elements with class small
and these are the two elements with
class small okay so within the ready
function we are going to use the dollar
function and then we want to find
elements with class small so I'm going
to specify small as the class name and
with a dot in front of head so this is
going to find all elements with class
small and for those elements we want to
set a border so I'm going to use the CSS
function and specify the name of the
property as border and the value is
going to be 5 pixel solid red let's save
the changes and when we reload the page
both of these elements that is the span
and development should have a red border
around them there we go now let's find
all elements with class either small or
big
and if you look at this HTML all the
elements either have plus small or big
okay so but this expression here is
going to find only elements with plus
small now we also want to find elements
with class big so I'm going to put a
comma and then dot big okay so let's see
if this changes and when we reload this
we should get a red border around you
know all the elements okay because these
elements have a the class small or big
now let's select elements with class
small so we want to select any element
with class small but only span elements
with class big okay so at the moment
this is going to select any element
which have a that last small a big okay
but our requirement now is to select any
element with class small but only span
elements with class big so I'm going to
prefix this dot big I mean the second
CSS class name with the element name so
span big so this is basically going to
tell find all the span elements with
class bake okay so at the moment this is
the span element with class big so that
should be selected and these elements
have got class small so both of them
should be selected but this is a
paragraph element with class play big so
this should not be selected so when we
save this changes and when we reload
this page the border on the paragraph
element should be removed there we go
all right now let's select elements with
class small that are nested in an
element with ID equals div 2 we need a
different HTML for this I already have
that in the notepad let's copy and paste
that within visual studio I'll have this
HTML available on my blog in case you
need it
so let's paste that within our body
section here so basically if you look at
this HTML they've got you know a div
here at ID Devon and there's another div
here with ID div two and inside this div
we have another day
okay and span okay both this div and
this pan are nested inside this div
again this div has an idea of div two
now what we want to do is find all those
elements that are nested with another
element with ID div two and if the
elements has class small then we want to
set a five pixel solid red border around
them okay so what is our requirement we
want to find you know an element with ID
div two so I'm going to use the ID
selector which is hash and the ID of the
element is div 2 this is the one so div
two and we want to find all nested
elements so I'm going to use a space
remember the ancestor and descendant
syntax so ancestor is here the element
with ID div - and you know whatever we
are going to specify here is going to be
the descendant so what do we want to
find any element that has CSS class
small so I am going to specify the class
name as dot small and then remove the
rest of it there so basically this is
telling find all the elements that are
nested inside an element with ID div -
and that has got class small so both of
these elements which are nested inside
this element with ID div to have that
class small so there will be a red 5
pixel border around them
ok so let's save this changes and when
the real oh look at that
this Deven this pan is nested under that
div too so they have a red border now if
we remove this CSS class what is going
to happen now this element will not
satisfy this selector so that will not
have a red border only the span which is
nested inside this div element with ID
div - will have the border so when we
reload that look at that only the span
element has the red border around it
now let's select all elements with class
small and set five pixel solid red
border again we need a different HTML
for this so let's copy this and let's
paste it with another visual studio so
this is straightforward HTML we have two
developments the first div has two
classes small and big and the second div
has only one class small now if we write
something like this you know dot small
then this is going to find any element
that has that class now both of these
divs have that class small so now when
we reload this page both the divs should
have a red border around them okay but
now our requirement is to select all
elements that has both the classes small
and big and if you look at these two
divs here only this div has both the
classes but not this step
okay so we want to select only those
elements which has both the classes
small and big and to do that I'm going
to specify the second class name dot big
notice there is no space between the
first and second class name so this is
going to ensure that it's going to
select you know elements that has both
the classes so let's reload that look at
that only div one is selected because
that is the only element with both the
class names all right now what is going
to happen if we have a space between you
know the class names then the meaning is
entirely different basically we are
saying in this case find all the
elements that have class big and that
are nested inside an element that has
class small okay so again this one is
ancestor
I mean ancestor descendant syntax okay
so basically what is this going to do
when we save these changes and when we
reload this page we are not going to get
bored
on any of the elements because none of
these elements satisfy that selector
okay but then if I'm going to have let's
say inside this div another div and then
let's set the CSS class of that to big
and let's say this is stiv 3 let's
include an HTML break okay
so now if you look at this HTML we have
a div here which has got the class big
and that element is nested inside
another element which has class small so
this element is satisfying this selector
so this div should get a red border
around it so when we reload this page
look at that div 3 gets a red border
around it now if we have you know code
like this without a space in between the
class names then this is going to select
this div because that's the dev which
has both the classes okay so this is one
way to do it another way is by using
filter method so basically I can say
okay find this one is going to find all
elements with class small and then what
I'm going to do is use filter method and
then find all elements with class big
and then apply the CSS function okay but
this you know it's lower than the
previous version where we have used the
class names without space between them
okay because what is this going to do
this is going to first build a list of
elements you know which has class small
and then it's going to remove any
element that does not have class big and
then apply the border okay so it's
happening in two steps here whereas in
the other example that is using the
class names without space between them
that happens in one go so when we save
these changes and when we reload you
know the behavior should be exactly the
same but we are here we are using the
filter method
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
