this video we'll discuss how to check if
the request method is a get or a post in
MVC this is continuation to part 143 so
please watch part 1 43 before proceeding
with this video in asp.net webforms
we can use east post back property to
check if the request is a get or a post
request this is post back property
belong to the page class that is present
in system dot web dot u i namespace we
don't have this page class in asp.net
MVC so to check if the request is a get
or a post request in MVC we use HTTP
method property of the request object
let's look at using this with an example
here I have a blank asp.net MVC for
application first let's add a controller
and let's name it home controller and
let's include a private method within
this controller and I want this method
to return a boolean true or false so if
it's a post request then we want this
method to return true otherwise false so
let's name this method is post or you
can give it any meaningful name you want
and we use request objects HTTP method
property to check the request time that
if it's a get or the post if you look at
the return type look at this it is
returning a string so if it's a get
request this property is going to return
you know a string get otherwise if it's
a post it's going to return post and we
want this method to return true if it's
a post otherwise false so we are going
to return whatever this expression
resolves to so if this expression is
also to true then we know it's a post
request otherwise it's a get request ok
and we're going to store the value that
met that this method is going to return
in a viewbag object so let's use a
viewbag object and let's use a dynamic
in here we can give it any meaningful
name so let's use East postback and we
are going to set the value to whatever
this method is going to return and we
want this method to respond to the get
request HTTP GET request let's make a
copy of this index action method and we
want this index action method to respond
to HTTP POST request okay and if we try
to build this at this point we'll get a
compiler error that's basically because
within a controller you can't have two
methods with the same signature so let's
go ahead and change this to index
underscore post and then let's use
action name attribute and specify that
we want this to respond to this action
name with the URL index action all right
now let's go ahead and add a view let's
name it index and let's include an h3
tag here is post back equals whatever we
have stored in the view bag object so
within view bag we have used this
dynamic expression so that's going to
print that you know whatever value that
is stored in that property now let's
also include a submit button here let's
put that inside a form tag so let's use
this using statement
so this big inform helper is going to
generate the form tag for us and we have
wrapped that call inside a using block
so that a closing form that is also
automatically generated and then here
let's include an input type equals
submit and the value on that equals
submit all right so let's go ahead and
run this now
so we should actually navigate to the
index action let's actually run with
debugging so that we can actually place
a breakpoint and see what does the HTTP
method property returns look at that you
know when we first type slash home slash
index let's actually put a breakpoint
within our controller and let's hit the
submit button look at that now since we
clicked the submit button what did we do
we are issuing a post request okay so
when I + f10 it goes into is post so let
me press f11 now and f10 and look at
this HTTP method what is what is the
string it is returning its returning
post okay so let me press f5 now look at
that is post back true on the other hand
if I click on the URL and hit enter we
are issuing a get request so at that
point you know this action method is
responding and then when we + f10 and
f11 f10 and if you look at the HTTP
method it's a get request so basically
with an asp.net MVC we can use this HTTP
method property of the request object to
check if the request is a get or a post
request that's it for today thank you
for listening - have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
