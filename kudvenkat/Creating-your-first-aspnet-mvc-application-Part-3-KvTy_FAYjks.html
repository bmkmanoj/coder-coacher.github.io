venket this is part 3 of a speed or net
MVC tutorial in this video we'll discuss
about creating an asp.net MVC
application and understand how MVC
request is processed as opposed to a
webform request first let's go ahead and
create an MVC project so let's flip to
visual studio click on file new project
and I'm going to create an asp.net MVC
for web application and let's call this
MVC demo click OK and let's select an
empty template and then look at the view
engine drop-down list I get two options
here meaning we have two built in view
engines aspx and raiser which one do we
use I personally prefer raise a view
engine because it has got much cleaner
cord we'll talk about the differences
between razor and aspx views in a later
video session when we discuss about
views for now let me select razor as the
view engine and click OK so that should
create an MVC project for us now let's
flip to another instance of visual
studio that's running on my machine and
let's create a web forms application so
click on file new project and then this
time I'm going to create an asp.net
webforms application so I am going to
select a speed or net web application
and let's call this web forms demo
alright let's click OK that should
create a web forms application now we
have MVC demo here the MVC project and
notice the solution Explorer within the
solution Explorer we have models views
and controllers you know these folders
as the names suggest they're going to
contain models views and controllers of
our MVC application will discuss about
models and views in detail in a later
video session now let's go ahead and add
a controller to our MVC project and do
that right click on the controller
folder add controller and then give you
a controller a meaningful name I'm going
to call this home controller click add
and that should add
a file with named home controller dot
cs2 the controllers folder okay and this
is nothing but a class file so it has
got this class with the name home
controller and notice this this this
glass actually inherits from the base
controller class ok so what is a
controller it's nothing but a class
which inherits from base controller
class and classes can contain functions
so this controller class has got one
function at the moment which is index
and look at the return type it's
returning something called action result
but this is about this return type
action result in a later video session
for now let's make this index function
return string instead of action result
and what string do I want to return I
want to return a message from this MVC
application function saying hello from
MVC application so that's the string I
want to written so this function very
straightforward all it's doing is
returning a string so at the moment if
you look at this controller it's simple
it's a class and it has got one function
called index which is going to return
this train okay now at this point if I
go ahead and run this by default it's
going to use built-in asp.net
development server look at this it's
using the visual studio built in asp.net
development server but let's deploy this
to is and deploying this to is is very
simple first let's open is and to do
that click on start type run and then
plus enter that should open run window
within run window type I net manager and
hit OK that should open is okay now at
the moment if I expand you know the
virtual directories the websites that
are there in this I as look at this at
the moment I don't have MVC demo so
let's deploy this project MVC demo to is
and to do that right click on the
project go to properties and then on the
web tab you know look at this at the
moment we are using Visual Studio
development server but instead of that I
want to use a local is web server so
that's the radio button under I'm going
to select and then click on this button
clear
eight virtual directory so the virtual
directory was successfully created
so now if we go back to I as we should
have
you know MVC demo created there okay so
now let me go ahead and run this MVC
project let's save that and then if we
run this now you know it should be using
the local is you get here it's using a
random port number meaning it's using
the visual studio built-in development
server but here it's not using the port
number look at this localhost it's
nothing but the name of the server it's
running on my machine and MVC demo is
the name of the project okay
now let's go ahead now let's say I want
to print this message in a web forms
application how do I do that
it's pretty straightforward you know in
a web form you add a web form and in the
load event of that platform you include
a response right and then give it this
message it's just going to write that
message on to the web form so let's do
that quickly and then we'll
differentiate between web forms and MVC
that request processing okay so I'm
going to get rid of this about and
default web forms and then I'm going to
add a web form with name wave form 1 dot
aspx so add new item let's call it form
1 dot aspx and then let's get to the
code-behind file so with the code-behind
file I'm going to say response dot right
hello from web forms application okay so
let's go and deploy this also to is and
to do that simply right click on the
project it's the same process and go to
the web tab and then select use localize
web server by default you know we get a
default directory which is the name of
the project waveform stem or you can
change it if you want to and then click
on create virtual directory that should
create a virtual directory with an eyes
for that let's go ahead and run this now
as you might expect this performs
application should use local is instead
of the built-in web server and then look
at this VR
actually it's still using
the localize for some reason let's say
that is saved properly so let's refresh
this so we should have waveforms demo
there and let's actually save it it
didn't save that I still see that star
symbol there
that's why it's not saved so let's save
it let's run it now and at this point it
should use localize instead of the built
in visual studio built in asp.net
development server okay now let's
understand how these requests are
handled
you know the asp.net webforms request as
opposed to an MVC request so obviously
if you look at the MVC application
notice the URL here it says localhost
MVC demo that's it now what I'm going to
do here is and look at the output we get
that message hello from MVC application
now I'm going to say in the URL so
localhost is the name of the server MVC
demo is the project name and then home
forward slash I'm going to say index and
then press Enter look at that I get the
same you know output so this is the URL
localhost MVC demo home it slash index
and look at the web forms you are a
local host web forms demo web form one
dot aspx okay so we are used to web
forms development so if you look at this
URL this is straightforward in a local
host is the server name web forms the
demo is the project name and web form
one dot aspx that's the name of the file
so this URL actually invokes a file with
named web form one dot aspx so within my
web forms application we have got that
web form one dot aspx so when the
request for this platform is received at
the web server you know obviously all
the events of this Web form will be
processed including the page load event
at which point it's going to generate
this message generate the HTML and send
it back to the requested client so
basically you know within web forms
application you know the URLs are mapped
to the physical files okay here where
form one dot aspx is a physical file
that exists within our asp.net webforms
application whereas in
Vesey application the URLs are mapped to
controllers and controller action
methods okay so basically if you look at
the MVC URL it's localhost that's the
name of the server and MVC demo is the
project as usual so there's no
difference between those two parts in
MVC and web forms but then after that
after the project name you have this
home so this is nothing but the
controller so you know it actually
searches MVC controllers folder by
default is there a controller with name
home and we do have it okay and then
after that it's the function within that
controller okay so home controller and
index function so in invoke this URL is
going to invoke index function that
resides in home controller and obviously
we know all the controllers within an
MVC application are present in
controllers folder by default okay so in
MVC URLs are mapped to controller action
method so usually functions inside a
controller that can respond to URLs are
called as controller action methods okay
but whereas in a web forms URLs are
mapped to physical files okay so in my
MVC project you know if you look at this
I have a home controller and within that
I have index function so you know I get
this message back now let's say instead
of index function I'm saying something
like you know get details for example
and then plus enter what will happen the
resource cannot be found why is that
within home controller I don't have a
function called get details that's why I
get a 404 HTTP status code 404 meaning
the resource cannot be found so if I go
ahead and add get details function to
our controller within this home control
I mean a function to this home
controller plus then it should work so
let me actually copy this and paste it
here and let's call it get details so
that's the name of the function
so get details ok let's save it and
let's call it you know get details
involved ok so now let's actually run
this once again so I get that localhost
MVC demo and the wave form loads look at
that I by default the index function is
called so I'm going to go to the home
controller and then I'm going to go to
get details function ok look at that we
get that message get details invoked now
instead of the home controller if I say
let's say home 1 and then press Enter so
obviously within the controllers folder
we don't have a controller with named
home 1 that's why again we get this
message the resource cannot be found so
the important thing to understand is
that in MVC you know the URLs are mapped
to controller action methods whereas in
web forms URLs are mapped to physical
files will discuss about controllers
models and views in detail in a later
video session on this slide you can find
resources for asp.net c-sharp and
sequence of interview questions that's
it for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
