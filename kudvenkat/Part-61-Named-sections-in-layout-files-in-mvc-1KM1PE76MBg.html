in this video we'll discuss named
sections in layout files please watch
butts 59 and 60 before proceeding we'll
be working with the same example that we
started in part 59 let's understand
named sections with an example but
before we do that we have to undo some
of the changes that we have done in the
previous session now notice that at the
moment this index view uses different
layout file that's because of the
changes that we have done in the
previous session so let's undo them so
within the index view we have specified
this layout property notice that we have
told it to use a different layout file
which is this one let's get rid of this
property so that this very view will use
this layout file so let's save it let's
refresh this now it should use the other
layout file and similarly when we
navigate to the create view it's again
using the different layout file and
that's because within the home
controller within this details
I mean create action method we have
specified in order to use different
layout file and we don't want that to
happen now
so let's get rid of that code from there
let's build a solution and let's refresh
this view so it should use the other
layout file that we have now when we
navigate to details view notice that
it's actually using a partial view we
want that to now use the details the non
partial details view that we have here
okay so look at the details method at
the moment it's returning a partial view
result and the return type is partial
view result and it's returning a partial
view but instead we want this action
method to return action result and to
return a view and then we don't want to
return a partial view so let's get rid
of that and then let's rename this to
details alright but all these changes
let's build a solution and let's refresh
this view so now it should use the non
partial view and that non partial view
should use the other layout file that we
have okay now notice that when we
navigate
- you know index we see that employee
list link there similarly if I navigate
to edit view again I see the same link
similarly if I go to details I see the
same link so this is the navigation menu
that we have in our layout file ok now
what we basically want to do is if I am
on the edit menu
I mean edit view then we want this
navigation menu to be changed to
something like that so since I'm in on
edit view we want list details and
delete links there okay so based on the
view that I am on I want to dynamically
change the menu that we display to the
user okay and let's see how to achieve
this using name sections obviously there
are several ways to do that but let's
see how to use named sections to achieve
that okay so now the first thing that we
have to do is we have to define the
section on the edit view so let's go to
the Edit view and then to define a
section with an edit view we use at
section and then specify a name for that
so the section is going to be menu ok
and then you can specify whatever you
want in that section now what do we want
in the section we want list details and
delete links so just to speed things up
I have the code to generate those links
okay
so let's copy that and paste it right
there so if you look at this that's
straightforward code so all I have here
is three action links so the first
action link you know this the name of
the link and it's going to invoke the
index action index action method doesn't
require any parameter so we don't have
to pass them but then when I am on the
details view or the delete view so
that's the text and that's the action
method which is going to be invoked but
if you have to display an employee
details then obviously you'll have to
specify the ID of the employee and where
are we going to get the ID of the
employee notice the model for this view
it's an employee object so we are going
to get the ID from that model object
okay so using model dot ID so
we are passing the ID and similarly to
delete an employee you need to know the
ID of the employee which again we are
getting from the model object okay so
now we have the section defined on this
edit view now we have to tell where we
want this section to be displayed in the
layout okay so this section so basically
the header the navigation menu the
footer they are defined in the layout
file okay so basically with the layout
file so we want to tell it where we want
that section to be rendered and to do
that we can actually use so this is the
TD which is displaying that employee
list menu at the moment so that's where
we want the menu section to be rendered
so what I'm going to do here is instead
of that I'm going to say at render
section and then you can specify the
name of the section that you want to
render okay so now let's build a
solution and let's navigate to edit view
let's say we want to go to edit view and
then pass an employee ID of one so what
should happen notice that when I go to
the Edit view now whatever action links
that we have defined are displayed here
now let's see what happens when we go
back to the index view so when we
actually click on this it's going to go
back to the index view and notice that
we get an error section not defined menu
okay so what are we saying in the layout
view in the layout view we are saying we
want a menu section to be you know
rendered here but then within the index
view did we define a menu section no we
dint we only defined it in the edit view
so when we navigate to the index view it
tries to load a menu section from the
index view but we haven't defined that
it's a required section so that's why we
have this runtime exception so how do we
fix it there are two ways essentially
one way is to define that section in the
index view the other way is to obviously
make that section optional and how do we
make a section optional very simple you
pass it as a second parameter so bool
required
it's a bool
in parameter if you want that to be
required which is true by default you
know you can pass through otherwise you
can simply pass false so that's optional
the moment we do that now if we go back
and refresh this so we are on the index
view so notice that nothing is displayed
now I don't want this to be like this if
you know a specific view has not defined
that section let's say by default I want
to display the employee list a link then
what we do you can specify a default you
know content for that section within
your layout file and basically what we
have to do is if you know if that
section is defined in that view then we
want you know basically to use that
section which is defined in that view if
not then we want to use the default
content that is specified in the layout
file so how do how do we know if a
specific view has you know that section
defined okay there is a function f so
obviously this is c-sharp code so ad F
section is section defined so we have
that function and specify the name of
the function section so if the menu
section is defined then go ahead and
render that section else we want to have
some default content so what is that
default content we want to render an
employee list link and how do we do that
we can use HTML action link HTML helper
and then let's say we want the link name
to be something like Employee List and
we want to navigate to which action in
this index action it doesn't take any
parameters so we don't have to pass any
parameters okay
so let's pull the solution and let's
refresh this so now ICD employee list
link there similarly if I go to details
view we don't have menu section defined
in details view so we have the employee
listening on the other hand if I go to
the Edit view
notice that the navigation menu is
different because we have that menu
section defined there all right
so this is exactly the same piece of
code that we have just written on the
slide you can find resources for asp.net
c-sharp and sequence of interview
questions that's it for today thank you
for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
