questions video series in this video
will answer this interview question what
happens if finally block throws an
exception this interview question can
also be asked in a slightly different
way how to handle exceptions that occur
in finally blog so what actually happens
if finally blocked throws an exception
three things happen one the exception
propagates up and should be handled at a
higher level if the exception is not
handled at the higher level then the
application crashes with the exception
that has occurred let's understand this
with an example
let's flip to visual studio here I have
a console application let's include
another method here let's call this
hello and let's include a try block a
catch block and a finally block and
within this finally block let's write
some code that would cause an exception
to occur let's try to convert this
string to an integer
obviously runtime will not be able to
convert the string to an integer we will
have a format exception now let's call
this hello method within main method
alright notice that at the higher level
that is the place where this hello
method is called we don't have any
exception handling mechanism in place
obviously when we run this program the
application is going to terminate with
the exception that has occurred in the
finally block now let's try and include
exception handling mechanism at the
higher level that is within the main
method where we are actually calling
this hello method
so since we are using exception handling
mechanism here at the higher level we
have the opportunity to handle the
exception that has occurred within the
finally block of this hello method let's
print the exception message to the
console in reality we will that we may
actually log the exception message to an
event viewer or to an XML file or to a
database table let's go and run this now
look at that the application doesn't
crash since we have exception handling
mechanism at a higher level we have the
opportunity to handle that exception so
what's the second thing that can happen
the finally block execution stops at the
point where the exception is thrown so
if we look at this finally block this is
where the exception is thrown
now let's include a console dot readline
statement here so let's say this line
will be executed
so obviously this line is present before
the exception is occurring so obviously
this piece of code will be executed but
at this line we will have an exception
occurring
so obvious license there is an exception
at this line you know the execution is
going to stop at this line okay so this
line will not be executed
so let's actually run this look at that
we have you know this line printed but
this line is not printed why is that
because there is an exception at this
point because of which you know the
processing is stopped at this line so
the finally block execution stops at the
point where the exception is thrown
three if the finally block is being
executed after an exception has occurred
in the try block and if that exception
is not handled and if the finally block
throws an exception then the original
exception that occurred in the try block
is lost let's understand this with an
example so let's say here we are
throwing an exception
let's call this try block exception
and let's say we don't have this catch
block here and written define lead lock
we are throwing another exception okay
look at this let's go and run this now
so we are able to handle the exception
that has occurred in the finally block
but what about the exception that
occurred in the try block look at this
there is an exception occurring here
okay now we know that irrespective of
whether there is an exception or not
finally block is going to be executed
you know it's guaranteed to execute now
this exception has occurred within the
try block and we are not handling that
exception within this method and there
is another exception happening within
the finally block and as a result the
original exception that has occurred in
the try block is lost okay so if the
finally block is being executed after an
exception has occurred in the try block
and if that exception is not handled and
the finally block throws another
exception then the original exception
that occurred in the try block is lost
alright that's it for today thank you
for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
