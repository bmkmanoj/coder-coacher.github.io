in this video we will discuss optional
route parameters in angular with a
simple example on some routes parameters
are required and on some routes they are
optional for example when we navigate
from employee list to view a specific
employee details then this employee ID
route parameter is a required parameter
because without it we wouldn't know
which employee details to retrieve and
display on the other hand when we
navigate from employee details back to
the list then the ID of the employee
whose details we have just viewed is not
mandatory for this route it's an
optional parameter in case if we pass
the ID of the employee whose details we
have just viewed back to the list route
then in this list we can style that
employee panel with a different color
maybe something like this so at the
moment we have viewed Mary's details so
when we come back to the list if we pass
the ID of the meri in the URL to that
list route we can style the employee
panel of that employee with a different
color indicating that we have just
viewed her details it's a nice to have
feature but for the list itself to work
we don't need that ID parameter so ID
parameter in this case for this list
route is optional so let's discuss how
to pass optional parameters and we'll
also discuss how to read them at the
moment we are on the view template of
employee details component and we have
that back to list link right here so
when we navigate to view a specific
employee details we pass the ID of that
employee as a required route parameter
and then we have that back to list link
right here so when we click this link we
want to pass the ID of this employee
which is 2 in this case back to the list
route and for that we are going to make
use of optional route parameters notice
at the moment we are binding the router
link directive to a link parameters
array and a first element in this array
is the path to the destination component
in
case it is less next we specify any
required parameters we may have in our
case for the list route we don't have
any required parameters so we didn't
specify anything followed by the
required parameters will specify the
optional route parameters to pass
optional route parameters we use an
object and then specify our optional
road parameters as key value pairs we
can have as many optional route
parameters as possible in our case we
want to pass the ID of the employee
whose details we have just viewed back
to the list route so I'm going to name
the key ID we can give it any meaningful
name we want but I'm going to name it ID
and then we need to specify the value
for this ID optional road parameter and
we are going to get that from the
employee property which we already have
in the component class and it has got
the ID property so if we take a look at
the component class of our employee
details component notice we already have
employee property right here and of a
view template is already binding to that
employee property and to get the ID of
the employee using the ID property on
this employee property so at the moment
we are passing one optional route
parameter to the list route and that is
the ID of the employee now if we want to
pass another optional road parameter we
include a comma and then another key
value pair for our second optional route
parameter let's say for example we also
want to pass the name of the employee
I'm going to specify the key s name and
then value for that property which I am
going to get from the name property but
in our case there is no need to pass the
name of the employee to the list route
so I'm going to remove that let's save
this change and then take a look at the
browser by the moment we are looking at
many details whose employee ID is - now
look what happens when we click this
back to list link notice we are
redirected to the list route and our
optional route parameter ID and its
value were also passed to the list route
and notice the path which is list and
the optional road parameter ID equals
two are separated with a semicolon right
here now all that is left to do is read
the optional Road parameter value from
the list route and then style that
employee panel with a different
background color indicating that we have
just viewed hard details of a list
employees component view template is
right here and this is the component
which is displaying the list of
employees right here and to display each
employee details we have another nested
component and that is the display
employee component we have that display
employee component view template right
here
let's also open the component class file
so we want to read this optional ID
route parameter value from this display
employee component to read the route
parameters whether they are required or
optional we use the same service
provided by angular which is activated
route service so let's inject that into
our component using the constructor I'm
going to name it underscore route and
the type of the service is activated
route let's use Visual Studio code to
import the activated route from angular
router for us automatically
now within ng on in its lifecycle hook
let's read the ID option route parameter
value let's use the get method and the
name of our option Road parameter is ID
and we know ID is a number so let's cast
that to a number by using the plus sign
and let's store this road parameter
value in a private field I'm going to
name it selected employee ID we don't
have this property yet let's take the
help of Visual Studio code to generate
it automatically for us by pressing
control period notice we see two options
let's select the first option declare
property selected employee ID by default
it's going to make it public but we want
it to be private
now all that is left to do is use this
property to conditionally add another
bootstrap class to the employee panel
whose details we have just viewed so in
the view template of our display
employee component we're gonna make use
of class binding we discussed class
binding in detail in part 12 of angular
2 tutorial I'll include the link in the
description of this video if you want to
check it out later now notice these two
classes panel and panel primary these
classes are added by default to all the
employee panels we have on the list and
this panel primary class is what is
giving us this blue background cover in
addition to panel primary we also have
panel sixes panel warning panel in for
etc these different classes give us
different colors I'm going to make use
of panel success now we don't want to
add this panel success class to every
employee panel we only want to add it to
that employee barrel whose employee ID
matches with the employee ID value that
we have in the route so that employee
panel is colored differently so to do
that we are going to use a boolean
expression here so basically this is
saying if the ID of the employee object
that is being displayed by this panel
matches that the ID value that we have
in our private field selected employee
ID then add this panel - success class
to the employee panel otherwise remove
it so let's save all our changes and
then take a quick look at the browser
notice in the route the optional road
parameter value is 2 and hence the
second employee panel whose ID is also 2
is styled with a different color now
let's click on mark and view his details
and if we go back to the list now his
panel is styled with a different color
now notice if we go to the create route
and then come back to the list route in
the route we don't have that optional
route parameter
Eydie and hence all the employee panels
are styled at the same way if BBU is
specific employee details and then go
back to the list that specific employee
panel is styled with a different color
indicating that we have just viewed his
details so here is the syntax for
passing an optional route parameter and
this is how an optional road parameter
in the URL appears notice it is
separated with a semicolon and finally
reading an optional route parameter is
very similar to reading a required route
parameter we still use the same
activated route service there are
several differences between optional and
required route parameters we'll discuss
what those differences are and when to
use one or the other
in our next video thank you for watching
