video we'll discuss tree view control in
asp.net this is continuation to part 158
so please watch about 158 from the
asp.net tutorial before proceeding with
this video the tree view web control is
useful to display hierarchical data in a
tree structure just like the asp.net
menu control the content for the tree
view control can be specified either
directly within the control itself or
the tree view control can be bound to an
XML file web dot sitemap file or a
database table in this video we'll
discuss specifying the content directly
within the control itself and in a later
video session we'll discuss binding the
tree view control to different data
sources attribute control is a
collection of tree node objects let's
understand using this tree view control
with an example let's flip to visual
studio this is the same example that we
have been working with in the previous
sessions of this video series first of
all let's add a peb form and let's first
set a style attribute on the stiff tag
and let's set font family to area
let's now drag-and-drop tree view
control tree view control should be
present on the navigation tablet in the
toolbox we want to configure let's
actually put this tree view control
inside this div tag so we want to
configure this tree view control in such
a way that we get this output that we
see here basically this output
represents the logical structure of a
website at the root level we have home
employee employer and admin pages and
under employee employer and admin we
have three more pages okay so let's see
how to configure the street view control
so that we get this output so as
discussed before a tree view is a
collection of three node objects as you
can see here look at that we have got
nodes element and within that we have
several tree node elements the first one
is the home tree node and then we have
employee
ie 3-node and a employee tree node we
have three more tree nodes upload resume
edit resume and view resume so basically
a tree node can contain another tree
node and that's how this is able to
display hierarchical data in a tree
structure and along the same lines we
have employer tree node and this
employer tree node has got three other
tree nodes underneath underneath it and
along the same lines we're going to have
admin tree node and three more tree
nodes underneath that to speed things up
I have already implemented this HTML so
let's copy it from the notepad let's
flip to visual studio let's specify the
nodes element and within that we are
going to have these three nodes let's
actually format this HTML properly and
to do that let's select the entire HTML
and + ctrl K + D alright so here we have
the home tree node we have employee tree
node and that has got three more tree
nodes alright with this change let's run
this and see if we get the output that
we expect
okay so we get the same output now look
at this we can expand and collapse this
tree view control so under employee we
have got these three pages and then the
employer these three pages now if you
look at the tree node object it has got
several attributes now notice that we
have specified text attribute text is
something that you see and click on
navigate URL is the page to which you
will navigate to when you click on that
link and look at that we have also
specified target attribute so what's the
use of this here it is when I click on
home look at what's going to happen its
home opening home page but it's doing
that in a new window and that's possible
because we are using target attribute
here similarly if I select editors you
may look at that that's open in a new
window
they still have the original page here
alright so that's how we specify the
content for the tree view control
directly inside the control itself now
to configure the look and feel of the
tree view control there are several
styles for example when I hover the
mouse over any tree node we want maybe
let's say a green background color and
we want the font to be bolded if that's
the case then we can make use of this
hover node style let's see how to apply
that let's flip this to the design mode
let's get to the properties of the tree
view control and then look at this here
we have have a node style so let's say
we want green background color and maybe
we want the font to be bolded so let's
set font bold to true let's run this and
see if that style is going to take
effect look at that as I hover the mouse
over we got green color and the font is
also bolded because the font color is in
our blue we can't see it properly let's
actually change the
font color to white and let's say we
want to change the font color for the
entire control if that's the case you
can actually specify for color at the
control level itself so for color let's
say we want that to be white color and
look at this as soon as we have
specified white as the full color you
know you can't see anything here that's
because your background color is white
your font color is also white and you
know you have other styles as well for
example let's say I want to specify leaf
node style so what are leaf nodes leaf
nodes are those nodes which doesn't have
any children so here home doesn't have
any children underneath it so that's a
leaf node uploaded as you may edit
resume view resume our leaf nodes
because they don't have any children
underneath them so let's specify the
background colorful leaf node style
let's say maybe we won't read that
background color so look at that leaf
nodes have caught that and we can also
specify a root node style what are the
root nodes within our sample tree node
employee employer and admin so let's
specify the background color for root
nodes maybe if you want navy as the
background color for root nodes all
right with all these changes let's run
this and see if those styles get applied
look at that they got applied look at
the hovered node style so I'm sure you
can play around with these tiles now at
the moment we are specifying these
styles in line on the page itself but we
can specify these styles in an external
style sheet and then we can link the
class within the style sheet with the
respective style using CSS class
attribute and we have discussed how to
use the CSS class attribute when we were
discussing menu control all right
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
