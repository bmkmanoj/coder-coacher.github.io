this video we'll discuss how jQuery
animation queues work let's understand
this with an example notice here we've
got two developments and we have several
calls to animate method chain together
by default these calls will be placed
into a default queue and the name of
that default queue is FX keep in mind
each HTML element will have its own
queue since we have got two developments
here there will be two such default
queues so with this code there will be 5
calls to animate method placed in the
queue of each development this means
both the developments that is my t1 and
my div - may start to execute the first
call to their respective animate method
more or less at the same time however
from the given Q the Q methods are
executed one after the other in series
rather than executing all of them
simultaneously in parallel let's look at
this in action let's flip to visual
studio so I have this same code that we
have seen on the slide here if we view
this page in the browser this is how it
looks like notice we have caught a
button and two developments and to get
this UI this is the HTML that we need so
we have a button and the value on the
button say start animation and we have
got two developments notice each
development has a class attribute set to
my div class and this CSS class is
present within the Style section
so my div class is the name of the class
and notice we are setting width to 150
pixels so the width of each development
is set to 150 pixels padding of 5 pixels
font size 18 pixels and we have a 1
pixel solid black border and opacity is
set to point 4 that is the reason why
these developments are not clearly
visible because we have set opacity to
0.4 if set background color to red and
font color to white okay so this div
class is applied to both the
developments and that
why they look exactly the same and then
within our script section we've got our
ready function and we are finding the
button by ID so the ID of the start
animation button is my button and when
we click that button we want to call a
function actually when we click that
button that's when we want to animate
both these developments so when we click
the button we are calling a function and
within that function we are finding both
the developments that is my d1 and my
div too and then notice we have got
several calls to the animate function
chained together
so the first animate function is going
to animate the increase in width so we
are increasing the width of the
development from an initial width of 150
pixels to 500 pixels and that increase
is happening over a period of 15 hundred
milliseconds that is one and a half
second and then we are increasing the
padding from five pixels to 20 pixels
again that's happening or a period of
fifteen hundred milliseconds similarly
we are increasing font size to fifty
border width to ten and opacity to one
so when we set opacity to one then the
development should be clearly visible
right and we are doing exactly the same
thing even on div two element right so
when we click the start animation button
now notice what's going to happen you
know it increases the width and then you
know the padding and then the font size
border width and finally opacity so now
notice the developments are clearly
visible but the important thing to keep
in mind is that the executions are
happening in sequence one after the
other okay they're not happening
parallely so well the first animate
method is being executed the other calls
to the animate method are placed in the
queue and they are waiting to be
executed in fact we can find the length
of the queue and to do that we are going
to make use of cue function so basically
this cue function you know we can use
that
to QA function right to place the
function into that default queue the
name of that default queue is FX so
let's say we want to queue a function an
anonymous function and what we want to
do inside this function function is find
out the length of the queue and display
that length within the console window
right so to get the length of the queue
so I want to get the queue of this
development so I'm going to use this
keyword to refer to that development and
then I'm going to call the cue function
and the name of the queue is FX that's
the name of the default queue and length
property on that is going to give us the
number of calls waiting in the queue to
be executed right so what we want to do
with that length we want to log it to
the console so I'm going to use the log
method so console dot log we want to log
the length so I'm going to append a
string here let's call this queued calls
equals whatever is the length of the
queue all right so let's save the
changes and let's go ahead and reload
this page and look at this let's
actually launch the browser developer
tools by pressing f12 key we are on the
console tab within the developer tools
and look at this when we click start
animation it starts executing the
animations look at that it's a skewed
calls equals 5 the important thing to
notice here is look at this after the
first animation you know the div 1
element has stopped executing any more
calls within the queue and first of all
let's see why it says queued calls
equals 5 now if you look at this code
here so while this call to animate
method is being executed the rest of the
calls that is all these methods are
queued you know they are waiting in that
default queue to be executed one after
the other right so at this point how
many calls we have so this cue function
is going to queue this function place
this function into the queue as well
we have one two three four and five so
that's the reason why we get cute calls
equals five because there are five calls
to be executed right and the reason it
stops the animation after executing you
know the first call to animate method is
because when we queue a method to
execute we also have to DQ that
explicitly and to DQ that we have to be
used DQ method so I'm going to simply
say dollar this dot DQ so this is going
to DQ the method and the execution of
the rest of the calls within the queue
must continue so let's look at this in
action let's also place another call to
the queue at the end so let's get rid of
this semicolon from there and paste it
there put a semicolon so when this code
is executed there is only one more
function to execute in the queue that is
this function which we are adding so
this one should produce the cute calls
count as one
whereas this should produce the cute
calls count as six because including
this function we have six calls to be
executed so let's save the changes
reload this page and let's click start
animation so the animation starts and
look at that cute calls equals six and
the animations continue and finally it
should say cute calls equals one now
let's see how to globally disable all
animations for some reason let's say you
know when I click a button turn off
animations you know probably I want to
turn off all the animations is it
possible absolutely if you want to
globally turn off animations you know we
would either set dollar dot FX dot off
equals true or jQuery dot F X dot off
equals true keep in mind that FX is the
name of the default queue okay J dollar
is the shortcut for jQuery so you can
either say dollar RJ
and then dot F X dot off equals true
let's actually do this let's put in you
know throw a checkbox onto the page turn
off animations now if we check that box
and then when we click start animation
it should not do any animations you know
it should increase the width padding
font size etc all these properties
without animations
whereas if that is not checked that
means we want animations so when we
click the button we want all those you
know CSS properties to be changed you
know using animations let's see how to
achieve that so first of all we need to
get that UI that means we need a check
box so let's go ahead and include a
check box after the button so we want
input let's give it an ID let's call
this check box and type is going to be
check box and let's specify the text as
turn off animations
and when we click the button we want to
get the value you know whether if that
checkbox is selected or not right so we
want to find that checkbox by ID so
let's use the ID selector so the ID is
chk Bo X that's the ID of the checkbox
and to get the value you know whether it
is checked or not I'm going to use East
method is and the selector here is going
to be cool and checked so what is this
going to do this is going to return true
if this checkbox is checked that is if
this checkbox is checked then is :
checked is going to return true if it
returns true then we want to turn off
animations so to turn off animations
globally we can use dollar dot FX dot
off equals true or false
okay so let's save the changes reload
this page and look at this now the
moment turn off animations is not
checked so when I click start animations
it will do all the animations now let's
go ahead and turn off let's actually
reload this page check that box
turn off animations and when we click
start animation button look at that it
doesn't do the animations anymore on the
other hand you know when we run it
without you know checking that box it
will do the animations now at the moment
the calls to these methods are being
executed in sequence one by one right
they are not executed simultaneously in
parallel now let's say for some reason
you want the calls to animate method to
be executed simultaneously in power if
that is the case then we can set this
cue option to false right so when we
said that cue option to false
basically telling we don't
want them to be executed in sequence one
after another
instead execute all of them
simultaneously in parallel and to
specify that option you know we are
using this version of the animated
method notice there are two versions of
animate method in a one variation as
where you know we are passing adjacent
object with the CSS properties and
values and then we can specify duration
easing and complete we discussed this
version of animate method in a previous
video session we also have another
variation where you know we specify the
CSS properties and their values as a
JSON object and we can specify the
additional options that we want to pass
to the animate method also using a JSON
object yes that is using this options
parameter and if you want to find out
you know the list of all additional
options then visit this URL so when you
visit that jQuery URL so notice there's
the first variation of the animate
method and this is the second variation
and here are the list of options that we
can pass to the animate method and we
passed them as a JSON object right so we
can specify duration easing whether you
want to cue them or not right and we
have several other options like that we
have step we'll discuss that option in
our next video session so now if you
don't want these calls to be executed in
sequence if you want all of them to be
executed in parallel then use the second
variation and set that cue option to
false so what we can basically do is let
me delete all of this I'm going to say
here so that's the width property using
adjacent object and I'm going to use
another JSON object and you know I want
to specify duration that say duration is
1500 milliseconds and Q equals false
okay similarly I mean Q : fast the city
is an object right so similarly we have
to do it for padding font size border
with opacity so in the interest of time
I have already typed that required HTML
so I'm going to copy this and paste it
right here so let's format this abet so
the same idea here padding and then
we're saying duration Q equals false so
for all the calls to animate method we
are basically setting Q option to false
right so let's do the same thing for the
other development as well so now since
we have set Q option to false all of
these calls to the animate method will
be executed in parallel right so let's
look at them now so let's reload this
page look at that and I say start
animation look at that
all of them happen within fifteen
hundred milliseconds that is one and a
half second now an easier way to animate
these multiple CSS properties
simultaneously is to include all those
he has properties in a single JSON
object now there's no reason why you
want to have multiple calls to animate
method so all we are doing is you know
animating or increasing these CSS
properties we can include all those CSS
properties in a single JSON object and
that's going to execute you know or
perform all those animations
simultaneously in parallel so let's look
at that option so if we have to do that
then we would do something like this so
I can simply say so I want to increase
with two finite pixels similarly you
know I want to increase padding to 20
pixels so we specify padding and then we
want to increase that to 20 similarly
you know we include font size border
with opacity
cetera again within the interest of time
I have already typed the required code
so let's copy that and paste it right
here okay and let's say we want all
these animations you know to be
performed within 1500 milliseconds we
specify that using speed parameter so
let's do the same thing for the other
development okay
so let's save the changes let's reload
this page and look at that it should
work the same way thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
