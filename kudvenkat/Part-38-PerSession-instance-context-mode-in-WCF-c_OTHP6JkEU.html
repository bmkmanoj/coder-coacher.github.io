this video we'll discuss Paris session
instance context mode in the BCF with an
example this is continuation to path 37
so please watch 437 before proceeding
when the instance context mode for a WCF
service is set to pair session a new
instance of the service object is
created for each new client session and
maintained for the duration of that
session the default session timeout is
ten minutes let's understand per session
instance context mode with an example
we'll be working with the same example
that we worked with in the previous
session let's flip to visual studio if
you recall it from the previous session
for this simple service we have set the
instance context mode to pair a call at
the moment the service host is already
running let's go ahead and run the
client and notice that the number
doesn't get incremented beyond 1 and the
reason for that is very simple this is a
pair call WTF service so every time a
method call is made an instance of this
simple service class is created and the
method gets executed as soon as the
method returns the value what's going to
happen to the object it gets destroyed
so there is no way for pair call
services to remember a state between
method calls even if those method calls
are from the same client so with pair
call services state maintenance is an
issue let's see have to convert the spur
call service to a pair session service
all we need to do is change the instance
context mode to pair session and now
this is a pair session tab UCF service
let's close the host that's running and
the client as well let's run the service
host once again let's now run the client
and now look at the number it gets
incremented and how is that possible
that's because when the first method
call is made from the client to the WCF
service
what's happening on the WCF service it's
going to create an instance of this
class simple service okay so obviously
this variable will be initialized to its
default value since it's an integer it
will be initialized to zero and when
this method is called it's going to
increment 0 to 1 return 1 but will this
object be destroyed right away no it
doesn't why because it's a per session
service so the instance of this class is
going to stay on the server memory until
the session times out and what is the
default session timeout 10 minutes so
this object is going to stay on the
server memory for the next 10 minutes
within those 10 minutes if a subsequent
request come from the same client then
the same service instance is used to
service that request and that service
instance object remembers the value so
the value is 1 so when increment number
is called again so it's going to
increment that from 1 to 2 return the
value 2 and that's how it's able to
remember a state between calls that came
from the same client but if it's a
different client know between client the
state is not maintained you know the
state of one client is not known by
another client that's actually create a
Windows forms application as a client
and and look at those examples so I have
another instance of visual studio
running let's create a new windows forms
application here let's actually call it
Windows client
and we need to add a reference toward
WCF service and this is the URL way we
have the metadata available so it's
going to generate the required proxy
classes let's change the namespace to
simple service click OK
so that's going to generate the proxy
classes let's drag and drop a button
control on the form and let's change the
text on the button to N work service
double click the button to generate
click event handler at the Forum level
let's create a reference variable of
type simple service client and then
within the form constructor let's
actually create an instance of our
simple service client and within the
button click event let's invoke
increment number function and then
display the incremented value within a
message box and let's say number equals
whatever number we get from the service
alright let's go ahead and build the
solution now obviously since this event
is forms application they should be an
executable generated so let's open the
project in Windows Explorer
now we get to bin and debug directory so
there we have the executable let's
double click it so this one instance
running let's double click again so
there is another instance running so
here at the moment we have two clients
now when we click this button in work
service ok so the number starts at one
click it again so number two click it
again number three okay
so now there is an instance
of simple service class on the server
for this client and that instance is
going to stay on the memory for the next
ten minutes so within the next 10
minutes if this client makes a call look
at that you know it's going to remember
the state and increment the value from
that point on okay now look at this at
the moment the number is four for this
client now here we have another client
so when we this button is the number
going to continue you know I mean start
at five or is going to start at one
since this is a different client there
will be a new session for this client
which means a new service instance get
created for this client and that service
instance is going to stay on the memory
for this line for the next ten minutes
so when we click this in work service we
get a value of one click it again number
two now let's go back to this client
when we click this look at that
it continues from where it has left off
okay so at this point since we have two
active clients and their sessions have
not timed out there will be two
instances of this class on the server
memory now if you have 100,000 clients
then you will have 100,000 objects in
the server memory now if the client
let's say if this client is idle and not
doing anything even then the object is
going to stay in the memory until the
session times out so with per session
services the memory is not managed
effectively because even if the clients
walks away you know the objects are
still going to stay in the server memory
until the session times out but with per
call services we don't have that problem
why as soon as the method call returns
what's going to happen the object gets
destroyed so what are the implications
of per session services
first of all the advantages state
maintained between calls and the
downside is greater memory consumption
as service objects remain in memory
until the client session times out so
this is going to negatively affect
application scalability concurrency is
also an issue for multi-threaded clients
now this is a very common interview
question how do you design it am UCF
service would you design it as a per
call service or a per session service
now there is no Universal answer for
this this is a very tricky question we
can't blindly say whether per call
services are better or per session
services are better each of these have
their own strengths and weaknesses if
you prefer object-oriented programming
style then pair session is your natural
choice on the other hand if you prefer
SOA that is service oriented
architecture style then per call is your
choice in general all things being equal
the main trade-off is performance versus
scalability per session services perform
better because the service object does
not have to be instantiated on
subsequent requests and why is that the
object the service instance is going to
stay on the silver memory until the
session times out and within that
session timeout if there is a call from
the same client you know the same object
can be used to execute code and return
the values okay so there is no overhead
involved in instantiating object from
this crash so per session services
perform better on the other hand
parallel services scale better because
the service objects are destroyed
immediately after the method called
returns which means memory is
effectively managed okay so the decision
really depends on you know the
application architecture performance and
scalability needs that's it for today
thank you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
