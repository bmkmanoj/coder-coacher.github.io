this video well disk is hosting a WCF
servers in a Windows service this is
continuation to part 26 so please watch
for 26 before proceeding we'll be
working with the same example that we
worked with in part 25 so let's flip to
visual studio so we're going to host
this hollow service which is a WCF
service in a Windows service so first to
this solution let's go ahead and add a
Windows service project select windows
under install the templates and then
choose windows service template and then
let's call this Windows service host
click OK and now we want to host this
hollow service you know within this
window service and in order for us to be
able to do that we need to add a
reference to that hollow service project
so right click on references folder add
a reference and then let's select hello
service and we also need to add a
reference to system dot service model
assembly so let's go and add system dot
service model and one more thing that we
need to do is add the application
configuration file so right click on
windows service host add a new item and
we want to add application configuration
file now here within this config file we
need to specify the configuration for
our WCF service which we have done in
the console application and windows
forms application in the previous
sessions of this video series so in the
previous sessions we have discussed
hosting this hello service within a
console application as well as the
windows forms application so let's copy
the configuration from one of the apt or
config files of those projects and then
paste that configuration within this app
that config file in the windows service
project
now let's change the name of the service
dot service one dot cs2 hollow windows
service and then once we press enter
it's going to ask us if we want to
change all the references of that
service one click yes and then double
click on this hello windows service dot
CS file and then right click on the
designer and select this option view
code so here we need to write code to
host our WCF service so first of all
let's go ahead and bring in system dot
service model namespace and then at the
class level we are going to create an
instance of our service host class and
let's call it host so on start so when
the service starts what we want to do we
want to have our WCF service started as
well so we are going to create a new
instance of service host and then
specify the type of the service that we
want to host we want to host hello
service and in order to open the
communication channels all we need to do
is invoke the open method on the
instance of the service host class and
we also need to implement on stop method
so when we stop the service what should
happen we should stop on the WCF service
as well so in work the close method
that's that we are done now there's one
little step that we have to do so open
this hollow windows service file and on
the designer right-click and select this
option add installer and this is going
to add in a project installer dot CS
file and on this file you can say
service installer and service process
installer so select service install of
one right click on that and select
properties within the properties window
here we can specify a meaningful name
for our service instead of calling it as
service one let's call this hello
vendo service and then let's also
specify the start type now if we set the
start type to manual which is the
default you know the service will not
automatically start when the operating
system starts and the computer starts if
we want the service to start
automatically when the system starts
then we need to set the start type to
automatic okay and select service
process installer right click on that
get to the properties of set and here we
need to specify an account so here you
have the option to specify you know the
account using which you want this
Windows service to basically install and
run so let's actually select local
system here you can select any account
that you want alright so we are done
with you know configuring the project
Installer so let's go ahead and build a
solution just to make sure that
everything compiles so notice within the
status bar it says been succeeded now
all that is left is to actually install
this Windows service and in order to
install and uninstall the vendor service
we can make use of this utility called
the install yuto and we need to run this
utility from visual studio command
prompt so click on start all programs
Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 and then
from there Visual Studio Tools and then
Visual Studio command prompt then we
need to run it as an administrator so
right click on it run as administrator
click yes navigate to see driver
pressing CD backslash and then let's
make use of this utility install yuto
and if you don't know the switches that
you want to use with this utility you
can simply say install you 204 slash
question mark so it's going to basically
specify the options that you can use
with this install utility ok now if we
want to install a Windows service using
this install utility
we specify the switch you know - I for
install and then we need to specify the
path for the executable you know that
contains our Windows service and where
is that present you know the project is
Windows service host so right click on
the project open folder in Windows
Explorer and then within the bin
directory and then within debug we have
the you know project executable this is
Windows service host project so this
contains the code for the windows
service that we wants to install so we
need to specify this path there so let's
copy that part and then let's navigate
to visual studio command prompt and
paste it right there and then we also
need to specify the name of the
executable
which is Windows service host dot exe so
let's copy that and let's paste it here
and then press Enter so you know look at
that it says the commit phase completed
successfully the transacted install has
completed so it should have installed
our you know our holo Windows servers
and to confirm that you know let's get
to the services window and in order to
do that click on start type run within
the run window type services dot MSA and
then click enter and here you know press
H and we should see hello windows
service there ok and look at the startup
type is automatic since we have just
installed this service it has not
started automatically but then if we
reboot of a machine this service will be
started automatically ok now if I want
to start this service simply right click
on it and select this option start ok
and look at the status it says started
let's actually stop this service for a
bit so to install a Windows service we
use the switch - I - uninstall it we use
- you for uninstall and when we + enter
you know it should be uninstalled from
the machine let's actually confirm that
so it's still doing the cleanup and now
when we actually refresh this window
look
look at that hello windows service is
gone from there so let's actually
install it once more so this survey
should be installing now let's refresh
it look at that hello windows service
let's go ahead and start the service ok
this service has started now so the
windows service has started which means
our WCF service is hosted within that
and the WCF service has also started so
let's open up the windows client project
that we have been working with so let's
fire up another instance of visual
studio and then open the windows client
project that we have been working with
so we want to open the project windows
client so let's quickly test this to
make sure you know the WCF service is
still working as expected all right now
before we do that let's update the
service reference so it's going to
communicate with the WCF service that is
hosted within our windows service and
then the you know configuration
information will be used basically to
create the proxy classes and update the
configuration information all right now
let's go ahead and run this client and
see if it works as expected
ok let's pass presume as the name and
then click get message if everything is
working as expected it should get a
response back okay so we have discussed
hosting or WCF service in Windows
service in our next video we'll discuss
the advantages and disadvantages of
hosting the WC of servers in a Windows
service that's it for today thank you
for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
