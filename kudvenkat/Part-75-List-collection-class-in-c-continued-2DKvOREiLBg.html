this video we'll continue discussing
list collection class in c-sharp this is
continuation to part 74 so please watch
part 74 from the c-sharp tutorial before
proceeding with this video we'll be
discussing all these functions first
let's look at this contains function
this function checks if an item exists
in the list and if an item does exist in
the list then this method returns true
otherwise false let's look at that in
action we'll be using this customer
class in this demo
notice that this class is very simple
with three Auto implemented properties
ID name and salary and within the main
method we are creating three instances
of this customer class customer one
customer to end customer three and then
we are creating a list of customers and
to that list we are adding customer one
customer two in customer three objects
now let's check if customer three object
exists in the list and to do that we can
use contains method so contains and look
at that this method expects an object of
type customer so let's go ahead and pass
customer three object and look at the
return type it's a boolean meaning it's
going to return a true or false if the
object exists it returns true otherwise
false and let's say if the object exists
we want to print a message stating
customer three objects exists in the
list else we want to print a message
stating customer three object does not
exist in the list so since customer
object customer three object is there we
should get that message now let's remove
that object from the list so we only
have at the moment customer one and
customer two object in the list let me
run this now and look at that customer
three object does not exist in the list
all right now let's look at using exists
function now this function also checks
if an item exists in the list but based
on a given condition okay
and again if the item exists within the
list then this method is going to return
true
otherwise false so for both of these
methods the return type is a boolean
okay so let's see how to use exists
function first of all let's go ahead and
add customer three object as well all
right
now when I use exists function look at
that it asks me to pass a predicate so
which means we can pass a lambda
expression here now let's say I want to
check whether if this list contains a
customer whose names name starts with P
okay now we do have a customer object
whose name starts with P so if I want to
base my search based on that condition
then I can use this exist function so we
need to pass a lambda expression here so
we have you know this list of customers
contain a customer object so let's say
customer such that customer name dot
starts with maybe letter P and we do
have a customer whose name starts with P
so it should say customer three I mean
it should come into this if block and
print this message so let me actually
run this look at that customer three
objects exist in the list on the other
hand you know we don't have a customer
whose name starts with said okay so
obviously when we run this the method
should return false and it should come
to the else part and print this message
okay customer three object does not
exist in the list now you can give any
kind of message that you want here just
in the interest of time I didn't change
that message there all right so the only
difference between contains and exists
is that with exist function you can
specify a condition but with contains
you can't do that you pause the object
itself to that function now let's look
at using find function so this function
searches for an element that matches the
conditions defined by the specified
lambda expression and then it returns
the first matching item from the list
okay so again this condition at
I mean this function expects a condition
to be passed and then even if there are
several items matching that condition
this function is going to only return
the first matching item from the list
let's look at using that okay now let's
say if you look at these employees you
know there are two employees whose
salary is greater than 5,000 customer
two and customer three now let's use
find method so let's get rid of this
piece of code so list customers dot find
and look at that again we need to pass a
predicate so let's pass a lambda
expression so let's say customer such
that customer dot salary greater than
5,000 okay now look at the return type
of this function unlike contains and
exists this function actually returns a
customer object so this fine function is
going to return the actual object back
okay whereas contains and exists return
a boolean it only tells you whether the
object exists in the collection or not
but then this fine function is going to
find that object if it exists it's going
to return that okay so let's store the
returned object in a variable of type
customer and maybe let's call it C okay
and look at this it only returns one
customer object back the fine method and
then maybe we want to print all the
details of the customer maybe their ID
name and salary and to speed things up I
have already typed that so ID equals
name equals salary equals we have
placeholders there and then we are
basically printing their ID name and
salary so let me go ahead and run this
and see if it's going to print the
details of that employee look at that it
has printed the details of Pam so Pam is
the first matching customer whose salary
is greater than 5,000 so it doesn't give
you the second customer okay
all right now let's look at using find
last function again this function
searches for an element that matches the
conditions that are defined by the
specified lambda expression and then
this method is going to return the last
matching item from the list okay so if
there are multiple items that matches
the given condition then this fine last
function returns the last matching item
okay so the same function I mean the
same code but then instead of using find
you know I'm going to use find last and
again this method expects a predicate so
we are passing this lambda expression
here at this point it should actually
written as this customer that is row up
so let's run this and see if it works
that way and look at that we get drop
whose salary is greater than 5,000 so
that's the difference between fine and
fine last find is going to return the
first matching item
whereas fine last is going to return the
last matching item both based on a given
condition all right if you want all the
items then we have find all function so
let's look at using find all function so
obviously if you look at this function
find all look at the return type instead
of returning a single customer back it
is returning list of customers back okay
so which means this is going to return
all the customers who match the given
condition from the list
okay so let's include list here so list
of customer and maybe let's call it
customers and then since we have a list
here let's loop through and print the
details and let's use a for each loop so
for each customer and let's call it C in
our customers collection
so we are basically printing out their
ID name and salary again so let's run
this and see if we get both the
employees look at that I get both the
employees who I mean both the customers
whose salary is greater than 5,000 okay
all right now let's look at using this
find index function so obviously find
index returns the index of the first
item that matches the condition
specified by the lambda expression and
there are two overloads of this method
which allows us to specify the range of
elements to search within that list
let's look at that in action so we have
this list of customers here now let's
say I want to find index so find index
returning an integer so it's going to
return the index of the matching element
so we need to specify again a lambda
expression here let's use the same
lambda expression customer salary
greater than 5,000 and let's say end may
be index equals that and then let's
print the index
okay so we have two employees whose
salary is greater than 5,000 so this
should now return the index of customer
to object and the index of customer to
object is one because the index is zero
paste so customer one is zero and
customer 2 is 1 and this find index
method is going to return only the first
matching items index now there are two
customer objects which match this
condition but we are only going to get
the index of the first matching customer
so let's run this and look at that index
is 1 as expected now find last index is
going to return the last matching items
index we'll come back to that in just a
bit but then look at this this find the
index method has got several overloads
as well so we have through three
overloads here so basically here we are
only specifying the condition but the
next overload you can also specify the
start index so at what point in the list
do you want to start searching do you
want to start searching at position 0 or
position 1 opposition - you can specify
that as well you saying you know this
overload way we can specify the index so
let's specify the index as 2 so if we
specify 0 1 2 as the index then we are
going to get this customer object so
let's specify the index s 2 and now it
should give us 0 1 2 St index let's run
this and look at that so it's giving us
you know from here the matching element
is customer 3 and customer 3 index
within the list is 3 and we get that I
mean sorry - ok and there is another
overload as well so if you have several
items in the list not only can you
specify the start index you can also
specify from that start index how many
items you want to look up ok so it's
going to you know look in the range of
those elements and then return the index
of the first
element okay now similarly we have
another method find last index so this
is going to return the index of the last
matching element okay
so let's call let's invoke fine last
index and again this method also has got
three overloads and the use cases are
the same okay so now this should return
the index of customer three object which
is two because there are two matching
elements but this function is going to
return the index of the last matching
element so let's go ahead and run this
so index is 2 all right
now let's look at converting an array to
a list so how do we convert an array to
a list simply use this tool list method
so first of all let's get rid of this
code here and then let's create an array
so customer and maybe let's call it
customer RA equals new customer array
and then let's create let's say the
array size 2 3 customer array of 0
equals customer 1 and similarly let's
initialize the array with the rest of
the customer objects
all right now I want to convert this
array to a list all we need to do is
customer array dot to list and look at
the return type of this function it is
returning a list back okay so basically
we can store that in a list types or
list customer and let's call it maybe
list customers and then obviously you
can use a for each loop and loop through
each customer object and print their
details so for each customer see in list
customers so this will verify that the
list is I mean the array is successfully
converted to a list and just to speed
things up we have that already type so
let's copy and paste it there let's run
it now and we should get all the three
customers okay similarly we can convert
a list to an array okay so here at the
moment let's get rid of this one and
let's say list customers equals new list
of customer and then to this list let's
add customer objects so list customers
dot add customer one object and let's
add customer two and customer three as
well now to convert this list into an
array if we simply say list customers to
array and look at the return type what
do we get back customer array so you can
store those elements in an array of type
you know customers and then loop through
them in the same manner okay and we can
also convert a list to a dictionary and
to do that again you use two dictionary
very simple and straightforward let's
look at that actually so let's convert
this list to a dictionary so when we say
list dot two dictionary and obviously
when you want to convert a list to a
dictionary you need to specify the key
for the dictionary and then the value
for the dictionary okay
now value part is optional since this is
a list of customers by default if you
don't specify the value
then the value is going to be that
customer object so let's just specify
the key so I want the key to be the ID
of the customer so obviously this is
going to return a dictionary back so
dictionary of key you know the type is
going to be the key of the dictionary is
going to be integer and the value is
going to be customer and let's call it
maybe dictionary equals you know
whatever this function is returning
now let's loop through that dictionary
and dictionary is a collection of key
value pair
so for each key value pair key is going
to be of type integer value is going to
be of type customer and let's call this
maybe kbp key value pair in the given
dictionary so we are going to loop
through the dictionary and then
obviously if you want to get the key
from the key value pair you simply say
key okay and then let's say we want to
print that so console dot readline
key equals K V P dot key and then we
want to print the details of the
customer I mean the value as well the
value is nothing but the customer object
so let's get the customer object let's
set the variable name is C and how do I
get the value simply say key value pair
dot value and look at that it's going to
return a customer object back and then
here we are printing ID name and salary
of that customer so let's go and run
this now and we should see the
respective keys and value objects
alright that's it for today thank you
