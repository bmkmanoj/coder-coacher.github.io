in this video we'll discuss unobtrusive
validation asp.net MVC in part 87 we
discussed obtrusive and unobtrusive
javascript please watch part 87 before
proceeding with this video in asp.net
MVC client-side validation is
unobtrusive to turn on client-side
validation and unobtrusive javascript
for the entire application we usually do
that using these two keys that are
present within web config file is it
possible to control these features using
application code the answer is yes for
example let's say based on certain
conditions I want to be able to either
enable or disable these features
programmatically to achieve that we can
specify these settings with an
application underscore start event of
the global dot a si X file and since we
are specifying these settings within the
application start even handler these
settings will be applicable for the
entire application is it possible to
turn these features on or off for a
specific view again the answer is yes
let's say for example in my entire
application on a given specific view I
want to disable these features and to
achieve that all we need to do is pass
false as the argument for these two
methods enable client validation and
enable unobtrusive javascript and then
both of these features will be disabled
on that specific field now we discuss
that client-side validation asp.net MVC
is unobtrusive so how is this
unobtrusive validation implemented in
asp.net MVC using data attributes for
example let's say we decorated the name
of property with required attribute and
then if we have both client-side
validation and unobtrusive JavaScript
enabled then the generated HTML for the
name field will be as shown here look at
that there are these two data attributes
data - Val so basically this indicates
that the unobtrusive validation is
turned on and data - Val - required that
is equal to the name field is required
so basic
this indicates that the name field is
required and the associated error
message will be displayed if the
validation has failed for that field
let's actually look at that in action so
in the web dot config file we already
have client validation and obtrusive
JavaScript enable and if you look at
name property within the employee class
this property is decorated with several
attributes let's get rid of all of them
except required attribute to keep things
simple let's build our solution and
let's go ahead and reload this feel
let's now right click on the page and a
few its source and look at this the HTML
that we have here is clean HTML with the
new traces of JavaScript whatsoever and
then if you look at this name field so
here we have the input field for name
and look at this data - Val equals true
and data - Val - required equal to the
name field is required basically these
data attributes are used by jQuery
validation plug-in to perform the
client-side validation okay
now let's turn these features off so
within web config file let's disable
unobtrusive javascript let's save the
changes let's reload this view again let
me right click and then view the page
source first of all notice the input
field for name we don't have those data
- attributes generated and then if I
scroll down look at that we have
JavaScript right here okay so basically
if we have unobtrusive JavaScript
enabled then you know these data
attributes have generated which are used
by jQuery plug-in to perform the
client-side validation if you don't have
this unobtrusive JavaScript enabled then
the data - attributes are not generated
and then the JavaScript is spit out on
the P
itself that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
