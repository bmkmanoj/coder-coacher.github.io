venket this is part 20 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll learn about
the practical application of server map
path method before continuing with the
session I strongly recommend to watch
part 19 of this video series where we
have discussed the basics of server dot
map path method we know that server dot
map path method returns the physical
path for a given virtual part this
method can be used in several different
ways
depending on the characters that we pass
end to this method the dot character
returns the current physical directory
of the executing page whereas dot dot
returns the parent directory of the
executing page until that symbol
resolves to the root directory of the
web application project we have
discussed about this in part 19 of this
video series let's actually look at an
example here I have a simple asp.net web
application project and if you look at
this page in electronics folder dot aspx
page its present in electronics folder
which is present in categories and this
category is present a folder is present
in sample web project okay now let's say
on this page I want to drag and drop a
drop-down list control and then within I
want to bind this drop-down list control
to country's dot XML file if you look at
this countries dot XML file it has got
you know a list of countries here so I
want to display these countries within
this drop-down list control so obviously
if you look at you know the locations of
these two files the countries dot XML
file is present in countries folder
which is present in data and this data
is present in the root directory of the
web application project whereas page in
electronics folder dot aspx is present
in electronics folder which is present
in categories and that's present in the
root directory so if this page has to
find this file it has to navigate to the
root directory and from there go to the
data folder and then to the countries
folder and then retrieve this file okay
so let's write simple code to actually
read that XML file and we have seen you
know in the previous sessions of this
video series how to bind
well file to a drop-down list alright so
since we are going to use a data set
data set is present in systems or data
namespace so let's import that let's
create a data set because that's the
simplest way is to read the XML file so
data set D s is equal to new data set D
s dot read XML so obviously to this
method we have to pass in you know the
path of the file okay so obviously if
you have to pass in the physical path of
the file then you have to retrieve that
so how do we retrieve the physical path
of the file we can use this silver dot
map path method okay because the silver
dot map path method you can pass in a
virtual path which gets resolved to the
physical path of that particular file
okay so I want to get to the you know
this particular file now if I just say
server dot map path and then if I
specify the name of the file country's
dot XML by default what's going to
happen the server dot map path will
actually look for that file within the
executing directory now this is the
current directory where this page is
present so when you say country's dot
XML this server dot map path method you
know tries to look in the in that
directory itself but we don't have
countries dot XML within that folder
okay it's actually present in countries
dot XML
I mean countries folder so if you have
to find that you have to come all the
way to the root directory from the root
directory you have to go to the you know
data directory within which you will
have to go to countries and then find
this countries dot XML okay so obviously
to get to the root directory of the web
application project since you are two
levels deep in relation to the root
directory of the web application project
folder you will have to use dot dot four
slash dot dot so dot dot four slash dot
dot four slash so these two dots will
navigate me back to the categories these
two dots
we'll navigate me back to the root
directory so from the root directory I
have to go to the data folder and then
to the countries folder so obviously
data and then countries for / countries
dot XML so this is the virtual path that
I have to pass in to the server dot map
path method which can return me the
correct physical path of this particular
file and once we have read the data into
the data set we can simply bind that to
the drop-down list so drop-down list 1
dot data source is equal to that data
set and drop-down list 1 dot data bind
and obviously we need to specify the
data text field and data value field of
the drop-down list we have spoken about
you know binding an XML file to a
drop-down list in the previous sessions
of this video series so data text field
and we need to specify the data value
field as well so if you look at this I
want the data text field to be the
country name and data value field to be
the country ID let's copy and paste it
here okay that's it so if we run this
now as you might expect we will be able
to correctly read that XML file and
display the data within you know the
drop-down list obviously I think we
binded the country IDs D text yet that's
why we see the country IDs instead of
country names so let's correct that
all right so if we run this now as you
might expect we will see the country
names within the drop-down list okay so
we can see all the countries there so
but then is this the best way to do this
maybe not because you know it works here
fine without no issues because you have
computed how to navigate to the root
directory because I am two levels deep
you know relative to the root web
application directory I use dot dot four
slash dot dot but just imagine if I want
to display the same drop down list and
same data in this page in Page in root
directory dot aspx let's try to copy
this and paste it within this page okay
is this going to work
no this will break first of all let's
correct this error since data set is
present in system data let's import that
namespace there okay and we don't have a
drop-down list on this page so let's
drag and drop a drop-down list control
onto this page okay so now if you look
at this one when I compile the solution
I don't get any compilation error okay
but then when we actually run this app
like this page you know this page in
root directory dot aspx this page is
going to crash and you can understand
why because if you look at this page
this is already in the root directory of
the web application project and then
look at this
so when you say dot dot it tries to go
to the parent directory now beyond the
root of your web application project you
don't have any other directory you
cannot navigate so trying to navigate
beyond you know the root directory of
the project will throw an error so
obviously this will return an error okay
so that's why you know anytime you want
to navigate to the root directory I
always suggest use the till character
but let's run this and see if we
actually get an error we should get an
error okay so cannot use leading to exit
above
the top directory and what's the top
directory for us you know the sample web
folder you cannot navigate beyond that
folder that way we get that's why we get
this error on the other hand look at
this even this page works fine why
because you're two levels deep dot dot
four slash dot dot will correctly
navigate you to the route from the route
you want to go to the data folder and
then into the countries and then read
countries dot XML and that's what this
says this works fine instead of making
this this complicated we know that we
have to come back to the root directory
and then go to the data folder and then
countries folder you can simply use the
tilde character and that's the best way
to do this okay no matter how deep you
are in the folder level in relation to
the in a root directory of the web
application project sense once you use
till the character you know that will
automatically be resolved to the read
directory of the web application project
so now if I copy paste this code in any
page in my web application project it's
just going to work fine as long as you
have this country's dot XML within this
path okay so if I copy paste this code
here it's going to work without any
issues so I run this now it's going to
work exactly the same as page in
electronics folder dot aspx okay so we
can see the list of countries there if I
try to run this page the same code
should run there as well all right so
the till symbol resolves to the root
application directory no matter how deep
you are in the folder hierarchy this is
the advantage of using tell over the two
dots and this discord with work will
work you know from any folder in our
application okay whereas the following
code will only work from folders that
are two levels deeper relative to the
root directory of the application
because why you use dot dot four slash
dot dot you know a single dot dot will
resolve to the parent directory if you
have another dot dot following that then
it tries to go to the you know the
parent directory about that and if you
are already in the root and if you try
to use dot dot you can
navigate beyond the root directory you
will get a runtime error not a compile
time error and runtime errors are always
dangerous on this slide you can find

today thank you for listening have a
