interview questions and answers video
series in its video we'll discuss
writing a sequel query to find all the
employees who are hired in the last 10
months if you have used the inbuilt
date dev sequence of a function then you
already know the answer we'll be using
this employee's table for this demo
let's flip the sequence of management
studio I've already created this
employees table it is the sequel script
that can do it
I'll have the script available on my
blog in case you need it let's look at
writing the sequel query itself we want
to select all the columns from employees
table along with the all columns I also
want to select the difference between
today's date and the date an employee is
hired in months and the easiest way to
achieve that is by using date day
function this method expects three
parameters the first parameter is the
interval that is how do you want the
difference between dates to be reported
do you want the difference in days
months or years we want it in months so
I'm going to pass month as the first
parameter the second parameter is the
start date the start date is going to be
hire date so we want the difference
between hire date and today's date how
are we going to get today's date we can
use get date inbuilt function and let's
give this column an early let's call it
death and then let's order the results
by hire date in descending order let's
execute this query and see what output
we get so look at the odd but notice the
first two rows if you look at these two
employees they're hired in the month of
May and if you look at today's date it's
May 30th so we are in the same month so
obviously the difference between their
hire date and today's date in months is
0 but for the employees who are hired in
the month of April the difference in
months is 1 for the employees who are
hired in the month of March the
difference is 2 so now we can use this
expression to filter and get the
employees that we want let's say for
example the interviewer has asked you to
find all the employees who are hired
the last three months all you need to do
is use a very loss so where the day
difference in months is between 1 and 3
so that will give us the employees who
are hired in the month of April March
and February so let's execute this query
look at that so people who are hired in
the month of April March and February of
2014 are only retrieved ok so very
straightforward now let's say for
example if the interviewer asks you can
you write a query to find all the
employees who are hired in the last 30
days then we can use the same query and
then by simply changing the interval
parameter here we can achieve that so we
want to find out the employees who are
hired in the last 30 days so we want the
difference between hire date and today's
date in days and if that's the case use
day as the parameter value for date they
function and then let's change this
upper threshold level to 30 so let's
execute this and look at this we are
only getting the employees you know who
are hired in the last 30 days ok now if
the interviewer asks you you know can
you write a query to find the employees
who are hired in the last one year then
simply replace this day with year
so the lower threshold is going to be
one upper threshold is going to be one
okay so when we execute this we get all
the employees who are hired in the 2013
okay look at that people who are hired
from December through January of 2013
are only returned if you want you know
all the employees who are hired in the
last two years okay that is in 2014 as
well as 2013 change the lower threshold
to zero now do we really need to have
this date day function in the Select
list not really since we want to
visually see the difference you know in
the results that we have included it
there but the actual query need not have
it so here you can put you know any
number that you want and that's going to
give you you know the employees who are
hired until that year so it's that
simple that's it for today thank you for
listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
