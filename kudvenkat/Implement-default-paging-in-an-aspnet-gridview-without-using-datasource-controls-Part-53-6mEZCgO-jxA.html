invented this is part 53 of a spirit
activeview tutorial in this video we'll
discuss about implementing default
paging in a group you control that does
not use any data source controls will be
using table TBL employee for this demo
so to retrieve data from this table
let's go ahead and implement employee
data access layer so let's flip to
visual studio let's add a class file to
our project and let's call it employee
data access layer dot CS now to
encapsulate the employee information
that's present in the stable let's
design employee class to speed things up
I have this class already implemented so
let's copy this and paste that into our
employee data access layer class file
now this is a very straightforward class
but for auto implemented properties
employee ID name gender and City now
within our employee data access layer
class we need a method which can
retrieve data from this table so
obviously we need to write ad or dotnet
code so first let's go ahead and import
the required namespaces ato dotnet
namespaces system data system door data
dot single client and system dot
configuration now let's copy and paste
the method itself
so if you look at this method this is a
very straightforward method look at the
name of the method get all employees
which is returning list of employee
objects we are first creating an
instance a variable of type list
employee and using the configuration
manager class we are reading the
connection string from web config file
using that connection string we are
building or a sequel connection object
look at the sequel command select star
from TBL employee we are executing that
sequel command and looping through each
row and converting that row into an
employee object this employee object is
then added to the list and finally we
return that list back so now let's flip
to the form 1 and dot aspx let's drag
and drop a grid view control onto this
waveform and let's auto format this
could be control let's choose
brown-sugar scheme now by default the
paging is not enabled so let's go ahead
and enable paging so get to the
properties of the grid view control and
then we have this property allow paging
which is false by default let's set that
to true so that should enable paging and
look at the page size by default we get
it you know the page size at stand let's
go ahead and set the page size to 3 all
right so within the code-behind file in
the page load event look at this if not
is post bacc meaning if it is the
initial get request of the waveform then
we are invoking get all employees method
of our employee data access layer class
this method returns list of employee
objects back which is going to act as
the data source for or could be control
and then invoking their data bind method
ok so at this point let's go ahead and
run this as you might expect the grid
view control should display employee
data with three rows on each page so on
the first page I have three records but
let me click on page number two and look
at look at what's happening you know we
get a runtime error grid view grid be
one fired event page index changing
which wasn't handled so obviously when I
click on that page number you know grid
we control raises the cement page index
changing event and we need to handle
that event so obviously first let's
generate the even handler method
for the grid we control so get to the
properties of the grid we control by
pressing f4 click on the even second
then the event name is page index
changing so double click on that to
generate the even handler method and
here you know what we need to do when
the page indexes has changed you know
when it is about to change
we need to set you know the grid view 1
page index to the new page index which
is going to be the you know the second
page so how do I know what is the new
page index going to be I use this object
grid view page event arguments object so
the page index of the grid view control
should be equal to e dot new page index
look at this this new page index what is
the return type it's an integer and page
index is also an integer so we are
setting the page index property of this
grid we one control to the new page
index and that's it
all that is left out is you know
retrieve invoke the get employees method
of the employee data access layer you
know said that as the datasource and
invoke the data bind that's it we are
done so the default paging for the grid
view control is now enabled ok so we are
around page one I click on page two look
at that I get the second set of three
records and on page three we will only
have two records because there are a
total of only 8 records within the
database table in our next video we'll
discuss about implementing custom paging
with asp.net grid view control on this
slide you can find resources for
Dannette c-sharp and simples the way
interview questions that's it for today
