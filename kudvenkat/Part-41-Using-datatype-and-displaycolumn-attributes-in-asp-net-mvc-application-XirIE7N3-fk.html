this video we'll discuss data type and
display column attributes
please watch but 40 before proceeding
we'll be using the same example that we
started in Pat Forde a data type is a
very useful attribute and can be used in
a variety of scenarios for example in
this table we have this email address
column and this column is displayed as
plain text
instead we want the email address to be
rendered with mail to hyperlink and the
advantage of this is that when we click
on that hyperlink it's going to open the
default email client automatically for
example if you have Microsoft Outlook
configured as your default email client
once you click on this email address
with mail to hyperlink it's going to
open Microsoft Outlook automatically for
you and to achieve this you simply need
to decorate the email address property
within our employee metadata class with
data type attribute and specify that it
is an email address using data type enum
let's look at this in action let's flip
to visual studio so here we have our
employee metadata class the property is
email address which is of type string
and let's decorate this with data type
attribute and using data type enum we
are going to specify that this is an
email address let's build a solution and
let's refresh the view once this view
refreshes it should render that email
address with mail to hyperlink notice
within the status bar you should see
that mail to hyperlink and at the moment
when I click on this hyperlink nothing
happens on my machine because I don't
have any our email client configured on
my machine another scenario where you
can use data type attribute is when you
want to associate currency symbols
notice that here we have celery and at
the moment celery is displayed you know
we don't have celery : displayed that's
because we are using the scaffold column
attribute and we specified a value of
false meaning we don't want this celery
column to be rendered so let's turn this
to true so that the celery column I mean
property is displayed and we want to
associate a currency symbol with that
again for that purpose we can make use
of data type attribute and specify that
this is a currency using data type enum
let's build our solution and let's
refresh this view celery should be
displayed and it should I mean it's
displaying a Great British Pound by
default on my machine ok but let's say
instead you want to associate for
example US dollar with this amount and
to achieve this all you need to do is in
your web config file specify culture
using globalisation element so on the
system dot vamp use the globalisation
element and specify culture as English -
United States save the changes let's
refresh this and instead of the Great
British Brown you know notice that we
have a dollar symbol there and another
scenario where you can use this if you
know look at this every employee has got
and website and then you know at the
moment the website address is displayed
as plain text instead we want that to be
displayed as a hyperlink and to very
easily achieve that all you need to do
is to create that property with you know
data type attribute and specify that
it's a URL using data type dot URL so
let's do that within our employee class
so public strength the name of the
property is personal website
datatype
let's build this and let's refresh
overview and this should be rendered as
a hyperlink okay this error is because
we have mistyped the name of the
property it's personal website let's
look at the name of the property it's
personal website and to get it right I'm
actually going to copy that from our
auto-generated file the name of the
properties should match
so personal website let's copy that
let's build it once again and let's
refresh this
so now we have personal website rendered
as hyperlink and notice that once I
click on this URL it opens the target
page within the same window now next
video session we'll actually see how to
open you know URLs in a new window
especially when we are using this data
type dot URL UNAM and again we can also
use this data type attribute if you only
want to select a node date part or time
part of date/time data type another
attribute that we will discuss today is
display column attribute this attribute
is very useful when a class has a
property of complex type and you want to
pick one property of this complex object
for display purpose notice that here we
have this company director property
within this company class which is
returning a complex type of employee so
this employee class has got several
properties but then for display we want
to pick one property of this employee
class let's say for example full name
let's see how to achieve this first of
all let's go ahead and design our
company class so within our models
folder I'm going to add a class file and
let's name it company dot CS and to
speed things up I have this company
director property already implemented so
let me copy and paste this within our
company class so all we are doing is
having you know this company director
property which is returning an employee
object and then here we have hard-coded
an employee ID of one and we are
returning the first employee okay and
then within our home controller let's
make this change let's actually create
an instance of company object
and then pass this company object as the
model to view and then within the
details view I'm going to get rid of all
this code
so the company class is going to be the
model for this view and then what we are
going to do we are going to use this
HTML helper display text for
and then we are going to specify the
property X such that X dot company
director and remember this property is
going to return a complex object okay
which is nothing but the employee object
in our case and this employee object has
got many properties out of these many
properties I just want let's say for
example the full name of the employee to
be displayed then what you know how do
we achieve that we can use display
column attribute notice that in the
partial employee class you know I have
decorated this class with the display
column attribute you know and then I
specify the column as full name so
wherever you know we have this complex
type you know and then and if we are
using this display text for a helper
it's going to look if there is this
display column attribute specified and
it's going to use that column you know
for display purposes in this case we
have specified we are going to specify
within the employee class so within this
partial class we are going to specify
display column attribute
and we are specifying the property that
we want to use for display purposes full
name so let's build this and let's go
ahead and refresh our view it should
only display the full name of the
employee in this case what is that we
get John Smith in our next video we'll
discuss opening URLs in a new browser
vendor on the slide you can find
resources for a speed or nets eShop and
sequence of interview questions that's
it for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
