this video we'll discuss display display
name display format and scaffold column
attributes
please watch by 39 before proceeding for
the purposes of this demo we'll be using
this table TBL employee i'll have the
sequel script available on my blog in
case if you need it to represent each
employee within this table TBL employee
we need an employee entity class and to
generate the employee entity class we're
going to make use of a do dotnet entity
framework so let's flip to visual studio
let's right click on the models folder
add a new item and let's select data
under install templates
ato dotnet entity data model and let's
name the sample data model click Add and
we want our model to generate from the
database click Next let's name or
connection string as sample DB context
click Next this is going to connect to
the database and retrieve all the tables
views and stored procedures and our
table name here is TBL employee and we
want our entities to live in models
namespace let's click finish so this
should generate an entity with named TBL
employee but we want our entity to
actually be named as employee so let's
go ahead and change it accordingly
save everything and let's build our
solution and at this point let's go
ahead and add home controller and let's
select MVC controller with empty
readwrite actions as the template click
Add and now we are interested in
implementing details action method so we
pass an employee ID this method is going
to retrieve the employee ID from the
database and then it's going to pass
that employee object to the view and you
know this auto-generated entity class
file is going to have an employee entity
class notice that this employee class is
actually implemented as a partial class
and notice the namespace its present in
MVC demo dot models and since we want to
use an employee class within the home
controller let's go ahead and include
this namespace
in the home controller and let's create
an instance of our sample dbcontext
class and this class has got employees
property which is going to return the
list of employees back out of which we
want a single employee where the ID of
the employee must be equal to whatever
ID that we are passing into this detail
section method and that's going to
retrieve a single employee which we are
storing in this object and then we will
hand this object to the view the next
step is to actually add the details view
so let's right click on the details
action method add view the name of the
view is going to be details we're going
to make use of razor view engine and
we're going to create a strongly typed
view against employee models class and
this careful template is going to be
details so this should add details view
and to set adls our font-family let's
use a div tag here and specify the style
attribute and let's font-family as area
alright with all these changes let's
build solution let's run this and
navigate to details action and let's
navigate to employee 1 ok so you know
obviously here this view is not that
pretty first of all look at the property
name here full name we don't have a
space between full and named let's say
we want you know that property on the UI
to be displayed like this with a space
in between full and named how do we
achieve that we can make use of this
display attribute and now we need to
apply these attributes to the properties
of the employee class but this employee
class that is present in the sample data
model that designer dot CS this is
auto-generated file so obviously if we
make any customizations to this file
there's a disadvantage because anytime
this class is auto-generated again we're
going to lose all those customizations
that's why it's not a good practice to
make any customizations to the sort
generated class because this class is
implemented as a partial class we can
have another employee partial class and
then we can apply all our customizations
there so to a models folder I'm going to
add another class file I'm going to call
this employee dot CS and this is the
class which is going to contain all our
customizations so this is going to be
another partial class and then I'm going
to create another class here public
class and I'm going to call this
employee metadata so this class is
actually going to contain the metadata
related to the employee class and then
to associate this employee metadata
class with employee partial class I am
going to use metadata type attribute and
that attribute is present in system
component model the data annotations
namespace so now let's go ahead and use
metadata type attribute and then specify
that this class is going to contain the
metadata for employee class all right so
now we want to have a space you know on
the full name property so public
strength the name of the property is
full name and let's have the get insert
accesses and now we are going to use
that display attribute so display
attribute and that this has a property
Nate and named property which is nothing
but the name and then you can specify
whatever name you want so I'm going to
specify full name with a space in that
let's build the solution let's refresh
this view and we should get a space
between full and named there so look at
that and if you notice the way we have
used this display attribute look at this
you can either use the full name of the
attribute which is display attribute or
simply use this
a okay we're going to have the same
effect an instead of using display
attribute there is another attribute to
achieve the same thing we can use
display name attribute as well the only
difference between these two is that
here we are using and named parameter
but whereas here we are passing the
parameter you know you know with here we
are not using a named parameter it's as
simple as that
alright now another interesting you know
attribute that can be used you know to
control the display is display format
attribute okay so if you look at higher
date right here look at that we have
date in time let's say instead of
displaying date and time we just want to
display date then we can use display
format attribute and specify our data
format string and notice that we are
using the data format string as 0 : d d
for short date string that's only the
date part of daytime again display
format can either be used like this I
can you or you can use the full name of
the attribute they'll have the same
output on the other hand if you want a
date and time ok here the time is in
24-hour notation then you can use the
data format string notice that 0 :
you're specifying ddmm yyy and since we
are using capital H here for hours you
know we are going to be able to get time
in 24-hour notation on the other hand if
you want time in 12-hour notation with
a.m. and p.m. you can use in a small
case H there and T T so all these
customizations are possible using this
display format attribute let's quickly
look at that in action
so the type here is daytime and the
Sinhala bill date/time and the name of
the property is higher date and we want
to use display format attribute and
specify data format string again this is
specified as a named parameter and let's
specify our data format string that's 0
: d let's fill this let's navigate the
view look at that at the moment we have
date and time but we only want date part
so let's refresh this so you'll notice
that we only get the date part now if
you navigate to employee 2 here notice
that for employee to Mary Jane we don't
have gender specified that's stored as
now and then on the UI instead of
displaying now let's say you know if for
an employee a gender is not specified
then I want to display gender not
specified instead of the empty string
there how can we achieve that again we
can make use of display display format
attribute and there is another parameter
call now let display text where you can
specify the text for any null value now
here since the property is gender I am
specifying the null display text as
gender not specified in this case it's
going to display that if the gender of
the employee is now
so public string gender
and let's use this play format attribute
and the parameter is now displayed text
and then we can say gender not specified
so let's build this so at the moment
Mary Jane since she doesn't have gender
you know no value is displayed there but
now when we refresh this as you might
expect instead of the empty string it
should show gender not specified right
another very useful attribute is careful
to column attribute okay now if you
don't want to display a column then we
can make use of scaffold column
attribute let's say salary is
confidential information at the moment
notice that salary information is
displayed but for some reason we don't
want salary column to be displayed in
the view then you can control that using
scaffold column attribute all you need
to specify is you know passed false as
the value for thus a tribute and that's
not going to show that column but
however this attribute is going to only
work when you use display for modal HTML
helper at the moment if you look at the
way this details view is implemented
this is an auto-generated view for us
okay now notice that first of all it
didn't generate you know a div tag for
displaying ID so we don't have ID there
but it has generated you know a div tag
for salary so that's the reason why we
see salary there now if we apply the
scaffold column attribute if we apply
this attribute to this employee class
it's not going to work okay because
let's actually look at that so public
and salary
and let's specify this careful column
attribute and then pass false so we
don't want to scaffold the column let's
build a solution let's go back refresh
this notice that at the moment we have
salary displayed
but even after refreshing the view we
still have salary specified but we have
used this careful column attribute okay
so why is the salary being store still
being displayed that's because the
scaffold column attribute will only work
when you use display for model HTML
helper okay
so instead of all this HTML that we have
right here I can get the same output
using just one line display form model
using HTML helper so add HTML dot
display for model HTML helper so this
helper is going to go through each
property and then it's going to render
the UI for us automatically
so let's rebuilders let's go back to the
view and let's refresh this and look at
that salary is not displayed now but
then ID is displayed again okay you know
if you remember the previous with the
previous implementation of this view we
didn't have this problem because the
auto-generated view it didn't generate a
div tag for ID so it didn't display that
but this display for model you know is
displaying ID there let's say we don't
want the ID also to be displayed all we
need to do is have you know ID property
and specifies careful column attribute
on that property as well alright in our
next video we'll discuss data type and
display column at views on this slide
