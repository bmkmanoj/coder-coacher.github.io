in this video well discuss the
significance of ngmodel group directive
along the way we'll discuss another way
of implementing confirm password field
validation in our previous two videos we
discussed one way to implement a confirm
password field validation there is
another way as well so let's look at
that in this video in our previous video
we have included this ng-model group
directive to group our password field
and confirm password fields at the
moment we are using our custom validator
that is this confirm equal well data as
a directive on this confirm password
field right here now what we want to be
able to do is use this directive on this
group right here which contains our
password field and confirm password
field so let's go ahead and include our
directive right here since we have
specified the directive on the group we
don't have to again include it on the
confirm password field so let's go ahead
and remove that from there the benefit
of grouping of form controls using this
ng-model group directive is that
whenever the form controls within the
group changes our custom validation is
automatically triggered because notice
we are now using our custom directive on
this group and not on the individual
form controls so this means whenever the
password field our confirm password
field value changes our custom
validation is automatically triggered so
we don't have to explicitly trigger a
controls validation using this update
value and validity function so we can go
ahead and remove this event binding from
here now notice of a custom validation
directive since it is applied on this
group this group is passed as a
parameter to the validate function
within our custom validator class so to
make this parameter name more meaningful
I'm going to change the name of the
parameter from control to password group
because what we are passing here is
essentially of a password group which
contains both of our password field and
confirm password field so let's use this
parameter to get the password field and
confirm password fields so we use the
group name dot ket and then we specify
the name of our password field and the
name of our password field is password
as you can see right here so let's use
this name and get a reference to the
password field let's name this constant
password field
similarly let's also retrieve our
confirm password field let's name the
constant confirm password field the name
of our confirm password field is confirm
password so all that is left now is to
check whether if our password field and
confirm password field is true thee and
if our password field value is not equal
to confirm password field value then we
want to return this object indicating
that the validation has failed otherwise
we return null indicating validation has
succeeded at the moment we are not using
this input property anymore so let's
delete that and let's also delete the
input type from here now the very
important point to keep in mind is this
notice we are passing the password group
as a parameter to the validate method
and when the validation fails meaning
when the password field and the confirm
password fields don't match we are
returning this object with the key not
equal so when there is a validation
error angular is going to attach this
key to the password group and not to the
individual form controls that is not the
password field and confirm password
fields this means within our view
template we should be checking this key
not equal on the errors collection of
the password group and not the password
field and confirm password fields so for
us to be able to do that let's go ahead
and create a template reference variable
for
this ng-model group so let's name our
template reference variable password
group and to create this template
reference variable we need this ng-model
group right here now instead of using
the confirm password field here and here
we use the password group and then check
its errors collection for this key not
equal and we'd no longer need this
condition so let's get rid of that
finally we need to do a similar change
on the confirm password field so let's
copy this and then make that change on
the confirm password field so instead of
checking for the not equal key on the
errors collection of the confirm
password field we check for that key on
the password group instead notice when
the password and confirm password don't
match we get the validation error as
expected and when they match the
validation error disappears so we use
this ng-model group directive to create
a subgroup within a form this is useful
to validate a subgroup of elements on
the form in our case we have used this
ngmodel group directive to validate if
password field and confirm password
fields require this directive is also
useful to group properties of the form
model into a nested object the name of
the ng group directive will become the
key for the nested object in the form
model so if we take a look at our
employee form notice these two property
is password and confirm password they
are grouped into a nested object and the
key for this nested object is the name
that we have given to our ng model group
directive which is password group
finally this ng-model group directive
can only be used as a child of ng form
directive so if we take a look at our
view template notice at the top right
here we have this ng form directive
which creates this route form group and
then we have our ng model group
directive nested as a child and this ng
model
Group directive creates a subgroup
within the route form group on our
employee form we don't need this
password field and confirm password
fields I only included them to
demonstrate Crossfield validation so
let's go ahead and delete this ngmodel
group div notice now on our employee
form we don't have the password fields
anymore that's it in this video thank
you for watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
