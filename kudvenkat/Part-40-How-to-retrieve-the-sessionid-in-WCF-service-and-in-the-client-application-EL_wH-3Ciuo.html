this video we'll discuss retrieving
session ID in the VFC service and in the
client application
this is continuation to power 39 so
please watch part 39 before proceed in
in order to send messages from a
particular client to a particular
service instance on the server WCF uses
session ID notice that client 1 session
ID matches with the session ID of
service instance 4 client 1 and the same
is the case for client 2 and service
instance for client - so basically WCF
uses these session IDs to send and
receive messages between the client and
their respective service instance but
keep in mind there are different types
of sessions in WCF you know for example
there are application sessions transport
sessions reliable sessions etc we'll
discuss each of these sessions in great
detail in a later video session for now
just concentrate on how to retrieve
session ID both in the WCF service and
in the client application so to retrieve
session ID from the client application
all you need to do is on the proxy
instance you know there's an energy in a
channel property on that there is
session ID property so that's what we
use to retrieve the session ID from the
client application on the WCF service
side you know every time you invoke in
operation there is something called
operation context and that has called
this current property and on that we
have session ID property which should in
order to on the session ID so let's go
ahead and make these changes to our WCF
service and the client application will
be working with the same example that we
worked with in the previous session so
let's flip to visual studio so here we
have our simple service so within our
service implementation file so here we
have the operation increment number
which our client applications call so
every time somebody calls this you know
operation we want to print the session
ID you know within the service host
console and in order to do do that let's
use system dot console class
and rightly and method to print the
session ID so let's just say session ID
: and then we use operation context dot
there is current property and on that we
have session ID which returns the
session ID as a string so that's what we
want to plan so every time somebody
invokes this operation you know we are
going to print that message out onto the
console alright so with this change
let's go ahead and run our service host
and now let's get to the client
application so you know when we click
the button you know we are showing the
number you know in a message box along
with the number let's also display the
session ID let's actually use here
backslash n which is going to print you
know a newline character so that session
ID will be printed in the next line so
let's say session ID colon and then to
that we need to append the session ID so
what is our service instance here it's
called client so on the client object we
should have inner channel property and
on that we have session ID again session
ID is returned as a string all right
with these changes let's go ahead and
run our client application and then
invoke the button look at that session
ID is F 3 6 5 B 5 you know that's what
is the session ID on the client let us
see what we have got on the server look
at this we have a different session ID
okay let's actually click this button
once more so a session has time down
let's click it once more okay look at
that
it starts with F 3 6 5 but on the server
side look at that it is c e 8 2 8 so why
are these session IDs different we
expected them to be same because that's
what we thought WCF you
you know basically to send and receive
messages between the client and the
service instance but in our case here
actually the session IDs are different
between the client and the WCF service
why is that that's because the client
side and server side session IDs are
correlated using something called
reliable session ID so here with in our
example we're actually using TCP binding
that's actually flipped to our WCF
service and if you look at the app
config file look at that we're using TCP
binding and TCP binding has got
different types of sessions okay now
what we are interested in is reliable
session you know that's what the code
that's what correlate messages between
the client and you know the WCF service
so here by default for the ccp binding
reliable sessions are disabled so let's
go ahead and enable reliable sessions
and to enable reliable sessions all you
need to do is use this reliable session
element and set the enabled attribute to
true all right so let's go ahead and
close declined and the service host
which are which is running let's rerun
the service host let's go back to the
client application and let's update our
service reference
and then run our client application in
work service so now look at that it
starts with a two double-a you know the
session ID on the client and let's look
it on the server look at that it is a
two double-a now the session IDs match
okay so in work it again once again
session timed out
let's click the button look at that this
time at six nine a and that's what we
got there you know the same session ID
is used okay so if tcp binding is being
used with reliable sessions disabled
then the client and server session IDs
will be different and why is that that's
because the client side and server side
session IDs are correlated using the
reliable session ID on the other hand if
the label sessions are enabled
obviously the session IDs will be same
okay but in case of WS HTTP binding
irrespective of whether reliable
sessions are enabled or not the session
IDs will always be same both you know on
the client as well as on the the VC of
service side let's actually look at that
in action let's close the client that's
running that's also close this service
host let's flip to our WCF service at
the moment we are using net tcp binding
so here the binding is net TCP let's
actually change that to WS HTTP binding
but before that let's use here the
binding as WS HTTP binding
let's give it a name let's call it WS
HTTP and let's set receive timeout to
something like you know the default or
let's get rid of received timeout
altogether
we don't really require it and then
reliable sessions let's actually disable
them and say if the session IDs on the
client and the WCF service will be the
same and we can get rid of this net TCP
binding because we are not going to use
that anymore
and all we need to do here is specify
that we want to use WS HTTP binding and
we also need to change the binding
configuration attribute to use WS HTTP
all right so let's go ahead and run our
service host so with the WCF service now
we are using WS HTTP binding and we have
disabled reliable sessions now let's go
back to the client application let's
actually delete the service reference
and let's add a service reference so
this should find out our WCF service
so let's specify the namespace as simple
service click OK all right now the
client is also using reliable sessions I
mean WS HTTP binding so let's go ahead
and run our client and work service look
at that the session ID starts with C 3 1
3 0 so C 3 1 3 0 let's click OK let's
click that once more and look at that
it's the same session ID C 3 1 3 0 and
on the WCF service C 3 1 3 0 okay so
with WS HTTP binding irrespective of
whether reliable sessions are enabled or
not the session IDs will be same but in
case of TCP binding if the label session
is disabled then the client session ID
will not match with server-side session
ID that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
