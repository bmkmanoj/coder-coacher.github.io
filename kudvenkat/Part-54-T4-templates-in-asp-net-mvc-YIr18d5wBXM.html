in this video we discuss what are t4
templates in their purpose
customizing t4 templates so what are t4
templates and what is their purpose
t4 stands for text template
transformation toolkit these t4
templates are used by visual studio to
generate poor when we add a view or a
controller so to add a view we simply
right-click on a controller action
method and select add view from the
context menu this is going to bring up
this add view dialog box let's say the
name of the view is going to be index
we're going to make use of razor view
engine I'm going to create a strongly
typed view against employee model class
and notice the scaffold template
drop-down list now we have several
templates here these are nothing but the
t4 templates now let me select list t4
template and then when I click add this
going to generate index dot CSS HTML
view and then look at the amount of code
that is generated now this add view
dialog box has used that list t4
template to generate this code for us
automatically so the obvious next
question is where does these p4
templates
live they live at this path look at the
path you know we have to navigate to
Program Files Microsoft Visual Studio 10
common 7 IDE item templates and look at
this after item templates there is this
c-sharp folder now if you want to modify
the templates for f-sharp or Visual
Basic then get into that directory and
then within that we have web and then
MVC version so which version of MVC are
you using if you want to customize the
templates for MVC 4 then you would go
into MVC 4 folder if you want to
customize the templates for MVC 2 then
you would go into that folder within
that MVC version folder then we have
code templates that's where these T 4
templates are living let's quickly
navigate to that directory so we'll get
into the run window c program files and
then within that microsoft visual studio
10
and then within that common seven IDE
item templates and then you have the
programming languages here at C sharp F
sharp Visual Basic let's go to C sharp
and within that fab and within that we
have different MVC versions we want to
customize the template for MVC 4 so
let's get into the directory there and
we have this code templates folder now
look at that there are two folders here
one is the add controller and the other
one is add view now we can also add a
controller to a project and then when we
add a controller there is controller
code that's also generated for us okay
now you know when we add a controller
these are the default templates that are
used by Visual Studio and we add a view
then the templates that are present in
this add view folder are the templates
that are used by Visual Studio so within
add view we have two different folders
aspx c-sharp and CS HTML depending on
the view engine that you are using you
can customize them for example if you
want to customize the default templates
for aspx view engine then you would get
into that folder if it's for rays of
view then you would get into that CSS
HTML folder and notice the list of
templates that we have look at this this
list is going to match with what we have
in this add view dialog box so if I
right click and say add view and then
look at this drop down list we have
create delete all the templates there
whatever that are present here okay now
the next question is what is the file
extension for default templates its dot
TT so all these default templates have
that extension is it possible to add
your own default template to the
existing list of templates absolutely
all you need to do is create a file with
dot TT file extension let's say you know
here we have some existing t4 templates
let's make a copy of this list template
let's paste that so we have list copy TT
now if we go back and then if we select
add view and then within the drop down
look at that we can see in a list copy
t4 template there all right so the next
question is is it possible to customize
these t4 templates absolutely default
templates can be customized in place
meaning we can change them the list of
templates that are here we can change
them here and let's see what's going to
happen if we change them here now to
change them I'm going to open a notepad
I have to run this as an administrator
and then I'm going to open one of these
templates so file open and then we need
need to navigate to this path so let me
copy that path and then paste that
within this address bar and then I don't
see any of the templates that's because
by default it's going to show only those
files that have got T or dot txt
extension
Lendl but then let's change that to all
files so here we have the list of
templates so let me select that list TT
let's open that now notice that when we
added this index view it has generated
all this code for us and there is an h2
tag also generated where you know the
hd2 again that tag has the name of the
view index in this case now let's say I
want to also have a bold tag and then an
underline tag so something like this
okay so we want this to be generated
like this now to do that we can
customize this list T for template so
obviously we need to navigate to the
location where that code is being
generated so this is where that's being
generated so simply here I'm going to
pull that and I'm going to underline
that obviously we have to close those
tags as well so close the underline tag
close the bold tag save this one now
let's go back to our MVC
demo project let's actually delete this
index view and let's add the index view
once again so let's select the list
template now keep in mind we have
already customized to that so when we
click add it should generate that h2 tag
with bold and underline as well what is
that we get those changes applied now
since we have changed these templates
within this location if you have
multiple projects that you are creating
on this machine then all of them are
going to make use of this customized
template so here I have another project
MVC app let me add an index view here
and let's select the list as a scaffold
template click Add so this is another
project look at that the changes are
reflected here as well because all of
the projects you know visual studio by
default is going to make use of
templates that are present in that
location now they may they might be
situations where you want to customize
them only for a specific project that is
the case all you need to do is let's
undo those changes so let's get it off
these tags
let's save it let's close this file now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
copy this entire code templates folder
and then let's go back to our MVC demo
and then let's place that folder within
the root directory
so here the moment we do that you know
Visual Studio is going to run them
automatically but we don't want to run
them so click on cancel because there
are several templates you're going to
get this dialog box a lot of time so
click cancel you know to cancel running
them okay so we have the code templates
folder here so I'm going to go to add
view and then CS HTML so we have a list
there and let's say now we want to
modify this to use bold and underline
and let's close those tags as well lose
the online and close the bowl tag let's
save it we don't want to run it they
simply want to save it okay and then one
more thing that we need to do is get to
the properties and then delete this you
know property value text template file
generator now by deleting this we are
telling Visual Studio not to run this
template every time we build a solution
ok so we are going to manually invoke
you know this template the execution of
this template using that ad view dialog
box so it's going to be manually invoked
and when I say rightly when I right
click on the controller action method
add new so we here we have the add view
dialog box when I select this list
template here and then when I click on
add that pifo template is going to be
executed at that point of time so when I
click add this should generate index
view because we already have an index
view let's actually rename it to index
two and when we do that look at that the
changes should be applied here because
you know the default template is
residing within this project directory
if I go back to
vfc which is a different project and
here we have we don't have those
customized t4 templates so it's going to
make use of the default templates that
are present you know at this path code
templates add view CS HTML so here these
templates are not customized so when I
add the index view let's make it index 2
you should notice that you know look at
that for the h2 tag it didn't add that
pull tag actually we didn't select list
as our default template let's do that
now let's make this index 3 let's select
this careful template as list let's add
and look at that we don't have that bold
and underlined text there because it's
using the template by default that's
present at this location alright this
