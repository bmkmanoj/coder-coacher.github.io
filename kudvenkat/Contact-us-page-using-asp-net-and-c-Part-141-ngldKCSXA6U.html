this video we'll discuss designing
contact us page using asp.net and C
sharp
these days it's common for most of the
websites to include a Contact Us page
that looks something like this first of
all let's go to InDesign at this forum
let's flip to visual studio here I have
a blank asp.net webforms application
first of all let's go ahead and set the
font family to Arial alright the first
thing here we need is a field set that
gives us this border and then this text
to contact us so let's go ahead and
include field set here and then let's
set the width of the field set to be 350
pixels
and then let's include a legend for this
feel set and you know we want this text
contact us so let's go and include that
text as part of this legend all right
so within this feel set we need a table
and then we need a table row and each
table row should contain at three TDs
the first two TDS for displaying the
stacks and the second TDS for the text
box and the third PD is for the
validation control so let's go ahead and
include a table first let's include at
TR and then we need three TDs so let's
make a copy of the steady 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 so the
first at TD is going to contain the
literal text in your name or email so
the first one will be name and let's put
that inside a bold tag and then the next
TD should contain a text box control so
let's go ahead and include it text box
control and let's change the ID of this
text box to something like txt name and
then in the final today we want name to
be a required field so let's go ahead
and include a required field validator
there let's go to the tool box and then
under validation tab we should see
required field validator so let's
include that there and there are several
properties that we need to set for this
required field validator
so let's go and set those properties
first of all the error message we want
something like name is required and then
we want to set the other properties like
the control that we want to validate so
which control we want to alidev alidade
we want to validate this txt name
control which is what we will include
here and then we need to set the text
equal to star that's basically because
we don't want the detail error message
to be displayed next
to the control instead next to the
control we want to display that asterisk
symbol and then the detail error message
should be displayed within the
validation summary at the bottom so
that's the reason we are setting text to
star and then we want the error message
to be displayed in red color so let's
also set for color property so let's set
the for color to red alright so that's
the first row so if we flip the waveform
to the design mode look at that we have
name at Xbox control and then Eric white
field value data another thing that I
want to do is I want to set width for
this textbox control let's set it to
something like 200 pixels all right so
now just to speed things up let's make a
copy of this TR so the first row
contains the name the second row should
contain email so let's change the
required pieces so this is email and
let's call this textbox
txt email and obviously let's say email
is also required field so we are going
to use this required field but here
control to validate will be txt email
and then we should say email is required
okay and then another thing that we
require with the email is a regular
expression valid data because if
somebody enters an invalid email then we
want to tell the user that's it's an
invalid email and it's very easy to
check the format of the email using
regular expression validator
so let's actually drag and drop a
regular expression valid data as well
and let's actually flip to the design
mode and then configure this regular
expression validator so plus f4 to get
to the properties and then first of all
the error message is going to be email
or please enter a valid email okay so
that's going to be the error message and
the four-color we want that to be maybe
red let's actually type that too
read and control to validate which
control we want to add validate txt
email alright and let's also set the
text property because we don't want the
detail error message to be displayed
instead we want you know an asterisk
symbol alright so that's the second TR
so we are done with name and email now
let's make a copy of this TR
so the next one is for subject so let's
paste it there and let's change this to
subject and let's call this text box as
txt subject and let's say the error
message is subject is required
controlled validate is going to be txt
subject all right and finally
we want comments so let's include
comments and let's call this tx2 a
comments comments are required and then
control to validate is going to be txt
comments all right so at this point we
have all the fields next we need the
validation summary control which is
going to display any of the validation
errors so let's go ahead and include
another PR here but then look at that
every TR until this point has got three
TDS with a net but then this TI is just
going to contain one TD but then the
width of that one TD should span across
three TDs so let's set call span to
three and then let's include validation
summary control so this is the control
which is going to display the detail
error messages and the one property that
we need to set here is for color because
we want the error message messages to be
displayed in red and then we also want
to include a header text for this
because we want to include the specific
text please fix the following errors so
let's include that
all right and then the other thing that
we need is look at this so when we enter
the required fields and then once we
click Submit
okay so we will be disabling all these
controls and the submit button because
we don't want the user to be again
clicking the submit button and then we
will send an email to the administrator
or the person responsible for that site
and then we want to give some feedback
to the user you know that stating that
you know thank you for contacting us or
you know your comment has been forwarded
to the administrator so basically we
want to give some status and to display
that status information we need to label
control as well so let's go ahead and
include another TR and then within that
again we are going to contain one TD and
the width of that one TD is going to
span across three TDs and then we are
going to have a label control here so
let's drag and drop a label control we
don't want any default text within that
label control so let's get rid of that
and let's set font bold to true alright
and then the final one thing that we
need here is a button control to submit
the form so again let's set column span
to 3 and then let's include a button
control and let's call the submit and
then obviously once we double click this
button control that's when we want to
submit the page all right ok at this
point let's actually run this and see if
everything works as expected so at this
point we should not be able to submit
the form without filling the required
details ok and another thing we don't
want a single line a textbox for
comments we want a multi-line a textbox
so let's go ahead and fix that so let's
go to the properties of this textbox
control and then they should be a
property called text mode let's set that
to multi-line and then you can also
control you know how many rows you want
to display let's say for example by
default I want to display 5 rows so
that's going to increase the
right of the text box and then another
thing that I want look at this dis
comments I want that to be displayed on
the top something like this and the
validation error also on the top and not
in the middle okay so to achieve that we
can simply set so this is the comment
feel so style there's something called
vertical line and let's set that to top
so let's copy this style and then
replicate that across all these three
TDs
alright so now let's flip to the design
mode look at that it works as expected
alright let's save these changes and
then let's reload this feel so we should
get a multi-line text box and look at
this if I don't enter any of this data I
click Submit okay so we get the
validation errors as expected so but
look at this email feel now if I enter
an invalid email and then click Submit
look at that we get that message please
enter a valid email but then look at
that asterisk symbol it's not aligned
properly it's displayed you know a
little away from the text box that's
basically because we have another
validated it that's the required field
validator but then that's not displayed
but it's still occupying the space there
so we don't want this error to be
displayed we want that ashtray to be
displayed immediately next to the
textbox control and to achieve that all
we need to do is so these are the two
validation controls for email so if you
look at email we have two validation
controls required field validator and
regular expression valid data so there
is another property called dynamic
so let's actually display so this
display contains three value static none
or dynamic by default it's going to be
static meaning even if the control is
not rendered okay it's going to occupy
that space on the screen
but we don't want that space to be
occupied in case additional validation
error because it's occupying that space
is pushing the other validation control
away from the textbox so in order to fix
that all we need to do is set this
display to dynamic for both validation
controls that's for the required field
validator and regular expression
validator all right so with these
changes let's actually reload this view
so let's click Submit so email lists
require this fine but let's try to
include an invalid email click Submit
please enter a valid email and look at
that it's properly aligned now alright
so in this video we have discussed
designing this page in our next video
we'll see you know implementing the
server-side code which will actually
submit that data to the server and we
will send an email to the administrator
or the person responsible and then we
should be able to disable the controls
as well so that the user doesn't lick
the submit button button again alright
and then once we have submitted the form
we want to send an email
look at that within the email we have
sender name sender email and comments
okay so we will discuss this in our next
video session that's it for today thank
you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
