in this video we'll discuss watch window
in visual studio watch window is a very
useful debugging tool and can be used to
evaluate variables and expressions and
even edit the value of variables if
required during debugging and to get to
the watch window we can do that either
by using the visuals to your debug menu
or using this keyboard shortcut control
the control W but one thing that we need
to keep in mind is that to get to the
watch window the application must be in
debug mode at the moment we have the
simple console application here and we
are not in debug mode so if I go to the
debug menu and then windows notice that
we don't have any options to get to
watch render similarly if I try to use
the keyboard shortcut control D control
W look at what the message says the key
combination control D control W is bound
to command watch one which is not
currently available so this means that
to get to the watch window this
application must be in debug mode and to
do that let's put a breakpoint within
this print sum function and then run
this application within debug mode so at
the moment the application execution has
stopped at that breakpoint so one way to
get to the watch window is to simply
click on debug windows and then we have
watch here and then notice that we have
watch windows you know starting from
watch one through watch four okay so
that's one way the other way is to use
the keyboard shortcut control the
control W so control DW gets us to the
watch window now what is this watch
window useful for basically we can use
it during debugging to evaluate
variables expressions and if required we
also can change the values of variables
okay now let's say we want to add these
three variables n1 n2 and n3 to this
watch window and there are several ways
you can add variables to watch window
one of the simplest ways is to simply
right-click on that variable and then
select this option add watch from the
context menu notice that that variable
gets added and once a variable is added
by default within the watch window
record the name of the variable the
value it contains and its data type okay
the other way is to simply type the name
of the variable within the name
columned in this watch vendor so let's
say I want to add variable end to this
to this watch window I simply type the
name of the variable and then press
Enter
so the value that is with an end to
variable is 2 because look at this we
are calling the print sum function here
and passing 1 2 and 3 for n 1 n 2 and n
3 respectively and the third way to add
a variable to the watch window is to
simply drag and drop it so I drag this
variable to the watch window or you can
also copy and paste it if required so
you can simply copy it and paste it
within the name column okay so there are
several ways to add variables to the
watch render and we can also change the
value of a variable within the watch
window if required and to change the
value of the variable simply type the
name new value within the value column
that's a for example I want to change
the value of this one and one variable
from 1 to 10 and to do that in the value
column simply type the new value and
press Enter look at that now and one
value should be 10 so if I highlight I
mean how are the mouse over N one
variable look at this at the moment
it is displaying the value as 10 okay we
can also use watch window to evaluate
expressions now let's say for example I
want to check if N 1 is equal to n 2 so
I want to evaluate that expression
within the watch window so I can simply
enter the expression so N 1 double
equals n 2 and then once I press ENTER
look at that you know basically it is
returning false because that's an
expression and the return type of that
expression is a boolean look at the data
type and you know obviously N 1 is not
equal to n 2 that's why we get a value
of false so basically the idea is that
watch window can also be used to
evaluate expressions if required and to
delete the items from the watch window
let's say for example I want to remove
this n 3 from watch window you can
simply right click on that and then
select this option delete watch or if
you want to remove all the items from
the watch window simply right click on
the watch window and select this option
clear on that should clear all the items
from the watch window and you can also
use watch window to call a function if
quiet so let's say for example I want to
call the Sprint some function within the
watch window now obviously the Sprint
some function expects three parameters
so we need to pass values for those
parameters so let's copy the name of the
function
paste it right here and then pass the
values let's say we want to pass 10 20
and obviously notice that we also have
intelligence within the watch vendor and
30 and let's press ENTER look at that we
get the value and the return type is
integer and another thing which is
really useful is when a value of a
variable that is added to the watch
window changes then the new value is
reflected in the watch window okay so
let's understand that with an example
let's actually clear this now look at
this at the moment N 1 is 10 n 2 is 2
and n 3 is 3 and if you look at the sum
value at the moment it is 0 let's
actually add this variable to the watch
window ok so some value at the moment is
0 now let's go ahead and plus F 10 once
so we are now about to execute this
statement notice that the value of sum
is still 1 but after this expression is
evaluated some value is going to change
you know to something else other than 0
so as the variable value is changed look
at that that is immediately reflected
within the watch window all right so
that's about watch render thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
