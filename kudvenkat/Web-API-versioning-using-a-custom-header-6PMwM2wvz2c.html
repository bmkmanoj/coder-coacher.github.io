tutorial in this video well this is
implementing Web API versioning using a
custom version header this is
continuation to part 36 where we
discussed Web API versioning using a
query string parameter so please watch
about thirty-six before proceeding so
here's what we want to be able to do
notice within the request we have caught
a custom version header I named it X -
Student Service - version we can give it
any name we want and I have set it to a
value of two so a bevvy PA service
should be able to read this custom
version header and return version two
student objects as you can see here if
we specify the version is 1 then the
survey should written version 1 student
objects if you don't specify this header
all together then the web api service
should fall back to version 1 and return
version 1 student objects so let's see
how to achieve this this is the same
example that we worked with in our
previous video at a moment notice we are
using a query string parameter to
version our web api service and here is
the code which reads the query string
parameter value so let's come in these
two lines of code we are still going to
default version number to one just in
case if the request object doesn't
contain our custom version header we
want the web api service to fall back to
version 1 and return version 1 student
objects that's the reason we are
defaulting it to version 1 now let's
create a variable which is going to
store the name of our custom header so
let's call the variable custom header
and I'm going to initialize this to X -
student service - version you can give
it any name you want now let's check if
the request object headers collection
contains our custom header so if the
request headers collection contains our
custom header then we want to read our
custom version had a value and we want
to store that in this version number
variable so version number equals
let's use the request object again
request dot headers dot we're going to
use get values method and to this method
we need to pass the name of our custom
header which we have in this variable
and if you look at what this method
returns it returns ienumerable of string
object and we want just the first string
which contains our version number so to
get that first string we're going to use
the links first or default method so at
this point in this version number
variable we have the version number so
let's quickly build our solution and
test with feds are at the moment within
the request if not specified our custom
version header at all so in this case
the beby PA service should fall back to
version 1 and return us version 1
student objects now let's include our
custom version header and set it to a
value of 2 so in this case the BBB
service should return as version 2
student objects if we set it to 1 we
should get back version 1 student
objects there we go
but we have a slight problem with this
example users can specify the same
header twice in the request so here they
are specified our custom version header
twice so in this case the web api
service should read one of the header
values and then return as that specific
version of the student objects in this
case the service should return us
version 1 student objects but look at
what we got version 2 student objects
let's understand why this is happening
let's run the project in debug mode so
we can debug and see what's going on
let's set a breakpoint on this line
right here and issue the same request
from fiddler once again the breakpoint
is set at this point if you look at the
version number variable it's still
initialized to its default value of 1
let's step through the code now when
this line completes execution let's see
what the value is going to be at the
moment the value is still 1 but when
this line completes
execution look at its value it is one
comma one
why is this this is because we have
specified the version headed twice and
basically it is appending the values of
these two headers using a comma that's
the reason we have 1 comma 1 and since
the value is 1 comma 1 it is always
going to go into this else block and
return as version 2 student objects
let's look at that in action so when I
press f10 here look at that it checks a
version number equals 1 that's not true
so it's going to go to the else block
and return as version 2 objects so what
do we want to do in this case in this
case we want to check if the version
number string contains a comma if it
contains a comma then we want to take
the first number from the
comma-separated list of version numbers
so let's see how to do that now
let's first detach the debugger and then
here we are going to check if version
number contains comma if it contains
comma then what do we want to do we want
to take the first number from the
comma-separated list of version numbers
so worship number equals version number
dot we want a substring so let's use the
substring and we want a substring
starting from in x position 0 and until
we have found a comma in that string so
to find the index position of way we
have comma we're going to use the same
string again and on that let's use index
of function and we want the index of
comma so this is going to give us the
first version number within that comma
separated list of version numbers so
let's build our solution one more time
and quickly test with further when we
execute this we should get version 1
student objects if we include our custom
version header only once still we should
get version 1 student objects if we set
D version 2 - we should get version 2
student objects so it's all
looking as expected and here we have the
code to get diversion number from our
custom version header thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
