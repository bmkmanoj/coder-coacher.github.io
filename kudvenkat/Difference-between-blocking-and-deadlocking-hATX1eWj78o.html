questions and answers video series in
this video we'll discuss the difference
between blocking and dead locking this
is a common sequence of interview
question first let's understand when
blocking occurs blocking occurs if a
transaction tries to acquire an
incompatible lock on a resource that
another transaction has already locked
the block the transaction remains
blocked until the blocking transaction
releases the lock the diagram here
explains this scenario we've got two
transactions here transaction 1 and
transaction 2 both of these transactions
want to update this table table a
transaction 1 starts first so it
acquires an exclusive lock on the table
and at the same time transaction 2 also
wants to update the same table so
transaction 2 is blocked from acquiring
an exclusive lock on that table because
transaction 1 has already locked it so
transaction 2 will remain blocked until
transaction 1 completes let's look at
this in action we'll be using these two
tables table a and table B for this demo
and here is the sequel script to create
those tables and populate them with test
data
I'll have the script available on my
blog in case you need it I also have two
other instances of sequel server
management studio here on the Left we
have our first transaction and on the
right we have our second transaction
now both the transactions notice that
they want to update the same record in
the stable table a first let's execute
part of our transaction 1 now notice I
have not executed commit transaction
statement so this is an open transaction
at the same time transaction 2 also
wants to update the same record in the
same table and look at what's going to
happen when we execute this transaction
this transaction notice it still says
executing query because this is blocked
this is waiting on transaction 1 and
that's because transaction 1 has
acquired a lock on that table
so transaction 2 is blocked from
acquiring its own lock now when is
transaction 2 allowed to move forward
whenever transaction 1 completes now
look at this when I execute this commit
transaction statement look at what's
going to happen to transaction to look
at that it also says query executed
successfully
so when transaction one completed
whatever lock transaction one has
acquired on that resource it released
that lock so transaction two is allowed
to acquire its own lock and then it is
able to move forward so that's blocking
now let's look at when a deadlock occurs
deadlock occurs when two or more
transactions have a resource locked and
each transaction requires a lock on the
resource that another transaction has
already locked
neither of the transactions here can
move forward as each one is waiting for
the other to release the lock in this
case sequel server intervenes and ends
the deadlock by canceling one of the
transactions so the other transaction
can move forward the diagram here
explains the scenario we've got two
transactions transaction 1 and
transaction 2 and we got two resources
table a and table Bay now both of these
transactions want to update both the
tables so transaction one starts first
and it starts updating table a so
transaction one has already acquired an
exclusive lock on table a and at the
same time transaction two starts and it
starts updating table B first so at the
moment transaction two has acquired an
exclusive lock on table B whereas
transaction one has acquired an
exclusive lock on table a now
transaction one wants to update table B
so it tries to acquire a lock on that
but it cannot because transaction two
has already locked that table in a
similar fashion transaction true tries
to update table a by acquiring a lock on
that it cannot do it because transaction
one has already locked it so we have a
deadlock situation here because
transaction one is waiting on
transaction two to release the lock on
table B in a similar fashion transaction
two is waiting on transaction one to
release the lock on this resource table
a so neither of the transactions here
are going to give up so sequel server
intervenes and ends this deadlock by
canceling one of these transactions so
for example if the sequel server is
going to cancel this transaction that is
transaction two then whatever exclusive
lock it has acquired on this table you
know that is gone so transaction one is
allowed to acquire a lock on that
resource and it can complete
successfully whereas transaction two is
failed and it's rolled back let's look
at this in action so again here I have
two instances of sequence of management
studio and here we have our first
transaction and here our second
transaction so what I'm going to do is
execute part of this transaction so
we're starting our transaction one we
executed this first update statement
it's going to update table a okay so it
has acquired an exclusive lock on table
a now I'm going to execute part of our
transaction two transaction two is
updating table B first so now the
situation is transaction one has lock
table a transaction two has locked table
B and now transaction one wants to
update table B and look at what's going
to happen when I execute the second
update statement look at that this query
is blocked because transaction two has
already acquired a lock on table B so
transaction one cannot acquire a lock on
that same table for that same row and
now look at what's going to happen when
I execute this statement again this will
be blocked because transaction one has
already acquired a lock on this table
and look at this sequence server has
intervened and that sequel server made
this transaction too you know the
deadlock victim so it failed this
transaction and we get this 1205 error
and basically this is saying this
process was deadlocked okay and this is
deadlocked on you know these resources
table a and table B okay so in the case
of a deadlock there's no way that
transactions can move forward that's the
reason why sequel server intervenes and
ends the deadlock by canceling one of
the transactions the transaction that
sequel server has cancelled that's
called as the deadlock victim so that's
the difference between dead
locking and blocking they're not the
same and here is that second deadlock
example that we just discussed thank you
