am venket this is part 55 of asp.net
video series in this session we'll
discuss about cross page posting in
asp.net before continuing with the
session I strongly recommend to watch
parts 50 to 53 and 54 of this video
series cross page posting allows us to
post one page to another page by default
when you click a button the web forum
posts to itself if you want to post to
another web forum on a button click set
the postback URL property of the button
to the page that you want to post to
let's look at an example let's flip to
visual studio I have an asp.net web
application project here with two web
forms on webform 1 I have got two text
box controls where the user can enter
their name and email and I also have a
button control now the idea is when I
click this button control I want to post
to webform to now let me run at the
moment you know the application doesn't
have any core if you look at webform all
I have is the design of the webform on
the code-behind file I don't really have
any code but let me run this page as it
stands and once the webform loads when I
click the button control look at that
currently we are on webform one dot aspx
now when I click this button control you
know it will post back to itself to the
same waveform but what we really want to
do is when I click this button instead
of posting back to the same webform I
want to post to webform too and to do
that all you have to do is go to the
properties of the button control and the
button control has got a property called
postback URL all you have to do is set
this property to the page that you want
to post to in our case we want to post
to webform to tour aspx so click OK and
as you might expect in the source it
would have set the postback URL property
to the page that we want to navigate to
that's the only change that we have done
until now let me run the project now and
when the webform loads when I click this
button ctrl it's going to post back to
waveform 2 so currently we are on
waveform 1 dot aspx I click the button
now I am on waveform 2 dot aspx so to do
a cross page postback all you have to do
is set the postback URL property of that
button control to the page that you want
to navigate to now it's possible that on
this waveform one you can have multiple
button controls and when you click
button one maybe you want to go to
webform to when you click button two you
can go to webform through your webform
10 whatever okay now what else we want
to do when I you know I can enter name
and the email of the user here and then
when I click on cross page post back and
when I land on webform - I want to
retrieve the values that I have entered
on the previous page and then display
them in these label controls here let's
see have to do that okay so on webform -
dot aspx in the page load event I can
make use of the previous page property
of the page class so page dot previous
page so this property is going to have a
reference to the previous page in our
case webform one and you look at the
previous page property it's going to
return a page object back so I'm going
to store that in a page variable I'm
going to call that previous page okay so
if previous page is not equal to now
then I'm using a method called find
control so on the previous page find a
control so which control do we want to
find we want to find a control with ID
txt name so that's the idea of this
textbox control where the user can enter
their name so I want to find a control
with an ID txt name and look at the fine
control method return type it's
returning a control object back but we
know that we are going to get a textbox
back so we can typecast that to be of
type text box
and then retrieve the text property and
we can set this text property to the
label label name dot text okay
now you might be wondering why are we
using this null check here it's very
important we do this especially if it's
a cross page postback technique because
this is webform too dot aspx this page
can be reached in a variety of different
ways for example i can reach to it by a
cross page post back or i can directly
type the URL for webform to and i can
land on this page or i can i can land on
this page you know using server door
transfer or server dot execute so there
are variety of different ways that you
can land on this page for example if you
land on this page when the user types in
a direct URL in the browser window then
previous page property returns now when
it when it returns null your previous
page will be null if that's the case
when you say null dot fine control it's
going to throw another reference
exception so to avoid this runtime null
reference exceptions it's better to
check for nulls
okay now if we want to display the email
all you have to do is the same code
except that we change the name of the
text box to txt email and the label
control where we want to display to
label email that's it now let me run
this project and obviously as you might
expect once the webform loads once we
enter the name and email and when we
click the button you know it will cross
page post back to reform - and then on
webform - we are able to retrieve those
values now a small trick I want to do
here is now I want to display that the
name and email in the label controls
only if I land on this page using a
cross page postback technique if I land
in this page using any other technique
then I want I don't want to show
anything I don't want to execute this
piece of code at all
and I you know basically want to display
a message in the label control saying
that you have landed on this page using
a technique other than cross page post
bacc so first of all let's have a label
control on web form which can tell that
to the user so let me flip to the source
mode because that will be easy
so copy a table draw and I don't want to
TDs I just want one TD there I'm going
to set the TD call span is equal to two
and then we are going to have a label
control here so and let's call this LBL
status and let's get rid of that text
from there okay so now here I'm going to
set this okay so if previous page is not
equal to now and previous page dot there
is a property called east cross page
post back and this is a boolean property
and this property is going to return
true if we have landed you know because
of a cross page post back the previous
page is a result of cross page post back
if not this will return false so I want
to do execute this piece of code only if
it is a cross page post back otherwise
don't execute this code else what else
you want to do in the label we want to
display the message so LBL status the
text is equal to you landed on this page
using a technique
other than cross page post back so
that's the message I want to display on
this label so let's go ahead and run
this and just to simulate a non cross
page cross page post bacc technique
let's add another row here and then
let's drag and drop a button control and
when I click this button control all I
want to do is I want to do maybe a
server door transfer or response to or
redirect whatever so I'm going to say
survey door transfer and I'm going to
transfer to wave form to the aspx okay
so let's go ahead and run this as it
stands so when the page loads we can
enter the name and the email and when we
click on the cross page post back button
as you might expect this property of the
webform returns true so we get inside
the if block and display the name and
email so let's see if that's happens so
I enter the name and email cross page
post back so this is wave form - and
presume test but on the other hand okay
I have this data here I click this
button look at that you landed on this
page using a technique other than cross
page post back and to prove that you can
actually throw a breakpoint here and
then when we actually run with the
breakpoint there when we land on that
page using a cross page post bacc
technique obviously oh they are on wave
form - obviously look at this it's like
now directly hitting the URL so this we
didn't land on this page now using a
cross page post back and on top of that
since we are directly accessing this
page look at that previous page itself
will be now
so obviously this piece of code will not
be executed and when we plus a 5
look at that you landed on this page
using a technique other than cross page
post back let's go to webform 1 and
let's enter maybe name is test email
stash I click this cross page post back
as you might expect look at this
cross page post pack is true plus f5
displays that on the other hand when I
click this button cross page post back
is false so we can use page dot east
cross page post back property to draw
mine if you know we landed on this page
as a result of cross page post back or
not ok and now the problem here is we
are using you know find control method
on the previous page and if you look at
this we're using the IDS here and let's
imagine you know we have mistyped the ID
of the control here for example the text
box instead of txt name let's say by
mistake
I have spelled it as txt name and a
number 1 or something like that now when
this code when I build this application
look at that on the status bar Bill
succeeded but when I actually run this
application you know there could be a
runtime exception and null reference
exception that's because you know on
this page it's trying to find a control
with the name with ID txt name one but
we don't have a control with that ID so
obviously this entire expression is
going to return null and then you are
trying to retrieve the text property in
a null object so it's going to throw a
null reference exception we don't get
any errors at compile them they're going
to happen at runtime which are
definitely dangerous so I entered tests
and tests so when I click this cross
page post back look at that I get a null
reference exception in the next video
session we will see how to obtain a
strongly typed reference to the previous
page which can avoid these you know null
runtime null reference exceptions on
this slide you can find resources for
asp.net c-sharp and sequel server
interview questions that's it for today
