tutorial in this video we'll discuss
different properties of the web method
attribute this is continuation to part
three so please watch part 3 from the
asp.net Web Services tutorial before
proceeding with this video in the
previous session of this video series we
have discussed enable session property
in this video we'll discuss description
buffer response and cache duration
properties and in our next video we'll
discuss message name property so what's
the use of this description property we
use this property to specify a
description for the web service method
if you recollect from the previous
session we implemented two methods
within the calculator web service that
is ad and get calculations at the moment
none of these methods display any
description now let's say for example we
want to associate some description with
the side method and to achieve that all
we need to do is specify the description
property so let's set description to
something like this method adds two
numbers and let's now view this web
service in a browser so this should
bring up the service page of the web
service and notice that the description
we have specified is displayed on the
service page now let's look at buffer
response
property this is a boolean property
meaning we can either set it to true or
false
the default is true so when this
property is set to true the response of
the XML web service method is not a
return to the client underlay that the
response is completely civilized or the
buffer is full on the other hand when we
set this property to false the response
of the XML web service method is
returned to the client as it is still
being serialized in general set buffer
response to false
only when the XML web service method
returns large amounts of data so that
the client doesn't have to wait for the
entire process of serialization to
complete but for smaller amounts of data
web service performance is better when
buffer response is set to true now let's
look at cache duration use this property
if you
want to catch the results of a
webservice method in general we use
caching to improve the performance of an
application we discuss the basics of
caching in the asp.net video tutorial so
if you're new to caching please watch
caching videos from the asp.net video
series cache duration is an integer
property and specifies the number of
seconds that the response should be
cached and keep in mind that response is
cached for each unique parameter let's
understand using caching duration with
an example let's flip to visual studio
let's view the web form in the browser
now at the moment every time we click
the side button you know the web service
method will be processed and the
response will be returned from that web
service method so even if we send the
same of parameters still the web service
method will be executed and then the
response will be sent back now when we
send same parameters to the web service
method there's no point in react
securing it because we know that we're
going to get the same response so it's
better to cache the response of the web
service method to improve the
performance of the application so if we
want to catch the response of a web
service method all we need to do is use
cache duration property and this is an
integer property so if we specify cache
duration as 20 then the response of this
method will be cached for 20 seconds
so let's build our web servers
and then update the service reference so
this process should regenerate the proxy
class now when we click this Add button
first time when we sent 10 and 20 you
know obviously the web service method
will be reprocessed and then the result
of the web service method should be
cached for 20 seconds now if we leave
the parameters as same 10 and 20 and
then click the Add button once again you
know if we are within that 20 seconds
then the web service will not be
reprocessed instead the response that is
stored in the cache will be returned to
the client on the other hand if the 20
seconds have elapsed then the web method
will be reprocessed and then that
response will be cached for another 20
seconds so let's click Add if the 20
seconds might have already been elapsed
the web method is reprocessed and look
at that recent calculations is
incremented but now we know that we are
going to be within that 20 seconds if I
click that look at that within the 20
seconds I click the button you know
recent calculations are not incremented
this proves that the web method response
is cached okay so let's click this once
again 20 seconds might have elapsed
so I click it again now it doesn't
increment those recent calculations but
if we were to change the parameters
let's change 10 to 20 so we are now
adding 20 and 20 so these are different
parameters so when I click this Add
button look at that you know these are
since these are different parameters you
know a separate response will be cached
ok but then if we click again look at
that it doesn't increment those recent
calculations proving that it's actually
caching that response alright in our
next video we'll discuss message a name
a property that's it for today thank you
for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
