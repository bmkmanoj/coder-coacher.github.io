6 of the design pattern tutorial in this
session we will discuss differences
between singleton and static classes
static class example and real-world
usage examples of singleton design
pattern please refer to the previous
parts of the tutorial before proceeding
in the previous session we have
discussed the different versions of
singleton design pattern from the basing
it and pattern we have evolved to multi
third support and then we have discussed
about eager loading we have also
discussed how we can leverage on the
building lazy class of dotnet framework
for ATO which takes care of thread
safety internally along with delayed
initialization now when we talk about
differences between singleton and static
in many of the interviews we are often
questioned on the usage of singleton
design pattern with respect to the
static class and we are also questioned
on why we need to use singleton plants
instead of a static class to answer that
question let's first focus on main
features of singleton with respect to
the static classes first we need to
understand that static is a keyword and
whereas singleton is a design pattern
singleton preserves
conventional class approach and it's
important to remember that the
fundamental difference between singleton
pattern and static classes singleton
gives you an object whereas static
classes just provide static methods
singleton is an object creation pattern
with one instance of the class
singleton can implement interfaces
inherit from other classes and it aligns
with the object-oriented programming
concepts we should also understand that
singleton object can be passed as a
reference
whereas static object cannot be passed
as a reference to other methods or
objects we can create a singleton in
such a way that it can be disposed also
singleton object is stored on heap
whereas static classes are stored on
stacks and the singleton objects can be
cloned as well
now coming to static glasses they are
created in those situations where any of
the values are static to see that in
action let's switch to visual studio and
look at an example for a static class
let's bring up our previous demo
application let's create a new project
over here by doing right click and new
project and let's create another console
application let's say any name it as
static demo now let's say we have been
given a task to convert the temperature
from 4 and height to Celsius and
vice-versa
how do we approach in solving this task
we are pretty sure that the formulas for
falling height to Celsius and vice-versa
conversion will not change at all and
hence we can use static classes with
static methods that does the conversion
for us hence to achieve this we can
leverage on using a static class and
static methods let's see how we can do
that let's create a new class and name
it as converter and let's change this
class to static by using public static
class converter now let's create a
method which converts the given Celsius
to Fahrenheit public static double - on
height of double Celsius let's return
the calculated foreign height by using
the formula Celsius tar nine by Phi plus
32 let's create another static method
which converts foreign height to Celsius
double-o return form height - 32 into 5
by 9 now let's switch to the main
program and see how we can use these
methods that we have created for the
temperature conversion in order to save
some time I have already declared
Celsius and Fahrenheit as double
variables and assign some values to
check the conversion values we are
invoking the static converter methods
without instantiating the object as it's
not required in this scenario now let's
run this application look at the output
and notice that the static converter is
working as expected with this we have
proved that in the situation where we
need static computations we can achieve
them by leveraging on static classes now
with this explanation we hope now you
are familiar with the differences
between static classes and singleton
design pattern now you may have a
question in your mind that when to use
singleton to answer that after all these
differences the one major taking the
singleton is that it gives you the
little flexibility over static classes
to make the design changes and
variations as and when the situation
demands to conclude is the due diligence
of the programmers to choose when to use
static and when to use singleton as per
their application programming
requirements let's now focus on the
real-world scenarios where we use
singleton design pattern exception or
information logging connection pool
management file management device
management such as printer spooling
application configuration management
cash management and session based
shopping cart are some of the real-world
usage
of Singleton design pattern in the next
session we will implement the exception
logging using singleton design pattern
with the real-world use case sample
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
