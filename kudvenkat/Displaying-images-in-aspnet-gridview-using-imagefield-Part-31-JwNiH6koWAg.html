van gate this is part 31 of asp.net
grid-view tutorial in this video well
discuss about displaying images in an
asp.net grid view control using image
field in part 30 of the asp.net grid
view tutorial we discussed about
displaying images using template field
in this video let's get about displaying
images using image field please watch
part 30 before proceeding with this
video because this is continuation to
power 30 and if you remember we have
configured this grid view control in
such a way that you know the first four
columns employee ID name gender and city
these four columns are the bound columns
and the photo column which is displaying
the image is actually a template field
so if I flip this to the source mode
look at that you know this is the
template field which is actually
displaying that image you know this
image and then if you look at the
template field within that we have an
item template and with an item template
we have an image control and we have
said the image URL property of this
image to the photo property of the
employee object because you know from
this table the data is retrieved using
this employee data access layer the
photo pot in a column value is stored in
the photo property of the employee
object and the grid view is actually
bound to whatever is returned by this
get all employees method which is going
to actually return list of employees as
you can see in the intelligence there so
that's why we are actually binding you
know the image URL property to the photo
Pro you know to the photo property of
the employee object now instead of using
this template field to display you know
the photo of an employee with the grid
we control I actually want to use an
image field to do the same thing okay
for now let's leave the template field
there and let's have you know an image
field as well so I'm going to add an
image field just like any other field of
the grid view control the image field
can also have a header text so let's set
head a text to photo
and now I want to you know basically
bind this image field you know to the
photo property of the employee object
and to do that you know this image field
has got a property called data image URL
field okay
so now I need to set this to photo
property of the employee object that's
it so with this change if I go ahead and
run this now the you know the photo of
employee should be displayed within the
grid we control look at this the first
column is actually the first photo
column is the template field the second
photo column is our image field okay now
obviously the width and height we need
to adjust that okay so when we were
using the image we have set the height
and width of that image similarly for
the image field we don't know I mean
it's not the height and width but we
have to set something called control
style height and width properties so
control style - height I want that to be
100 pixels and similarly control style -
width and that one again 200 pixels so
with these two properties in place now
the width should be adjusted you know to
that hundred by 100 pixels so now look
at this how easy it is to display images
using an image field all you need to set
is the data image URL field property and
the width and height okay but if you
were to use a template field you have to
define an item template and then an
image control you know inside that item
template so keep in mind that image
field is designed specifically for the
purpose of displaying images and data
bound controls like grid view details
view etc so it's always better to use
image field or template field for the
purpose of displaying images within
those controls okay and please remember
that we are using the data image URL
field of the image field you know
basically to display the images to
control the width and height of the
images within the grid view control we
have used control style height and
control style
with properties and another important
property is the alternate text property
so if the image is missing for some
reason let's say I don't have you know
at the moment we have all the images
here whatever you know the path for the
part that is specified within the table
we have those respect to images here now
let me delete this John image from the
image folder okay and then let me
actually run this actually let's get rid
of this template field we don't need
that anymore so let me get rid of that
now we only have the image field so let
me run it now so at the moment I don't
have you know the image for John so when
the actual ating that's coming from they
browse the cache let's actually browse
this with another browser let me browse
the page using Internet Explorer so
browse with let me choose Internet
Explorer browse
okay look at that since I don't have an
image of John within that folder
you know it's displaying you know with
that Red Cross instead of that I want an
alternate text to be displayed if if
that's the case we can use alternate
text property so all I need to set here
is on the image field you can also have
something called alternate text and I am
putting a message like image or photo
not phone okay so now if we run this for
any employee who doesn't have a photo
you know that's what is the message you
see again this is Google Chrome so
Google Chrome doesn't work correctly but
whereas when I browse that within
Internet Explorer let's browse this
Internet Explorer and then it should
actually show us you know the alternate
text their photo not found now if I
actually right-click on the page and
then view the page source look at that
that alternate text is actually rendered
as an alt tag for that image you know
for the image HTML image tag the
alternate text property
actually rendered as an alternate
attribute okay now for Google Chrome to
work you know this actually has to be
rendered as name attribute okay so
Google Chrome it's a known issue with
Google Chrome whatever is specified for
an alternate attribute in the image you
know it doesn't display that properly
but it does work with Internet Explorer
as expected all right
now if you want to have different
alternate text for each image displayed
now look at this I don't have you know
John image that's why I went John image
is rendered you know it says photo not
fun now instead of that you know I want
to have something like you know for each
employee if Mark photo is not the mock
photo not found'
you know John photo not for Mary photo
not phone I want a customized alternate
text for each employee is that possible
absolutely if you have to do that then
there is a property called data
alternate text field okay you can bind
that field to a property of your
employee object obviously that has to be
there in the database table and you will
have to populate your employee object
with that property and then use that
with the grid view control let's see how
to actually achieve this and what I have
basically done here is you know at the
moment if you look at this employee
table it doesn't have an alternate text
column let's go ahead and add an
additional column so I'm going to answer
this table add that column so by now we
should have that alternate text column
but it doesn't have any data there so
let's update the table with that data so
now if you look at this you know for
mark if the photo is missing then we
have this alternate text mark photo is
not found
similarly for John Mary and Mike okay
now what I basically want to do is I
want to bind to this you know a column
okay if the photo is not found we want
to display the respective message within
the grid view control okay so to do that
all you need to do is you have to
specify alternate data alternate text
field okay so let's go ahead and specify
that so data alternate text field and I
want to set that to this column
alternate text column
so let's actually specify that to
alternate text okay so now obviously if
we run at this time we are going to get
an error actually yeah let's run that
okay again it's being rendered using
Google Chrome but we'll change that in a
bit
look at this we get this lamp i mirror
and that makes sense because a field of
property with named alternate text was
not found in the selected data source
now the column is present within the
table but then we are not retrieving
data directly from the table instead we
have employee data access layer which is
serving the data to our grid view
control so obviously we need to add a
property here so I'm going to call this
property as public stranger alternate
text you can give it any meaningful name
that you want I just happen to choose
alternate text as the property name and
obviously we need to populate that field
I mean that property of the employee
object so employee dot alternate text is
equal though we want to retrieve that
from the you know column database column
alternate text and and we are populating
whatever value that we get back we are
populating that with this property of
the employee object and the employee
object get returned so now actually
let's browse this with Internet Explorer
let's actually set that as the default
and then browse ok so we have here look
at this John photo not fun let's
actually delete let's close the other
browsers let's actually delete you know
Mary photo as well and now let's refresh
this browser window
okay I think that's coming from the
browser cache let's read on the
application so now look at this for John
it says John photo is not found Mary
Mary photo is not found okay so we get
customized alternate text for each
employee and to do that obviously we
have used you know data alternate text
property so if the image path is null
and if you want to have a different
image then use null image URL property
you know it can happen that you know
this photo path is null for some reason
and if that's the case and if you want
to display a different image if the
photo path is now it's also possible all
you need to set is you know set null
image URL property and if you want to
display some text when that URL is not
aligned then use null let display text
property let's actually look at that in
action it's it's easy to achieve so let
me go ahead and set you know the photo
part property is equal to null where
employee ID is equal to one so at the
moment if you look at this employee ID
one he doesn't have a photo path defined
at all okay so it's null if that's the
case then if you want to show a display
you know different image altogether then
you can use this null image URL property
so I'm going to set this now image URL
property to any of the image now I have
another image here null alternate image
let's copy that and let's put that
within the images folder
okay basically I want to display this
image when the photo part is now so I'm
going to set that so with an images
folder
for slash and the photo name is null
alternating h dot PNG alright so now
let's go ahead and run that
so for employee ID one there is no image
defined I mean the path is now so look
at that
I get null alternate image and instead
of that if you instead of the image if
you want text to be displayed then you
can specify you know null display text
property so instead of null image well
I'm going to use null display text is
equal to you know no or you can say
image path is now so there's lot of
customization that's available if we use
this image field
basically instead of template field so
image path is now right so it's always
better to use image field if you want to
display images within the grid we
control over template fear on this slide
