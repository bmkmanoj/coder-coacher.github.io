this video we'll discuss loading element
duration property of Ajax options class
this is continuation to part 95 so
please watch part 95 before proceeding
loading element duration property is
used to control the animation duration
of loading element at the moment notice
that when I click this all the link this
loading element immediately appears and
then as the data becomes available look
at that it immediately disappears
instead of that we want that loading
element to slowly fade in and fade out
to achieve that we can use loading
element duration property so let's
specify loading element duration
property and we want that you know to
fade in and fade out in a duration of
one second the time has to be in
milliseconds so one second is 1000
milliseconds let's just specify it for
the all link for now so let me go ahead
and run this now and when we click this
all look at that it slowly fades in and
as the data becomes available it slowly
fades out okay now that's fine but then
you know let's increase the time to two
seconds or let's increase it to three
seconds now let's run this and look at
that it fades in and fades out at the
same speed no matter what is the
duration that you set here and that
turns out to be a bug and I have found
the solution for the bug at this Stack
Overflow link all we need to do is
convert the value that is returned by
this attribute to an integer
look at that then we said loading
element duration property then you know
the rendered HTML so if I right click on
that and view page source notice that an
attribute is auto-generated for us data
- Ajax - loading - duration equals 3,000
milliseconds so jQuery has to read that
value from the satrapy
and then after it has read it it needs
to be converted into integer okay so
within our under truth you Ajax
javascript file we need to find you know
this attribute and convert that to India
so here it is so let's convert that to
integer and to do that we can use parse
int function that's it let's save the
changes and then within our index view
let's reference that script file so at
the moment we are using minified script
file let's get rid of that and use this
one alright so with these changes let's
run this now and let's click on this all
link look at that it slowly fades in
okay within a span of three seconds and
when we click OK it slowly fades out
alright that's it for today thank you
for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
