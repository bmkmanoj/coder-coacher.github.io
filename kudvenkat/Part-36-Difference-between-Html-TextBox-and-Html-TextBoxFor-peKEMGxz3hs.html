this video we'll discuss the differences
between text box in text box 4 and drop
down list and drop down list for HTML
helpers please watch by 35 before
proceeding let's understand the
differences with an example let's first
design a view with a text box and it
drop-down list controls in the text box
control we want to display a company
name and within the drop-down list we
want to display the list of departments
that are available within that company
so obviously the first step here is to
add a company class so let's flip to
visual studio let's add a class file to
our models folder and let's call it
company dot CS and to speed things up I
have this company class code already
implemented so let me paste that right
here and if you look at this code that's
very straightforward so I have a private
field here to store the name of the
company because we want the name to be
displayed within the textbox control and
then I have a constructor here to
initialize this private sphere and then
I have departments public property which
is going to return the list of
departments that are available in this
table TBL department to retrieve the
departments from this database table
there using the sample dbcontext class
and if you remember the sample DB
context class is coming from the sample
data model and this is nothing but the
ATO dotnet entity data model we have
discussed building the CDO dotnet entity
data model in the previous sessions of
this video series so this class is going
to connect to the database and then
using this departments property it is
going to retrieve and return the list of
departments so this property is used to
return the departments and then I have
another public property here company
name which is going to return the name
of the company that is stored in this
private field so a very simple and
straightforward company class with one
private field one constructor and two
public properties that is departments
and company name all right now let's go
ahead and implement the index action
within home controller to speed things
up I have the you know controller action
that code implemented as well so let me
copy and paste that and before I do that
now within this home controller we want
to use this company class and if you
look at this company class this is
residing in this MVC demo dot models
namespace so within home controller
let's go ahead and include that
namespace all right now let's go ahead
and paste the index action method code
and look at this code again this is very
straightforward all we are doing here is
creating an instance of this company
class and if you remember this company
class constructor is expecting a
parameter to be passed in that is the
name of the company so here we are
passing presume at the name of the
company and then notice what we are
doing here we are retrieving the
departments and passing them to the
constructor of the Select list class
basically within the drop-down list we
want to display the list of departments
so we are passing the list of
departments to the Select list to
prepare a select list for the drop-down
list and obviously if you look at the
department class it has got three
properties ID name and is selected out
of these three properties which property
is going to be a data value field and
which property is going to be data text
field we want ID as the data value field
and name as the data text field and
that's what we are specifying right here
so that is the data value field and this
is going to be data text for you and
then we are storing the Select list for
the drop-down list within view bag using
this departments dynamic expression and
similarly we are storing the company
name within company name dynamic
expression again in the view bag and
then we are returning a view so now the
next step is to actually add a view so
I'm going to right click on this index
action method add view the name of the
view is going to be index we are going
to make use of razor view engine but
then we are not going to create a
strongly typed view I'm going to leave
this unchecked and then click Add this
should add an index view now let me copy
the index view code right here again
it's just two lines of code
to save time and typing I have this
already typed so let me copy and paste
that so if you look at here we are using
text box and drop-down list not text box
4 and drop down list 4 and then look at
this here the first parameter is that is
the name for the text box and I'm hard
coding that I'm hard coding the name of
the text box as company name and then
within this text box control we want to
display the company name so I am
retrieving the company name from the
dynamic expression company name from the
view bag type casting it to be of type
strain okay so this should render a text
box and display company name presume
within that okay and then here we are
using drop-down list HTML helper and
notice that here again the property
which contains the dynamic expression
which contains our list of departments
is hard-coded I mean is within that
double quotes that it's hard coded there
and then within the drop-down list we
want select Department as the first
option this is passed as the second
parameter to this drop-down list HTML
helper with these changes let's actually
go ahead and run this and when the
waveform renders as you might expect we
should have a text box control and the
drop-down list control with the list of
departments so there we go then let me
right click on that and view page source
and notice the HTML here especially pay
attention to ID and the name attributes
of this text box control and again ID
and name attributes of the drop-down
list control okay
now let me add another index action
method but this time the name is going
to be index 1 and again I have this code
already typed so let me copy that and
paste within our home controller and
notice this code again this is two lines
and very straightforward the name of the
action method here is index one we are
creating an instance of the company
again we are specifying the name of the
company as pledging and then we are
passing that company object to the view
notice that here we are not passing any
model object to the view but here we are
passing this company object to the view
and now I am going to right click on
this index action add a view the name of
the view is going to be index one we are
going to use rays of view engine and I'm
going to create a strongly typed view
against our company class and the
scaffold template is going to be empty
because we are going to write the HTML
that's required so let me click on add
that should add index one view and
notice here at the model is a museum
demo dot model stood company so this
view is strongly typed against the
company class whereas this index dot CS
HTML this doesn't have that model okay
so this is not a strongly typed view
whereas index 1 dot CS HTML is a
strongly typed view and then to render
the text box and drop-down list control
since this is strongly typed view I can
use the strongly typed versions of the
HTML helpers which are nothing but text
box for and drop-down lists for HTML
helpers let me again copy this code and
paste it within index 1 dot CS HTML view
so if you look at this code look at this
instead of text box I am using text box
for HTML helper and then notice that
what is the model for our view its
company so M such that since model is
the company object because that I am
able to retrieve the company name
property it's not hard-coded here ok so
now look at this I am NOT specifying the
name for the text box I am just passing
a lambda expression here within this
text box control I want to display
the company name okay and I am
specifying that using this lambda
expression and look at this drop down
list here again I want this drop down
list to include the list of departments
so I'm using that lambda expression if
you remember company object has got
departments property which is going to
return the list of departments and using
that list you know generate a select
list item for the drop down list
okay and that's what we are doing here
so we are part we are creating an
instance of new select list class and we
are saying okay this property is going
to contain the list of departments out
of which I want ID to be the value field
and name to be the text field and then
we want select department as the first
option within the drop down list okay so
with these changes let me advances let's
actually navigate to index one view so
we are on index one view and notice that
we have a textbox control and the
drop-down list control let me right
click on that and view page source and
then again look at the ID and name for
the textbox control and ID and name of
the drop-down list control this HTML is
exactly the same as this HTML so this is
the HTML for index view and this is the
HTML for index 1 view so the end result
is the same but then you know in index 1
we are using these strongly type HTML
helpers we are in index view we are
using their counterparts which are not
strongly typed now let's understand the
differences let's flip to the
presentation so HTML text box and HTML
drop-down lists are not strongly typed
hence they do not require it strongly
typed view we have seen that practically
this means that we can hard code
whatever name we want on the other hand
HTML dot text box for an HTML drop-down
list for or strongly type and they
require a strongly typed view and the
name of the controls is inferred
the lambda expression and strongly typed
HTML helpers provide compile time
checking let's understand what we mean
by this now here we have this company
class which is going to act as our model
for the views okay
now look at this if you look at the way
we have implemented this index dot CS
HTML notice that here you know this
property is hard-coded departments now
if I go ahead and change now basically
the name of the property within this
model class here so let's say
departments one for example I have
changed the name of the property now if
you look at index dot CS HTML I don't
have any errors here within this view
but then if I look at index 1 dot CS
HTML look at that or you know the view
has already flapped them as headers
because the model property has changed
so you know that's reflected within the
strongly typed view so that's the
advantage you know the greatest
advantage of using these strongly typed
HTML helpers they provide compile time
error checking since in real time we
mostly use strongly typed views you know
prefer to use you know HTML dot text box
for and HTML drop-down list for over
their counterparts whether we use HTML
or text box you know or their
counterparts that is HTML dot text box
for the end result is the same that is
the same HTML is generated and we have
seen that practically as well and
strongly typed HTML helpers are added an
MVC too they are not available in MVC
one so these are basically the
differences between you know the
strongly typed versions and their
counterparts on this slide you can find

sequences of interview questions that's
it for today thank you for listening
