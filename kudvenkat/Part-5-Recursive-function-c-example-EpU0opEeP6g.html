questions tutorial in this video we'll
discuss what a recursive function is
with an example
so what is a recursive function it
occurs your function is a function that
calls itself it's normal for a function
to call another function but if the
function calls itself then that function
is called recursive function let's look
at an example let's compute the
factorial of a number with and without
recursion first let's look at computing
without recursion let's flip to visual
studio so here I have a console
application first let's write a method
that's going to compute the factorial
for us factorial can be quite a big
number so let's make the return type
double and let's call the method
factorial now we need to provide this
method in number for which we want the
factorial to be computed so we are going
to pass that as a parameter
if the provided number is 0 we want to
return 1 because 0 factorial is 1 on the
other hand if it's not 0 then we need to
compute the factorial and for that
purpose we're going to make use of a for
loop so for int I equals number so
whatever number the user has provided we
are going to start at that number and
while I is greater than or equal to 1 I
minus minus now to store the factorial
we need a variable so let's go ahead and
create a variable of type double and
let's call it factorial and let's
initialize that to 1 and factorial
equals factorial in to whatever value we
have in this variable I and finally
let's return the factorial ok
so very straightforward method now
within our main method
let's prom the user to enter a number so
console dot write line please
enter n number so this is going to
prompt the user to enter a number at
which point we need to read it from the
console and to read it from the console
we're going to make use of read line
method but this method is going to
return that number in a string format so
we need to convert that to integer so
let's use convert class for that purpose
convert dot 2 and 32 okay
now let's go ahead and invoke this
factorial method now look at this this
factorial method at the moment is an
instance method which means we need to
create an instance of this class in
order to invoke this method instead of
that let's make this method static so
that we can invoke that without having
the need to create an instance of this
class so let's invoke the method and
pass the number that the user has
entered to this function and let's store
it in a variable of type double and
let's call it factorial and let's
finally print the factorial value on the
screen so console dot write line
factorial of whatever number the user
has entered and how do we get that
number that's going to be in this
variable so let's copy that then with
that to string so factorial of 3 or 4 or
5 whatever number the user has entered
that is equal to and whatever is the
result and where is that it'll present
in this variable so let's go and convert
that to string all right so let's go
ahead and run this and see if it works
so factorial please enter in number 5 5
factorial is 120 so we get the output as
expected so here we are computing the
factorial of a number without recursion
we are using a for loop you know for
computing the factorial now let us see
how to convert this from turn into a
recursive function so now when I ask you
to compute the factorial of F 4 of 4
it's 4 into 3 into 2 into 1
okay or we can also say 4 factorial is 4
into 4 minus 1 and that multiplied by 4
minus 2 and 4 minus 3 which again should
give the same output okay so we're going
to compute the factorial like this which
means we are going to call you know this
function is going to call itself so
first of all I'm going to get rid of all
these lines of code here so return what
if we want to return we want to return
the number itself that multiplied by the
output of whatever this function is
going to give and then here we are going
to subtract 1 from the number so if B
parts for first time so it's going to
come and check is 4 equal to 0 no so
it's going to come here so for x and
this function is being called again but
look at this we are subtracting 4 in a 1
from 4 meaning now we are passing a
different value for this parameter so 4
into 3 and then it's going to call
itself again so 4 into 3 into 2 and then
it's going to call itself again but the
moment it comes here and checks ok if
the number is 0 then it's going to break
that recursion and the control will be
handed over back to whoever has called
this function so very simple and
straightforward
recursion example and let's run this and
see if it works as expected
so please enter a number number 5
factorial of 5 is 120 so it's working in
exactly the same way but this is now a
recursive function a function that calls
itself in our next video we'll discuss a
real time scenario where recursion can
be used that's it for today thank you
for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
