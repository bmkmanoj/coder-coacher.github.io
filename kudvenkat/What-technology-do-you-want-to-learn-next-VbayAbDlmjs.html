venket if you have been my youtube
channel folia
then you may know that we have already
completed dotnet basics c-sharp ad or
net asp.net and gridview concepts but
there is a lot more to do I've been
getting a lot of requests from my
YouTube subscribers to record videos on
these concepts remoting web services and
WCF WPF MVC jQuery AJAX entity framework
unit testing and mocking design patterns
link Enterprise library sequel server
integration services analysis services
and reporting services obviously I want
to start with one of these technologies
first which could benefit most of you
but I'm confused at the moment on which
one to pick I need your help in deciding
which one to pick based on your feedback
please select up to three technologies
in your order of preference by leaving a
comment for example let's say you want
MVC Ajax and link in that order then
type them in that order and then leave
your comment but please make sure to
leave only one comment but my name is
basically to complete all of these as
soon as I can so that you will have
everything at one place to refer to I
hope you will leave a comment to let me
know about what you want me to start
recording next that's it thank you for
listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
