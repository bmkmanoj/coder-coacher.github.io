am Frank at this is part 76 of asp.net
video series in part 73 of this video
series we have discussed about logging
exceptions to the Windows Event Viewer
and in part 75 logging exceptions to a
database table in this session we'll
discuss about customizing asp.net
exception logging meaning the user
should be able to change a setting
within web config file and depending on
that setting the exception should either
be logged to the Windows Event Viewer or
to a database table or to even both
let's see how to do that with an example
in fact we'll be using the same example
that we use to discuss exception
handling within the previous sessions of
this video series so I have this
waveform one dot aspx on this I have a
grid view control and on the page load
this we are trying to read the XML data
from countries wrote XML file but we
don't have continues to at XML file so
obviously when this page loads up we get
a file not found exception and since we
are not handling that exception at the
page level it gets propagated till the
application level and at the application
level in global dot a si X file we have
application underscore error event
handler and here we are retrieving the
exception and then if the exception is
not null meaning if the exception has
occurred we are logging that exception
using this logger class again this
logger class is the same class that we
have been using in the previous sessions
of this video series and this logger
class is present in this logo dot CS
file and if you look at that file it has
got logger class and a log method that's
a static method and this method takes
this exception object as an input
parameter and and then the log method is
actually retrieving the exception type
exception message and a stack trace and
it does it for all the inner exceptions
as well and then finally what we are
doing here we are logging you know that
exception to a database table that's
what we have discussed in the previous
session ok now what we are going to do
here is we're going to refactor this
code a little okay so I'm going to take
this bit of code this a do dotnet code
which
actually takes the exception message
look at that it's taking whatever
exception message that we have in this
SB exception message stringbuilder
object and passing that you know to this
ad or dotnet code which locks that
message to a database table so I'm going
to take this a do dotnet code and then
put it inside its own method I'm going
to create a private method for that so
private and it's going to be a static
method it's not going to return anything
so private void and I'm going to call
this log to the bay and let's make it
static method and then I'm I'm placing
that a do dotnet code within this method
and if you look at this this method I
mean this piece of code requires a
string to be passed in which will then
be logged to a database table so I'm
going to pass that n as a parameter so
string log and then we will use that as
the parameter a sequel parameter okay
cool so we have that this method is
going to log you know the exception to a
database so we will call that method
within you know log method and I made
this private this method private because
I'm going to use this method only within
the logger class I'm not going to make
it available outside of the loader class
now this logger class log to DB method
expects a log to be passed in and what
is that log that is nothing but this
string builder object so we are going to
pass that to this method and convert
that to string okay now the next thing
that we want to do is we want to also
lock the event viewer so to do that in
path 73 we have seen how to log
exceptions to the Windows Event Viewer
so I'm going to take code you know the
same code that we used in that part and
I'm going to put that in its own method
okay so let's copy the name here and
it's going to be another private method
and this time I'm going to call this log
- Event Viewer ok and let's take that
code which logs the string to the Event
Viewer the exception to the Event Viewer
so basically this is again the same code
that we have used in the previous
session it checks if the events or
success if it exists then it creates an
instance of the event log and then
finally writes the message to the event
log okay so we have that log which is
coming in as a parameter so now if you
want to log to the Event Viewer I can
simply say log to event viewer and it
expects they log to be passed in a
string which we have in sp the
stringbuilder object so we are passing
that in to this method now if you look
at this as it stands you know it's the
same log method but then we just added
these two private methods one method
locks the exception to the event viewer
the other method locks the exception to
the database and we are calling those
methods within this log method okay so
obviously now when we run this we get an
exception first let's open up the Event
Viewer and then let's go to the database
table if you look at the database table
TBL log it doesn't have any exception
messages there and if I come to the
Windows Event Viewer and we go into
application and service logs and if you
go to Prem tag there are some previous
exceptions so let's go ahead and clear
them so click clear log clear so we
don't have any exceptions here now let's
run this application as it stands so now
when I run this so we are handling the
unhandled exception within global dot
ASX file an application underscore error
that's going to handle that log it to
both the database table and the Windows
Event Viewer and redirects the user to
errors dot aspx page that's what is
happening here and we are using server
door transfers so the URL doesn't get
updated so we are redirected to serve a
door transfer now let's go in and check
the Event Viewer first so let me click
refresh and look at that okay I have the
exception there let's go and check the
database table
I have the exception here as well but
then we want this to be customizable or
configurable now we are logging the
exceptions both to the Windows Event
Viewer and to a database table but then
I want this to be configurable within
the application meaning within web
config file there should be some setting
which the user changes and depending on
that setting we want to either log it to
Windows Event Viewer or to a database
table or to even both and how do we do
that simply go to web config file and
within web config file I'm going to add
another section here and I'm going to
call that as app setting setting section
application settings basically and then
here I can have set of keys so I'm going
to add a key I'm going to specify the
value for that key as maybe log provider
so what's the log provider is it Event
Viewer
or is it the database table okay and
then that's the key and the value is
going to be either database so if I say
database here within web config file
then the exception should be only log to
database but on the other hand if I say
Event Viewer it should be logged only to
even fewer if I say both only then the
exception should be logged to both okay
so this value should be either database
even fewer or both and depending on that
setting the logger should log either to
a database table to the Event Viewer or
both okay and to do that it's a very
simple code all you have to do is within
this logger class okay within the log
method we read that you know key value
from web config file so the important
thing is how do we read that from web
config file to read anything from web
config file we can make use of
configuration manager class okay so
let's go to the logger class so here I'm
going to get that string maybe let's
call it log provider and how do I read
the value of that key I'm going to use
configuration manager class dot now app
settings you have a property called app
settings and then what is the name of
your key here the name of your key is
log provider so I'm going to take that
and then pass that to this
appsettings that's it that's going to
return the value of that key log
provider and what we tell here if log
provider I'm converting it to lower so
that if if we have a mixed case between
web config file you know we can match it
correctly so two lawyer is equal to if
it's a database then what do we want to
do we want to log only to database so
I'm going to copy that and put it there
so only log to DB and then on the other
hand else if it's going to be even fewer
if it's going to be even truer then we
want to log only to even truer and we
have a method which can do that so I'm
going to put that method there and
finally if it's both then I want to log
both to the database and to the event
viewer so I'm going to put log 2 DB and
log the interviewer that's it that's the
simple customization so now it's
configurable and if you look at what we
have in web config at the moment we have
database so it's going to log only to
the database but not to the imageview
so we have one entry within the database
and within Avent viewer I have one entry
but since we have configured it now to
log it only to database when we run this
code when we run this application it
should only log to database and not to
the event viewer and let's see if if
that's what it does so when it loads up
you know let's execute that so I have
the exception returned but then if we go
to the event viewer i refresh this look
at that I don't have it there on the
other hand if I change the web config
settings maybe to even truer
and you run this at this time it should
only lock the exception to even truer
and not to the database so it's logged
in the Event Viewer and in the database
it should only be two and not three but
on the other hand if you set it to both
it will get locked both to the Event
Viewer and to the database table on this
