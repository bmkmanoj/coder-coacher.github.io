tutorial in this video well disk is
binding XML file to a speed art and
chart control we want to bind the
student XML data to the chart control
let's look at the steps involved let's
flip to visual studio here I have an
empty a speed or net web application
project let's drag and drop the chart
control onto this waveform to this
project let's also add an XML file and
let's name this XML file students dot
XML I already have the student XML
within the notepad so let's copy and
paste this within this XML file notice
that every student has got IDs to the
name and total marks we want to displace
to the name on the x-axis and total
marks on y-axis so let's get to the
code-behind file now we are going to
make use of the data set object to bind
the student dot XML document to the
chart control data set object is present
in system dot data namespace so let's
first bring in that namespace and then
within the page load event I am going to
create an instance of the data set class
let's call it D s and this data set
object has got read XML method now this
if we provide the path of the XML file
this method is going to read that XML
data into the data set so to specify the
path of the XML file I am going to use
server dot map path function and notice
this XML file is present within the root
directory of the web application project
to specify the root directory we use the
tilde character for slash and the name
of the XML file is students dot XML so
with this line we should have the entire
XML data within the data set now all
that is left is to set that data set as
the data source for the chart control
and then finally call data bind method
we also need to do one more thing we
need to specify what we want to display
on the x-axis and what we want to
display on the y-axis on the x-axis we
want to display student name and on
y-axis we want to display total marks so
chart 1 dot series of so if you look at
the chart control
notice that we have got one series and
the name of the series is series 1 so
for that series we have to specify what
is the x value member and what is the Y
value member so x value member is going
to be student name
along the same lines let's also specify
y-value member
y-value member is going to be total
marks let's go ahead and run this
project and the XML data should now be
displayed within the chart control thank
you for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
