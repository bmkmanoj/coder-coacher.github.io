in this video we'll discuss how to
filter array elements in JavaScript to
filter array elements we use the filter
method the filter method creates a new
array and populates that array with all
the elements that meet the conditions
specified in a callback function first
let's look at the syntax of the filter
method filter method is an instance
method so we invoke it on the array
object which contains the elements that
we want to filter this method has got
two parameters callback function and
this argument callback function is a
required parameter this callback
function gets called for each element of
the array if the function returns true
then that element is kept otherwise it's
filtered out the second parameter that
is this argument is an optional
parameter within this callback function
we can use this keyword the object that
this keyword references can be specified
using the second parameter this argument
if this is too confusing at the moment
don't worry we'll look at an example of
that in a later video session the filter
method gets called one time for each
element in the array if the callback
function returns false for all the
elements of the array the length of the
new array that will be returned is 0 now
let's look at the syntax of the callback
function the callback function has got
three parameters value in the X and
array the value parameter specifies the
value of the element in the array the
index parameter specifies the index
position of the element in the array the
array parameter specifies the source
array object that contains the elements
that we want to filter now let's look at
an example so we are going to have an
array let's name it my array and this
array is going to contain numbers from 1
to 10 so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 now
what we want to do is filter out all the
odd numbers and retrieve only the even
numbers and we want to achieve that
using the filter method now if we
have to use the filter method first we
have to specify the callback function
and if you look at the callback function
it has got three parameters value index
and array so first let's go ahead and
create our callback function function
and let's name our callback function is
even so this function is going to
contain three parameters value index and
array now remember this function gets
called for each element within dra if
value mod 2 equals 0 so when a number is
divided by 2 and if the reminder is 0
then we know that it's an even number
and in that case this function is going
to return true else it returns false
now this callback function needs to be
passed as an argument to the filter
method remember filter method is an
instance method so we are going to
invoke that method on this my array
instance so my array dot filter and to
this method we are going to pass our
callback function that is easy even now
what is this filter method going to do
it's going to call this callback
function once for every element within
this my array and remember this filter
method will actually create a new array
and then whatever elements within this
my array satisfies the condition given
in this callback function will be
included in that new array and that
array will be returned so this method
gets called for every element within
that edge so it gets called first for
element 1 and that gets passed to this
value Creator
when 1/2 the reminder is not 0 so in
that case it is going to return false
when it returns false element 1 is not
included in the new array that will be
returned by the filter method now when
it comes to to to modulus to reminder is
0 so it returns true so number 2 will be
included in the result
that that will be returned by the filter
method so it does this for all of the
elements within the array so for all
even numbers this function returns true
and for all odd numbers this function
returns false so within the result set
that will be returned by this filter
method will include only the even
numbers so let's store the returned
array in another variable let's name it
result and finally what we want to do is
print the elements that is present
within the result array to the document
object so when we run this as you might
expect we should get all the even
numbers that is 2 4 6 8 and 10 now if
you look at the logic within this
callback function in our notice that
when we divide a number by 2 and if the
remainder is 0 we are returning true
otherwise false if we look at this
expression this expression itself will
return either true or false so instead
of all these lines of code I can simply
say return value mod 2w equals 0 so this
expression itself is either going to
return true or false so now when we run
this we should still get the same result
that is all the even numbers there we go
now if you look at the example here what
we are doing first here is creating our
callback function first and then passing
the name of the callback function as an
argument to the filter method now
instead of this what we can do is
specify this callback function as an
anonymous function directly within the
filter method anonymous function is a
function that does not contain any name
so when we remove the name from here
this is an anonymous function because
this function has no name now so now I'm
going to pass this entire code as an
argument to the filter method let's
format this a bit
so now when behind this we should get
all the even numbers that is 2 4 6 8 and
10 let's look at an except another
example this is a very common interview
question how do you remove duplicate
elements from the JavaScript array so
let's look at an example of that now now
our array is going to contain some
strings Sam mark Tim and Sam again so
Sam is repeated twice within the site
but what we want to do is filter out the
duplicates so we want to get only the
unique elements so let's see how to
achieve this using the filter method so
the callback function will have those
three parameters value index and array
so here what we are going to do is use
this array parameter so what is this
array parameter referencing it is pair
referencing this source array that
contains the elements that we want to
filter so I'm going to use that
parameter here written array dot there's
a method called index off so what is
this method going to do it's going to
return us the index of a given element
so to this method we can pass an element
and this method is going to give us the
index of that element within that array
now remember this method gets called
each time you know for every element
within this array so we want the index
of given value and I'm going to compare
that with the index that is referenced
by this index parameter
now if the index is same then include
that within the result set otherwise
filter that out now let's see what's
going to happen you know when we call
this for element Sam
so this method gets called once for
every element so when it gets called for
Sam Sam is passed into this value
parameter so index of Sam within that
array this method is going to return the
index of that element index of Sam
within this array is zero so this code
is going to return zero and this
parameter will return the index of that
element which is zero again so is zero
equal to zero yes that returns true so
Sam element will be included in the
result set that will be returned by the
filter method now when it comes to mark
so index off method is going to return
the index of element mark in this case
it will return one and this index will
contain one is one equal to one again
true so the array that will be returned
will contain mark as well same will be
true for team now when it comes to Sam
so Sam element is actually present in
two places that is at index position
zero and at index position three zero
one two three so index position zero and
index position three Sam element is
present now this index of method is
going to return us the index of the
first occurrence of that element Sam so
in this case this index of method is
going to return zero okay whereas the
this parameter index will return the
actual index of that element in this
case it's going to return three is zero
equal to three no it will return false
for this element so it will be filtered
out and the array that will be returned
by the filter method will only contain
these first three elements Sam mark and
team the unique elements so let's run
this and see if we get the output that
we expect
notice that we only get the unique
elements now let's include Sam one more
time here
and see if we still get the same output
now Sam is present three times within
this array when we run this we should
get Sam only once notice that we still
get Sam only once
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
