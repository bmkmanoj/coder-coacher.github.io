this video we'll discuss take free map
method what's the use of this jQuery map
method just like jQuery each method map
method is also used to iterate over
matched elements in general if you want
to create an array or concatenated
string based on all matched elements in
a jQuery selector it's better to use map
over each method let's look at a few
examples and that should make it clear
look at the HTML here we've got an
unordered list with a few list items now
what we want to do is create an array of
all these list item text values so
basically we want to create a string
array which is going to contain these
country names we can achieve this either
by using each or map methods first let's
see how to achieve this using each
method let's flip tuitions to do so here
we have the same unordered list and with
now a jQuery ready function the first
thing that we want to do is create a
variable let's name it result and this
is going to be an array and now we want
to retrieve all these list items so I'm
going to use this jQuery selector dollar
Ally so this is going to give us all the
list items and on that we are going to
call each function which is going to
iterate over each list item and let's
specify our callback function and this
callback function is going to have two
parameters the index of the element that
we are currently iterating over and the
element itself now we want to retrieve
the element text so let's wrap this
element using the jQuery wrapper so
dollar element and then we can call the
text function to retrieve the list item
text now we want to push this text into
this array so result is the array and
then on that we can call the push method
and then push the text value of the list
item into that array and then finally
let's alert whatever we have got within
that result variable so let's save the
changes and when we reload look at that
we get the area of all the country names
okay so here we're using each method now
let's see how to rewrite this using map
method so here we have got at least
three lines of code but with map method
you know the amount of code that we are
going to write will be read used so
first of all we don't require this
separate variable so I'm going to remove
that and instead of each we are going to
use map and if you look at this map
function look at the syntax you know
this also expects a callback function
just like each method and here is our
callback function and it's going to have
the same set of two parameters index and
element and we don't have the result
variable anymore so let's get rid of
that so dollar element dot text this is
going to give us the text of the list
item and what we are going to do here is
simply return that text item okay and
then to convert this into an array we
are going to use get method here at the
end so we are going to change the get
method which is going to convert this
into a JavaScript array so it's going to
iterate over each list item retrieve the
element text and then all the list item
texts are now returned as a JavaScript
array and then since this entire code
piece is going to return an array we can
wrap that around alert function like
that and we can get rid of this alert
here so now let's save the changes and
when we reload we should get the same
output okay see how simple it is to
create an array using map method now
let's look at an example of creating a
pipe delimited string of all these list
item text values so the output should be
like this look at each country name is
separated by a pipe symbol let's see how
to achieve this using each method first
and then we'll rewrite it to use map
method okay so we need a variable to
hold our string so let's create the
result variable initialize that to an
empty string and then we are going to
use each method first so instead of map
I am going to
use each method and this going to
iterate over each list item and then
what we want to do is use this result
variable so result plus equals the
element text and to that we want to
append the pipe symbol and let's get rid
of the sket method at the end
so now result variable will contain you
know each list item text value that is
the country name and a pipe symbol okay
and if you alert I mean when we allowed
this the string that we are going to get
back will contain an extra pipe symbol
at the end let's actually look at that
so we get all the country names
delimited by pipe symbol but there is an
extra pipe symbol at the end so we need
to remove that as well so to remove that
I'm going to use a javascript substring
function so we have this result variable
so result equals result dot substring
and we have to specify the start
character so we want to start at 0 and
we want a substring untill result dot
length minus 1 we don't want the last
pipe symbol that's why we are
subtracting 1 from the length so now
when we allow this we should get a
string a pipe delimited string without
that extra pipe symbol at the end so
this is the amount of code required to
create a pipe delimited string now let's
see how to rewrite this using map method
so with map method first of all we don't
require this variable so let's get rid
of that so instead of using each I'm
going to use map method and with map we
don't have this result variable so let's
remove that let's move that pipe symbol
as well and we are simply going to say
return
element dot text which is going to
return the country name and then at the
end I'm going to use GATT which is going
to convert that into an array and then
I'm going to use this join method
JavaScript join method so with every
list item text I also want to join the
pipe symbol so pipe is going to be our
separator now and look at this we could
achieve all this in a single line with
method chaining and let's allow this
using JavaScript alert function and we
can get rid of these two lines here so
let's save the changes and when we
reload this look at that we get the pipe
delimited string and here is that
example in our next video we'll discuss
the differences between map in each
methods and when to use one over the
other thank you for listening and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
