this video we'll discuss all these
attribute value selectors this is
continuation to part 7 so please watch
part 7 before proceeding let's look at
these one by one
name equals value this is called
attribute equals selector here is an
example title equals Diwan title so this
is basically telling find all elements
that have the title attribute but the
value of the title attribute must be
equal to the one title so let's look at
this in action so here we are basically
telling find all elements that have the
title attribute and the value must be
equal to t1 title so for all such
elements we are setting a 5 pixel solid
red border so let's save these changes
and then we load this page div 1 and
span 1 are selected and if you look at
those elements div 1 and span 1 both of
them have the title attribute and the
value of the title attribute is equal to
div 1 title that's why they are selected
name not equal to value this is called
attribute not equal selector and here is
the example title not equal to the 1
title so this is telling find all
elements that have the title attribute
but the value of the title attribute
must not be equal to the one title so I
want to find let's say all developments
that have the title attribute but the
value of the title attribute must not be
equal to the one title ok so let's save
those changes and then we reload this
look at that only div 2 element is
selected that's because that's the only
developments that has the title
attribute where the value is not equal
to D 1 title now you can specify not
equal to like this using exclamation
symbol or you can use the not selector
so basically we'll say title equals T 1
title but then here I'm going to say :
not so basically this is telling find
all the developments
which has called the title attribute but
the value must not be equal to the one
title so let's save these changes and
when we reload this the behavior should
be exactly the same name star equals
value this is called attribute contains
selector here is the example title star
equals title so this is basically
telling find all elements that have the
title attribute the value of the title
attribute must contain this word title
so let's look at that in action
so title star equals title so find all
elements that have the title attribute
and the value of the title attribute
must contain this word title so let's
reload this page and look at that every
element is selected
except span tool and if you look at span
two that's the only element that has the
title attribute where the value is not I
mean where the value does not contain
that word title rest all elements have
the title attribute and the value
contains that word title so that is
called attribute contains selector name
dilled equals value this is called
attribute contains word selector and
here is the example title tilde equals
my span so this is basically telling
find all elements that have the title
attribute and the value of the title
attribute must contain this word my span
and that word must be delimited by
spaces so let's look at that in action
so title tilde equals my span and if you
look at this panel man look at that
basically the title value ends with this
word my span okay it ends with that and
there is a space here so it's delimited
by space so this span element should be
selected so let's reload that look at
that now this word my span it may be
present even at the beginning okay so it
starts with this word my span but look
at that it's not delimited by space you
know at the end here so as a result this
won't be selected but then if we give a
space then it should be selected look at
that now this word can be present even
in between but then again it should be
delimited by space other
it wouldn't be selected okay so when we
save this changes and when we reload
this it should work the same way so
that's called contains word selector
tilde equals name pipe equals value this
is called attribute contains a prefix
selector and here is the example title
pipe equals my title so basically this
is telling find all the elements that
have the title attribute and the value
of the title attribute must be equal to
my title or it should start with my
title followed by a hyphen symbol so
let's look at that in action so title
pipe equals my title so either the value
of the title attribute must be equal to
title or if it I mean when it starts
with my title it should be followed by a
hyphen symbol and if you look at our
elements here look at that we have an
element here where the value starts with
my title and it's followed by - so this
should be selected and if you look at
this paragraph element it starts with
this word my title but you know you
don't have a hyphen following that so it
won't be selected
okay so when we reload this page look at
that only this paragraph is selected now
if you have the value equal to my title
even in this case it should be selected
so when we reload that look at that
so that's called contains prefix
selector name caret equals value this is
called attribute starts with selector so
basically this is telling you know the
example right here title tilde equals
still so this is telling find all the
elements that have the title attribute
where the value starts with this word
Dave
okay so title caret equals Def so let's
reload this page and look at that div 1
div 2 n span 1 are selected and if you
look at div 1 div 2 and this pan all of
them have title attribute and the value
starts with that for a div named dollar
equals value this is called attribute
ends with selector and here is the
example title dollar equals heading so
this is basically telling find all
elements that have the title attribute
but the value must end with this word
heading so let's look at that so title
dollar and it should end with this word
heading and if you look at the HTML at
the moment we don't have I mean we have
only this element where another title
value ends with heading so only that
element should be selected so let's save
that changes and when we reload this
look at that only that paragraph is
selected and here are the examples that
we just discussed
thank you for listening and have a great
