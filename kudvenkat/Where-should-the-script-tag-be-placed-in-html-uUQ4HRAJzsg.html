tutorial in this video we'll discuss way
should the script tag be placed in HTML
should this script tag be placed in the
body or health section of the page
in general the script air can be placed
either in the head or body section let's
look at an example let's flip to visual
studio this is the same example that we
worked with in part 6 of this video
series to this project let's add a
webform and all we want this waveform to
do is display an alert box and here
we are going to use the script element
within the head section and then we are
going to use the alert function to
display a message saying hello let's run
this and as you might expect when the
waveform loads it should display hollow
within the alert box in this example we
have the script element in the head
section now let's move it to the body
section of the page so let's cut it and
then let's place it just before the
closing body tag let's rerun this
waveform and see if it's going to work
the same way notice that we get that
message hallo
so now in these two examples
irrespective of whether we place that
script element in the head or body
section its working is expected but
there aren't scenarios where when you
place the script tag you know within the
body section it's going to work but it's
not going to work if you place it in the
head section let's look at an example of
that now what we want this waveform to
do is basically include a text box
control onto the form and then when the
webform loads we want to set the
background color of this text box to red
so we want a Java Script for that so
here we are going to use the document
object dot get element by ID method and
then we pass the ID of this text box
control and then we want to set the
background color so style dot
background color equals threat so let's
run this and see if the background color
of the text box is set to red and it is
set to red as expected and if you look
at the script elementally have it in arm
within the body section just before the
closing body tag now let's actually move
this to the head section and see if it's
going to work so let's read on the
waveform and look at that it then said
the background color of the text box to
read so it didn't work as expected why
is that so when we moved this script tag
to the head section and what is this
cryptic doing you know it's basically
getting the text box 1 and then setting
the background color so why did the
JavaScript did not work in this case
that's because JavaScript code is
present before the textbox control so by
the time this piece of JavaScript code
is executed the text box is still not
loaded into the browser Dom that is
document object model that's the reason
this piece of JavaScript is not able to
find this text box one control and
throws a null reference error and to
look at that non reference error I'm
using Google Chrome browser so we need
to get to the developer tools and to get
to the developer tools just press f12
key and it should launch developer tools
and look at that we've got this error
uncaught type error and it says cannot
read a property style of null so what
does this error mean this means you know
whatever this piece of code returns is
now because it cannot find the text box
1 so n null reference is returned and
for a null reference object we cannot
set this style property it's as simple
as that and I'm using Google Chrome but
if you are using Firefox or Internet
Explorer you still use the same f12 key
to get to developer tools and then look
at that error message there a message
may be slightly different but it all
relates to
non-reference error so that's why where
you place javascript is important
sometimes but in general you can either
place it in the head section or body
section if the javascript is present in
an external file and if we are
referencing it on a page using script
element we have discussed how to do that
in part 6 of this video series so if we
have such kind of a script element they
should you know that script element be
placed now to answer that question first
let's understand what actually happens
when it brows and starts loading a web
page so when a browser starts loading
the web page the browser has got
something called HTML parser which is
going to start parsing the HTML and when
the parser encounters a script tag let's
look at an example so here we have this
waveform and this is the example that we
worked with in part 6 of this video
series notice that here we have the
script tag and if you look at the script
tag it is referencing an external
javascript file now when this waveform
is being loaded
you know the parse that is going to
start parsing the HTML that is this
opening HTML head and then when it comes
to the script tag the parser is going to
be blocked until this external
javascript file is loaded which means
the parsing of the HTML is stopped you
know to download this external
javascript file once this external
javascript file download completes then
the parser is unblocked and then it will
resume parts in the rest of the HTML so
what does that mean that means while
these script files are being downloaded
basically the page parsing is top which
means it's going to affect the load time
so in this example we have just one
script tag now in real-time applications
they could be several script files that
we may need and as a result of that we
may have several script tags like this
let's say for example we need 10
JavaScript files in our project and if
you have 10 script elements like this at
the top of the page reference in 10
external files when the parts will get
to those scripts you know it's going to
block parsing the rest of the HTML until
all you know all of the
ten JavaScript files are downloaded and
another thing to keep in mind is that
according to HTTP 1.1 specification at
the max only two files can be downloaded
in parallel which means if you have 10
JavaScript files you know
only two files are downloaded in
parallel and then after those two files
are completed it then starts to download
the next two files and once they are
completed it goes to the next two files
so it's going to take a lot of time to
download all those script files if they
are present at the top of the page right
so that's why in general is a good
practice to place the script tag just
before the closing body tag that way we
have the entire HTML parse and then
these scripts will be loaded ok so so
that that's what happens when the
browser loads a web page the browser
starts parsing the HTML when the parser
encounters the script tag that
references an external javascript file
the parser stops parsing the HTML and
the browser makes a request to download
the script file until the download is
complete the parser is blocked from
parts in the rest of the HTML on the
page and the download of that javascript
file is complete that's when the parser
will resume to parse the rest of the
HTML so what does that mean
this means the page loading is stopped
until all the script files are loaded
which FX user experience in general the
suggested good practice is to place the
script tag just before the closing back
body tag so it doesn't block the HTML
parser however you may read on the
internet that the modern browsers
support async and Deffer attributes on
script element so basically on this
script element you can use the async
keyword okay so a saccade defer
attributes and what are these attributes
going to do basically these attributes
are going to tell the browser it is safe
to continue parsing while the scripts
are being downloaded but even with those
attributes from a performance standpoint
it is still better to play script tag
just before the closing body there and
why is that that's because according to
HTTP 1.1
specification browses download no more
than two components in parallel which
means if the page has got several images
to download and if we place the script
tag at the top of the page obviously
those script files should be downloaded
first and remember only two files can be
downloaded in parallel which means if
you have ten script files and let's say
20 images on the page and if you have
script element on the top then it's
going to block the downloading of images
while those script files are being
downloaded which means it's going to add
to the page download time which is going
to affect the user experience that is
why irrespective of whether use this
async and Deffer attributes on the
script element or not it's always better
to place the script tag just before the
closing body tag so that it doesn't
block the HTML parser from parsing the
HTML thank you for listening and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
