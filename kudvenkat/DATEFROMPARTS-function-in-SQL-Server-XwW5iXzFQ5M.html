tutorial in this video we'll discuss
date from parts function in sequel
server this is a new function introduced
in Sigma Server 2012 it returns a date
value for the specified year month and
day parameters if you look at the syntax
of this function notice it has got three
parameters year month and day depending
on the values that we provide for these
three parameters this function is going
to return at date value the datatype of
all these three parameters that is year
month and day is integer if we specify
any invalid value for any of these three
parameters then this function is going
to return an error similarly if we
specify for any of these three
parameters and null value then this
function is going to return now let's
look at a few examples look at the query
right here here we have specified valid
values for all the three parameters for
year we have specified 2015 for month 10
and for the day 25 so when we execute
this query it's going to display 25th of
October 2015 as expected
let's look at that in action so when we
execute this notice that we get 25th of
October 2015 now let's change the value
of this month parameter to 15 value of
15 for a month parameter is not valid
right so when we execute this it's going
to throw an error look at that it says
cannot construct datatype date some of
the arguments have values which are not
valid and that makes sense because value
15 for month doesn't make any sense
now let's change the value to now so one
of these parameters is now when we
execute this it is going to return now
all the three parameters are required
and they need to be valid and here we
have those two examples sequel server
2012 has introduced several new date and
time functions some of them are end of
month we dismiss this function in detail
in part 125 of our sequence of a
tutorial in this video we have just
dispersed date from parts function so we
supply year month and
values and the state from thoughts
function is going to return a date value
similarly we have date time from parts
so what is this going to do from the
name we can very easily tell this is
going to return a date time and for a
function to construct date time not only
the date parts that we have to specify
we also have to specify the time parts
and if you look at time parts what are
they in addition to year month and day
the time parts are these hour minute
seconds and milliseconds so these are
the parameters for date time from parts
function and we have another similar
function small date time from parts
again from the name you can guess this
function is going to return small D time
value and for this function to return
small date time value you will have to
supply values for these parameters right
here here month they have a minute this
function does not have seconds and
milliseconds so if you look at these two
functions date time from parts and small
date time from parts date time from
parts returns day time and small date
time from parts returns small date time
so the obvious next question that comes
to our mind is what's the difference
between day time and small date time
we'll discuss that in detail in our next
video there are also a few other new
date and time functions introduced in
secret Server 2012 and they are time
from parts function daytime to from
parts day time offset from parts we'll
discuss these three functions in a later
video session thank you for listening
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
