venket this is pad 59 in this session
we'll understand the difference between
convert to string method and to string
method let's understand that with an
example in this program you see a very
simple customer class that has just got
a name property now to create an
instance of this class with a customer
c1 is equal to new customer now to get
the string representation of this C 1 we
can use dot to string method so C 1.2
string so when we do that we get the
string representation of this customer
object so let's create a string variable
to hold that let's call string STR
alright if we want to print that we can
say console dot readline STR and if you
remember in the previous session we have
discussed about the importance of
overriding the to string method you know
if you want something meaningful out of
this string representation of a specific
object then we overwrite the to string
method but here we haven't overridden
the to string method okay by the way
where is this two string method coming
from it's coming from the base system or
object class and we haven't overridden
that so obviously when we try to run
this what do we get back we get back you
know the complete type name you know
including the namespace okay that's the
default implementation that's available
in system dot object base class all
right so to get the string
representation of this customer object
there is another way now instead of
using two string we can use the convert
class so convert dot in this class we
have a static method to string you can
use that and pass the object okay now
when I run that and obviously in the
output you wouldn't see any difference
okay you get the same output okay but
the difference is when this customer
object reference variable is null for
some reason okay if you are passing this
as a parameter to a method and you don't
initialize that or this
object is not created for some reason
you know it is possible that it could be
null at times okay so if it is now and
when I use the to string the static to
string method in the ten word class you
know what actually happens is let's put
a breakpoint here when we run this so if
you look at this c1 is now so when you
pass a null object to the to string
method in the convert class it actually
converts that even null into an empty
string look at that STR is an empty
string okay but on the other hand if we
use two string method on the object C
1.2 strain what's going to happen let's
see let's run this when you run this
what happens look at this we already got
a null reference exception and that's
because look at that c1 is null and on
that null you're trying to call this
instance two string method so on a null
object okay you cannot call an instance
method so that's why we get a null
reference exception and it makes sense
and you look at the error message null
reference exception object reference not
set to an instance of an object which
means this reference variable is not
pointing to any instance of the object
on the heap okay so very simple
difference between convert string and
two strings so what's that convert dot
to string handles nulls and return an
empty string if the passed in object is
now but whereas the to string method
doesn't handle nulls and it throws an
exception what type of exception null
reference exception why because Annan
maillot object you're trying to convert
to a string so we get a null reference
exception back okay but you cannot say
one method is better over the other
depending on the type of the application
the architecture of that application and
what you are trying to achieve you
choose one over the other
for example if you're designing a class
library and you expect a property to be
initialized or you expect the object to
be you know
pointing to some concrete object on the
heap and if you if if users the client
code if the client load doesn't pass in
that object then it makes sense to do an
exception but in the UI you don't want
to be throwing an exception on the UI
part you just want to you know print the
error message to the user in that case
probably you use they know the
controller to string just in case if it
happens to be and now you know we can
check if it's an empty string using
convert or to string and then display an
appropriate error message on the UI to
the user so depending on the type of the
application architecture what you're
trying to achieve you choose one or the
other
we cannot say one is better over the
other on this slide you can find
resources for asp.net and C sharp
interview questions that's it for today
thank you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
