tutorial in this video we'll discuss how
to create custom method names in an
asp.net Web API controller first let's
understand the default convention that
we have in place that asp.net web api
uses to map HTTP verbs get put post and
delete two methods in a controller class
by default the HTTP verb is mapped to a
method in a controller that has the same
name as the verb our starts with the
verb so for example the HTTP verb cat is
mapped to get method or get employees or
get something so within our employees
controller right here notice we have get
method so by convention this is mapped
to the HTTP verb get even if we rename
this to get employees or get something
it will still be mapped to the HTTP verb
get as long as the method name is
prefixed with this word cat the word cat
is case insensitive so it can be upper
case lower case or a mix of both so
let's change this to for example get
something and quickly verify whether if
it gets mapped to the HTTP verb get so
let's give our solution a build build
succeeded
now let's issue get requests so let's
navigate to API slash employees notice
we get the list of all employees so ever
get something method within our
employees controller is mapped to the
HTTP verb get as expected now let's see
what happens if the method is not named
get or if it does not start with the
word cat so within our employees
controller let's change this method get
something to load all employees let's
give our solution a bell so if the
method name is not cat or if it does not
start with the word cat then asp.net web
api does not know which method within
number controller class to map to the
HTTP verb get so it's going to fail
with an error message the requested
resource does not support HTTP method
get' with status code 4:05 method not
allowed so bill succeeded
now let's issue get requests and see
what happens
notice we get the error message the
requested resource does not support HTTP
method get' so if we inspect this
request in fiddler look at the status
code that we got for 0-5 method not
allowed so since we're api does not know
it has to map this method to the HTTP
verb get we get that error message we
can install a speed or net web api to
map this method to the HTTP verb GATT by
decorating this method with HTTP GET
attribute so let's do that
let's give our solution a build build
succeeded now let's reach you the
request notice we get the list of all
employees as expected
now let's request for a specific
employee so in the URI I'm saying
employee ID is one and when we request
that notice we get that specific
employee now in this case Web API knows
it has to map the ket verb to this get
method because the method is named cat
in the URI
we've got employee ID and this method
has got the ID parameter so the get
request in this case is mapped to this
ket method within our employees
controller now let's see what's going to
happen if we change the method name to
load employee by ID let's give our
solution a build build succeeded
now let's reissue our request notice
though we have requested just for
employee with ID 1 we are getting the
list of all employees so let's
understand what's going on here now this
get request is mapped to this load all
employees method because this is the
only method that is decorated with HTTP
GET attribute in this case web api does
not know it has to
app diskette request to this load
employee by ID method because it is not
named cat and it does not start with the
word get we also didn't decorate this
method with the attribute HTTP GET so
web api does not have any clue that it
has to map this method to the cat
request now let's decorate this method
also with HTTP GET attribute so at the
moment we've got two methods that are
decorated with HTTP GET attribute so
this method is going to be mapped to the
get verb when in the URI we don't have
employee ID parameter and this method
will be mapped in case if we have ID
parameter in the URI so let's give our
solution a build build succeeded now
notice when we have employee ID in the
URI we get only that specific employee
when we don't have the employee ID we
get the list of all employees so we have
used this HTTP ket attribute to let web
api know that these are the two methods
that we want to map to the HTTP verb get
depending on whether we have employee ID
parameter in the URI or not along the
same lines we also have other attributes
like HTTP POST HTTP put and HTTP delete
to map custom named methods in a
controller to post put and delete verbs
here is the list thank you for listening
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
