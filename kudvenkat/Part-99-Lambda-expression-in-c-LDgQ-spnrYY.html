video we'll discuss what lambda
expressions are with an example this is
continuation to part 98 so please watch
what 98 before proceeding in this video
we'll be working with the same example
that we worked with in the previous
session so what are lambda expressions
anonymous methods and lambda expressions
are very similar anonymous methods were
introduced in c-sharp 2 and lambda
expressions in c-sharp 3 in most cases
lambda expressions supersede anonymous
methods if you recollect from the
previous session we have used anonymous
method as you can see here to find an
employee with ID equals 1 0 2 from the
list of employees that we have caught
and notice the usage of anonymous method
here we explicitly use the delegate
keyword and then we specify the type of
the input parameter here the type of the
input parameter is employee the same
example is rewritten here using a lambda
expression and notice how simple is this
lambda expression first of all this
operator right here is called as lambda
operator and it reads as goes to here
EMP goes to EMP dot i DW equals 1 0 2 so
that's the lambda operator and what is
this
EMP on the left hand side this is
nothing but the input parameter okay now
first of all notice that we are not
explicitly using the delegate keyword
within the lambda expression and number
2 we're not specifying the type of the
input parameter okay so how is the
lambda expression going to know the type
of this it is going to infer that
automatically look at this fine method
it's being invoked on this list employee
so object what is this list employees
object it is of type list employee so e
and B here is going to be automatically
inferred to employee time let's actually
look at this in action let's flip to
visual studio so this is an anonymous
method now let's replace this with a
lambda expression so find EMP goes to
and look at this when I hover my mouse
over look at that it says EMP is of type
employee so the type is being
automatically input and we are not using
the delegate keyword explicitly here and
we can say EMP ID double equals 1 0 2
let's go ahead and run this and see if
we get the same output actually look at
that we get the same output here they're
using a lambda expression notice how
simple it is to use they're more
convenient than anonymous method now
here the name EMP you know it's just a
name any meaningful name you can give it
X for example if you want to okay so
this is the input parameter name and
this is the expression and this equals
greater than it's nothing but the lambda
operator all right so now here we
haven't specified explicitly the type of
the input parameter now for some reasons
if you want to be explicit and if you
prefer specifying the type of the input
parameter you can do so as well look at
this here you know we are specifying the
type of the input parameter explicitly
but that's not required which means we
can rewrite this one you know like this
so include a bracket and that X is of
type employee okay
and let's run this and lips see if it
works the same way look at this it works
the same way so you can or you know you
may omit the type of the input parameter
that's going to be automatically
inferred all right so this operator is
called as lambda operator and we read
that as goes to notice that with the
lambda expression we don't have to use
the delegate keyword explicitly and we
also don't have to specify the input
parameter type explicitly the parameter
type is automatically inferred lambda
expressions are more convenient to use
than anonymous methods we have seen that
in action just now lambda expressions
are particularly helpful for writing
link query expressions
let's flip to this in our demo that we
have let's bring in the link namespace
so using system dot link let's say for
example from this list I want to find
out all the employees whose name starts
with letter M now in that case we can
use the count function so let's go and
use the count function so int count so
that function is going to return the
number of employees which is a type
integer so list employees dot count and
if you look at this one again you know
there are two overloads the other
overload is expecting a predicate to be
passed now we'll discuss what this funk
is all about in a later video session
but basically you know we need to
specify our predicate here ok so again
we can use lambda expressions so what do
we want to do we want to find out all
the employees the count of all the
employees whose name starts with letter
M so how are we going to do that so
again you can give the input parameter
any name you want so I can give X so X
such that now notice that here we have
used you know the name as X the input
parameter again we are using X here now
what is the scope of this parameter X
within you know right there you cannot
use outside of that scope okay so that's
why we can reuse it here if we want to
okay so X goes to X dot name of the
employee dot starts with and you want to
find all the employees whose name starts
with letter M and look at this this
count method is actually returning an
integer we're showing that in this
variable and let's go ahead and print
that out so console dot readline let's
just say count equals whatever is
present in our variable all right so we
should get two as the output so count
equals two
right so in most of the cases lambda
expressions supersedes anonymous methods
to my knowledge the only time I prefer
to use an anima smething or lambda
expressions is when we have to omit the
parameter list when it's not used within
the body so anonymous methods I love the
parameter list to be omitted entirely
when it's not used within the body
whereas that's not the case with lambda
expressions let's understand the
statement with an example now if you
recollect from the previous session we
worked with this windows forms
application as well and what did we do
within the form load event we have
created at this button control
dynamically if I say in the text
property and to the click event we have
you know hooked up and even handler
using an anonymous method here now if
you look at this click event
so let's navigate to the event so here
we have the click event and if you look
at this event handler and go to the
definition on that that's again a
delegate and it expects you know two
parameters one is of type object the
other is of type eventargs and it's not
going to return anything okay so now the
delegate that we are going to create
here we need to pass you know basically
two parameters that is object and
eventargs now with the anonymous methods
you know we can write this piece of code
right here let's actually copy this it
and paste them right there and let's
change the names let's call this event
sender and let's call this eventargs
okay now let's go ahead and run this
it's going to work okay let's click that
button clicked okay so now this is
matching with what we have right here
okay so it compiles it works fine so
here we are using anonymous method now I
can get rid of these parameters
altogether because within the body right
here we are not using those parameters
okay so when I get rid of those piranhas
meters look at this first of all when we
build this in the build status bar bill
succeeded when we run this it's going to
work as well without any problem ok
button click now this anonymous method
can be replaced with a lambda expression
okay so that's the anonymous method and
this is the lambda expression look at
that we are using that lambda operator
and here we are specifying the
parameters okay
now within the body again we are not
using parameters these two parameters
are not being used within the body but
what's going to happen if we omit those
parameters we will get a compilation
error let's actually check that in
action so now we have got two parameters
here to be passed now how will we know
what are those parameter types look at
this the moment we open that you know
this click is an event and you know the
delegate that is associated with that is
this one even handler it's expecting
these are the two parameters so let's
actually copy them and let's go to the
form so again here do we need to specify
the names of the I mean the types of the
parameters you know not required the
lambda expression can automatically you
know infer them okay but if you want to
be explicit you can specify them like so
so those are the two input parameters
that's the lambda operator and here we
have our expression okay so let's go
ahead and run this first of all so it
works let's click that so the
application is working is expected now
we don't have to explicitly specify the
type so let's get rid of them and see if
it still works so let's run this click
the button so it still works now let's
actually get rid of these parameters
altogether before we do that look at
this when I hover the mouse over look at
this this is of type object even sender
and eventargs is of type even tardes
okay so the input parameter types are
automatically inferred now what do you
think is going to happen if I get rid of
these to save it and let's build the
application look at this delegate system
have event handler does not take zero
arguments so irrespective of whether we
are using those parameters are not
within the board a we still have to
specify them and we use lambda but
whereas that's not the case with
anonymous methods and only most methods
allow the parameter list to be omitted
entirely when it's not used within the
body all right that's it for today thank
you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
