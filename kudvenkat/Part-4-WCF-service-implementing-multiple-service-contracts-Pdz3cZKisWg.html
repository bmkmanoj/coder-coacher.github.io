video we'll discuss how a single WCF
service can implement multiple service
contracts and then expose each of those
service contracts using a different end
point this is continuation 2 part 3 so I
strongly recommend watching part 3
before proceeding with this video let's
understand how a WCF service can
implement multiple service contracts
with an example let's flip to visual
studio let's create a new class library
project and let's call this company
service let's delete this class 1 dot CS
file that is auto-generated and to this
project let's add a WCF service search
for WCF and then let's name this service
company service so this has generated
two files that is I company service dot
CSN company service dot CS within this I
company service dot CS file at the
moment we only have one service contract
notice that this interface is decorated
with service contract attribute so this
is a service contract let's change the
name of this service contract to I
company public service and then let's
also change the name of this operation
contract here that's actually changed
the name of the method to get public
information and let's change the return
type of this method to string so this
method is going to return a string at
the moment this has got only one service
contract let's make a copy of this and
then let's change the name here from I
company public service to I company
confidential service and let's change
this method name here to get
confidential information okay at the
moment we have got two service contracts
basically the idea is we want this
company public service to be available
for everyone that is outside the
firewall and to the employees within the
fire
everybody will be able to access this
because this service has got this get
public information which is public
information and will be available to
everyone
whereas this one is a confidential
service we want this to be available
only for the employees of the company
behind the firewall okay
so we're going to expose this service
using HTTP protocol so HTTP can go
through the firewall so this will be
accessible to everybody but this one
will be available over TCP protocol that
is only behind the firewall okay so at
the moment we got two service contracts
now let's look at our service class
itself now here we have an error that's
basically because we have changed the
names of the interfaces there so we want
this class to implement both of the
service contracts that is I company
public service contract as well as I
company confidential service contract
now we need to provide the
implementations for those service
contract methods and to do that simply
click on you know this option implement
interface I company public service and
then similarly let's implement the
confidential service methods okay so all
these methods are going to do is written
a string so get public information this
method is going to return this string
just to speed things up I have already
typed arm you know the message that we
want to return so basically all it
returns is this is public information
and available over HTTP to all general
public outside the firewall and we want
this method to return a string which
says this is confidential information
and only available over TCP behind the
company firewall so pretty simple
service at the moment we have a service
implementing multiple service contracts
okay so this could be an interview
question is it possible for a WCF
service to implement multiple service
contracts the answer is yes okay
all we need to do is make that class
inherit I mean implement those two
interfaces that's all but then how do we
want to make them available to the
clients we have to configure two
endpoints one endpoint is going to make
this service available the other
endpoint is going to make this service
contract available okay let's now look
at that so at the moment we have the
service itself ready now we need to host
this service and in order to do that
let's use a console application so to
the solution let's add a console project
and let's call this company service host
now the first thing that we need to do
is add a reference to the company
service project itself as well as the
WCF assembly which is system dot service
model so let's go ahead and do that
so first we need the project itself and
we need a reference to system dot
service model which is the main WCF
assembly all right so now we need to add
the application configuration file where
we specify the configuration so add a
new item and we want to add application
configuration file so within this file
we are going to specify the
configuration for our service and we
discuss this configuration in detail in
the previous session of this video
series so if you're new to this
configuration information please watch
part 3 from the WCF video series so here
we are going to specify system dot
service model and within that we are
going to have services element and
within that a service element and we
need to specify our service name the
service name is going to be present in
this company service dot CS file so the
name of the services company service and
its present in company service namespace
so let's copy that and specify the
service name and then the next important
thing is to specify the end points so
let's go ahead and add an end point an
end point is going to have three things
that is address binding and
configuration
so these are called as the ABC of an
endpoint so address we are going to use
relative addresses here so company's
service is going to be the address and
then binding so we want this service
that is the public service to be
available over HTTP protocol so we are
going to make use of basic HTTP binding
and to get the spelling right what I'm
going to do is I'm going to use bindings
element here and then here we should get
all the bindings so let's use basic HTTP
binding and then finally we need to
specify the contract okay so which
service contract we want to make
available over HTTP this contract the
public contract I company public service
and that's present within company
service namespace so the name of the
contract is I company public service and
the namespace is company service so the
fully qualified name of the contract is
going to be company service dot I
company public service so at this point
we are done specifying one end point
let's specify the other end point okay
even for this end point the address is
going to be company service and we are
going to use you know net TCP binding
here because we want this service to be
available only using TCP protocol that's
behind the firewall only so we are going
to use net TCP binding and the contract
name is going to be I company
confidential service which is again
present in the same namespace that's
company service namespace all right now
let's specify the base addresses and to
do that we use the host element we want
to specify base addresses and let's add
a base address okay so HTTP colon four
slash four slash localhost colon port
8080
okay so the fully qualified address of
this end point is going to be HTTP colon
localhost colon 8080 forward slash
company service in a similar fashion
let's specify the base address for this
company service so we want this service
contract that is the confidential
service contract to be available over
TCP protocol so that is going to be net
dot TCP colon four slash four slash
localhost
let's change the port number to 1890
alright so this service will be
available at net or TCP localhost eighty
ninety four slash company's service so
the base addresses are different here so
the address you know the full address
will be different for this endpoint and
for this endpoint alright let's get rid
of this bindings element there and the
most important thing for the clients to
be able to generate that Vistal document
we need to make the metadata of this
service available now when I say
metadata what we mean by metadata it's
nothing but for the client to build a
proxy classes they need to know about
you know what is the service contract
itself what operations are available the
names of the operations what parameters
they take in what are the theta tides
similarly what type of data is returned
back without this information clients
will not be able to construct proxy
classes okay so in order for that
metadata you know which is going to be
sent using the vestal document to be
made available you know we need to
specify service behaviors okay so let's
go and specify this service behavior and
to do that we use behaviors element and
within behaviors we want to specify
service behaviors and we want to add a
behavior so let's specify a behavior
let's call it max behavior
and within this we want service metadata
and we want clients to be able to browse
you know to the metadata file that is
the Vistal file of our service so we are
saying HTTP GET enabled equals true so
they're going to use HTTP protocol so
the issue a get request and that's why
HTTP GET enabled equals true and the
final one thing that we need to do is
associate this service with this
behavior and in order to do that we use
behavior configuration and specify the
name of this behavior there so pretty
straightforward alright so let's go and
build our solution now we need to set
our company service host as the startup
project so let's set that as the startup
project and one more important thing
that we need to do is when this program
loads we want to construct our service
host and then start the host and in
order to do that the service host class
is present in system dot service model
assembly so let's go ahead and bring
that namespace in then let's use this
using block so that we don't have to
close the host explicitly so using
service host and let's call it host
equals new service host and obviously we
need to specify the type of the service
what is the type of our service company
service and that's present in company
service namespace and in order to get
the type of a service we use the type of
keyword so company service dot company
service so we want to open the host and
let's also print the date in time the
host has started so console dot readline
host started ad
let's say date time dot now and then in
order for this console application to be
alive without closing automatically
let's use console dot readline all right
we are done let's go ahead and run this
ok so host has started now all we need
to do is create a client application so
let's open another instance of a visual
studio and then let's create a new
asp.net application so new project let's
select web and let's create an empty web
application and let's call this company
client so this client should be able to
consume or service the first thing that
we need to do is obviously add a
reference to these servers and in order
to do that select add service reference
option and within this address box we
need to give the address where the
Vistal document will be available that
will be at localhost colon 8080 and
click go button so that's the port
number we have specified so look at that
we have got company service there and
look at both of the service contracts
are available here I company
confidential service we have got get
confidential information and I company
public service get public information
both of them are available so let's add
any meaningful name space let's call
this company service click OK so a
Vistal document should be generated I
mean a proxy class based on the vestal
document should be generated for us so
now to this project let's add a webform
and to speed things up you know I have
typed the HTML already so let me copy
this HTML and paste it here then once I
flip this to the design mode you'll
understand so basically I have a table
here within that I have two buttons get
public information and get confidential
information and to label controls
basically to display the message that we
get back so let's double click on this
button to generate the click event
handler so that is get public
information button so what we need to do
here create an instance of the company
service you know proxy classes so within
the company service namespace we have
got look at this we have got both the
clients that is company public service
client and company confidential service
client okay so let's go and create an
instance of company public service
client let's call this client equals new
company public service client now if you
remember we have made this service
contract available only over HTTP
protocol okay so we need to use that
endpoint in order to communicate with
this service now when when we added a
reference to this service it has
obviously generated you know a lot of
configuration for us and within this
configuration look at this both the
endpoints that we have specified within
the servers are available here okay look
at this we have the endpoint which uses
HTTP protocol and the name of that
endpoint is here so with public service
we want to use this endpoint okay
so within our code behind file within
the constructor let's specify you know
the name of the endpoint and then simply
invoke the method look at this when I
say client dot we should say get public
information method which is returning a
string and all we want to do is we want
to display that with
label control so label 1 dot text equals
that okay in a similar fashion when we
click this button get confidential
information we want to create an
instance of confidential service client
class let's call this client equals new
company confidential service client
again we need to specify the name of the
endpoint that we want to use this
confidential service client is going to
be available on TCP protocol so here we
have the TCP protocol look at that look
at the address we have here it's the
fully qualified address if you remember
within the service we have specified you
know relative address as company servers
and within the base address we have to
specified this one so the client now
knows the fully qualified address to hit
that endpoint so basically this is the
name of this endpoint so let's copy that
and specify it here and then client dot
we should see that confidential
information method there and we want to
display that within a label to control
all right so with all these changes
let's go ahead and run this and see
what's going to happen now get public
information look at that this is public
information the message appears is
expected get confidential information
you know both of the messages we can see
here now what was the actual requirement
the actual requirement was you know this
public service to be available outside
as well as inside but this company
confidential service should be available
only inside the company that is behind
the firewall but if you look at the
client that we have just build we are
able to generate proxy classes of both
the services and we are able to invoke
both of these service methods so how is
that possible that's basically because
in my case here
both the service and client are running
on the same machine so basically they
are behind the firewall
so I am able to use both of the
endpoints but then if you are outside
the firewall you will be able to
generate the proxy classes but then when
you try to invoke the method the
firewall the firewall will block that so
basically you will get an exception at
runtime when you invoke the method okay
so basically in this video what did we
discuss we implemented you know a
service a WCF service that can have
multiple service contracts so is it
possible for a WCF service to implement
multiple service contracts the answer is
yes we make the service class implement
multiple service interfaces and then
simply expose those service contracts
using a different endpoint as you can
see here okay pretty straightforward
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
