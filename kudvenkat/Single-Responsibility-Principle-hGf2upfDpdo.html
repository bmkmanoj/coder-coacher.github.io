two of the solid design principles
tutorial in this session we will do a
quick recap of single responsibility
principle and we'll discuss the single
responsibility principle implementation
with a simple example please refer to
the solid introduction tutorial before
proceeding in the previous session we
have understood that yes in the solid is
acronym for single responsibility
principle as per the single
responsibility principle a class should
have only one reason to change which
means every module or class should have
responsibility over a single part of the
functionality provided by the software
and that responsibility should be
entirely encapsulated by the class
encapsulation is one of the fundamentals
of object-oriented programming at this
moment understanding more about
encapsulation is out of scope of this
session however we strongly recommend
you to refer to the c-sharp tutorial
playlist for more details on
object-oriented principles now you might
be wondering what do we achieve with the
single responsibility principle or
rather with all the solid design
principles let's first understand the
motivations behind the usage of solid
principles in any enterprise software
application development which many of us
are part of it we design and develop
software systems and in that process we
need to account the below factors during
the development lifecycle
the first being maintainability when any
enterprise systems become big and their
expected life time grows longer and
longer maintaining those systems becomes
more and more complex and a day-to-day
challenge many of us might have
experienced at that as well when the
original team that develops these
systems becomes no longer available due
to their career growth
or any other factors sometimes you know
the documentation may be out of sync or
he will not present all these factors
influence the maintainability of the
systems along with a demanding need of
upgrading these systems with new
features to meet the requirements of
business stakeholders
hence maintainable systems are very
important to the organization's the
second aspect of the motivation is
testability test-driven development is
required when we design and develop
large-scale systems in fact it's a good
practice to have a test driven
development in the system development
process itself hence test-driven
development is very important in the
application lifecycle the third factor
is flexibility and extensibility
flexibility and extensibility is a very
much desirable factor of enterprise
applications as developers we have faced
the situation of changing biggest next
requirements very often during both the
development of an application as well as
after it's being deployed to production
hence we should design the application
to make it flexible so that it can adapt
to work in different ways and extensible
and we can add new features easily
parallel development it is one of the
key features in the application
development as it is not practical to
have the entire development team working
simultaneously on the same feature or
component the last one is loose coupling
we can address many of the requirements
listed above by ensuring that our design
results in an application that loosely
couples many parts that makes up the
application
loose coupling makes the application
easier and safer to make any changes in
one area of the system because each part
of the system is largely independent of
other now after going over the above
points you might be feeling little bored
and looking forward to as an example the
demonstrate all these solid design
principle
we will be certainly doing that in this
session as well as in the upcoming
sessions however the conclusion of a bow
is that we need to follow the best
principles that lead to a robust
application
hence solid principles and design
patterns plays a key role in achieving
all of the above points now coming back
to the single responsibility principle
by implementing single responsibility
principle we can ensure that each class
and module focuses on a single task at a
time and everything in the class should
be related to that single purpose if you
are wondering and asking yourself
whether a class can have multiple
members then the answer would be yes
adding to that there can be many members
in the class as long as they are related
to the single responsibility of that
class with single responsibility
principle classes becomes smaller and
cleaner also the code becomes less
fragile hence we can say that single
responsibility principle achieves the
motivation points that we have just
discussed let's now switch to visual
studio and understand the single
responsibility principle with a simple
example let's say we need to create an
application that performs a user's login
and registration
not only just login and registration
who's that
it should be able to send an email to
the user depending on the status of his
login our registration however we should
also be able to log any exceptions that
may occur in this process as well so the
normal tendency is to create an
interface with all these methods let's
first create an interface and name that
interface as a user right click and add
new item and choose an interface let me
name this interface as AI user let me
create some methods that this AI user
can perform the first being login let's
say login with username and password as
the
input parameters string username and
string password let's return the success
status as a boolean flag this is the
first method of this I user interface
the second method will be registered the
registration comes with username
password and email as input parameters
now in this process we need to log any
exceptions so let's create another
method which lock the exceptions which
would be log error which accepts a error
as the input parameter string then the
next method which comes is to send an
email when the login or registration is
success so let's say that bull send
email and we'll be sending that email
with some content so let's call it out
as email content these are the four
methods which are required in minimum
for any user to perform login or
registrations at a first glance it looks
very common to have these steps
performed during the user registration
process but if you take a deep look into
these methods we can definitely figure
out that we don't need to have logger
and send email part of AI user because
the user object should be able to
perform only login and registration or
one at a time but it should not be
concerned about log error or send email
isn't it which is absolutely correct
because we don't need log error and send
email to be part of high user interface
so we definitely need to break that down
into separate interfaces let's go ahead
and do that
let's create another interface and call
this interface as a logger and the
method that this interface would handle
is log error method
let's move this log error method to this
high logger interface also let's create
another interface and name it as I email
this I email will handle sending any
emails so let's move this send email to
the I email interface now having these
three interfaces makes more sense and
these three interfaces are performing
their own responsibilities such as the I
user performs user related
responsibilities and the log error
performs the logging responsibilities
and email does the send email and other
email related responsibilities note that
we have segregated the single
responsibility principle using these
multiple interfaces the next step is to
implement these interfaces with object
creational mechanisms Ganga 4 has
defined many design patterns on object
creations based on the business
requirements hence we strongly recommend
you to refer to our design pattern
tutorial for more details on creational
design patterns
I believe this session has given you a
good idea on how we can implement single
responsibility principle in the next
session we will focus on interface
segregation principle till then thank
you for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
