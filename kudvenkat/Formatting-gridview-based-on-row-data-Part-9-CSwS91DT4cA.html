Frank it this is part 9 of asp.net
grid-view tutorial in this video we'll
discuss about formatting grid view
control based on the underlying raw data
let's understand this with an example
let's say I have this table in my
database we just got employee ID first
name annual salary country and cultured
information and we want to display this
data in a grid view control now there
are two important things to notice here
when we displayed this data in the grid
view control we want the annual salary
column to be displaying the country
specific currency symbol and to compute
that you know country specific currency
symbol we will use the culture
information that's present in the
database table and another important
thing to notice we don't want to display
this culture in a column within the grid
view control when it is rendered we only
want to use that column to compute the
country specific currency symbol and
obviously the easiest way to achieve
this is by using a row data bound event
through data bound event is raised every
time a row from the data source is bound
to a row in the grid view control okay
first let's see how to get this data
from the database and display that in
the grid we control obviously the
easiest way is by using sequel data
source control so let's go and configure
that click on configure data source
let's select our connection string from
web config file click next select your
table which is TBL employee we want all
the rows to be selected so select star
from TBL employee click Next test your
query click finish so we are done
configuring sequel data source control
so now let's go ahead and associate that
with this grid view control so select
the control from choose data source
drop-down list and we are done
ok so at this point we are able to
display you know the data as it appears
in the table but then remember based on
the culture column we need to retrieve
that culture information and then we
need to compute country specific
currency symbol and then display it for
this annual salary and obviously the
easiest way to do that is by using row
data bound the event so let's flip to
visual studio with the properties of the
grid view control by right-clicking on
that click on this lightning bolt symbol
and then look at this row data bound
event double-click here the even handler
gets auto-generated for us now so
remember this crude data bound event is
also raised for the header row and
footer row so f row dot sorry if ye dot
Rho dot row type is data row then what
we want to do we basically want to
retrieve this current you know country
culture the the data from this column
and then we want to retrieve the salary
as well format this salary using this
culture and then finally set that
formatted salary as the text back in
this column okay so four steps just to
speed things up I have the school
already typed so let's copy that and
paste it right there so if you look at
this what we are doing look at this we
are retrieving you know the salary from
cell to so obviously if you look at cell
2 that's 0 1 2 the cell so we retrieve
the integer salary and then we retrieve
the country culture country culture is
present in cell 4 which is this one so 0
1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 so we retrieve the country
culture and then finally we format that
using the country culture you know we
use 0 colon see you know to to get the
appropriate currency symbol passing in
that cell salary so we have formatted
string here finally we are setting that
formatted string back as the text for
salary column so cell 2 is again what
annual salary so we are setting that
formatted string back in that cell
alright so with this change if we go
ahead and run this let's see how the
output is going to be obviously as you
might expect the salaries will now be
displayed it displayed to the
appropriate country specific currency
symbol but remember we also don't want
to show this column to the end user okay
so obviously to hide this column there
are several ways and the easiest way
basically is to set the visibility of
that column you know to false in the
aspx of the webform let's do that and
see what happens
so here I have this country culture
column so I'm going to set the
visibility of that column to false so
visible is equal to false and with this
change let's go ahead and run and see
how the output is going to be look at
this the country culture column is gone
but look at what happened to annual
salary it is not now displaying the
correct country specific currency symbol
why is that because when we set the
visibility of this column to false what
is actually happening behind the scenes
let's right-click on the page and view
page source look at the page source it's
not at all rendering look at that we
have the employee ID we have the
employee name we have their salary and
we have the country to which they belong
but we do not have a table cell for the
country culture so obviously when it
comes to this code you know when when we
try to retrieve the country culture the
text from cell 4
will basically be an empty text for all
the rows and that's why for that empty
text you know we get that symbol you
know whatever is the symbol that we see
here okay so that's the reason why it
doesn't work correctly when you said the
visibility to falls in the aspx page
okay so what we basically can do to
solve this problem is buying by setting
the visibility dynamically you know
programmatically in the code-behind file
after we retrieve the country culture so
for each row I retrieve the country
culture and then I'm going to set the
visibility of this cell to false let's
do that and see what's going to happen
so visible is equal to false now let me
go ahead and run this and see how the
data will be displayed okay now good so
we have the annual salary displayed and
the data rules for country culture are
gone okay but then look at this this
header this doesn't look right so we
want to hide the header as well so how
do we hide the header it's very simple
and straightforward all you need to do
is put another if
statement here if the data row is header
and then since we have an F because the
row can either be a header or a data row
it's better to use else F you know
slightly better for performance so what
we basically want to do we want to you
know hide the header as well so I'm
going to say e dot true dot cell so for
dot visible is equal to false meaning
hide
you know the header as well so let's run
this now as you might expect the header
will be hidden so let okay look at this
so this is the app that we have
anticipated okay so it's working as
expected now this is not the only way
there's another way as well but before
we inspect that look at this when I have
said the visibility of the cell to false
look at this when I right click there
are currently one two three four columns
so when I view page source I only see
those four TDs employee ID employee name
salary and the country so we don't have
a TD for the country culture being
rendered when we set visibility of that
cell to false okay all right let's close
all this now what is the other way of
achieving this there's another way we
can use the display you know style
basically we can set a display to none
and then we can achieve the same thing
let's see how to do that so I basically
don't want to use you know hide this
column instead I want to use the style
attribute display and set that to none
and see how it behaves so obviously
there are a couple of steps to achieve
that so first we need to add a style
class and to do that let's add our
styles to a folder so let me go ahead
and add a folder to this project I'm
going to call this folder as styles and
let's add a style sheet it's always a
good habit to have all your Styles
defined in an external style trait
because tomorrow if a style has to
change for some reason you can change
that in that one style sheet and then
wherever you using that style you know
everywhere it will be updated
automatically so let's go ahead and add
a style sheet to this folder new item
and let's select a style sheet let's
call you know maybe site dot CSS
we'll talk about stylesheets in detail
in the later video session but I'm going
to add a style class and I'm going to
call this s maybe display:none that's
the name of the class and all I'm going
to set here is one attribute called
display and I'm going to set that to
none display : none so one style class
within this stylesheet so now I want to
use the style on my wave form so
obviously if I have to use that style
defined in that style sheet on my wave
form I need to set a reference for that
style sheet in my wave form and the
easiest way to do that is by dragging
and dropping that style sheet on to this
wave form it will add a link element
alright so now what I want to do here so
that's the second step first step add a
style sheet define your style second
step and a reference to that style sheet
on your wave form and then look at this
this is the column which is displaying
the bound column which is displaying
country culture now if you look at these
tiles you know basically that are
defined at this bone field level there
is something called item style and if
you look at that item style at CSS class
so we can specify a CSS class and if you
remember we have displayed I mean
defined this display:none STL CSS class
so I'm going to set that as the CSS
class for this item style and similarly
it's not only item we also want to hide
the header so I'm going to set header
style CSS class to the same thing okay
so basically what we are doing we are
hiding tools you know you're setting
display colon none attribute for the
item and the header okay now since we
have said this here we don't have to
have this code here so I'm going to get
rid of that and the code within here
which basically hides the display okay
so we are done with this
all right now let's go ahead and run the
snow as you might expect there's not
going to be any change in the output
it's going to be exactly similar to what
it was before except that now we are
using display : none in our style so now
if you look at this if I right-click on
the page and say view page source now
notice that the culture information is
also rendered there's a TD for the
culture information as well but notice
that what for that TD which is you know
rendering a country specific culture
there is this CSS class display:none
which you know since we have set display
colon man you know that attribute is
basically you know hiding this from
being you know shown in the control but
then that is rendered you know so that's
the main difference between using
visible is equal to false and display :
non visible is equal to false will not
render data whereas display colon non
will render data but will not be visible
in the control to the end-user on this

questions that's it for today thank you
