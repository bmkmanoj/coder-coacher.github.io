this video we'll discuss how to style
the form controls based on the
validation state here we have the list
of classes and glyph icons for styling
the form controls based on the
validation state for success validation
state we have has success class
similarly for warning and error
validation States we have has warning
and has error classes respectively we
also have the cliff icons for these
three validation States let's look at an
example now so here is what we want to
do when you register for an online
account you are required to type in a
password when you type in a strong
password you might have seen controls
Skylar like this look at the label which
says password the border around the
textbox and this help text strong
password all of them are in green in
color
so here the controls are styled for
success validation state let's see how
to achieve this using bootstrap at the
moment we have the label which says
password and a text box to capture the
password and here is the HTML required
for that here we have a horizontal form
inside that we have a development with
class form group and inside that we have
a label for password and that label is
two units wide and then a development
which is ten units wide inside the
development we have a textbox
to capture the password at the moment we
are not displaying this help text that
says strong password to display that I'm
going to use a span element with class
set to help block we use this class to
display the help text associated with a
form control and in this case the help
text is going to be strong password
let's save our changes and when we
reload this page we should see that help
text associated with the form control
now we want to style these form controls
for success validation state to achieve
that all we have to do is on the parent
development right here use has
success class let's save our changes and
when we reload this page notice now how
the controls are styled for success
validation state now let's discuss how
to style the form controls for warning
validation state for example if we type
in a weak password this is how we want
our form controls to be styled let's
look at this in action let's make a copy
of this form group that we have here and
the help text is going to say weak
password and instead of using hash
success class I'm going to use has one
in class let's save our changes and when
we reload this page notice now these
controls are styled for one in
validation state let's now discuss
styling form controls for error
validation State let's say for example
we have a form field that expects an
integer for example an age field like
this in his field
if we type alphabets instead of numbers
we want to style these form controls for
error validation state let's see how to
achieve this let's flip to visual studio
let's make a copy of this form group the
label should be age let's use input type
text instead of input type password the
help text below that should be invalid
age and now to style these controls for
error validation state instead of using
has one in class we are going to use has
error class let's save our changes and
when we reload this page notice now the
form controls are styled for error
validation state the colors that we get
depends on the bootstrap validation
class that we are using in addition to
these classes we can also use these
glyph icons with the three validation
States that we have let's see how to use
these icons with different validation
States so here is what we want to do
depending on the validation state we
want to display these different icons
these are glyph icons and you can find
these icons right here get bootstrap
com4 slash compound
with success validation state this is
the icon that we want to use with error
validation state this is the icon and
with warning validation state this is
the icon let's look at the steps
involved if you look at where we want
these icons we want them right inside
the form controls themselves
so immediately next to the input element
I'm going to use a span element and the
class for this is going to be the name
of the glyph icon with success
validation state we want to use glyph
icon glyph icon okay so this icon is
going to display that little tick mark
for us in addition to the glyph I can
name we also have to use a class here
and that is form control feedback class
and on this development right here which
has the form group and has success
classes we have to use another class and
that is has feedback class let's do
these changes for the other two
developments so on the second
development let's use has feedback class
on the third one as well and then let's
use this span element with this input
element so with warning validation state
we want to display a different icon and
that is glyph icon warning sign and
let's do the same thing with the last
development here so next to the age text
box let's face the span element and with
error validation state we want to use a
different icon and that is glyph I can
remove which is going to display that
little cross let's save our changes and
when we reload our page notice we get
the icons as expected
finally let's discuss styling input
groups here we have an input group
notice next to the text box there is a
dollar symbol appended to it so this
dollar symbol and this text box are
inside an input group styling input
groups is very similar to styling the
other form controls that we have seen so
far fur
let's create this input group so let's
flip to visual studio I'm going to place
this text box inside an input group
first let's create an input group to
create an input group I'm going to
create a development with class set to
input group and then let's move this
text box inside that development now to
this text box we want to append the
dollar symbol for that I'm going to use
span element and then the class for this
is going to be input group add-on and
what we want to append to this input
element is a dollar symbol so I'm going
to place the dollar symbol inside that
span element so this is going to give us
an input group consisting of this dollar
symbol and this text box and for
completeness I'm going to change this
label to income because we are
displaying a dollar and the placeholder
is going to say you are annual income
and let's get rid of the other
developments that we have here
let's save our changes and when we
reload the page notice we get an input
group that is styled for success
validation state now if you want to
style input groups for warning and error
validation States all you have to do is
use different classes and different
glyph icons thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
