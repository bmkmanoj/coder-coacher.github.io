am Frankie this is part 21 of asp.net
grid-view tutorial in this video we'll
discuss about enhancing grid view
editing interface using template feels
this is continuation to part 20 of the
asp.net grid view tutorial so please
watch part 20 before proceeding now by
default when editing data a textbox
control is rendered as the default
editing interface element for all bound
columns so if you recollect from part 20
of the asp.net grid view tutorial look
at this this employee ID name gender and
City columns all of them are actually
bound fields so if we flip this waveform
you know into the source mode look at
this employee ID name gender and city
all of them are actually bound for yours
so obviously when I put any of this row
in edit mode look at this for name
gender and City I'm getting textbox
controls as the editing interface
elements okay now for gender instead of
textbox I would actually like to have a
drop-down list because if I allow
textbox for the gender uses may type in
different values you know male female or
you know simply small case letters male
or some users may you and choose m or
capital letter m now I don't want to be
allowing users to basically enter all
these different variations for gender
instead I want to force users to select
one of the existing options within the
drop-down list male and female so
obviously we have to replace this text
box control with a drop-down list
control when this Rho render is in edit
mode and obviously to achieve that we
have to convert this bound field into a
template field so gender at the moment
is a bound fear so bound fields by
default you know use textbox controls as
their editing interface instead we want
drop-down lists so obviously we have to
convert this bound field into a template
fear and do that there are two ways we
can either you know change the HTML
directly here or we can use the designer
to auto generate HTML for us let's see
how to use the designer let's flip this
waveform to the design mode click on
this grid view
tasks button and then look at this you
have this link here edit columns click
on that link and then from the selected
fields look at this in selected fields
you
jealousy in our total five feels there
the first field is the command field
which is displaying that command but an
edit command button and then the rest
fields are the bound fields that display
employee ID name gender and City now we
want to convert gender into a template
field so I'm going to select that and
then click on this link and with this
field into a template field so this is
going to convert that bound field into a
template view let's click OK now let's
actually flip this waveform to the
source mode and see what happened to the
gender column so when I flip this
waveform to the source mode look at this
you know this bound feel the gender
bound field is actually now converted
into a template field and this template
field has two things within it edit item
template and item template okay so what
are these templates now item template is
actually used when the row is in non
editing mode so this row is not in edit
mode so that's when the grid we control
uses item template okay so in the item
template we are saying use label control
but whereas when the row is in edit mode
we are saying it use a text box control
so actually after we have converted you
know gender field you know from bound
gender from bound field into a template
field if you look at the HTML here you
know for items template we are using
label control but for edit item template
we are still using text box control so
obviously when I put any of this through
and edit mode it's still going to use
the text box control instead we actually
want to use a drop-down list control
when this rule is in edit mode okay so
obviously we want to replace this
control with a drop-down list control
okay again we can change that directly
in the HTML here or we can use the
designer let's see how to use the
designer and do it
so let's flip this waveform to the
design mode now remember we now have a
template field within the grid view
control which is gender column so since
we have a template field here look at
this when I click on this edit templates
link it will actually show us that
gender column which is a template area
and I get the opportunity to you know
modify the templates in different
templates that that can be present in a
template field so I can have an item
template edit item template in addition
to them we can also have alternating
item templates so what is alternating
item template every alternate row within
the grid view control and then we can
also have templates for header and
footer but for the purpose of this demo
we are just going to have an item
template and ATT item template look at
this item template I have a label
control whereas an edit item template I
have a text box control but what did we
decide we want to use a drop-down list
instead of a text box control so I'm
going to get rid of that one delete that
and then let's drag and drop a drop down
list control onto this you know edit
item template that's it now let's go
back to the grid view task and and edit
I mean template editing so at this time
if I flip the waveform to the source
mode look at what is there in edit item
template I just have drop-down list but
notice this drop-down list doesn't have
any list items so basically a drop-down
list is a collection of list item
objects but I don't have any list item
objects here okay so obviously now at
this time when we run this okay look at
this
item template as label control so the
genders of every employee is displayed
using label control but when I put the
row in edit mode remember we are using
the drop-down list and we don't have any
list item objects here nor we are
populating that dynamically so that's
why and empty drop-down list is
displayed here so instead of that we
want to have you know some options here
male female and along with them maybe I
want to have another option select the
gender basically to prompt the user to
select the gender okay so let's see how
to add those list items again those list
items can be added you know directly in
the HTML so if I want to add a list item
I can do that here so list item I can
specify text you know maybe text I want
it as select gender and then I want the
value as well so value is also going to
be select gender and then let's close
that so I can either do this or I can
use the designer to generate these list
items for me automatically so let's see
how to use the designer let's flip the
wave form to the design mode so let's go
back to edit templates and then I want
to edit edit item template so here is
the drop-down list go to the properties
of the drop-down
and then you have items of property
click on this ellipsis button that
should bring up the list item collection
editor by default I already have select
gender there in addition to that I want
male the value is also going to be male
and then I want female the value is also
going to be female click ok so now let's
actually end a template editing now
let's flip the waveform to the source
mode look at that in addition to select
gender
I have male and female now here we are
explicitly using the text and value
properties since text and value are same
I can either use you know this variation
of the HTML or simply use select gender
just like how we are using it for you
know male and female so I can do that as
well
alright now let's go ahead and run this
and look at this when the row is
rendered when the rows are rendered in
non editing mode all of them are you
know the genders are displayed using
label controls but when I put the ROO in
edit mode look at that now I have the
drop-down list as expected now notice
that there's a slight issue here for
example if you look at the gender of
Mary she is female but when I put the
rule in edit mode look at what is
selected in the drop-down list it's
saying select gender okay but I would
like to have female selected like this
when the row is in edit mode because
that's what is a gender and then if I
want to change it to male I'll simply
change it to male and then update it
okay so look at that
for example Mike is male but when I
click that you know instead of male it s
actually defaulting to the first list
item in the drop-down list so this is an
issue so how do we correct that to
correct that first let's actually
inspect how is the label control
displaying the actual gender look at
this label control it's using the bind
in a method whatever is the bind method
returning we are using that value as you
know as the value for the text property
okay so the spine method is retrieving
the column value gender and then binding
it to the text property similarly if you
want to have the gender selected in the
drop-down list by default then use
selected value property of the drop-down
lists
selected value is equal to now let's
actually copy this and use it as the
value for selected value property so
with that change let's go ahead and run
this now okay so look at this market
mail so edit that Meili selected in the
drop-down list and similarly Mary's
gender is female so May female is
selected now let's actually change May
this gender from female to male and see
if it works as expected
so employee I leave it through I know is
equal three successfully updated Mary's
gender is male let's actually check that
with the database so Mary's gender is
male as expected so we have seen how to
enhance the editing interface element
using template fields it's actually very
simple so if you notice you know all the
steps that we have done using the
designer all it has done basically is
convert that bound field into a template
field you know in the item template I'm
using label control whereas an edit item
template we are using a drop-down list
control now look at this this drop-down
list has these list items statically
defined on the page at design-time okay
in reality you may have you know
drop-down lists like cities drop-down
lists or departments drop-down lists etc
now if you want to dynamically load them
we simply use maybe another data access
layer method which retrieves the data
and bind it to the drop-down list
probably we'll talk about that in a
later video session all right on this
