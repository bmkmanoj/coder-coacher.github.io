this video we'll discuss the bootstrap
progress bar component progress bars are
used for showing the progress of tasks
such as downloading a file software
installation etc let's now look at an
example of creating a progress bar that
looks like this let's flip to shell
studio to create a progress bar we
create a development with its class set
to progress inside this development I am
going to create another development with
its class set to progress bar let's save
our changes
when we reload this page notice we get
the progress bar as expected but at the
moment we are not reporting any progress
at all let's say for example we want to
report 80% progress completed to do that
on this inner development we are going
to include the style attribute and set
width style to 80% because that is what
is the progress that we want to report
so when we reload this page notice now
we get a progress bar with 80% complete
we are not displaying the percentage
value to display the percentage value
include that value in the inner
development when we reload this page we
should have the percentage value
displayed as well now at the moment we
have a progress bar with solid
background color now if you want a
striped progress bar then in addition to
the progress bar class use progress bar
striped class this is going to give us
the striped progress bar there may be
times when we want to display low
percentage completed values like 0% 1%
etc now let's say for example we want to
display 1% complete so for that I'm
going to set width to 1% and the value
here is also going to be 1% when we
reload this page notice the 1% is not
displayed properly to make sure these
low percentage values are displayed
properly we will have to include min
width style as well so I am going to set
minimum width
20 pixels this is going to ensure that
the low percentage values are also
displayed properly as expected here is
the HTML for that
now let's discuss creating progress bars
with different color schemes as you can
see here to create progress bars with
different color schemes we use the
different contextual step glasses that
are available we have progress bar
success progress bar info progress bar
warning and progress bar danger let's
use those contextual state classes now
let's flip to visual studio so instead
of using progress bars stripe I'm going
to use progress bar success let's change
the percentage to 60% let's also change
the value to 60% and let's make three
more copies of this progress bar and
then we will change the contextual state
glasses
so on the first progress bar we are
using progress bar success here let's
use progress bar info progress bar
warning and finally progress bar danger
let's see what changes when we reload
this page notice we get progress bars
with different color schemes as expected
next let's discuss creating striped
progress bars with different color
schemes as you can see here to create
stripe to previous bars with different
color schemes all we have to do is use
progress bar stripe to class in addition
to the contextual state classes that we
have here so let's use this class on all
the other progress bars as well so let's
paste it on all the three progress bars
let's save our changes when we reload
our page notice we get striped progress
bars with different color schemes as
expected now let's discuss how to
animate these progress bars to create
animated striped progress bars just use
the active class let's paste this back
to class
the rest of the progress bars as well
now when we reload this page notice we
get animated striped progress bars
now let's discuss creating a stacked
progress bar as you can see here let's
flip to shoot studio to create stack the
progress bar all we need to do is place
all these progress bars inside a single
development with class progress so I'm
going to delete you know this closing
div and this opening div here similarly
I'm going to delete these two as well
and I'm going to delete this last device
well because in order to act progress
bar we are going to have three progress
bars stacked on top of each other and
I'm also going to change the percentage
here to 25 I am going to do that for all
the three and then let's say we are
shopping for some product so we have
already logged in so log in complete and
we are provided shipping details as well
so shipping is also complete and I have
also made payment so payment is also
complete the only step that is pending
is in our completion so let's save our
changes now when we reload this page
notice we get a stacked progress bar
with log and shipping and payment
complete you know the final step which
is completing the processes what is
pending so we can create a stacked
through this bar like this just by
placing all the progress bars within a
single development with class set to
progress now if you do not want the
animation then all you need to do is
remove the active class here so that's
going to remove the animation from the
stack the progress bar so when we reload
this page we will not have the animation
and similarly if you don't want the
stripes remove the progress bar striped
class again let's do that for all the
three progress bars that we have
so now when we reload our page notice we
don't have the stripes anymore thank you
for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
