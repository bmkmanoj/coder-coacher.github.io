tutorial in this video and in a few
upcoming videos we'll discuss
step-by-step how to implement
token-based authentication in asp.net
web api using open middleware and
identity framework of n stands for open
web interface for dotnet will discuss
more about event middleware in a later
video so here is what we want to do we
are going to make use of this employees
table on the left in this demo we want
to retrieve data from this table and
display it on a web page only for
authenticated users as you can see right
here in addition we also want to provide
a registration page using which new
users can register with our site once
registered they can use those registered
credentials to login to our site and see
the employees data our registration page
should look like this we need three
pieces of information from a new user to
register with our site we need their
email address password and confirm
password now let's try to register using
this email address good when Curt at
gmail.com let's provide a password and
confirm password
let's click the register button notice
we are getting a validation error I've
already registered using this email
address and that's the reason why we are
getting this error could win today at
gmail.com is already taken we can
dismiss this validation error by
clicking this little cross right here
now if I use a different email address
could make it 1-0
at gmail.com and when I click register
notice we get registration successful
when I click Clues on this it
automatically redirects me the login
page and now I can use the email address
using which I have just registered and
login to our site so now I am redirected
to data dot HTML the system knows I am
logged in and that's the reason why it
displays this log off button here we
have load employees button when I click
on this button we get the data from the
employees table now
this point if I navigate to register dot
HTML and then if I come back to data dot
HTML it still knows I'm logged in and it
takes me to the data page we have the
log of button we also have the load
employees button now when I click log
off I am logged off and it automatically
redirects me to the login page at this
point if I try to go to data dot HTML
page look at that it automatically
redirects me to the login page because I
am not logged in and if I try to provide
an invalid username and password it
displays a validation error the username
or password is incorrect so we need to
implement these three pages registration
page login page and data page now we are
going to make use of event middleware
and identity framework to achieve this
in addition to open middle bear and
identity framework we'll be using a few
other technologies will be using asp.net
Web API ad or dotnet entity framework
sequel server bootstrap and jQuery if
you're new to any of these technologies
please watch the respect to playlist
from our YouTube channel and here is the
link to our YouTube channel where you
can find all the playlist
I'll have this link available in the
description of this video so the first
step here is to create the employee's
table and populate it with test data I
have the sequel script for that right
here
I've already executed the script I'll
have it available on my blog in case you
need it so when we select data from the
employees table we get all the test data
the next step is to create the web api
service which is going to retrieve data
from this employee's table so let's flip
to visual studio now in visual studio
click on file new project under visual
c-sharp select web asp.net web
application and let's name our project
employee service click OK on the screen
web api and set authentication to
individual user accounts if this is set
to anything else click change
authentication button this shows us all
the different authentication options
that we have so make sure you select
individual user accounts and click OK
the individual user accounts option uses
membership database the new users that
we register with our application will be
stored in that membership database we'll
discuss more about the membership
database in a later video in this series
so at this point click ok this is going
to take a few seconds to create our Web
API project there we go the project is
created now let's add a 2.8 entity data
model which is going to retrieve data
from the employees table so let's right
click on our employee service project
add new item select data area dotted
entity data model let's name our data
model employee data model click Add we
want to generate the model from the
database so select entity framework
designer from database and click Next we
want a new connection so let's click the
new connection button we will be
connecting to sequel server on my local
machine so the server name is going to
be dot and then from this drop-down list
select employee DB database which has
got our employees table and let's click
on test connection test connection
succeeded click OK and now let's click
Next this screen is going to show us all
the tables views and stored procedures
that we have in our employee DB database
so we want this employees table click
finish this is going to generate the ato
dotnet entity data model for us the next
step is to add employees controller so
let's right click on the controllers
folder add controller select empty Web
API - controller and then click Add
let's name our controller employees
controller
and click Add this is going to add
employees controller with our employees
controller we are going to have a single
public method which is going to return
us I enumerable of employee objects now
if you are wondering where this employee
object is coming from it's coming from
our ato dotnet entity framework the
employee data model that we have just
created has got the employee entity
right here so we are returning I
enumerable of employee objects from this
method this method is going to respond
to a get request so let's name this get
now we are going to create an instance
of employee DB entities so this is the
database context class which is going to
help us connect to the database and
retrieve employee entities so let's
create an instance of this class using
employee DB entities let's call this
entities equals new employee DB entities
then all we want to do here is return
the list of employee objects let's run
our project now by pressing ctrl f5 we
are on the home page right now let's
navigate to slash API slash employees
notice we see the list of employees at
the moment this request is not
authenticated but we are still able to
see the list of employees that's not
what we want we want only the
authenticated users to be able to see
the list of employees so let's slip to
visual studio and decorate our employees
controller with authorized attribute
let's give our solution a build and when
we reload this page notice we get
authorization has been denied for this
request since the employees controller
is decorated with authorized attribute
all the actions within this employees
controller need to be authenticated
otherwise we get this four zero one
error
authorization has been denied for this
request in our next video we'll discuss
implementing new user registration page
once a user has registered with our
application he will be able to log in
and view the employees data thank you
for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
