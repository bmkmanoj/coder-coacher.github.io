in this video we'll understand the
problem of global namespace pollution in
JavaScript with an example when working
with JavaScript and large projects
during your code review you might hear
senior developers saying this JavaScript
code causes the global scope to be
polluted let's understand what we mean
by global namespace pollution in this
video and in our next video we'll
discuss how to write JavaScript code in
such a way that it does not cause global
namespace pollution let's say we have
two teams team a and Team B working on a
large project whatever functions team a
develops they add their functions to
this javascript file team a dorje s
similarly team b add their functions to
team b gs file let's go ahead and add
two JavaScript files to a project so add
a new item we want to add a J script
file and let's call this team a dorje s
and similarly let's add another
JavaScript file and let's name this team
b dot j s now let's say team a has
created a customer function and this
function is going to have two parameters
first-name and lastname so this is going
to be our customer constructor function
which will construct a customer object
for us and we want the customer object
to have two properties first-name and we
want to initialize that with a parameter
that is being passed to this constructor
function so this dot lastname equals
plus name parameter and we also want to
have a function in this customer
constructor function which is going to
return us the full name of the customer
so this dot get full name is going to be
the function and all we want this
function to do is return the first name
by concatenating that to a single space
and concatenating that in turn to last
name so here we have got a very simple
customer constructor function that has
two parameters and get full name is
going to give us the full name of the
customer now let's say Team B has also
developed a function and they ended up
giving that function the same name that
is customer but what these guys have
done is they've included three
parameters instead of two so middle name
first name middle name and last name and
let's have middle name property and
let's initialize that with the parameter
that is passed to the function and thus
get full name is going to append first
name to space and that in turn will be
appended to middle a that appended to
space and to that be up in the last name
so at the moment we've got two customer
functions two functions with the same
name one customer function takes two
parameters the other one takes three
parameters now on this HTML page let's
include the HTML let's include the head
section with an HTML and let's include a
script section and let's reference
teammate GS file and let's also
reference team bj s within the body
section let's include it development
let's give it an ID let's actually call
this result div and let's include
another script section in the body
section
document dot get element by ID let's get
the ID of the development which is
result there and let's set the inner
HTML of this div to let's create an
instance of the customer object now we
have two customer functions one has two
parameters and the other one has three
parameters now our intention here is to
actually use the customer constructor
function which has two parameters
because we are just going to pass first
name and last name so I'm going to pass
the first name as Tom and last name as
grower and the customer object has got
get full name method so let's call that
- written as the full name of the
customer okay so when we run this we
expect it to print the customer full
name within the development that is Tom
grower so let's go ahead save these
changes and reload the page now look at
this we get Tom grower undefined why is
that that's basically because here this
customer function is actually calling
the one that has three parameters not
the one which has two parameters why is
that because if you look at our code
here I notice that we are referencing
both the script files and our intention
here is to actually use the customer
function which has two parameters
because team a dot J is another script
file that Lee referenced here has got
that function with two parameters so why
is it not able to use that that's
because in JavaScript we don't have the
concept of function overloading you
cannot have two functions in the same
namespace
now what is happening here is you know
when team a dot J's script file is
loaded you know this customer function
this gets added to the global scope
in JavaScript the global object is the
vendor object okay so to that global
namespace the customer function will be
added with two parameters and then after
that team b dot JS file is loaded and if
you look at team b door chairs this also
has got customer function but with three
parameters so now if you declare two
functions with the same name in the same
scope then the function that you have
defined later which in this case is
customer function with three parameters
this one is going to override the one
that we have added earlier because in
the same global namespace you cannot
have two functions are two variables
with the same name it's going to cause
name collision that's why one will
overwrite the other because in
JavaScript we don't have the concept of
function overloading so here we have
already polluted the global scope now
you may be wondering why didn't it
happen the other way around why don't
the customer constructor function with
two parameters override the customer
constructor function with three
parameters that depends on the order in
which the scripts are loaded now if I
load Team B first and then team a next
then you know the one with two
parameters will overwrite the one with
three parameters okay depending on the
order in which the script files are
loaded
you know the respective function which
is loaded earlier that will be
overwritten by the one which is loaded
later okay
so let's actually look at this in action
so if you go to this browser window so
at the moment I'm using Google Chrome
now when I press f12 this will launch
the developer tools in Google Chrome and
then here we have the console vendor so
within the console window the global you
know we know that in JavaScript the
global object is window object so when I
say vendor dot we can actually see the
customer function and look at this when
I press ENTER it only knows about the
customer function which has three
parameters
okay now actually
you can actually see what are all the
keys that are present within the global
object you know when I type keys of
vendor notice that these are all the
keys that are already present in the
global scope top vendor location etc and
within that global scope we also have
this customer function okay so we only
have the customer function which has
three parameters right now let's
actually go back and reverse the order
in which the scripts are loaded so I'm
going to take this one and you know
paste it on the top so team B's loaded
first and team a is loaded next team
bead or days you know what is that going
to do that's going to first load the
customer constructor function with three
parameters and that function will be
added to the global scope right so at
the moment you know the browser will
know about that function okay but
immediately we are loading teammate or
J's as well and here we are adding the
customer function to the same scope so
what is this going to do it's going to
override the one which is added earlier
so the browser will know only about
customer function which has two
parameters so let's save these changes
in the HTML page so we're loading Team B
first and then team a and team a has the
customer function with two parameters
so now let's reload this page now first
of all notice that it works as expected
calling the customer function which has
two parameters now if we go to keys of
vendor so it knows about the customer
object now when we say window dot
customer look at that now it knows about
the customer function which has two
parameters okay so in JavaScript when
you define a variable or function with
the same name you know it does not raise
errors like c-sharp or Java you know it
simply overwrites the one that you have
created
Leigha so polluting global namespace
causes name collision this is especially
true in large projects where you know
you may be using several JavaScript
libraries that are developed both
internally as well as third-party
libraries that's why it's very important
not to add everything to the global
namespace if someone else use the same
variable a function name it can lead to
name collision in our next video we'll
discuss how to write JavaScript code in
such a way that it does not cause global
namespace pollution thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
