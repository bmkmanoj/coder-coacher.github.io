your instructor for this online tutorial
on learning Java I love teaching and my
primary goal is to empower you all by
supplying the experience and knowledge
on this subject you will see that
composing a program will be very natural
and satisfying experience this tutorial
is essentially for folks who want to
dive into the world of programming and
have started with Java if you like this
course please do not forget to like and
subscribe our channel to get regular
updates in this tutorial we will first
discuss water programming languages and
what is sour then we will discuss
history of Java and how it stands among
other programming languages here we will
cover both an evolution of Java we will
also see how Java is comparable with
other programming languages finally we
shall see how to set up our machine for
Java programming after this tutorial you
should feel excited about learning more
and more Java without further ado let's
get started we will be begin to talk
about Java let us understand what is a
programming language a programming
language defines the way to communicate
with the computer it is used to make a
computer perform something by providing
it some instructions every programming
language has its own syntax and
constructs which are used to provide
programs or instructions to the computer
when one has understood the notation and
constructs of a programming language he
or she can start writing programs in
that language it is like once I learn
Tamil and words of German language I can
start communicating in that language
programming languages are low level or
high level in nature a high level
programming language is easier to
understand and user-friendly on the
other hand low level programming
languages are closer to computer
hardware and are useful for writing
operating systems and form where there
are various programming paradigms you
will hear about something like
procedural programming object-oriented
programming functional programming they
are simply different approaches to solve
the problems in a programming language
for now let's move on to understand what
is serve off now July's considered as
both a programming language and a
platform Java programming language is a
high-level object-oriented language and
has a particular syntax and its own
style the Java 8 it is also capable of
creating functional programs for example
when you use our six Java 7 Java 9 of
these all are versions of a programming
language Java platform is a particular
environment in which Java programming
language applications run for example
Java SE Standard Edition
Java ME micro Edition Java EE Enterprise
Edition Java affects the all our various
Java platforms so let's talk about how
to Java come into place and how did it
evolve will did tawa was simpler and
platform independent alternative to C++
it it was initially developed by James
cufflink when he was modifying C++ code
to make it suitable for set-top-box
the language he was initially called as
oke interestingly because there was the
oak tree in front of the developers
window but later Suns marketing
department named a Java Sun Microsystems
released the first public implementation
of Java 1.2 in 1995 as of now the latest
stable version is tower 8 update 121
Oracle Corporation is currently the
owner of our language right now it is
working on Java 9 which will be released
in July 2017 open JDK is another notable
Java implementation which is licensed
under GNU GPL license now another
interesting point that you should
consider now is that learning Java will
help you in creating Android
applications also because Java is the
key pillar of Android and which is an
open source mobile operating system now
let me ask one thing how popular is Java
in order to understand the popularity of
Java
we can look for our base school now this
is a software quality company that
tracks the evolution and popularity of
programming languages and guess what
Java is number one in the market during
the last two decades Java has maintained
its status as one of the most popular
programming languages for everything
from programming games to creating
mission-critical applications such as
those for trading on Wall Street or
controlling master overs because the
pool of Java developers is huge
large and small corporations like to use
Java for the development of new projects
if you decide to leave the project for
whatsoever reason it is not too
difficult to find another server
programmer to replace you now that we
move that we are on right track we
should quickly get into action and set
up our environment to start programming
in Java we shall learn how to install
Java on an operating system it's pretty
easy all you have to do is go to google
and search Oracle's our downloads the
first link will take you to Oracle Java
C downloads page where you can download
the JDK and JRE based on your operating
system after accept
the terms and conditions you might
wonder what is JDK and JRE JDK is the
Java development kit which comes with
the developer tools along with the JRE
that is our in time engine also we might
code Java programs on command line as
well as on an IDE called eclipse we
should also see Eclipse installation in
later part of this tutorial as I said we
might write code programs on command
line in some situations in order to
recognize service or valid command we
have to set some variables in the
operating system environment on windows
we might have to set path variable to
include the JDK and JRE binary locations
similarly for using build tools like me
one you might have to set Java home as
well let's see all this in action to
understand better when you search on
Oracle's our downloads on Google the
first link takes you to the Oracle Java
downloads page here you see that there
is an option for JDK download when you
click it it takes you to another page
where you can accept the license
agreement and choose the appropriate
download option based on your operating
system I work on Windows with 64-bit OS
so I am selecting JDK 8 - 1 - 1 Windows
xxt volt 6 Exe once I click on this I
get the location to download since I
have already downloaded this and
executed this executable Java is already
downloaded and it installed on my system
let's the after installation where does
JDK binaries life for this you shall go
to C Drive Program Files Java and you
shall see two folders jdk 1.8
and JRE 1.8 both these folders have the
binary folder again this binary folder
contains the necessary executables in
order to make these executables
available on the command window we might
have to set some path variables for this
go to control panel go to system then
move to advanced system settings and
click on environment variables here you
shall see system variables and one of
the most useful system variable is path
click on back and double-click you shall
see a list of locations put in the path
variable you can see the last three
lines where I have put the GDK 1.8 and
JRE 1.8 binary folders as the available
locations once you do this tchau should
be successfully available on the command
line as well let's serious on command
prompt when I write Java - version I get
to see that Java is recognized command
also you will work in later tutorials
with Java compiler known as Java C even
that should be recognized command once
we have installed Java and set the path
variables what we should do next is we
should also install Eclipse IDE on our
operating system for this again go to
eclipse downloads page on google and
then once you are available on this site
then click on Eclipse IDE for Java
Enterprise Edition developers once you
click on this you will have option to
download multiple packages since this is
windows 64-bit OS I click on this link
and my download start gets started once
you click on download Java je nyan gets
downloaded
now this is essentially a zip file as
soon as this reply zip file gets
downloaded users have to extract this to
your favorite location and then create
shortcut for the Eclipse toward Exe file
in the extract folder after this you are
all set with installing Java and also
installing eclipse on your operating
system so in this tutorial we learnt
about Java we discussed how it came into
existence we learnt about Java
popularity and why should we learn this
we also install Java on our operating
system and also we set up an IDE for our
complex programs I hope you like this
session if you like this please
