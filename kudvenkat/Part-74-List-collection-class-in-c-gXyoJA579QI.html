video we'll discuss list collection
class in c-sharp list is one of the
generate collection classes present in
system dot collection or generic
namespace I've listed a few of the
Gendry collection classes here we
discussed a dictionary in part 72 and 73
in this video we'll discuss list
collection class a list class can be
used to create a collection of any type
for example we can create a list of
integers strings decimals and even
complex types like customers employees
the objects that are stored in the list
can then be accessed by their index
unlike arrays lists can grow in size
automatically this class also provide
methods to search sort and manipulate
lists let's look at all of these in
action let's flip to visual studio so
we'll be using this customer class for
this demo there's a very simple class
with three auto implemented properties
and then if you look in the main method
we have created three instances of this
customer class first of all let's go
ahead and create a customer array and
let's call this customers and let's set
the initial size of the array to two
which means we can use this array to
store two customer objects so let's say
customer of zero is customer one and let
store customer two in customers of one
location now let's also try to store in
a third customer so customer three in
customers of two location so while the
size of the array is - we are trying to
store a third object in this array let's
compile this
control shift to be to build the
solution and look at this build
succeeded we don't get any compiler
error but let me go ahead and run this
and see what's going to happen look at
that we get an exception at runtime
while the size of the array is - we are
trying to store a third object in the
array so arrays doesn't grow in size
automatically
and that's the reason why we have this
error index out of range exception but
lists grow in size automatically let's
look at them in action so to create a
list we use the list keyword and then we
need to specify the type of the list so
what type of data are you going to store
in this list is it going to be an
integer list or is it going to be a
string list or any other simple data
type we can also create a list of
complex tides so here we have a customer
class so I want to create a list of type
customer and let's call this maybe
customers and then look at this there
are several overloaded constructors to
create a list okay the first one doesn't
take any parameters but then if you look
at the second one there is an integer
parameter and it says capacity so this
is the parameter that we can use to set
the initial capacity that is the initial
size now let's set the size of this list
to 2 and then let's go ahead and add a
customer object to this list and to add
a customer object to this list we use
add method since the list is of type
customer you can only add a customer
object so let's add a customer one
object and in a similar fashion let's go
ahead and add customer two and customer
3 look at that the initial size is 2 but
we are trying to add a third customer as
well let's build this control shift B
look at that build it succeeded and let
me go ahead and run this by pressing
ctrl f5 so we didn't get a compiler
error let's run this and we don't have
an exception either at runtime
that's because lists grow in size
automatically okay so while the initial
size is 2 we are adding a third element
so the size is automatically bumped up
okay so lists grow in size automatically
but arrays doesn't ok now we have some
items stored in the list and to retrieve
an item from the list we do that by its
index so I have customers list here now
let's say I want to retrieve the first
item from the list and to do that I use
an in
X so I passed the index of the item so
I'm going to pass 0 now these index are
zero based so they start at zero so if I
want the first element I pass the index
0 if I want the second element we will
pass the index as 1 so look at this what
is this you know collection returning
back it is returning a customer back so
let's go ahead and store that in a
variable of type customer so maybe let's
call it C okay so we have the customer
object and let's go ahead and print the
details of you know the customer so
console dot write line and obviously
customer class has got ID property name
and salary so let's go ahead and plant
all of them
so the object reference variable is C so
C dot ID and similarly C dot name and
then finally C dot salary okay so let's
go ahead and run this and see if we get
the object that is present at the zero
at index look at that we get the first
object and similarly if you want the
second object you pass the index s1 okay
now is it possible to iterate through
all the items within this collection
absolutely we can either use a for loop
or a for each loop let's look at using a
for loop let's say I want to loop
through each object within the
collection and then print the respective
customer detail so I can use a for each
loop so for each customer and maybe
let's call the C n what is the name of
the collection customers so let's pass
that and then we simply print the
respective customer ID name and salary
let me go ahead and run this and see if
we get the output look at that we get
all the three customer objects okay now
can we use for loop absolutely we can
use a for loop as well so let's see how
to use a for loop so when I use a for
loop then we have to you know tell it
how many times we want to loop through
so let's say for int I is equal to 0 so
we need to start at 0 remember you know
the in it's 0 index based okay so I is
equal to 0 I less than the length of
this customer's collection okay
so customers dot count okay so this
property is going to give us the total
number of elements within the collection
and then I plus plus and here
let's say customer C equals where do we
need to get the customer object from
from the customers collection so
customers off and then we can pass I is
looping through from 0 till the number
of elements within that collection so
let's go ahead and run this and see if
it works as expected
look at that it displays the details of
the customers now what is going to
happen if you by mistake include less
than or equal to okay let me run this
and see what's going to happen look at
that all the three employees details are
printed but then I also have index was
out of range that's basically because
what is the what is the count property
going to return the count property is
going to return the total number of
items in that collection so what's the
total number of items it's three and
then we are starting at zero so zero to
three is four we are trying to look an
element in the fourth location of this
collection which we don't have that's
why we have that exception index um was
out of range okay so that's why anytime
you want to loop through all the items
in the collection use a for each loop
instead of a for loop you might run into
errors like this all right now all
collections in this namespace I mean all
the generic collections that are present
in systems or collections store generate
they are strongly typed so including
this list class so what do we mean by
when we say list class is strongly typed
now that means this is a list of type
customer which means you can only add
objects of type customer if you try to
add an object of a different type let's
say Here I am trying to add maybe an
integer okay will it compile no look at
that immediately I have a red that
squiggly we cannot add an object of a
different type to this collection
because this object is of type customer
so you can add to this list only a
customer object or any object that has
in here
from the customer class let me explain
what I mean so I can add a customer
object to this list without any problem
but then if I have a class that is
deriving from that customer class let's
go ahead and create another class here
let's say public class maybe let's call
the savings customer and this class is
inheriting from customer class okay and
let's go ahead and create an instance of
that class here let's call the savings
customer and let's call it SC equals new
saving customer now can I add this
object to this collection absolutely
because this class is inheriting from
customer class so we can add that as an
inherited type so if I say customers
don't add savings customer object and if
I compile this look at that I do not get
an exception okay now if this class
doesn't inherit from that class you know
from the customer class then these two
classes are unrelated look at that the
moment I have removed that inheritance
relationship we immediately have it
reads quickly okay so that's what means
when we say you know these classes these
generate collection classes are strongly
tied okay
all right now is it possible to insert
an object at a specific location
absolutely let's say for example you
know we have already added customer one
customer two and customer three to this
collection now I want to insert another
customer I mean the same customer three
object within the first location that is
at the zero at index position is it
possible absolutely and how do you do
that we have a function called insert so
we can use this function to insert an
object at a specific location because if
I use add function it's going to add you
know customer for object in you know
fourth location I mean in the third
index position of this collection class
but let's say my requirement is to push
an object at zero
at position and to do that you can use
insert not only zero at position you can
insert it and at any position that you
want so if you look at this function you
can specify the index position at which
you want to insert the object let's say
I want to insert it at zero at position
I pass zero as the index and then let's
pass the customer three object so now
this customer three object is present in
two locations at the zero at position
and at the last position which is third
index position okay so when we insert it
at zero at the position it's going to
push the rest of the objects further
down in the collection okay let's
actually use a for loop and then print
these details a for each loop and then
loop through each object and see what we
get back so for each customer let's say
see in our customers collection so at
this point we should be we should be
getting four objects back because we
have just inserted customer three object
at that location
so let's simply print out the ID of the
customer so that we'll know look at that
v1 one nine is the third customer object
customer three has got an ID of one one
nine and that's what we see here at at
the first location and at the last
location so this object will be present
at the last index position whereas this
will be present at the first index
position okay now is it possible to
programmatically retrieve the index of a
specific object within that list
absolutely again we have another
function called index off so let's use
that function so let's say I want to
find the index of this customer three
object okay
now let's use index off a function and
then obviously we need to pass the
customer object so let's get rid of this
code right here and let's pass our
customer three object now look at that
when we pass customer three object here
the index of this
I mean if you look at this customer
three object it's present at two
different locations within that list its
present at this zero at location and
that one two and three third location
so which index will I get will I get the
0th index or the third index let's look
at that let me run this look at that
let's actually use console dot write
line to print that index number so
console dot readline and that should
print the index so let me run this now
look at that by default I get the zero
at index you know the first element that
matches you know the index of that
element will be returned from the
collection okay now if you want
Dyl you know this index then there are
several overloaded versions of this
index off function so the first one the
first parameter is obviously the object
that you want to look up in the
collection the next parameter is the
position that you want to start
searching from so let's say I want the
index of this customer three object then
I know at 0th position there is a
customer three object already so let's
start at position one okay so that
started this index within the collection
so now if we run this we should get the
index of this customer three object look
at that we get that this customer in
customer three object index position is
three so we get that now now there is
another overloaded version you can also
specify the number of items to look so
from this first index okay from in from
position one how many elements do I want
to look you can give that count let's
say if I give two so from position 1 so
0 1 from this position I want to only
look up two items and within those two
items I don't have customer 3 object so
what output am I going to get now you
will get minus 1 meaning the item is not
found within within that range of
elements within that list okay now on
the other hand if we pass 3 so third
element is
basically the element that is pleasant
from first position third position we
have this customer three object so now
we should get the index what is going to
happen if I pass for now do we have five
objects here we don't that's why it's
going to throw an exception so we get
you know an exception their argument out
of range exception all right and there
are several other methods that this list
class exposes we'll discuss them in our
next video session that's it for today
thank you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
