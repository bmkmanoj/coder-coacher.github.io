in this video we'll discuss arrays in
JavaScript arrays are collections and
are zero indexed this means the first
element is present at index position 0
and the last element is present at index
position array object at length minus 1
length property of the earlier object
returns the size of the array let's look
at few examples notice in example 1 we
have square brackets after the equal to
symbol this square brackets indicates
that this variable mtra is an array
object since we don't have any elements
within this array length property is
going to return 0 let's quickly look at
this in action I have this exact same
code already typed within visual studio
so when we run this we should get 0 as
the output there we go there are several
ways to create an array in this example
one we're using the square bracket
syntax to create a array in example 2
notice that we are using the array
constructor to create an array and to
the constructor we are passing number 10
so in this case we are instructing to
create an array with size 10 so calling
length property on this my array object
returns 10 let's look at this in action
so instead of using this square brackets
index to create an array I'm going to
use array constructor and to it let's
pass 10 so in this case this empty re
object will have size of 10 so length
property should return 10 there we go
now let's see how to retrieve the first
and last elements from the array using
the array index let's name this array
myarray and let's use square bracket
syntax to create the array and I want
this array to include three elements
that is 10 20 and 30
now arrays are zero indexed meaning the
first element is at index position zero
second element is at index position one
and third element is at index position
two so in this case the first element is
at index position zero and the last
element is at index position two and the
length of this array is three so we can
say that the last element within this
array is present at 3 minus 1 that is
index position 2 that is the length of
the are a minus 1 so let's see how to
retrieve the first and last element
let's actually write those elements to
the document object using the write
method of the document object so what we
want to do is print this little text
first element and then to this we want
to append whatever is the first element
within that my array object so we want
to retrieve the element that is present
at index position 0 and then let's
append HTML break
now we also want the last element so
last element equals my array of index
position - so at index position - we
have number 30 now in this case we are
hard-coding the index position of the
last element we can either do that or we
can use the length property of the array
object and then subtract one from that
because length property is going to
return 3 3 minus 1 is 2 and that my
array of two we have the last element so
let's run this and see if we get the
first element and last element first
element should be 10 last element should
be 30 now let's see different ways of
populating an array in JavaScript first
let's look at you know declaring an
array first and then populating it using
the array index so here notice that we
are first creating this my array and
within the square brackets we don't have
any element so technically this array is
an empty array and then we are using the
index position of the array to populate
it with values so at index position 0 we
have number 10 index position 1 we have
20 and index position 2 we have 30 and
finally we are passing that array to
this alert method so we get this output
10 comma 20 comma 30 so let's quickly
look at this in action so where my array
we want to create an empty re first and
then we want to use the index positions
to initialize it so my array of 0 10 so
at index position 0 we want to store 10
and at index position 1 we want to store
20 and that index position 2 we want to
store 30 finally let's pass this array
object to alert function and when we run
this we should get 10 comma 20 comma 30
that is the contents of that array
so in this case we are first declaring
an array and then we are using the index
positions to populate it we can also
declare and populate the array at the
same time so here I can directly pass 10
comma 20 comma 30 to this array object
so in this case we are declaring and
populating at the same time now when we
run this we get a same output that is 10
comma 20 comma 30 there we go so in both
of these examples by using the square
bracket syntax to create and populate
the array now another way is to use the
array constructor itself so here by
using the array constructor and passing
3 so here we are creating an array with
size 3 and again we are using the index
positions to populate it with values and
we are passing that array to the alert
function so let's look at that in action
so instead of using the square bracket
syntax let's use the array constructor
so new array and this 3 is going to
instruct to create an array with size 3
and then my array of 0 equals 10
my array of 1 equals 20 and my array of
2 equals 30 and finally we are passing
my array to the alert function
so we should get then comma 20 comma 30
so if you are using the array
constructor here now again when we use
the array constructor we can a the first
declare the array and then populate that
array with values using the index
positions or we can declare and populate
it in a single line like this so 10
comma 20 comma 30 so in this case it's
going to automatically create an array
with size 3 and populate it with these 3
values 10 comma 20 comma 30 so when we
run this we should still get the same
output 10 comma 20 comma 30 an important
point to keep in mind here is that when
we pass a single numeric value to the
array constructor in that case we are
instructing it to create an array with
that size so here we are passing 3 so
here we are instructing to create an
array with size 3 now if we pass more
than one number then the constructor is
automatically going to assume those are
the values you know to be present within
the array so if you pass a single value
then that will be used to construct an
array with that as the size if you pass
more than one number then those will be
used as elements within the array now
let's see how to populate an array using
a for loop so if you look at the example
right here we have a variable even
numbers array and this is an array
object because we have that square
brackets after the equal to symbol and
notice that here you using a for loop
arrays are zero indexed so we are
starting from 0 going to 5 and then
notice what we are doing within the body
of the for loop so I first will be 0 so
0 equals 0 into 2 so at index position 0
we will have 0 and at index position 1
we will have 1 into 2 that is 2 and that
index position 2 we will have 4 so we
are multiplying the value of I
by two every time and storing that
within the height index position and
then finally we are passing that even
numbers are a to the alert function so
we should get even numbers from zero to
ten let's look at this in action so
let's call this my even numbers array
and then let's use a for loop so for VAR
i equals zero because the array index
starts at zero I less than or equal to 5
I plus plus my even numbers array or Phi
equals I into two and then finally to
the alert function let's pass my even
numbers high so when we run this we
should get even numbers starting from
zero till 10 so in this case we are just
using the for loop to populate the array
now let's see how we can use for loop to
retrieve elements that are present
within the array so for where I is equal
to zero I less than
my even numbers are a dot length I plus
plus let's actually write the value of
the array I mean the value that is
present at each index position within
the array to the document object so my
even numbers array of I and two that
lets up an HTML break so that we get
each number on a separate line so first
I value will be zero so my even numbers
of zero will return the value that is
pleasant at index position zero and then
you know it's going to increment the
value by one so at index position one we
have 2 4 6 8 and 10 so when we run this
we should get numbers 0 till 10 thank
you for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
