tutorial in this video we'll discuss the
basics of JavaScript if you are already
familiar with the basics then you may
skip this video in this video we'll
discuss if JavaScript is case-sensitive
comments and data types in Java Script
East JavaScript case-sensitive yes
javascript is case sensitive programming
language variable names keywords methods
object properties and even handlers all
are case sensitive here we have two
examples notice that within example one
were using alert function and all the
letters within the function name or
small letters so this is going to work
as expected if you look at example two
notice that within the alert function
letter a is capitalized
now this alert function is different
from this alert JavaScript only knows
about this alert function with all small
letters within its name it doesn't know
anything about you know alert function
with capital letter a so this example is
not going to work as expected it is
going to throw not defined error and if
you want to see that JavaScript error
plus f12 K this f12 key is going to work
with all the three browsers that is
chrome ie and Firefox let's look at this
quickly in action let's flip to visual
studio so here we are using the alert
function with all small letters when we
run this as you might expect JavaScript
basics tutorial should be displayed in
an alert box now let's change it to use
capital letter a and let's save these
changes and let's reload this waveform
notice that the alert box is not
displayed and if you want to look at the
JavaScript error plus f2l key which is
going to launch the developer tools and
within the console notice that we have
that javascript error uncaught reference
error alert is not defined it doesn't
know anything about this alert with
capital letter A
since JavaScript is case sensitive and
the same is true even for variables for
example if you create a variable we use
ver keyword to create a variable in
JavaScript for example let's say I'm
creating a variable with named STR and
let's say hello is
value within that and now if I use alert
STR then this one is going to work as
expected so when we do load this we
should see Hello within the alert box
but then instead of you know capital I
means all small letters within the
variable name if I use capital letter s
here so this variable is different from
this variable javascript doesn't know
anything about this variable so when we
reload the page it's going to give us an
error again uncaught reference error STR
is not defined javascript doesn't know
anything about it now let's look at
comments in JavaScript there are two
types of comments in JavaScript single
line and multi-line just like c-sharp
single line comments start with four
slash four slash and the comment ends at
the end of the line so that's a single
line comment multi-line comment begins
with four slash Astrix and then you can
have as many lines of comments as you
want and then it should end with a
streak forward slash now let's look at
data types in JavaScript we have three
broad categories of data types in Java
Script numeric boolean and string now we
don't have separate data types for
integer float decimals etc you know all
our numbers and boolean is going to
store true or false
string should be in codes either double
quotes or single codes to create a
variable in JavaScript we use var key
but we have just seen that and variable
names are also case sensitive in c-sharp
to create an integer variable we use the
end keyword and to create a string
variable we use string keyword but with
JavaScript we always use var keyword to
create any type of variable based on a
value that is assigned to the variable
the type of that variable is inferred
for example here we are creating
variable a and we have assigned number
10 to it so a here is a numeric type and
for variable B we are
a string so the type of this variable is
string again in c-sharp you cannot
assign a string value to an integer
variable so here X is an integer
variable right we have assigned value 10
to it and it's data type is integer and
in the next line we are trying to store
a string in integer variable now c-sharp
is going to raise a compiler error it
will not allow us to do this but
javascript is a dynamically typed
language this means JavaScript data
types are converted automatically as
needed during script execution if you
look at this example notice that this my
variable is first storing a number that
is 100 and then we are storing a string
literal here so we stew 100 into this
variable so here it is treated as a
numeric type and then we are displaying
that within an alert and then we are
storing a string into that variable so
here it is treated as a string type and
then again we are displaying that in an
alert so let's quickly look at that in
action if if that works is expected so I
have this exact same code already typed
so let's paste that here and let's run
this so first it should display hundred
and then once I click OK on that alert
box it should then display the string
assigning a string value
when a plus operator is used with two
numbers JavaScript adds those numbers so
here we have a and B we have stood two
numeric types within those variables and
variables C equals a plus B so what is
JavaScript going to do it's going to add
10 and 20 and then it's going to display
30 as expected when a plus operator is
used with two strings javascript is
going to concatenate those two strings
so we have hello within a JavaScript
within B notice that there is a one
space at the end at the end of hello
word and then C equals a plus B so here
we are applying the plus operator on two
strings so JavaScript knows to
concatenate those two strings and the
output will be hello JavaScript when a
plus operator is used with a string and
the number JavaScript converts the
numeric value to a string and performs
concatenation so here with an a we have
a string and within B we have a number
and we are playing the plus operator
here so what is JavaScript going to do
it's going to convert this numeric value
to a string and performs string
concatenation so we get the output
number is 10 and here we have 50 again
represented as a string because that's
present inside codes and then we have 10
now when you apply a plus operator don't
expect it to return 60 instead what it
will do is can catenate 10 with 50 and
it's going to give you 50 10 but if you
use a minus operator notice that here
are 50 you know though it's a number
it's present in a string format and then
within B we have 10 so a is string and B
is numeric and but we are using minus
operator here so we will get the output
40 here in this case the string is
converted to a numeric type the -
operation is performed and we get 40
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
