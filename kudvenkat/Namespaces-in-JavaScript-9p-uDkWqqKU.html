in this video we'll discuss how to use
namespaces to avoid polluting the global
scope this is continuation to part 55 in
part 55 we'll discuss the problem of
global namespace pollution so please
watch part 55 before proceeding
javascript lac namespaces however we can
use objects to create namespaces here we
have an example so basically this line
here says if the presume take object
already exists you start otherwise
create an empty object so now we can use
presume tag as a namespace if required
we'll look at an example of that shortly
we can also create nested namespaces in
JavaScript and nested namespace is a
namespace inside another namespace in
JavaScript to define an ester namespace
you define an object inside another
object we have an example here so
basically the first line says if the
presume take object exists use that
otherwise create an empty object and the
second line here says if T may already
exist then use that object otherwise
create an empty object let's look at an
example now we'll be continuing with the
example that we worked with in the
previous video session and if you
recollect from the previous video
session we've created two customer
functions one version of the customer
function is present in tea made or J's
file and this function has got two
parameters the other version of the
customer function is present in team
vedoe J's and has got three parameters
and on this HTML page we are loading
both the script files teammate or J is
followed by team B dot J s now since
these two functions have caught the same
name and since they are added to the
global namespace by default one version
of the function overrides the other
version depending on the order in which
these scripts are loaded and as a result
of that on any given page we are able to
use only one version of the customer
constructor function in this video let's
see how to make these customer functions
belong to their own namespaces and on
any given page we want to be in a
position to use both the customer
constructor functions if required so
let's see how to achieve that using
namespaces so let's go to teammate OGS
file first let's say both of these teams
are working for presume technologies so
we want to create a nested name space ER
so we want presume tag team a and all
the functions that team a develops we
want them to be part of presume tag team
a dot you know that namespace so let's
go ahead and create you know a variable
here let's name it regime Tech and that
equals regime Tech if it already exists
otherwise create an empty object and we
want to nest team a under presumed X so
presume tag team a equals pledge mtech
team a if it already exists otherwise an
MD object and then we want this customer
function to be part of presumed tech
team a namespace so presume Tech Talk
team a dot customer and then we will
have the function keyword and then
finally let's return an instance of this
customer object now this customer
function is part of prism tech team a
namespace so pledging Tech in this case
will be added to the global namespace
and remember in JavaScript vendo is the
alias for global namespace that means to
access customer function you can do that
you know in two ways one is by going
from the window object because that's
the global namespace so window dot
presume TechEd or teammate or customer
or projector teammate or customer so
here in this case pledging Tech will be
added to the global namespace that is
the
vendo so let's actually prove that so
let's save these changes and if you look
at this HTML page we are already loading
teammate or JS file so let's reload this
page and then let's get to the developer
tools by pressing f12 Kay and then
within the console window
let's go ahead and type keys of window
and then when we press enter notice that
presume tech namespace is already part
of the global namespace
now when I say faendal dot presume tech
dot we should say team a and when we
press dot we should also see the
customer function so when I press enter
notice that we get the customer function
with two parameters so the fully
qualified name of this function is
vendor or presume Tech Talk team a dot
customer now let's go and do the same
thing for the other version of the
customer function that's present in team
B door J's file so let's actually copy
this and paste that in this file so here
we want the namespace to be presumed
actor team B and then we want this
function to be part of presume tag team
B namespace so presume Tech Talk Team B
dot customer equals function and then we
want this function to return an instance
of the customer object all right now
let's save these changes let's go to a
browser reload this now when we say keys
off enter
notice that we have presumed tech name
space there so vandal dot presumed tag
. now we should see both team a and Team
B now if I go to team B dot customer we
should get the customer function which
has three parameters what is that
now on any given page we should be able
to access both the versions of the
customer constructor functions so let's
say for example if I want to access Team
a customer function so window dot
presume tech dot team a customer and
this version of the customer function
takes two parameters let's say the first
name is storm and the last name is
clover and we want to call get full name
method which is going to return the full
name and let's go and alert the full
name and if I want to access team B then
I can say window dot presume tech dot
team B dot customer and if you look at
this function notice that it has three
parameters let's say Tom middle name T
and let's say last name is grower and we
also want to alert the full name in this
case all right let's go ahead and run
this page now let's actually close the
developer tools reload the page now
first we get Tom grower
once I click OK we should get Tom T
grower but for some reason it says
object object let's see why is that
that's basically because we're not
calling the get full name method so we
are just getting the object part so
let's call get full name function and
now let's reload this Tom grower
now we should get Tom T grower
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
