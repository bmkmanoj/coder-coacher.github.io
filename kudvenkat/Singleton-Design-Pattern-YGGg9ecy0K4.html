technologies my name is rubbish and this
is part 2 of the design patterns
tutorial in this session we will discuss
what is singleton design pattern
singleton as creational pattern
implementation guidelines and how do we
implement a singleton class this
continuation - part 1 of the design
patterns tutorial so please watch part 1
before proceeding singleton pattern
belongs to creational type pattern let's
recap bodies creational design pattern
as mentioned in the part 1 of the
tutorial jiangha 4 have identified 5
design patterns that belong to creation
and design type category singleton is
one among them and the rest are factory
abstract Factory builder and prototype
patterns as the name implies creation
and design type deals with the object
creation mechanisms basically to
simplify this
creational pattern explains of the
creation of objects in a manner suitable
to a given situation I hope now you are
familiar with creation type pattern
let's now focus on singleton design
pattern singleton design pattern is used
when we need to ensure that only one
object of a particular class is
instantiated that single instance
created is responsible to coordinate
actions across the application if you
look at the Illustrated diagram you will
see different objects trying to invoke
an object instantiated a singleton this
single instance of the object is
responsible to invoke underneath methods
or events let's look at advantages and
guidelines in singleton implementation
concurrent access to the resources well
managed by singleton design pattern as
part of the implementation guidelines we
need to ensure that only one instance of
the class exists by declaring all
constructors of the class to be private
also to control the singleton access we
need to provide a static property that
returns a single instance of the object
now let us clip to visual studio and see
this in action by implementing a
singleton class
let's create a new project and choose
console application let's name this as
singleton demo let's add a new class
give it a singleton let's create a
public method public void clean details
which acts eps string as the input
parameter let's just print this message
using your console dot write line let's
just compile this for our convenience we
have named this class as singleton we
have not yet applied any singleton
design pattern principles to this class
let's see why we need to apply singleton
design principles and how we can apply
them for this singleton class now that
we have created a singleton class which
bring details as a public method we can
invoke the public method from this main
program by creating a new object of
singleton let's see how to do that
singleton s1 is equal to new singleton
and then s1 dot bring details let's just
say this is first message and
if you want to print another message we
just need to say s1 dot clean details
again this time let's say this is second
message let's compile this and let's run
this program look at that
the program has output a two statements
this is first message and this is second
message that means we have instantiated
only one object and we are able to
invoke a print details method imagine a
situation where we need more in details
from different classes of a given
project what we do is we end up creating
multiple objects of this singleton class
let's say we create the singleton object
for an employee so let's just change
this s1 to from employee that means we
are assuming that we are creating this
object from an employee class and then
say that employee dot print details and
let's change this message as from
employee and then let us assume that we
need to invoke the singleton object from
a student class we would say from
student and then let's spin the details
from students and let's pass the
messages from student let's compile this
compilation succeeded and let's run this
program look at the output the output
has printed a message from employee and
from student this means whenever we need
to create an instance of singleton or
invoke the print details method of
singleton we end up creating multiple
objects let's do that it has created
multiple objects how do we do that let's
go back to the singleton class let's add
it public constructor called singleton
and then let's create a private static
incremental variable we will be
incrementing the counter as and when a
new instance is created using the
singleton class now once we increment
the counter let's output the counter
value using our console dot write line
and say counter counter value is counter
dot tostring let's compile this
application and run this again look at
that we ended up creating two instances
of singleton class which is evident from
the counter value 2 that means first and
then we create the singleton object from
employee the counter value is
incremented to 1 and second time when we
create another instance of the singleton
object the counter value is incremented
to 2 even though we are invoking a very
common method we are ended up creating
two instances of the same singleton
class as objects now that we have food
it's unnecessary to create new instance
of an object for a common methods like
bring details let's see how we can avoid
that the first point comes into mind is
to restrict the multiple instance
creation we can achieve it by making all
constructors as private and change the
class to feel class so that it's not
inherited anymore let me change to this
public constructor to private and let's
also make this class a C class as Singh
eater
let's compile this application now and
see the behavior look at there're
messages here it says the season is
inaccessible due to its protection level
let's see very destroying there're look
at that for every new object
instantiation it is flowing an error
right now that is because we have
changed the public constructor into
private so we are not able to
instantiate the class then we are not
able to instantiate the class we need to
provide an alternative way where we can
give back the singleton object creation
let's see how we can create a single
instance of this singleton class let's
create public static singleton call it
as get instance return new singleton
look at that we have not overcome the
problem of creating multiple instances
if we return new singleton instance in
this get instance property how do we
avoid this let's create a new private
static singleton let us call it as
instance which is equal to null we need
to create an instance only if the abour
declared private property is null so
that way let us put the check instance
equal to null then instance is equal to
a new instance and then let's modify
this code and return instance instead of
new instance
but this we have applied the singleton
design pattern to our singleton class
let's go back to the program and see if
the error is gone no that has not gone
yet reason we are still trying to
instantiate a new singleton class let's
change it instead of doing a new single
term let's use the property which we
have created which is the get instance
and say instead of doing a new instance
now we are getting it from singleton
without getting stamps let's do the same
thing for student instead of creating a
new instance we have successfully
achieved the same behavior through the
get instance property and this get
instance will take care of creating only
one instance of the object across the
application let's run this application
look at that the counter value has not
been incremented and we have got the
input from both employee and student as
well this means we have successfully
achieved the singleton design pattern
with this example now let's flip to the
singleton class based on the given
situation we have successfully changed
the object creation pattern of this
class by applying the singleton design
principles and we have learned the first
base version of the singleton design
pattern you might be wondering why this
is the first base version if you focus
on this code this works perfectly well
in a situation when a single thread is
trying to create instance of this class
this version is not efficient enough to
handle multiple threads as it will run
into a race condition situation in the
next session of this video we will
discuss how to handle this
multi-threaded situations as well as a
real-world implementation example thank
you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
