control tutorial in this video well disk
is sorting asp.net chart control using
sort method this is continuation to part
9 so please watch part 9 before
proceeding do you sort method to solve
the asp.net chart control there are two
steps the first step is to modify the
HTML in web form one dot aspx nation'
here notice the two lines that are
highlighted in yellow
when we select student name from this
sort by drop-down list we want to sort
this chart data using the axis labels
that we can see at the bottom of the
chart and when we select total marks we
want to sort by y-values
so in order to support this we are going
to change the value attribute of both of
these list item objects of this GDL sort
by drop-down list for the first list
item object we are setting the value
attribute to access label and for the
second list item object we are setting
it to Y in a bit we'll see how we are
going to make use of this value
attribute now first let's go ahead and
make this change
let's flip to visual studio this is the
same example that we worked with in the
previous video session so for this DDL
sort by drop-down list we are going to
change the value attribute of the first
list item object to access label and for
the second list item we are going to
change it to Y and the next step is to
actually change get chart data method
within the code-behind file first of all
we don't require this parameter for this
function so let's get rid of that and we
don't require the state of view as well
so let's get rid of these two lines and
then we are going to set this data set
as the data source for the chart control
and then we call the data bind method
and here we are going to write our
sorting logic now our sorting logic will
be based on these two drop-down lists
that is sort by and sore direction so if
DDL sought direction drop-down list so
that's the drop-down list where the user
will tell whether if they want to sort
the data in ascending or descending
order and if you look at the drop-down
list on the waveform notice the value of
this ascending list item is set to a si
so if d real short direction dot
selected value equals ascending then
what we want to do is sort the chart
data in ascending order depending on
what field is selected in sort by
drop-down list now if you look at the
chart control the chart control actually
contains a series with named series one
and when we say we are sorting the chart
control we are actually sorting the data
points of this series one so within the
code-behind file chart one dot series of
series one dot sort so we are going to
use the sort method and we are going to
be used this overloaded version where we
specify the point sort order that is
whether we want to sort the chart in
ascending or descending order and by
which field we want to sort so point
sort order is going to be ascending
because that's what the user has
selected within the drop-down list and
then the next parameter is by which
field do we want to sort that depends on
which item the user has selected within
DDL sort by drop-down list if he has
selected student name then we want to
sort by access label if I select total
marks then we want to sort by y-values
so here we are simply going to say DDL
sort by dot selected value else
if the selected value from DDL short
direction drop-down list if it's not
ascending then you know the user wants
the data to be sorted in descending
order in which case we will change this
to descending and at the moment we have
compilation errors that's basically
because this get chart DITA method
doesn't expect any parameters so let's
go and get rid of these arguments that
we have passed into that method within
the page load event and within these two
selected and exchanged even handler
methods so with these changes let's go
ahead and run the project so student
name is selected let's select descending
and notice that the chart control data
is sorted by student name that is the
axis labels in descending order and when
we select ascending look at that the
data is sorted in ascending order by
axis label
let's select total marks look at that
the data is now sorted by y-values and
let's select descending so again by
y-values in descending order now if you
notice here we are first getting a
reference to series you know series 1
and then we are using this sort method
this is one way the other way is instead
of you know getting a reference to
series one and then using this sort
method you can let's actually comb in
this line we can also use data
manipulate a property of the chart
control and this data manipulator
property has got sort method now when we
use data manipulator property then to
the sort method along with specifying
you know the sort order and by which
field we want to sort that is whether by
axis label of y values we also need to
tell which data series data points we
want to sort so we have to specify the
series name as well because a chart can
typically contain multiple series as
well in our example we just have one see
but they could be multiple series so
let's go ahead and specify the series
name the series name is series one and
let's do the same thing here as well so
here we want to sort in descending order
so let's run this and it should work in
the same manner as before
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
