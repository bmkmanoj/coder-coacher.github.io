tutorial we are going to learn about
arrays arrays are one of the most
fundamental types and a java programming
language before we dive into arrays
since recall what was the tooth
fundamentally different types of data
one was primitive types you remember in
short byte long etc they were the
primitive types of data we also learned
that everything else which is not
primitive is a reference type and the
examples were classes
strings arrays animations etc so we are
going to deep dive into arrays today let
us understand what are arrays for sake
of simplicity you can consider arrays as
a container that is holding fixed number
of values and these values are of single
type the point to remember here is that
all the elements all the items in an
array they will be belonging to same
type and the length of the array is
fixed during creation that means
whenever we are creating an array we
should know the size of the array you
remember any example of where it is now
I hope you should because in all our
programs we always had a main method and
the main method you should take an
argument of type string arrays that was
the first glimpse of array in our Java
programming course also in other
previous lectures we have also declared
arrays which represent the list of
integers so to understand the
terminology learn that each item in an
array is equal is called element and
every element is accessed by its
position which is called index so a
diagram would help to understand this
better so here we have an array of ten
elements here the length of there is ten
the starting index is zero and the last
index is nine zero to nine are called
indices of an array and whenever we want
to get a particular element
in an Aries we use it index so an
element at index eight will be called a
it
let's do this in action let's say I want
to declare an array of type integer now
in order to declare an array what we
have to do is we have to give the type
of an array followed by P brackets and
then the name of an array something like
this so this is the declaration of an
array how do you initialize so there are
two ways here you can say that this
array is an integer array of five
elements this will create an array and
initialize it with the default values of
integer the other way is you can say an
array is equal to 1 2 3 4 5 this is
another way to initialize an array here
the size of the array is calculated
using the number of elements here right
now let's say that I want to combine
these two statements so we can declare
and initialize array on same line I can
say that boolean array
is equal to new boolean so this is the
way we declare and initialize an array
if you want to initialize an array using
some fixed values let's say 1 2 3 this
is another way to initialize an array
here you don't specify the size but
depending upon number of elements you
specify a initialization syntax the Java
compiler automatically finds out what
what are the what is the size of the
array so how do you declare an array we
learn that we declare an array using
then integer array syntax there's
another form of declaration where you
can remove this from here and you can
add here this is also a valid
declaration but I would suggest you not
to go with this mode of declaration
always provide this brackets here in
order to initialize one dimensional
rates we saw that we have to specify
size or we can also have a shortcut way
of initialization they are depending
upon number of elements in the
initialization syntax we can have the
size initialized automatically let us
talk about another type of ferries which
are called multi-dimensional arrays
multi-dimensional arrays are themselves
are arrays where the elements are
themselves arrays which means we can
also call them array of arrays they are
very essential in defining some data
types like matrices so when you have to
declare a matrix say 2 cross 2 matrix or
5 cross 5 matrix in that scenario you
can use multi-dimensional arrays in
order to declare a multi-dimensional
array
we can use the syntax something like
this you can have a 3 cross 3 matrix and
then you can initialize it using values
like 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 so here I have
declared a matrix so we can just clear
all everything else and we have to
specify we have declared a matrix and
let's understand how to access the
elements we can use our previous
knowledge of for loops to to declare a
nested for loop for example if I if I is
0 and ice less than 3 5 plus plus this
is an outer loop which will hydrate over
the rows and then we can have an
internal loop int J is equal to 0 again
J is less than 3 J plus class and then
we can say
so if we use it nested-if over a
multi-dimensional array you should get
some output something like this 1 0 1 1
1 0 &amp;amp; 0 1 1 you can use some spaces to
get a better output and hence you can
work with matrices so these were the
multi-dimensional arrays in this
tutorial we learnt about how to declare
an array how to initialize array and
what are multi-dimensional arrays this
is just a surface knowledge about arrays
in our next tutorial we are going to
learn more deep about arrays so stay
tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
