tutorial in this video we will discuss
how to pass data from the parent
component to a child component using
input properties so let's understand
this with an example at the moment we
are on the list route and we see list of
employees list employees component is
the one which is displaying these
employees so if we take a look at the
list employees component notice we have
this property employees which is an
array of employee objects and within the
engine in its lifecycle hook we are
calling the employee service this
service returns an array of employee
objects which we are storing in this
property and then within our view
template we are looping over the array
of employees that we have and then this
HTML right here is displaying the
employee photo they gender date of birth
and the rest of the fields so this list
employees component is kind of doing
three things it's responsible for
calling the angular's employee service
to retrieve the employees information
within the view template we are looping
over the array of employees that we have
and it is also responsible for
displaying employee's information now
what we want to do is offload this logic
of displaying each employee information
to another component so let's go ahead
and create that component first I'm
going to use angular CLI to generate of
a new component if you're new to angular
CLI I strongly recommend to check out of
our angular CLI course I personally
think every angular developer should
know how to use angular CLI so we can be
as productive as possible and here is
the command to generate of a new
component ng for angular CLI itself
G for generate C for component and I'm
going to name a component display
employee and let's place this component
in our existing employees folder so I'm
going to prefix it with a folder name we
want this component to be generated flat
in that folder so I'm using the flat
option let's also use the no spec option
so we don't have the unitest file
there we go all the required component
files are created and the route module
file app module is also updated now
notice within the employees folder we
have our display employee component
let's open the view template now what we
want to do is move the HTML that
displays the employee information like
the employee photo the agenda date of
birth etc from our list employees
component to display employee component
and within our list employee component
here is the HTML which displays employee
information so I'm going to cut this
HTML from all less employees component
and then paste it within our display
employee component notice here we are
binding to the employee object to
display their name photo gender etc so
we have to pass this employee object
from our parent component list employees
to this child component display
employees component so to make that
happen we are going to include an input
property within the component class
let's name the property employee and the
type for this is going to be employee we
don't have this type imported yet so
let's include the required import
statement to import it and this is going
to be input property so I'm going to
decorate this but add input decorator we
don't have this input type imported so
let's import it from angular core now
the parent component can bind to this
input property and pass the employee
object to this component and look our
component has the selector AB - display
- employee let's use the selector to
nest this component within list
employees component now we want to bind
to the input property and remember the
input property name is employee so let's
bind to this property since it's a
property binding we are including the
property name within a pair of
square brackets and to this input
property we want to pass the employee
object that we are looping over so let's
pass that employee object let's save all
our changes and then take a look at the
browser
it displays the site can't be reached
that's because our server is not running
so let's run our server there we go we
have our data displayed but the employee
images of way too big so let's fix the
height and width notice within our
display employee component view template
on this development which displays the
employee photo we already have a class
called image class and if we take a look
at the style sheet of our list employee
component notice we already have that
image class here and we have set width
200 and height also to 200 so we need
these two classes within the style sheet
of our display employee component so
let's cut these styles from here and
paste them within the style sheet of our
display employee component save all the
changes and then take a look at the
browser notice now we have the employee
photos properly displayed we still have
one more small issue here they using
bootstrap panel to display this employee
information at the moment this bootstrap
panel is not properly formatted and
that's because we still have two more
classes left within our list employees
component so these to bootstrap classes
panel and panel primary we need to move
them to the display employees component
so within our display employee component
let's include a div element here and
then include those two classes on that
development and let's move this closing
div to the end let's save all our
changes and then take one final look at
the browser there we go notice now we
have data displayed exactly the same way
as before at the moment we are using
parent-child components of a parent
component is this list employees
component so within our parent component
we are calling the end
servus and then looping over the list of
employees that we have and then as we
are looping over we are passing each
employee object to the child component
which is this display employee component
and to pass the employee object from
this parent component to the child
component we are using this input
property in our upcoming videos we will
discuss how to pass data from the child
component to parent component using
output properties so to create an input
property simply decorate the
corresponding property with at input
decorator we use input properties to
pass data from the parent component to
child component we can intercept and
react to input property changes there
are two ways to do that well this is
both of them in our next video thank you
for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
