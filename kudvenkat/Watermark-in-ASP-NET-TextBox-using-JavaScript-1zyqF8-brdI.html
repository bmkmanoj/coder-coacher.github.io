asp.net tutorial in this video we'll
discuss how to create a watermark in an
asp.net text box control using
javascript let me explain what I mean on
this HTML page we have this search text
box and within this text box we have
this default text enter your search term
here the moment this text box receives
focus that is when we click inside this
text box look at what happened to that
default text it disappears and then we
can type our search term within the text
box since we have some characters typed
within the text box at this point if the
text box loses focus nothing is going to
happen whatever we have typed in the
text box that text is retain but then if
we delete all these characters and if
the text box loses focus look at what
happened to the default text it
reappears so this is what a mark let's
see how to display this watermark in
asp.net text box control let's flip to
shell studio here I have an empty
asp.net web application project onto
this waveform let's drag and drop a text
box control we also want to display the
literal text which says search so let's
type it there and then within this
search text box the default text that we
want is enter your search term here so
let's set text attribute
and the font color of the default text
should be gray so let's set for color
attribute to gray and let's also set
width for the text box let's set it to
250 pixels with this let's go ahead and
run waveform 1 look at this when webform
1 loads we have that default text
displayed in gray color enter your
search term here but then when we click
inside the text box that is when the
text box receives focus that default
text doesn't disappear so we need to
write JavaScript to clear that watermark
so let's slip to visual studio and
include a section for script let's name
this function clear watermark and this
function is going to receive two
parameters the first parameter is the
default text and the second parameter is
the textbox control from which we want
to clear the watermark now when do we
want to clear the watermark whenever
this textbox receives focus so text box
control has got unfocused client-side
event so on focus equals we want to call
this clear watermark function and this
function has two parameters the default
text default text is this one enter your
search term here so we are going to pass
that and the second parameter is the
textbox control itself and let's use
this keyword to reference this text box
one control alright so when the textbox
control receives focus we want to clear
that watermark now when we want to clear
that whenever the text within the text
box matches this default text that's
only when we want to clear it if the end
user has typed you know a string like
this for example
we don't want to delete that so if I
have typed something like that and when
the textbox receives focus I don't want
to lose that value we still want to
retain it that's why we want to check
what is the text that is present within
the text box if it matches the default
text that's only when we want to play
that watermark so here we are going to
include an S condition if text box
control dot value equals default text
and notice what we are passing as
default text our default text that is
enter your search term here so if it
matches that then go ahead and set value
to an empty string and let's also change
the font color so text box control dot
style dot color equals black okay so
let's go ahead and run this page look at
this the moment this text box receives
focus that default text should disappear
and that's what happens but then you
know when we click away from the text
box that is when the text box loses
focus we want that watermark to reappear
but that's not happening so let's go
ahead and write another function to
create the watermark when the text box
loses focus so let's actually make a
copy of this function let's name this
create what mark again this function is
going to receive the same two parameters
default text and the textbox control
now if the text box is empty that's only
when we want to create the watermark if
the user has typed nothing into the text
box so for example if I typed regime and
then when the text box loses focus we
don't want to create the watermark we
want to retain the value that the user
has typed right but if the text box is
empty and at that point of the text box
loses focus that's when we want to
create the watermark so we need to check
the length property if it's equal to
zero
then the value within the textbox
control is going to be the default text
that we pass to this function and we
want the color to be grey because we
want the watermark color to be greater
that's why we are setting the font color
of the text box to create in this case
and then we want to call this function
when blur event occurs on the text box
so onblur equals create watermark and
this function is going to receive the
same two arguments so let's copy them
from here all right
so let's go ahead and run this so when
the web page loads we have that default
text when the text box receives focus it
disappears and then we can type our
search term in there look at that the
search term color is black and then at
this point if the text box loses focus
nothing happens but then if we delete
all these characters look at this at the
moment there's nothing within the text
box at this point if the text box loses
focus the watermark reappears thank you
for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
