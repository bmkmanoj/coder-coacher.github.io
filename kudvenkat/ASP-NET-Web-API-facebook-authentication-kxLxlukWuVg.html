API tutorial in this video the disk is
using Facebook authentication with
asp.net Web API this is continuation to
power twenty eight so please watch part
twenty eight before proceeding so here
is what we want to do on our login dot
HTML page in addition to login with
Google button we also want to include
login that Facebook button when the user
clicks this button the user will be
automatically redirected to facebook
login page once he provides his Facebook
credentials and once they login is
successful the user will then be
redirected to our application with an
access token which is it proof that the
user is successfully authenticated by
Facebook and then our web application
will grant access to the user to the
protected resources to use Facebook
account for authentication we will have
to first register our application with
Facebook to register our application
with Facebook navigate to develop list
dot facebook.com once we are on this
side click the login button and login
with your Facebook credentials once you
are successfully logged in we'll have to
create an application so to create an
application click this button create app
provide a name for your app I'm going to
name this test app and provide you our
contact email and select a category we
can select any category let me select
education and then let's click this
button create app ID and we need to end
this security check code so let's go
ahead and enter this
and then click submit' button this is
going to take a few seconds to create
the application for us the application
is successfully created now we need to
make this application public to make
this application public click this link
right here a preview and then click this
button it's asking for our confirmation
to make the app public so let's click
the confirm button the application is
now made public next to this application
we need to add facebook login product to
add the facebook login product click
this add product link on the left we
have the facebook login here so let's
click this get started button so we have
just added facebook login so click this
settings link on the left and here we
have to provide or redirect your eyes
and if you look at where our application
it's running its rang at this URL
localhost colon 3 4 8 3 8 that's the
port number so let's copy that and
specify that URL right here so that's
the URI at which our application is
running we also have to specify the
redirect URI so it's going to be same
port number 4 slash sign-in - Facebook
for Google we have specified the
redirect URI as sign and - Google for
Facebook it is sign in - Facebook let's
save our changes the changes are saved
now let's go to dashboard so here we
have the app ID and app secret
we'll use this app ID and app secret in
our asp.net Web API service in just a
bit the next step is to implement
Facebook back channel handler so what's
this Facebook back channel handler let's
understand that now Facebook has made a
breaking change to its API version 2.4
prior to 2.4 this is how the URI used to
look like
now notice to the URI we are sending
access to again using a question marks
the first query string parameter so we
are appending that to the URI using a
question mark now with Facebook version
2.4 they have made a breaking change and
the changes in addition to access token
they also want the list of fields that
we want from Facebook so in this case we
want ID and email and that is appended
to the URI using question mark so the
next parameter which is the access token
that's now appended using an ampersand
that's a breaking change because the
default implementation provided by
Microsoft for the Facebook client
appends the access token using a
question mark instead of an ampersand so
we will have to change that to ampersand
and to do that we are going to implement
this Facebook back-channel handler so
let's see how to do that now this is the
same project that we worked with in our
previous video so that is employee
service project let's add a new folder
let's call it Facebook to this folder
let's add a new class file let's call it
Facebook back-channel Handler and this
class is going to inherit from HTTP
client handler class this class is
present in system net dot HTTP namespace
so let's bring that namespace in within
this class all we are going to do is
override send async method that is
present within the base HTTP client
handler class we want this method to be
asynchronous so let's use async keyword
since we are using async keyword we also
have to use a weight keyword and we're
going to make use of this request object
which is coming into this function as a
parameter so if not request dot request
URI dot absolute path so if the request
URI absolute path if that does not
contain so
/ oh art then all we want to do is lick
restored request URI equals new URI
request daughter equal to RI dot
absolute your i dot replays so what
they're going to do we are going to
replace question mark access underscore
token where ampersand access underscore
token so that's all this function is
going to do replays question mark access
and the spoken with ampersand access
underscores token so let's see what
changes is the code that we have just
implemented so that's our second step
implement Facebook back-channel handler
to address the breaking change
introduced by Facebook to its API
version 2.4 the next step is to enable
Facebook authentication in startup dot
or dot CSV file so let's go to startup
dot or dot CSV file remember in our
previous video we have enabled Google
authentication
now let's enable Facebook authentication
to do that I'm going to create a
variable let's call it Facebook options
equals new Facebook authentication
options
this class is present in Microsoft that
open door security dot Facebook
namespace so let's bring that in and
we're going to specify few options here
going to specify a PI D AB secret
remember we got these two after we have
registered our application with Facebook
so let's navigate back to developers to
our Facebook comm they've called the app
ID here so let's copy that and specify
it right here similarly let's copy app
secret and specify it right here in
addition to app ID and app secret I'm
also going to specify back-channel HTTP
handler we have just implemented
Facebook back
handler so let's include a new instance
of this class as the value for our
back-channel HTTP handler and this class
is present in employee service dot
Facebook namespace so let's bring that
namespace N and the last thing that we
need to specify is the user information
endpoint remember that Facebook API
version 2.4 this is the endpoint which
we are going to issue the request so
let's specify that as the user
information endpoint now from the user
information endpoint we want email so to
the scope let's add email and to enable
Google authentication on the app object
we are calling use Google authentication
method so to enable Facebook
authentication we are going to call use
Facebook authentication method and this
method they are going to pass the
Facebook options that we have just
created so this is the code required to
enable Facebook authentication so let's
save our changes so that's our third
step an able Facebook authentication in
startup dot or dot CSV file the next
step is to modify the HTML on our login
dot HTML page to include login with
Facebook button so let's go to login dot
HTML page here I notice we already have
log in with Google button so let's make
a copy of this TR and then change the
bits that are required let's change the
ID of the button to be DN Facebook log
in and let's change the text to log in
with Facebook let's see what changes
reload our login page notice now we have
log in with Facebook button here is the
HTML required for that
the next step is to wire up click event
handler for our login that Facebook
button let's scroll down to the script
section notice here we already have the
even handler for login with Google
button let's make a copy of this and
then change the bits that are required
the ID of the button is BTN facebook
login so let's copy its ID and specify
that right here and then we also want to
change the provider from Google to
Facebook because when we click login
with Facebook button we want to redirect
the user to facebook login page let's
save our changes here is the code
required for that the next step is to
modify these two JavaScript functions
these user registered and signup
external user functions that are present
in Google authentication dot JS file so
let's go to Google authentication dot
J's file notice this method signup
external user look at this you are right
which we are redirecting the user notice
the provider it's hard coded to Google
that's because in our previous video we
had only one login provider which is
Google but now we've got to login
provider's Google and Facebook so
depending on the login provider that we
are using
we'll have to supply the appropriate
provider name we can't hard-coded like
this so let's introduce another
parameter to this function I'm going to
call it provider and then let's replace
this hard-coded value from here so
instead of using Google let's use the
provider parameter and obviously when we
call this function we also have to
supply a value for this parameter and we
are calling the sign of external user
function from this is user registered
function so when we call this function
we will have to supply a value for this
provider parameter now look at this
success callback function so for this
function we have this response parameter
so
response parameter has got login
provider property which tells us who the
provider is Facebook or Google so let's
use that property login provider let's
save these changes let's give our
solution a build and reload the login
page I'm already logged into Facebook so
first let's log out of Facebook and now
let's click this log in with Facebook
button notice now we are redirected to
facebook login page let's login with our
Facebook credentials
I am authenticated and I'm automatically
redirected to data dot HTML page and
then I click the store employees button
notice we can see the employees data and
look at the email address here Web API
3-degree at gmail.com and if you look at
ASP net users and ast net user logins
table notice we have an entry for web
api dilatory at gmail.com the email
address that we use to log into Facebook
now let's log off from our application
and let's try to log in with Google
provider so let's click log in with
Google button notice we are redirected
to Google sign-in page let's log in
using code banker at gmail.com I am I am
identified by Google we will be
redirected back to data dot HTML notice
they are using could wink at at
gmail.com and then when I click load
employees we can see the employee's data
now if we go back and check SP net users
and asp net user logins table we also
have an entry for could wink at at
gmail.com so at the moment we have both
Google and Facebook authentication so
here are the modifications for is user
registered function and signup external
user function thank you for listening
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
