this video we'll discuss the different
methods that are available in JavaScript
to convert strings to numbers
this is continuation to part 8 so please
watch part 8 before proceeding
first let's design a waveform that looks
like this
this form is going to allow the end user
to enter two numbers and add them
together along the way we'll discuss the
use of parts and parsefloat and ease na
and functions so let's flip to visual
studio here I have an empty asp.net web
application project I've already
designed this webform
I'll have the HTML available on my blog
in case you need it
now let's inspect the HTML so basically
here we've got an HTML table where we
set the border to one pixel solid black
and font family to area and this table
contains four TRS so for TRS to display
first number second number result and
then the add button and each TR has got
two TDs so the first year has got two
TDs the first TD contains this little
text first number and then a textbox to
allow the end user to enter the first
number similarly the second TR also has
got two TDs the first TD contain that
little text and the second TD contains
the text box to enter second number
similarly the third TR also contains two
TDs
first TD contains the literal text and
the second TD contains the result a text
box and within the final TR we still
have two t DS but the first TD is empty
there's nothing within the first TD
within the second TD we've got this HTML
button so when we click that button what
we want to do is retrieve the first
number second number from those two text
boxes add them together and display the
result within the result text box and we
want to do all that using javascript so
within the head section let's include a
script section and let's set the type
attribute and specify text slash
JavaScript so here we need a function
which is going to add two
numbers let's call that ad numbers so
the first thing is we need to retrieve
first number from the first number
textbox so let's create a variable first
number equals we are going to use the
document object dot get element by ID
and to this function we need to pass the
ID of the first number text box which is
txt first number and the dot value
should give us the value that the user
has entered within the textbox and we
need to do the same thing for the second
number so first of all let's rename the
variable to second number and the ID of
the second number text box is txt second
number so let's copy that ID and then
pass that to this document dot get
element by ID method so at the moment we
have got first number and second number
now all we need to do is add those
numbers together so first number plus
second number and whatever result we get
we want to set that as the value within
the result textbox so we are going to
use again a document dot get element by
ID method to get a reference to the
result textbox and then we set the value
property and if you look at the ID of
the result text box it is txt result so
let's copy that and then specify that
here okay so the value within the result
the textbox should be the sum of first
and second number and now we need to
call this JavaScript function when we
click this add button which means we
need to set the on click attribute of
this HTML button so let's copy the name
of the function and then go all the way
to the button control and then set on
click equals we want to call add numbers
JavaScript function so with all these
changes let's go ahead and run this and
let's enter 20 as the first number 10 as
the second number click Add button look
at that instead of adding those two
numbers together it's actually
concatenate
getting the numbers let's understand why
in order to understand that let's put in
a breakpoint with in the JavaScript
function Internet Explorer is already
the default browser for visual studio so
if we run this in debug mode we should
be able to debug the JavaScript so let's
enter 20 as the first number 10 as the
second number click Add button and let's
press f10 twice now let's have the mouse
or first number variable look at the
value within the first number variable
it's 20 but then look at how it is
represented it is present inside codes
means the number is represented in a
string format and the same is true for
number 10 as well so both the numbers
are present in a string format and when
we apply a plus operator between two
strings javascript by default is going
to concatenate them but that's not the
behavior that we want instead of
concatenating them we want to add them
and if we want the right behavior we
should be converting you know the number
represented in a string format to an
integer you know the reason why we are
getting it in string format is because
the value property of the textbox will
return the value that is entered in a
string format so basically we need to
convert that to an integer and that's
when we use parts in function so if you
give it a string that function is going
to convert that string to an integer so
let's remove this play point from here
and then use the parse int function so
we have parse and to this function pass
the value which is present in a string
format that's going to convert that to
an integer let's do the same thing for
the second number so now within first
number and second number we have caught
integers and when you apply a plus
operator between two integers javascript
is going to add them so now the behavior
is going to be as expected so let's
enter 2010 and click the Add button look
at that we get 30 as expected
so we have the same example right here
but the problem that this code is it
works fine with integers when we enter
20 and 10 look at that we get 30 but if
you enter decimals for example twenty
point five and ten point three we expect
the output to be thirty point eight but
notice what we are getting we are
getting thirty the decimal part is lost
let's look at that quickly in action so
twenty point five and ten point three
and when we click the Add button look at
that we still get thirty we actually
want 30.8 we don't want to lose that
decimal place so why are we losing the
decimal place here that's because parse
and is going to convert the entered
number to an integer which means it's
going to strip off that decimal part but
if you want to retain the decimal part
as well that's when parts float function
is useful so instead of using parts and
if you want to retain the decimal places
use parsefloat function so with this
change let's go ahead and run this one
more time and let's enter twenty point
five ten point three now we expect the
result to be thirty point eight and we
get the decimal places even if you have
like two decimal places you are still
going to get that look at that thirty
point eight two so we have just seen how
to use the percent and parsefloat
functions so if you want to convert a
string to an integer use percent if you
want to convert a string to a decimal
then use parsefloat now let's talk about
n a n what is n n any instance for not
in number in JavaScript first of all let
us see when we actually run into a
problem here now if you leave these
textboxes plant or if you enter text
instead of a number and then when we
click the Add button look at what we get
we get the result s n n so what does n a
n stands for any n stands for not a
number
in JavaScript we have caught this
function is an aien which is going to
determine whether a value is an illegal
number so this function returns a
boolean that is true if the value is not
a number and false if not let's look at
that in action so basically what we want
to do is if the end user did not enter
anything within the first number and
second number text boxes or if he enters
text instead of numbers we want to
display relevant you know validation
error messages so here we have the first
number second number we are going to
make use of EES na and function so if is
n n so to this function let's pass this
parameter now if the value that is
present in this variable if it's not a
valid number you know then this function
is going to return true so if it's not a
valid number then what we want to do is
display an error message to the end user
alert please enter a valid number in
first number textbox
and we need to do the same thing for
second number as well so easy n function
will return true if it's not a valid
number so it gets inside the f-block in
or display that error message right and
the same thing is true for the second
number if it is indeed you know a valid
number then it's not going to come into
this block anyway so let's go ahead and
run this and see if we get the message
that we expect so let's click the Add
button notice that it says please enter
valid number in first number textbox
click OK again we should get the same
error message please enter a valid
number it still says first number
textbox that's basically because I think
we haven't changed the message here so
let's actually change that to second
number textbox rerun that so please
enter a valid number for in first number
textbox please enter a valid number in
second number text box I click OK look
at that we still get the result as an N
we don't want that you know and it's
displaying the validation error messages
in another two box multiple times now
let's say for example what we want to do
is after we display the first error
message we want to stop the execution
and in addition to that within the
result this text box we don't want to
display that NN so if you want to stop
the execution as soon as you detect that
you have an error you know you simply
can use the return keyword so this is
going to return the control back ok so
let's go ahead and use the return
keyword here as well let's run this now
now notice that when I click add it says
please enter a valid number in first
number text box when I click OK it
doesn't proceed from this line any
further it's simply going to return ok
and notice that within the result x box
we don't have that any n now the error
messages here are not that relevant you
know when you leave the text boxes blank
it still says please enter valid number
and Trust number textbox instead of that
what we want to do is let's make this
validation error messages a little more
relevant if the first number and second
number text boxes are left blank then we
want to display these error messages
first number is required second number
is required if we enter text instead of
number then we want to display this
error message please enter a valid
number you know in the first or second
number text boxes so let's see how to
achieve this so basically we should be
checking if the first number text box is
empty or not if it is empty then we
should say first number is required if
the end user enters text instead of
number that's when we want to display
please enter a valid number so let's see
how to achieve that
so document dot get element by ID you
know this is going to give us the value
that is present within the first number
textbox in a string format so let us do
that in this variable first number
variable and then we are going to check
if first number equals an empty string
now when you do a comparison
just like c-sharp you will have to use
double quotes
I mean double equals if you use single
equal to then you are doing an
assignment it's very similar to c-sharp
so if you want to check whether the
first number is an empty string you know
you use double equals for comparison
okay so if it is an empty string then we
want to display a message saying first
number is required
and then we want to return basically we
are saying stop the execution so rate an
now if that is not true in the sense if
it is not an empty string then the end
user has entered something into the
first number textbox in which case we
want to convert that so to a float value
so here we are saying first number
equals parse load document dot get
element by ID we don't have to do all
this now since we already have the value
within the first number variable we can
simply pass that to this part float
function so use these function parts the
value that is present to a float and
again store it in the same variable and
then we use this check so if first
number is not a number then display this
validation message please enter valid
number in first number text box and
return okay
so let's delete you know this code that
we don't require anymore so so far we
have done you know for the first number
we need to do the same thing for the
second number
so let's actually copy this actually
let's copy all these three lines and
paste that here so here the variable
name is going to be second number and
the ID of the second number is txt
second number so we get the second
number we check it second number is an
empty string if that is the case we
display this error message second number
is required
and then second number equals parsefloat
second number and after we do that we
check if it's in number or not using
easy inane function if it is not a
number then will from the user to enter
a valid number within the second number
textbox and then finally the result
within the result text ball
is going to be first number plus second
number okay so this is the JavaScript
function which is going to display the
relevant error messages let's say so we
left the text boxes blank when I click
Add look at that it says first number is
required because the text box is empty
now let's go ahead and enter ABC text
instead of number click Add look at that
it says please enter a valid number in
the first number text box so let's enter
a valid number 100
click Add now look at that second number
is required
let's enter an invalid number ABC please
enter a valid number in the second
number text box let's enter 200 and
click Add so we get 300 is expected
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
