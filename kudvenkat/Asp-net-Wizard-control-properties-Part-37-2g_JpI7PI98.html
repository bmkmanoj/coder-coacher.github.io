venket this is part 37 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll discuss
about the asp.net wizard control
properties before continuing with the
session I strongly recommend to watch by
35 and 36 of this video series let's
flip to visual studio drag and drop the
desired control onto the waveform so we
know that F is at control is a
collection of wizard steps and by
default we have two wizard steps here
let's copy and paste this facade step so
we get a third wizard step let's get rid
of the ID property here and then change
the title to step three okay so the
first property that we will investigate
today is the active step index property
now if you remember from the previous
session of this video series if we want
to navigate you know between wizard
steps we can make use of this built-in
buttons the previous next and finish
buttons but however for some reason if I
want to programmatically control which
step I want to show to the user is there
a way to do that absolutely and the
property that we use for that purpose is
the active step index now we know the
Vizard is a collection of wizard steps
and it's a zero index based collection
so it starts at zero one two so if I
have three steps then the first step
index is zero second step is one and the
third step is two so on and so forth now
let's say for example you know when the
page loads I want to change they skip
the first step and show the second step
to the user so if I set that to one
since that is zero index based look at
what's happening step two is bolded here
which means when this page renders then
step two of the wizard will be shown to
the user now we are doing that
declaratively in the HTML source is it
possible to do it programmatically
absolutely in the code-behind file we
can do that let's say for example you
know for some users when the page loads
you know I want to show them based on
some condition the step two of the visit
control okay how do we do that within
the code-behind file on the page load
event in
in real-time we have several conditions
I mean there could be several reasons
why we may want to do this but for now
let's say if one is equal to one you
know which will always be true beside
one dot active step index is equal to
one so your programmatically changing
that to one so if we flip on the HTML
here you know by default it is step one
but then on the page load we are
changing the active step index of the
result control so let's run this once
again so when the page loads it will
actually load step two skipping step one
okay so that's the first property the
next property that we will investigate
today is all this well if we if you look
at the wizard control you know to
navigate between the steps of the wizard
control we can make use of these
built-in buttons the next previous and
finish buttons okay but we haven't seen
actually a cancel button on the facade
control is it possible to have a cancel
button on the wizard control absolutely
and the way we do that is there is a
property called display cancel button
which is false by default but if you
turn that to true then a cancel button
will be shown on that wizard control now
if you're wondering what is the purpose
of this cancel button you know it's left
to the imagination of a developer
probably you know the business
requirement is that the user you know is
not required to follow these wizard
steps and then maybe he has to go to a
certain page within our application so
when I click this cancel button I will
redirect the user to that page within my
application okay or it's also possible
when you click that button you can
navigate the user to an external side
for example let's say look at this we
have turned this cancer display cancel
button to true and there is this cancel
destination page URL so the URL of the
page that you want the user to navigate
to when they click that pattern okay now
when I click this ellipsis button then
you can select any page within your
application that you want the user
you know to navigate to or you can even
redirect him to an external site for
example let's say I want the user to go
to presume techcom I just type in the
URL there and then when we run this and
when the user clicks the cancel button
he will be navigated to presume techcom
so I have the cancel button and look at
this the interesting thing is the cancel
button will be shown on every step of
the facade control okay so on any step
if I click the cancel button it's going
to redirect me to presume tech website
there okay so that's cancel button but
then this cancel button has got several
properties that we can use to customize
it further the most interesting property
here is the cancel button type by
default it's displayed as a push button
but you can change that to a link button
so if I change that to a push button or
a link button then you have this cancel
button text and you can change this to
whatever you want
maybe go to somewhere or go to you know
Pro Jean so when they click that button
they go to pledging website okay and the
other button type that we have is the
image button so if you select the button
type as image then obviously we'll have
to specify the image URL for the image
button and how do we specify that we
have another property called cancel
button image URL now within this
application I have images folder and I
have a cancel button image there so
let's set this as the image for that
cancel button so let's go to the
properties of the wizard control cancel
button image URL click the ellipsis
button go into the images folder and
select this cancel button dot PNG when I
click OK so I can customize that there
and there are several other properties
that you can use the cancel button style
where you can set the back color border
color etc and the height and width okay
so that's about the cancel button the
next property that we will talk about is
the display sidebar by default the
sidebar of the wizard control is shown
here the sidebar is this bar which to
show step one step two step three this
is shown by default but
some reason if you want to turn it off
maybe for space constraints or you
managed it told we don't want to display
that sidebar to the end-user you can
actually hide that and how do we do that
just turn this property to false and the
sidebar will be hidden okay and the next
property that we will look at is the
finish complete button type okay now if
you look at the name of the property
it's a little confusing finish complete
button type what does this mean this
means on the finish step of the wizard
control the complete button that you
have what is it the type that you want
do you want to push button for example
if I go to step three that's the finish
step for my desired control because
that's the last step so on this step
what is the button type you want for
finish button by default it will be a
push button okay so finish button finish
complete button type okay I can change
that to an image button just hope just
like how we have done it for the cancel
button and if you do that obviously you
will have to specify finish complete
button image URL so go to the images and
then I select finish button I click OK I
get an image button there and the same
thing you can do for finish previous
button type let's say here I want to set
that to link button and then in that
case you want to set the finish previous
button text you know maybe to previous
or back whatever you want to call it
maybe I want to call this back in this
case I can change that to back ok and
then the font and full color are the
regular properties that you can use to
change the font and for color and you
have header style and another
interesting property is the header text
by default this visit control doesn't
have any header text now let's say I
want to display some header text maybe
we are capturing the personal details of
an employee here so I'm giving this
header personal details ok so that will
be shown there the header text and you
can customize this header style header
style what is this it's a collection of
style properties that we can set to
customize this header style for exam
I want the back color of let's say a
dark green and then maybe the full color
maybe white color and I want to bold the
font you know you can customize it to a
great extent
okay and another interesting thing about
this header text you can even change
that programmatically in fact all these
properties can be changed
programmatically now let's say this is a
Vizard control where we are capturing on
step one personal details on step two
maybe we are captured in contact details
and then step three we will show the
summary to the end user you know so
which means programmatically depending
on the step the user is on I want to
change the header text at the minute
it shows personal details on each and
every step we don't want that we want to
change the header step head attacks on a
step by step basis how do we do that
okay we have to do that in the
pre-render we can do that in the
pre-render event of the page so let's
copy this just to generate the event
handler since this is a pre render event
I'm going to call this page underscore
pre-render and then F wizard one that
active step index is equal to one
meaning if we are on the second step of
the wizard control then I want to set
the header text of wizard 1 to contact
details because on second step we are
capturing the contact details of the
user
so let's copy that else/if active step
index is equal to two which means on we
are on the final step then I want to
show the summary to the end-user okay
let's run this one now so when the page
first loads it loads step one of the
wizard wave we are capturing personal
details but when I go to step two by
clicking on the sidebar or by clicking
the next button it shows contact details
when I go to the third page a true
summary all right
let's flip to the web form okay so we
have seen the finish previous button and
finish complete button we discussed
about header style and header text and
we have another property called
navigation button style okay
that's nothing but the navigation
buttons that we use so for example if
it's you know a push button and then I
want to change the back color of that
push button maybe to a red I can do that
there and then maybe I want to change
the font you know I want to bold that
and then maybe for color I want to set
that to white again all these are style
properties which we can basically use to
customize the navigation button styles
and navigation style this property
basically changes the area way we have
the navigation buttons the navigation
layout basically ok let's say for
example the back color of the navigation
area I want that to be something like
this
you know oh that's a border color let's
say back color maybe I want this color
there and I'll look at that that's the
navigation layout there and similarly
you can change the several styles you
know sidebar button style again we have
sidebar buttons here you know you can
configure the sidebar buttons here again
the same style properties and sidebar
style sidebar itself if you want to set
the background color maybe
to something like a black color you know
we can do that and there are several
other properties maybe I want this you
know sidebar basically to be vertical
aligned on the top you know we can do
that several other properties and then
we have the start next button image URL
now if you look at this on the start and
step one we have this start button okay
so that's the next button
so start next button type okay again you
can configure that to push button or
image button a link button whatever so
if I change it to image button obviously
I will have to specify the start next
button image URL so maybe I go to images
and I select the next button there so we
will get that image button there
similarly for the step you know the
first step is the start step the last
step is the finish step of the wizard
control but then in between we have
steps of the wizard control so on those
steps we have the previous and next
buttons so you can use step next button
type to change the next button within
the steps of the wizard control and then
step previous button type can be used to
customize this previous button so for
example step previous button type it's a
push button if I change that to image
button then this previous button is
converted into an image button and
obviously if you have converted that
into an image button then you have to
specify the previous button image URL
property so I go there I select previous
button and that will be converted to an
image button and you do the same thing
to convert the step next button type use
step next button type or property for
that at the minute it's a push button
but I can change it to link button if I
want so there's a link button that or I
can change it to the image button if
that's the case then I have to specify
step next to button image URL so I go to
the images next button
okay alright so the next property is the
step style property you can change the
step style itself you know maybe the
back color I want to change something
like this you know that's the step area
where you will have controls in the back
I know for each step okay and then if
you look at the dis wizard steps you
know you can add a steps to the wizard
controlled in the HTML source you can
directly type them here or you can
actually use the wizard step collection
editor so if you come here click the
ellipsis button we get the wizard step
collection editor and you can add every
side step you want give it the title and
then I'll set all these properties and
then you can move it up or down using
these arrow buttons there on this slide
