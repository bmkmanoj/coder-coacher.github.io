this video well discus check very
previous bar of each ad there are two
simple steps to get the jQuery progress
bar widget on your web page the first
step is to include a div element with an
ID on the page and the second step is to
write this one line of jQuery code so
let's look at that in action first let's
include it development let's set the ID
attribute let's set this to prove this
bar within our jQuery ready function
let's find this development using the
jQuery ID selector and on that let's
call the previous power function save
our changes reload this webpage and
notice that we get the progress bar
there are two types of progress bars in
jQuery determinate progress bar in
determinate progress bar use the
determinate progress bar when the actual
status can be accurately calculated use
the indeterminate progress bar to
provide user feedback when the actual
status cannot be calculated to get a
determinate progress bar all you need to
do is set the value option of the
progress bar function to an integer
value between zero and its maximum value
at the moment we have set it to 65 to
get an indeterminate progress bar set
the value option to false so the value
option of the progress bar function
supports two different data types
integer and boolean so let's look at
these two in action so let's go ahead
and set the value option so let's set
the value to 80 save the changes reload
our page now we have a determinate
progress bar let's set the value to a
boolean type that is false save the
changes reload this page and notice that
we get an indeterminate progress bar so
when do we use this indeterminate
progress bar for example let's say
you're uploading a file to the server
you don't know how long you know it
takes to upload the file but you want to
provide some feedback to the user so at
that point you can use this
indeterminate
progress bar when do you use determinate
progress bar if you know how long you
know or what percentage of the work is
completed that's when you can use the
determinate progress bar now let's look
at an example of taking the value from a
drop down list and then setting that as
the value for the progress bar so we
want to bind this progress bar to this
drop down list so here is the HTML for
the select element that you see here so
let's paste that within the form section
right here first we need that literal
text which will prompt the user to
select percentage and we need the Select
element in the interest of time I have
already typed this so the Select element
has got an ID DDL percentage and we have
options from 10 to 100 and after the
Select element we need a button so input
type equals button let's give it an ID
let's set it to BTN let's also set the
value attribute let's set it to set
value and let's include two HTML break
elements save the changes reload our
page so we get the UI which is similar
to what we have here now within our
jQuery code I'm going to remove this
javascript object so the progress bar
function on that development is going to
initialize the progress bar for us now
when we select the value from the
drop-down list and when we click the
button that's when we want to set the
selected value from the drop-down list
as the value for the progress bar so
let's find the button element I'm going
to use the jQuery ID selector again the
ID of the button is BTN and we want to
wire up the click event handler then we
click the button we want to execute some
code so what do we want to do we want to
you know find that development once
again so I'm actually going to cache the
Dom element in a variable so let's go
ahead and create a variable here
let's call it progress bar def equals
the dorm element and let's use the
variable instead of finding it on the
indie Dom every time so within the click
event handler when we click the button
on the Dom element called the progress
bar function once again and this time we
want to set the value option okay so I'm
simply going to say value equal to where
is the value going to come from the
value is going to come from this
drop-down list the drop-down list has
got an ID DDL percentage so let's use
the jQuery ID selector one more time
find the drop-down list and to get the
selected value let's use the Val
function and this function is going to
return that value in a string format we
need to convert that to an integer to do
that I'm going to use parse int function
so let's save the changes reload our
page and let's select 90% for some
reason look at that the progress bar
doesn't show up that's basically because
I I think we have a syntax error here
since this is an option we don't require
a semicolon here if you have another
option you would use a comma like that
since we don't have an option let's
remove that comma save the changes
reload this page now let's go and select
90 and look at that 90% of this progress
bar is filled all right at the moment if
you look at the progress bar that we
have here the value is not displayed on
the progress bar now we want to display
the value like this okay
so let's see how to achieve that now we
need to make changes both to the HTML as
well as the jQuery code so here we have
a development inside the development I'm
going to include a span element so this
pan is the child element let's give it
an ID let's
all this progress bar label for
displaying the value and I'm going to
set style attribute so where do we want
to place the span element you know
basically we are going to use the span
element to display the value okay so we
want that value to be present in the
center so we want the horizontal
alignment to be in the center and
vertical alignment also to be in the
center okay so to do that I'm going to
set the style attribute and I'm going to
use the position property so position
absolute so I want to position the span
element in our in absolute relation to
the parent development and from left
side 50% and from the top 20 percent
okay because if you said from top 50
percent you know it's going to start
from halfway that means it looks like
you know it's pushed down a little bit
that's why we are starting at 20 percent
okay so let's say what changes now let's
include some text there for example ABC
to see where it is appearing and then we
will modify the styles as required let's
save our changes reload this page and
look at this ABC is right here so we
expected that to be in the middle of
this progress bar so why is that that's
basically because it's positioning you
know it's taking this left 50% and top
50% in relation to the you know this
this browser window itself that's not
what we want we want that to be relative
to the parent element and to tell that
we have to again set the style attribute
here and set the position attribute to
relative okay so that should fix that
issue let's reload this page and look at
that we get it where we want it to be
all right so let's remove this default
text from there okay so we are going to
use that label to display the value and
within our jQuery code whenever we
change the value of the progress bar an
event is raised and that is change event
so when change event is raised we want
to execute some code
so let's include a function and what do
we want to do we want to find this span
element and the span element has got an
ID progress bar label so let's use that
ID find the jQuery ID selector you know
use the jQuery selector and find that
span element and on that let's use the
text function and we want to retrieve
the progress bar value so I'm going to
use this progress bar div again dot
progress bar function and we want value
property so it's going to return us the
current value of the progress bar to
that if you want to append a percentage
symbol simply append that okay
so let's save our changes reload this
page and let's select 80% look at that
another percentage value is now
displayed on the progress bar so here we
have the HTML and on this page we have
the jQuery code required thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
