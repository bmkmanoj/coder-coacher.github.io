venket this is part well of asp.net MVC
tutorial in this video we'll discuss
creating a view to insert data please
watch part 11 before proceeding with
this video we want to create a view
which allows the user to enter name
gender city date of birth and then once
the user clicks on this create button we
want to store the employee details to a
database table in part 11 if you
remember we have implemented an index
view which actually lists lists all the
employees that are present in TBL
employee table let's flick to visual
studio let me actually run this project
and navigate to employee controller and
in the X action method look at this this
page is listing all the employees that
are present in TBL employee table now
when I click on this create new link we
are actually navigating to employee
controller
create action method now within the
employee controller class do we have the
create action method no and that's the
reason why we have this error message
the resource cannot be found HTTP status
code 404 so obviously to fix this error
the first thing to do is to implement
this create action method within the
employee controller class okay so let's
go ahead and create that action method
so I'm going to simply copy the action
method that we already have there I am
going to change the name to create and
then I'm going to get rid of this code
and then I am simply going to return a
view okay and then I'm going to decorate
this controller action method with HTTP
GET attribute meaning this controller
action method will only respond to a get
a request of this URL so if if somebody
navigates to this you are a local host
MVC demo employee controller and create
action okay if it is the get request
meaning it if it is the initial you know
get request of this view I mean you
only then you know this controller
action method will respond okay so
that's why I have decorated this with
HTTP GET now after I enter the data I in
Oh name gender City date of birth and
then once I click this create button
what are we actually doing we are
posting the data back to the server at
that point of time you know this
controller action method will not
respond we'll have another version of
3/8 which will be decorated with HTTP
POST attribute which is going to receive
the posted form data and then we will
submit that back to the database server
you know to be stored in the database
table we'll talk about that in our next
video session first in this video let's
say you know creating this view for the
end user to enter employee data ok so
this is the controller action method
which is going to respond only to the
get request of this URL ok so now the
next step is to create a view and to
create a view it's very straightforward
all you need to do is right click on the
controller action method from the
context menu select add view so our view
name is going to be create I am going to
use a raid arrays a view engine we are
going to create a strongly typed of view
and then I am going to select the
employee class as our model class and
then the scaffold template I'm going to
select create as the scaffold template
and then I'm going to click this Add
button which should add create view you
know to the employees folder within
views folder so I have this create dot
CS HTML view the first thing that we
need to do if you scroll all the way
down you know I have this section
scripts that is generated at the moment
I'm going to get rid of this code will
talk about these sections and scripts in
a later video section and to format this
properly I'm going to use a div tag and
then I'm going to specify a style you
know and then set font family to area
and then let's take this div tag and put
it at the bottom of this view ok so
that's the only change now
let's go ahead and run this and see what
we get so let's navigate to employee
controller and index action method and
then once we click on this create new we
are navigated to this URL employee
controller create action method and look
at the form you know we have all text
boxes for name gender City date of birth
etc but gender in an ideal world it's
better to have a drop-down list instead
of a text box okay so let's see how to
you know get a drop-down list instead of
a text box and that's very
straightforward okay all we need to do
is within this view create dot CSS HTML
we will have you know look at this for
gender okay so we are using this HTML
helper editor for you know model dot
gender so forth for gender which is a
string you know we are using this HTML
help editor for which is rendering this
text box by default okay but instead of
that we want a drop-down list and to do
that all you need to do is instead of
using the editor for HTML helper I'm
going to use you know an HTML helper
drop-down list and then obviously this
helper method has got several parameters
so first we need to specify the name the
name of the property of the employee
object which is that gender and then
look at this this HTML helper method has
got several overloads I'm going to use
you know this overload look at this this
is the first parameter is the name of
the property of the employee object
which is gender and the second property
is you know what options do you want
within that drop-down list and it is
look at this it's actually an
ienumerable of select list item objects
okay so which means i can pass a new
list object and then it's going to be
select list item object
so let's specify you know it's a new
list of select list item so I'm going to
create a new select list item object and
obviously the constructor of this class
has got two properties text so what is
the text that we want within the
drop-down list male and the value is
also going to be male so a drop-down
list will have both text and value you
know in our case both of them are going
to be you know text and value as male
similarly let's have another you know
select list item which will be female
and text and main value is also female
okay so that's it now let me go in and
run this and see if we get it dropped on
this so let's navigate to employee index
and let's go to that create form look at
that I get a drop-down list now look at
this by default male is selected here
but let's say I want you know another
string which says select gender how do I
get that so there is if we look at this
drop-down list HTML helper it has got
several overloads I'm going to use
another overloaded version you know look
at that I'm going to use this version
which also takes an optional option
label okay
so what that's going to be select gender
and that's of type string so I'm
enclosing that within double quotes okay
and if you want to properly format this
select or the entire HTML and plus
control K and D that should format that
properly so if you look at this now look
at this this code is properly formatted
now let me go ahead and run this and
navigate to employee controller index
action click on this create new look at
that we get the drop down list with that
option as well select gender alright
so now obviously look at this we have
this URL employee create now then I
enter this URL and plus enter there you
know
that's the get request for the webform
so obviously this controller action
method will respond in orbit and create
the employee controller
you know this action method will respond
to that URL request on the other hand
look at this if I don't enter I mean if
I click this button create what's going
to happen this platform will be posted
back to the server okay now look at this
I get this error message the resource
cannot be found but I have a create
action method within the employee
controller why did I still get this if
you look at this I have the create
action method within the employee
controller but I still got this error
message that is because when I click
this button you know create we're
actually posting the form data so that's
an HTTP POST request and here since we
have decorated this action method with
HTTP cat you know this controller action
method will only respond to the get
request of that URR
but when I post the waveform back you
know when I click this button I'm
submitting the form in which case you
know it looks for a create action method
with HTTP POST attribute we don't have
that and this action method is decorated
with HTTP GET attribute meaning this
will only be used for you know get
requests of that URR okay in our next
video we'll discuss you know actually
posting the data back you know entering
data and then once I click on this
create button we will actually discus
storing this data to a database table on
this slide you can find resources phase
