in this video we'll discuss window dot
honourary event in JavaScript in general
we use try-catch statement to catch
errors in JavaScript if an error is
raised by a statement that is not inside
a try-catch block the own error event is
fired assign a function to window dot on
error event that you want to execute
when an error is raised the function
that is associated as the even handler
for the own error event has three
parameters message URL and line message
parameter specifies the error message
URL specifies the location of the file
where the error occurred and line
specifies the line number where the
error occurred let's look at an example
now now to this own error event of the
endure object we want to associate an
event handler method so we want this
function to be executed when the own
error event of the window object is
raised now remember this function
receives three parameters message URL
and line now if we want to display the
values that are present in these three
parameters any JavaScript alert so let's
go and use alert function so we want to
display this word message and then the
actual error message that is present in
message parameter and then we want to
print a new line character using this
escape sequence backslash N and then we
want this word URL and then print the
URL of the page where the error occurred
and then another backslash and then the
actual line where the error occurred and
then let's return true from this
function so what is significance of
returning true from this function
remember the old versions of Internet
Explorer used to display JavaScript
errors on the bottom right hand corner
of the browser window now if you want to
suppress those error messages then
return true from this function otherwise
return false now let's raise an error
I'm going to raise an error by calling
a function that is not declared yet so
we don't have this non-existing function
declared anywhere in our script so now
let's go ahead and run this so when we
run this this function call is pleasant
it's not pleasant inside a try-catch
block so this is going to raise an
exception and that gets bubbled up till
the vendor object and this event that is
on error event it's raised and we have
associated this function as the even
handler for that event so this function
will be automatically executed and we
get the message water and line number
where the error occurred in JavaScript
alert so let's look at this in action so
notice that we get the message uncaught
reference error non-existing function is
not defined and that's the URL of the
page where the error occurred and that's
the line number now if this method call
is present inside a try-catch block then
you know the catch block is going to
catch that exception so the exception
will not be bubbled up until the window
object so the owner element is not fired
so this even handler method will not be
executed and hence will not get the
message in the alert let's look at that
in action so let's wrap this in a try
block and then catch the exception and
then let's simply write the exception
message to the document object
notice that it says non-existing
function is not defined that's the
message but we don't get you know the
error message you are a landline number
because this error is already caught by
this catch block so it's not bubbled up
till the window object that's why on air
element is not fired
and as a result this function is not
executed so if the error is handled by a
try-catch statement then the on error
event is not raised on air event is
raised only when there is an unhandled
exception so the line that caused the
exception if it's not present inside a
try block then you know that unhandled
exception will bubble up till the window
object and then the on error event gets
fired and as a result the function that
is associated as the even handler for
that event will be executed on earth
even handler method can also be used
with HTML elements let's look at an
example
so let's include an image element here
and let's specify the source for the
image now I'm going to specify maybe
some non existing image dot jpg now if
you look at our solution Explorer notice
that we don't have an image with that
name so it's a non existing image and
then I'm going to use the on error
attribute and then associate that with a
function so let's specify a function
let's actually remove this window dot on
error and then let's give it a name
let's call this image error handler
and then let's associate this function
with this event I'm going to remove all
these parameters and then I am simply
going to alert a message here stating
that there is a problem loading the
image all right so this image does not
exist so on air it even gets fired as a
result this method will be executed
notice that it says there's a problem
loading the image the image is not
loaded on the other hand in case if we
have an image with that name with no
solution Explorer this event will not be
raised as a result the Associated
function will not be executed so you can
also use the own error even handler
method with HTML armed elements thank
you for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
