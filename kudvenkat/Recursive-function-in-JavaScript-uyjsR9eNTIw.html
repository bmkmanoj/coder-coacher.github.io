in this video well discuss recursive
functions in JavaScript recursion is a
programming concept that's applicable to
all programming languages including Java
Script so what's a recursive function
recursive function is a function that
calls itself when writing recursive
functions there must be a definite break
condition otherwise there is creating
infinite loops let's look at an example
let's first see how to compute the
factorial of the given number without
using recursion so let's create a
function let's name it factorial now we
want to be able to compute the factorial
of a given number so let's include a
parameter to this function now if n is
equal to 0 or n is equal to 1 then we
want to return one because factorial of
zero and PAC factorial of 1 is 1 on the
other hand if n is not 0 or not equal to
1 then let's create a variable let's
name it result and let's initialize this
variable with the value that is present
in the parameter and let's use a while
loop here well n is greater than 1
result equals result into n minus 1 and
then let's set N equals n minus 1 and
then finally return whatever is present
in this result variable let's call over
factorial function now and let's pass 5
as the value for n so we want to compute
the factorial of number 5 factorial of 5
is 5 into 4 into 3 into 2 into 1 which
is 120 and we want to write that value
to the document object so let's pass the
return value to the write function of
the document object so when we run this
we should get 120 now let's see what's
actually happening here let's open a
notepad so when we pass 5 to this
function n is equal to 5
five is five equal to zero or five equal
to one that is false so it doesn't come
inside it comes here and then it is
initializing result of the value of n so
at this point result will also be equal
to five so it comes here and checks is 5
greater than one that is true so it
comes inside the while loop and then on
the first iteration of the loop so
result equals result into n minus one at
the moment we have got five and result
variable so 5 into 5 minus 1 that is 5
into 4 is 20 result equal to 20 and n
will become n minus 1 so that is 5 minus
1 4 so on the first iteration of the
loop those are the values on the second
iteration of the loop is 4 greater than
1 true that comes inside and result is
20 20 into n is 4 so 4 minus 1 is 3 20
into 3 is 60 so result will become 60
and n will become 3 on the third
iteration n will become 2 and result
will become 60 into 3 minus 1 is 2 so
120 and then it's 2 greater than 1 that
is true so it comes inside result is 120
and n is 2 so 120 into 2 minus 1 that is
120 into 1 is 1 so on the final
iteration results will be 120 n will
become n minus 1 that is 2 minus 1 is 1
so is 1 greater than 1 that is false so
it comes out of the while loop and then
it returns whatever value that is
present in the result variable at the
moment we have got 120 so that's what
get returned and we are writing that to
the document object and as expected it
prints 120 so here we are not using
recursion so what is it recursive
function recursive function is a
function that calls itself so let's see
how to use recursion to compute the
toriel of a number so I'm going to get
rid of all of this code so it records
your function is a function that calls
itself return n that is whatever value
you are passing to this function n into
factorial of n minus 1 so basically here
we are calling the same function over
and over or lower until n becomes 0 or n
becomes 1 ok the moment n becomes 1 you
know it returns 1 from this function but
until then it's going to call you know
the same function so 5 into 4 into 3
into 2 into you know at last when n
becomes 1 that's when 1 will be returned
but then by that time we have multiplied
5 into 4 into 3 into 2 okay so the
factorial of 5 is going to be 120 and
here since this function is calling
itself it's a recursive function and 5
factorial is 120 so this is the same
example that we have just seen thank you
for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
