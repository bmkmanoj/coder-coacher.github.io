am venket this is part 28 of asp.net
video series in this session we'll learn
about the asp.net bulleted lists control
before continuing with the session I
strongly recommend to watch parts 25 26
and 27 of this video series in asp.net
there are several list controls like
drop-down lists checkbox lists radio
button list list box and bulleted lists
just like every other list control
bulleted list is also a collection of
list item objects items can be added to
the bulleted list in the HTML source at
design-time
or in the code-behind file at runtime
programmatically britta'd less like any
other list control supports data binding
for example a bulleted list can be bound
to a database table or to an XML file
now let's look at some of the useful
properties of bulleted lists that can be
customized further to suit our
application needs let's flip to visual
studio drag-and-drop a bulleted list
control onto the webform and we know
that a bulleted list is a collection of
list item objects and those list item
objects can be added in the HTML source
at design time I have some of them
already typed so let's copy and paste
them there let's select all the HTML
format selection to format that properly
okay so if I flip this to the design
mode now look at this by default it's
showing us a non unordered list okay the
bulleted list by default shows an
unordered list so when we run this it
will actually render this bulleted list
control as an unordered list in HTML we
have you know the unordered list which
we create using UL tag all right now
let's say instead of this unordered list
I want you know an order the list where
we can show numbers instead of the
bullets how do we do that go to the
properties of the bulleted list and
there is a property called Blitz style
and said that two numbered and the
moment we do that look at that we have
these numbers one two three four so
instead of the bullets now we have the
numbers and when we run the application
now
instead of generating an unordered list
it will actually generate an ordered
list as you can see here okay now
thus the ordered list start numbering at
one every time now you can customize
that as well there is a property called
the first bullet number okay which can
be used to specify the value at which
you want the ordering to start so now
let's say if I say that 210 and look at
what's going to happen it's going to
start at 10 which is again very simple
and straightforward now if you look at
the bullet style property you have
several Pro you know styles there you
can display alphabets so when I select
lawyer alphabets look at that it starts
from J because I have selected 10 if I
put that to 1 it will start at 1 so
there's a lot of customization that you
can do I can select upper alphabets or I
can select the Roman numbers lower and
upper and I can also you know use
symbols like disk circle or Squire or
custom image you can customize this to
suit your needs so when I specify custom
image as the blade style then you know
you need to specify the bullet image URL
you're saying I'm going to use my custom
image so in that case you'll have to
tell where is that custom image what's
the path of that one using this bullet
image URL property now I already have an
image here let's copy that let's go to a
visual studio and within the solution
Explorer let's add a new folder to our
web application project let's call that
images and let's paste this image into
that folder ok so I have an image here
now if we go to this web form select our
blade list and we set bullet style is
custom image and the bullet image URL is
going to come from this images folder so
let's select that ok and look at that
it's using that image there so now when
we run this as you might expect you know
it uses those images that we have
specified so a lot of customization is
possible as far as
they you know display of this bulleted
list is concerned bullet lists blade
style now there is another very useful
property called the display mode now by
default the display mode is text now
let's flip this back let's go to the
properties with ability list
let's choose maybe numbered or let's not
choose any style which defaults to the
unordered list okay so there is another
property called display mode and if you
look at this it takes three values text
hyperlink and link button by default its
text so the list items rendered as text
but then you can also specify the
display mode as hyperlink in which case
all this list items are clickable the
user can actually click them and go to
the respective pages or the you know
even external sites let's say I want
these hyperlinks now when you want your
list items within the bullet list
bulleted lists to be hyperlinks then the
value will actually be the URL to which
you want to navigate it could be a page
within your application or it could be
an external site so let's copy these
list items just to save some time and in
the source instead of using these list
items I'm going to use these ones okay
so obviously when we run this now the
list items are going to be rendered as
hyperlinks and the user can actually
click on them and the user will be
navigated to the side so when I when we
run this look at the hyperlinks there
now as I move my mouse over these
hyperlinks look at that the URLs on the
browser at the bottom okay so obviously
when I click this now it's going to
navigate me to that URL i clicked on
blue google so it's going it's taking me
to the google website okay now if you
look if you notice the google website
has opened in the same URL now let's say
I want this target web page to be
opening in its own window or a new tab
is that possible absolutely all you have
to do
this bulleted list has got another
property called target where you can
specify you know whether you want to
open it in the same window or in a
different browser window if you want to
open that within it within a different
browser window then specify the target
as underscore blank so now if we run
this and try to click on any of the link
then that website will be opened in its
own URL let me click on YouTube look at
that it's opening in another tab within
the same browser window I have my
original page here alright
so that's about display modes text and
hyperlink now another interesting value
this display mode can take is the link
button now if you have seen until now
you know we haven't discussed any event
of ability list control now if I double
click this ability list control let's
see what's going to happen I double
click this look at that the bulleted
list actually exposes a click event
which means the user can click on this
list item now if we go to the properties
of the bulleted list and change the
display mode to link button now these
links are going to be displayed as link
buttons upon which the user can click
and when when the user clicks on them
it's going to post back to the server
and you can tap into the click event and
you can identify which link button the
user has actually clicked and retrieved
the text value and index of that list
item let's see how to do that okay so
now to retrieve the list item upon which
the user has clicked we will use the
bulleted list event argument here now if
you look at that e okay there is a
property called index which will give us
the index of the item that the user has
clicked on so we have four items here
it's a zero based index so it's going to
start at zero okay so this index will
give us the item upon which the user has
clicked and now how do I retrieve the
text
and the value of that list item it's
very simple so this is a bulleted list
so bulleted list 1 dot items collection
so the items collection is going to
return us the list of list items within
that bulleted list but we don't want all
the list items we want the list item
upon which the user has clicked so I'm
going to use the index of the lot that
list item and how do I get the index
using a dot index property okay so
that's going to give us the list item
upon which the user has clicked so list
item Ally so once we have the list item
all we have to do is retrieve the text
and the value of that and print that
onto the screen so response dot right we
want the text so text is equal to a lie
dot text and then to properly format
this use the HTML break so let's copy
paste all that and we know the value is
equal to Li dot value and if you want
the index we already have the index
using this bulleted list even talks of
object so e dot index that's an integer
so let's convert that to string and then
get rid of this HTML and let's change
this text to index okay so let's run
this now so obviously now when we click
on the item the webpage will be posted
back to the server and we have the
option to actually retrieve the text the
value and the index if I click on Gmail
Gmail is the text value is that and the
index is 3 because that's a zero-based
index and Gmail is the last item within
that list
on this slide you can find resources for
asp.net c-sharp and sequence of
interview questions that's it for today
thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
