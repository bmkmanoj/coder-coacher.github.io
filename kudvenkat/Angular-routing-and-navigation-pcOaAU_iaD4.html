tutorial in this video well discuss
setting up routing for our sample
application so here is what you want to
do we want to display a navigation menu
on top of the page as you can see right
here when we click on the less
navigation menu item we want to navigate
to employee list component along the
same lines when we click on create we
want to display create employee
component at the moment we don't have
create employee component so first let's
go ahead and generate that they're going
to make use of angular CLI for that so
here is the command ng which stands for
angular CLI itself g4 generate C for
component and let's call a component
create employee component we don't want
a speck file to be generated for this
component so I'm going to set spec
option to false and we want this
component to be flat so I'm going to set
the flat option to true when I mean flat
we want this great employee component to
be created in this employees folder
without its own dedicated folder so when
we look at our project notice we already
have the employees folder within that we
already have list employees component so
we want our create employee component
also to be created in this employees
folder we don't want a dedicated folder
of its own there we go our component is
created and the route app module is also
updated now if we take a look at the
employees folder within our project
notice along with list employees
component we also have create employee
component now as far as setting up
routing is concerned the first step is
to define a base path and we do that
within our application host page which
is usually this in X dot HTML file so if
we take a look at this file notice we
already have a base path defined so this
base href element is set to a single
four slash by default when we create
this angular project using the angular
CLI this base href element tells the
angular router how to compose navigation
URLs well
the significance of the Space Age
development in detail in our next video
for now let's leave it with its default
value a single four slash next we need
to import the router module the router
module contains all the angular routing
features that we need such as the router
service and routing directives like
router link router link active router
outlet etc we'll discuss the
significance of these routing directives
in just a bit but first let's go ahead
and import router module and we do that
within our application route module
which is present in this file app dot
module dot yes
so in this file let's include the
required import statement just like how
we have imported browser module ng
module we are also going to import
router module and we need to make it
part of the imports array right here
just like how we have browser module
next let's configure the application
routes for that I'm going to import a
type called routes from the same angular
router package and right here let's
create a constant I'm going to call this
a Prout's and the type for this is going
to be the routes type that we have just
imported from the anla router package so
this one equal to an array of routes so
this array is going to contain route
objects and here is our first route
notice within the route object since we
have specified at type for this
constraint when i press control space
here look at that i can see all the
properties a route object can have we'll
discuss most of these properties in our
upcoming videos for now to define our
out we are going to use just two
properties the first one is the path
property and I'm going to set the path
to list so basically this means in the
address bar if we see that path
list then what is the component that we
want to display in our case we want to
display list employees component so when
we see this part list in the URL we want
the employee list component to be
displayed so we specify that like this
using the component property and
similarly let's define another route so
when we see this part create so when we
click on the create navigation menu item
the URL is going to change to create so
when we see create in the URL we want to
display create employee component so
let's change the component here to
create employee component and the path
here is going to be create notice at the
moment we have got four red squiggly
lines here and if I hover the mouse over
one of these squiggly lines we have a
message saying missing whitespace and
this is reported by this ts lint tool
but discussed what is lending and thus
TS lint tool can do for us in our
angular CLI course so if you are new to
linting please check out our angular CLI
course now to fix these errors that we
have all we need to do is introduce a
space between the property and its crisp
morning values let's do it at these four
places at this point we have all of our
lending errors fixed now let's create
another route so let's make a copy of
this route object paste it right here
and I'm going to set the path to an
empty string and instead of using the
component property I'm going to use this
redirect to property and set its value
to four slash lists so when the path is
an empty string meaning in the address
bar we don't have any client side
portion of the URL like less store
create we navigated to the root URL so
when the path is empty we want to
redirect to the list route which is
going to display the list of employees
so that's what this empty path route
does and for this empty path route to
work we have to include another property
that is the part match property and I'm
going to set that to a value of full
because we want to do a full part match
the other possible value for
this property is prefix but liscus the
difference between these two values in
our upcoming videos for now let's set
this property to follow this completes
configuring our routes next we need to
let the angular router know about our
configured routes and the way we do that
is by using for route method of the
router module so on this router module
right here we call the for root method
notice there are actually two methods
for route and for chair let's use the
for root method and to this method we
pass our configured routes we know a
configured routes are present in this
constant so let's pass that to this for
route method now we have another method
that is the fourth change method
well discuss the difference between
these two methods in our upcoming videos
next we need to create the navigation
menu itself and tie these configured
routes to our navigation menu and
remember we want our navigation menu to
be always displayed so the ideal
location for our navigation menu is our
root component AB component and our root
component is present in this file AB dat
component or TS that's our typescript
file and the butan plate is in this file
app component dot HTML so I'm going to
replace this HTML with our navigation
menu HTML to create the navigation menu
we are going to use bootstrap navbar
component if you're new to bootstrap
please check out our bootstrap course so
let's replace this HTML with nav element
and we're going to use to bootstrap
classes navbar and nav bar - default
both of these classes are used for
styling and inside this nav element
let's create an unordered list and we
are going to use two more classes on
this unordered list the first one is the
nav class and we are going to use
another class never
- nav so all these for bootstrap classes
they used for styling our navigation
menu
in our navigation menu we want two menu
items list and create so within the
unordered list let's create a list item
and inside this let's create an anchor
element and the text is going to be list
when we click on this list navigation
menu item we want to go to list route
and we tell that to the angular router
using a directive called router link and
this router link directive is provided
by the router module that we have
imported so we said this router linked
directly to the route that we want to
navigate to we want to navigate to list
route along the same lines let's include
another list item and this navigation
menu item is going to display this text
create and when we click on that link we
want to go to the create route next we
need to specify where we want the routed
component butan plate to be displayed
when we click on these navigation menu
items we want that respective router
component view template to be displayed
just below the navigation menu so we
have this navigation menu within our
root component suggest below this
navigation menu I'm going to include
another directive and that is the router
outlet directive again this router
out--all directive is provided by the
router module that we have imported so
this is the location where we will have
the routed component view template
displayed for example when we navigate
to the list route list employees
component view template is displayed at
this location where we have the router
outlet directive and at this point if we
navigate to the create route the create
employee component is displayed in the
location where we have the router outlet
directive so they create employee
component 3 places the list employees
component this way the navigation menu
is always displayed but depending on the
route that is active that respective
route butan plate is displayed at the
location where we have this router
outlet directive at the moment we are
routing to this list employees component
so we don't need its selector so let's
go back to list employees component
and then remove the selector that we
have right here let's save all our
changes and run our Anglo project by
using this command ng serve - Oh
notice the navigation menu is displayed
as expected by the moment we are on the
list route and we see list employees
component view template at this point
when we click on this create navigation
menu item the route changes to create
and we see the create employee component
view template now if we navigate to the
fruit URL without list or create we
specified that with this empty path
route we want to redirect to the list
route so at this point when I hit and I
look at what happens to the URL it
automatically redirects us to the list
route and we see the list employees
component view template at the moment
our application is using the entire
width of the browser and we don't want
that so I'm going to wrap all the HTML
that we have within our route component
inside another development with this
bootstrap class container so let's move
the closing div to the end save our
changes and take another look at the
browser notice now our application is
not occupying the entire width of the
browser in our next video well discuss
the significance of the base href
element that we have in our index dot
HTML to display this navigation menu
that we have right here by using the
bootstrap navbar component and here is
our route configuration at the moment
the list route is active so this list
employees component view template is
displayed at this location where we have
the router outlet directive thank you
for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
