video we'll discuss what happens if
shade resources are not protected from
concurrent access in a multi-threaded
program and how to protect shade
resources from concurrent access so what
happens if shared resources are not
protected from concurrent access in a
multi-threaded program the output or
behavior of the program can become
inconsistent let's understand this with
an example within this program class we
have this total field at the class level
and within this add 1 million method we
are adding 1 million to that total field
within the main method we are invoking
add 1 million 3 times and finally we are
printing the value that is present
within the total fear so this is not a
multi-threaded program it's a
single-threaded program so when we
execute this program the execution is
going to start within the main method
so by default we are going to get one
thread for free that is the UI thread
and that single thread is going to
execute all of this code so here
concurrency is not an issue and
protecting shared resources is not a
concern I have this exact same code
within visual studio so let's go ahead
and build this solution and let's open
this project folder within Windows
Explorer let's navigate to the bin and
debug directly that's where we have the
project executable now let's copy this
path and let's try to run this program
from the visual studio command prompt so
here I have Visual Studio command prompt
so let's change the directory to the
directory way we have the project
executable and then the project
executable is threading example dot exe
so let's go ahead and run this 5 times
and notice that all the 5 times we get
the same output that is 3 million and
that's what we expect the program to
print because this add 1 million method
you know is going to add 1 million to
that total view we call it 3 times so
the total should be 3 million and that's
what this program is printing ok all
right now let's rewrite this program to
use multiple threads so here we are
creating 3 threads and each thread is
calling add 1
okay and then on each of the threads we
are calling start method and we are also
calling join method so why are we
calling join method because we want the
UI thread to wait you know until all the
three threads complete so that this
total field is updated and then the UI
thread can go ahead and print the value
that is present within the total field
okay so let's go ahead and change the
code that we have here so we need to
bring in system daughter
threading namespace so let's go ahead
and do that first and then let's create
a thread class instance let's call it t1
equals new thread and we want this
thread to execute add 1 million method
so let's go ahead and create three
instances of the thread class and then
let's invoke start method on all of the
three threads
let's end walk join method again on all
of the three threads
alright now let's build the project so
now this program is a multi-threaded
program let's navigate to issues to the
command prompt let's clear the screen
and let's execute look at that we get 3
million that's right let's run it once
again look at that we get a different
number now we get 3 million 3 million 3
million but look at this every time we
run that we are not getting three
million always we are getting a
different number every time we run on it
okay so why is that inconsistency okay
that the inconsistent output is
basically because the total field is a
shared resource here and it is not
protected from concurrent access by
these multiple threads okay and this
operator right here total plus plus you
know the plus plus operator this is not
thread safe and that's why we have that
inconsistent output every time
around this program okay and there are
several ways to fix this and I have you
know discussed here two of the options
one option is to use the interlocked
class and this class has got increment
method which is going to increment a
specified variable value and store the
result as an atomic operation okay
so we are going to change the code that
is present with an add 1 million
function from total plus plans to
interlocked or increment in and parse
our field that we want to be updated as
an atomic operation in this case the
total field again we need to pass it as
a reference parameter so that it gets
updated
okay so let's change that to that and
see if it works as expected so
interlocked dot increment and let's pass
our total field that's it so let's build
the project let's navigate visuals to
the command prompt let's actually clear
the screen and let's run look at this
every time we run at no matter how many
times we run it we get the same output
okay three million so the program is now
working as expected
so one option is to use the interlocked
class the other option is to basically
use locking okay create a lock object
and then lock the section which updates
that field so here this is the section
that is updating the field so when we
use this lock only one thread that can
enter that piece of code so that you
know the field is correctly updated so
let's go ahead and use that instead of
interlocked dot increment method and see
if it works as expected so the class
level let's create a static object and
maybe let's call it lock equals new
object and then you know here it is
total plus plus so let's actually change
it to use the lock so log of log and
then let's build a solution let's clear
the screen
let's run five times and notice that we
get the same output okay so basically to
fix this there are several issues and we
have explored two of the I mean two of
the options here one is interlocked dot
increment and the other one is basically
locking okay now which one of these
options is better okay from a
performance perspective using
interlocked classes better or using
locking okay let's actually measure the
performance and to do that I'm actually
going to write some code here and to do
that we need to use system door
Diagnostics namespace so let's go ahead
and bring that in system Diagnostics and
let this class called stopwatch let's
call it stop watch equals stopwatch dot
start near so when this program begins
execution we are starting a stopwatch
and then when it prints the total we are
going to stop it and then finally we
will print the elapsed time so they have
this stopwatch object and there is this
property elapsed in milliseconds
actually let's use elapsed the ticks so
what does it take it take is again a
measurement of time basically one
millisecond contains 10,000 takes okay
so basically if you want to know how
many ticks are there in a second or an
hour there's another class that you can
use so console dot readline so there is
this timespan object and this timespan
object has got
you know these enum values here ticks
per day ticks per hour
ticks per millisecond you know you can
use those to find out how many ticks are
there in a second or a millisecond
basically alright so at the moment we
are using locking method to protect you
know the shared resources and let's see
what is the time we get let's build this
project let's navigate to the command
prompt and let's execute the command
look at that that is the time it has
taken you know 3 2 3 3 4 let's run it
once more okay something like 2 9 3 7 2
5 let's run it 3 times
so around 200 to 300 ticks I mean not
hundred it's more than that but you know
those many ticks are taken to complete
this program and we are using the lock
object now instead of the lock object
let's use interlock that increment
method and see what time it takes to do
that let's get rid of that one and let's
say in the load increment
let's pass ref and the name of the field
is total right let's build a solution so
that is with locking now let's run once
again look at that it's much lesser with
interlocked class okay so for my
performance perspective using
interlocked class is better over using
locking locking locks out all the other
thread except a single thread to read
and increment the total variable so this
will ensure the total variable is
updated safely but the downside is that
since all the other threads are locked
out there is a performance head but keep
in mind the interlock the class can only
be used with addition subtraction you
know on an int or a long field but if it
anything else other than that then
probably will have to resort to using
locking
kinnison okay the interlocked class
again has methods for incrementing
decrementing adding and reading
variables atomically and this is the
code that we have seen you know to
basically get the time in text and we
have also seen that the timespan object
can be used to find out how many ticks
are there in a second or in a
millisecond that's it for today thank
you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
