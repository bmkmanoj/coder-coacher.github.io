good this is path 43 exception handling
abuse in this session learn what
exception handling abuse is all about
and we want to see how to prevent
exception handling abuse now we know
that an exception is nothing but an
unforeseen error that occurs when a
program is running for example let's say
we have an application that reads data
from the database and displays that
maybe on a web page and when it's doing
that there is a database header so
obviously to handle that we use you know
exception handling techniques but many a
times I have seen people using exception
handling incorrectly to implement the
program logical flaw which is extremely
bad and that's what is termed as
exception handling abuse probably we'll
look at an example which will make that
clear so let's say you know I want to
write a simple program which can divide
two numbers and display the division
result and that's pretty simple to do so
first let's prompt the user to enter
their numerator so console dot write
line and we'll ask the user to enter
numerator so please enter numerator now
once we ask the user to enter the
numerator he will enter the numerator so
we need a variable which can hold that
so we use the console dot readline
method to read the input from the user
but since red line reads that in the
form of a string we need to convert that
to a integer so we can make use of
convert class to convert dot to in 32 so
what is this going to do it's going to
convert that to integer and store in
that numerator variable so similarly
let's ask the user to enter denominator
and once the user enters the denominator
we want to read that from the console
convert that we integer and store it in
this denominator variable and obviously
we want to calculate the division result
which is C filter numerator by
denominator and then we finally
and the result back to the user so
result is equal to result all right now
if we run this program it's pretty
simple it will last then the user to
enter two numbers let's say numerator is
ten denominator is two just like this
five it works but then there are several
reasons why this program can fail if you
look at this you know it's asking us to
enter the numerator the first reason why
this program might fail if I enter you
know alphabets instead of numbers what
this program will do it will try to read
that from console and try to convert
that now when this convert the two in 32
method you know tries to convert the
string it cannot convert that integer it
will throw an exception format exception
so when I do this look at that
you get a format exceptions so obviously
to handle that what we can do we can put
this in a try block so basically what
you want your program to do is you know
when you leave that input from the
console you want to check if that is in
a valid format rather than using
exception handling like this so for
example format exception let's say F E
and what we do console dot write line
please
and a number or only number slapped
whatever okay we don't have to use this
object here because we are not using
that for any purpose so now if I run
this so please end the numerator so if I
enter alphabets then what's going to
happen this line will try to read that
convert that integer which will fail a
format exception will be thrown the
catch block will catch that exception
and prints this message to the user okay
that looks fine but there are other
reasons as well why this program can
fail for example it's asking me to enter
a numerator now I enter a very big
number now you know that an into 32 an
integer can
a whole you know a number of certain
size and this is definitely big for an
integer variable to hold so when I
present that what's going to happen
consumed or treadline will read that
number and when it tries to convert that
to an integer obviously it cannot
convert that to an integer because it
overflows okay what happens if you pour
two litres of water then it one liter
can it's going to overflow similarly if
you try to you know store a huge number
in a variable of smaller datatype
obviously that's on overflow so we get
an overflow exception so obviously to
handle this probably we have to have
another catch block maybe catch overflow
exception and what we want to do here is
we want to tell the user okay you
entered a number that makes sense but
that enter number should be between you
know the ranges that an integer variable
can hold and what is that range how do
you find out let's see that it's a
console dot write line and then we want
to say only numbers between that's the
minimum value and maximum value are
allowed so what is the minimum value
that an entity to variable can't hold
it's very easy to identify that to find
that out you don't have to remember you
know on top of your head so for example
if I say that in 32 we know that in
turtle is a value type and its structure
so the intellisense shows that so now
when I right-click on that and say go to
definition look at this this int 32 has
a constant a public constant variable of
type minimum value and maximum value
which will basically tell what's the
minimum value it can hold and what's the
maximum value it can hold so basically
you can use these two constants to get
your value so minimum value and in 32
dot max value so that's
it so now if we run this and then if we
try to enter a very big number which in
uh you know an integer variable cannot
hold obviously it will through an
overflow exception this catch block
handles that and then choose this
meaningful message to the users who only
numbers between that range are allowed
and there is another reason why this
program can fail as well let's see now
please enter in numerator I enter a
valid number please enter the
denominator I hundred zero now we know
that in mathematics it's illegal to
divide a number by zero which will lead
to infinity and a program you know
cannot with chain that number so
obviously you know divided by dividing
by zero is is illegal so the application
through divided by zero a exception but
our application you know cannot handle
that exception so when we do that we get
it divided by zero exception so
obviously to handle that we need another
cache block let's say so catch divided
by zero exception and obviously what we
can display here is denominator cannot
be zero so we'll display that meaningful
message to the user denominator cannot
be zero so now if the user enters zero
as the denominator then he will get that
meaningful message and apart from these
three if there is any other exception
then it's safe to have another catch
block so we will just say console dot
readline extract message maybe here we
will have a reference variable
all right so now our program looks okay
now it's it can and I'll basically
handle any type of exception I run this
whatever is the case this program
doesn't break but then if you look at
the look at what we have done in this
program this is actually wrong I mean we
are abusing exception handling you know
instead of using a format exception
overflow exception and / 0 a exception
to handle these scenarios okay I would
say use header checking mechanisms like
instead of using convert or to enter to
do use in try parse method and then if
the tryparse is not successful you know
that there is something wrong with the
input and based on that you know display
the meanings and use messages to the
user and similarly instead of allowing
you know the / 0 exception to occur and
then catching that what you can
basically do is check the denominator is
0 after after you have successfully
parse of that and ensure that message to
the user all right what we will do is
actually we will see how to you know
prevent this exception handling abuse
with an example in the next session so I
hope in this session you have understood
you know this way of implementing
programming logic you know here what am
i doing i am using format exception
basically to tell ok you are your
entered number should only be a your
entered value should only be a number
similarly to tell him the range I am
using overflow exception but instead of
that once you try to parse that based on
the result you can basically tell
whether if he has entered a number or
not well if it falls within a specific
range or not similarly if the
denominator is 0 you can straight away
tell the user ok dividing by 0 is not
allowed rather than allowing the / 0
exception to occur and then telling the
user you know within that exception
block okay denominator cannot be zero so
so so we have to prevent this and we
will see that in our next session on
this slide you can see asp.net and C
sharpen to be questions thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
