tutorial in this video we'll discuss the
differences between partial and render
partial HTML helper methods
please watch but 52 before proceeding
we'll be working with the same example
that we started in part 52 both of these
helper methods that is HTML dat partial
and HTML dot render partial I used for
rendering partial views there are a few
differences between them the primary
difference is that the return type of
render partial is wild whereas the
return type of partial is MVC HTML
string so if you notice partial function
notice that the return type is MVC HTML
string whereas the return type of render
partial is void okay that's the primary
difference and depending on whether you
are using razor view engine or web forms
view engine the syntax is going to be
slightly different depending on which
function you're calling if it's rays of
view engine and if you're calling
partial HTML helper you call it like
that HTML HTML partial you pass it the
name of the partial view and then if
that partial view is expecting a model
object then we can pass it as the second
parameter like so on the other hand if
we have to invoke lender partial you
know notice that we are wrapping that
inside brackets and then the function
call ends with a semicolon and then we
are passing the name of the view and the
model object that the partial view
expects now the reason why we have to
encapsulate that within the brackets is
because you know the written type of
this function is wide and the output of
this function is written directly to the
output stream that's the reason why we
have to invoke it like that and if you
are using web forms view engine this is
how you invoke it okay for partial you
included coolin and then partial name of
the partial view and then the model
object if any and if it is rendered
partial then you will not have colon and
it has to end with a semicolon okay so
this is one of the common interview
question what are the differences
between HTML at partial and HTML
train departure and there could be
another interview question since we have
two methods to render partial views and
obviously you know the obvious next
question is when would you use partial
over lender partial and vice versa now
we know that the main difference is that
in a render partial returns white and
the output of render partial will be
written directly to the output stream
whereas the partial method returns MVC
HTML string which can be assigned to a
variable and we can manipulate it you
know and then use it in the way we need
it so this partial function provides us
an opportunity to assign the return type
of the function be available and
manipulate it in whatever way we want
and use it in whatever way we want but
then render partial is going to write
the output directly to the output stream
so we don't have much effects
flexibility there so whenever there is a
need to assign the output a variable for
manipulating it then use partial as user
in the partial and the obvious next
question is which one is better for
performance from a performance
perspective rendering directly to the
output stream is better and that's what
render partial does exactly so that's
why then a partial is better for
performance over partial okay so let's
see you know using this render partial
so if I use render partial like this
notice that let's use an HTML break
there okay
now I'm not using this syntax okay so
I'm using the function the same way as
partial okay let's save everything and
let's refresh this view and see what's
going to happen so it will throw an
exception okay so there is an error
there okay and to correct that all you
need to do is since this lender partial
is going to write you know directly to
the output string you have to wrap that
inside brackets and then the function
call has to end with a semicolon
now let's save everything and then let's
refresh the view and see if it's going
to work there you go okay so John Smith
Mary Jean David Park you know they're
displayed twice because partial is
displaying them once then a partial is
displaying them the second time and then
we have an HTML break between each
employee all right on this slide you can
find resources for asp.net c-sharp and
sequels of interview questions that's it
for today thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
