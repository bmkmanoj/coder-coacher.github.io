venket this is part 41 of asp.net video
series in this session we'll discuss
about the littoral control in asp.net
and the difference between literal and
label controls in my opinion little
control is least understood in asp.net
in many ways a little control is very
similar to a label control both of these
controls are used to display the text on
a waveform and the text property for
these label for these two controls can
be either set in the HTML or in the code
behind let's quickly look at an example
let's drag and drop the label control
onto the waveform and let's drag and
drop a little control also onto a
webform
and as we discussed both the text I mean
before both the controls the text
property can be set in the HTML as well
as in the code behind so we are setting
now the text for the label control if
you look at this label control has its
ex
text set in the HTML similarly for the
little control now obviously if we run
this as you might expect the label will
display its text and the literal control
will display its text okay which is set
in the HTML now let's say I want to set
this in the code-behind file how do we
do that we use the text property of the
label control and the text property of
the literal control let's quickly do
that so on the page load let's say for
example I want to set the text of the
label to label text and similarly I want
to set the text of the literal control
to literal text and obviously when we
run this project as you might expect now
you know we are setting the text in the
code-behind file and obviously the label
text and literal text is displayed label
control wraps the text this is one of
the very important defenses label
control wraps the text in a span tag
been rendered so now the webform is
rendered if I right-click on the page
and view source look at that the text
for the label that we have set
the idea of the label control is label
one so the text of the label is actually
wrapped inside a span tag but look at
the text of the literal control you know
this is displayed as is it's not you
know displayed using any surrounding tax
asp.net is not surrounding any tags
around the literal text okay so that's
one of the very important differences so
label control wraps the text in a span
tag when rendered any style now let's
look at another thing let's close this
and let's apply some styles to the label
control let's close this one let's go
here now if I want to apply a style to a
label control I can apply that for
example let's say I want to bold the
font so I can say font bold is equal to
true and then similarly maybe I want to
apply the color so for color I want red
let's say okay so we are applying styles
to the label control now obviously as
you might expect when we run this when
the text is displayed in the label
control it's bolded and in red color and
when we view the page source you should
see that the style that we have applied
on the label control is actually applied
to that span tag so any style that is
applied to the label control will be
rendered using the style property of the
span tag a little control doesn't output
any surrounding tags and we have just
seen that the text is displayed assets
and let's say for example if you're
looking at right now
if you look at this one the literal text
doesn't have any Styles applied to it
but is it possible to also bold it this
little text and apply you know the red
font to it absolutely now if we look at
the little control in the sewers look at
that it doesn't have any properties like
font bold full color etc you know the
little control is a much lightweight
control than the label control it
doesn't have all these style properties
and another interesting thing is this
label class also has CSS class property
but the literal control it doesn't have
all that okay so if at all if you want
to apply any styles to the text of the
literal
you have to do that directly within the
text for example let's say I want to
build the text you know I can apply that
here so I directly apply the HTML tag
myself okay and similarly I want the
font color to be red so I'm saying font
maybe color is equal to obviously we
have to escape that and then close the
phone tag okay so now when I run this as
you might expect you know the literal
text will be bolded and the color of the
font will be red so obviously now if we
right-click that and view page source
look at that I get the text as is you
know the bold tag the font that we have
applied in the code-behind file and the
actual text and notice that still we
don't have any other tag surrounding
that literal text but whereas the label
text is surrounded by the span tag and
the styles that we have specified for
the label control you know the font bold
and for color they are actually applied
as styles for the span control so to
apply styles to a literal conclude to a
literal control include them in the text
of the literal control if you just want
the text so this is a big question that
we have to ask ourselves when do we use
little control over label control okay
if we just want the text to be displayed
without applying any Styles whatsoever
then we use little control otherwise use
the label control by default this is
another interesting point to keep in
mind by default both the label and
little controls does not encode the text
they display let's understand what we
mean by this this is very important in
fact let's get rid of this text that we
have in the HTML I mean in the
code-behind file let's flip to the HTML
source now what I want to do basically
is this label control has the text
property so I'm setting the text to
something like this I'm including a
script tag look at this script and then
I'm saying alert we are using this
JavaScript function alert and let's call
this label text okay
and then I am closing the script tag
basically if you look at this one we are
injecting you know the JavaScript into
the text property of this label control
all right now let's do the same thing
for the literal control so let's copy
that let's get to the little control we
know that the little control also has
the text property so text is equal to I
am setting the same thing to this one
now look at this you know we are
injecting JavaScript into the text
properties of the literal and label
controls but let's run this and see
what's going to happen and this is very
dangerous so if I run this now instead
of displaying that as text you know the
JavaScript will be interpreted and
executed by the browser look at that I
get a JavaScript alert label text I
click OK again I get label text I click
ok that's because we have specified you
know to alert this message on to the
browser window using this script tag
let's change this to literal control so
it makes sense
okay so the reason why though you have
said this as a text property of the
label control and the little control you
know it's since it's not HTML M coding
this it's interpreting that and then
executing this JavaScript okay so we
don't want that we want this to be
encoded and displayed as a text in the
label control and the literal control so
how do we encode the text you know we do
it slightly different for the label
control and the literal control if we
want to encode the text for the label
control there is this you know server
dot HTML encode method let's do let's
look at that so the text property what
I'm going to do is I'm going to remove
this text from there
and then within the opening and closing
braces of the label control angle
brackets percentage equals so I can use
the methods the code-behind methods
server dot there is a method called HTML
and code and if you look at this method
it expects a string whatever string you
pass into this method it's going to
encode you know HTML encode that string
for us so what I want to encode is this
one that's it and if I want to encode
the text of the little control all you
have to do is the little control
supports a property called mode and all
you have to select here is encode so
what this little control is going to do
whatever text that it's displaying that
will be HTML encode it once you set this
property to encode so now when we run
this as you might expect the text will
be displayed as these rather than
interpreting it as a script and then
executing it look at that I get the
script I get it as it is whatever we
have specified that's displayed Aziz so
to HTML encode the label text server dot
HTML encode method can be used and for
little control the mode property can be
used and little control is a much
lightweight control when we compare that
with label control and if you look at
the class hierarchy you know the little
control s we said it's a much lighter
weight control so if you look at this
that class hierarchy four little control
inherits from control which in turn
inherits from system object but whereas
label control you know inherits from web
control which in turn inherits from
control and system dot object and to
quickly verify this for yourself what
you can do is in the code behind we know
that all these controls are in fact
classes so label control is actually a
class so if I right click on the label
class and then go to definition label
class is inheriting from web control if
I right click on the web control go to
definition web control is inheriting
from control and if I right click on
that and go to definition this control
class you know inherits
system dot object you'd you can't see it
here but all classes we know that
directly or indirectly inherit from
system dot object on this slide you can
find resources for asp.net c-sharp and
sequel server interview questions that's
it for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
