this video we'll discuss how to
increase/decrease and reset font size
using jQuery so here is what we want to
achieve we have some page content here
and on the top we have three links when
we click on the increase link we want to
increase the font size similarly when we
click on decrease we want to decrease
the font size and when we click reset we
want to reset the font size to its
default size so let's see how to achieve
this using jQuery let's flip to visual
studio so here I already have the page
content if we view this page in the
browser this is how it looks like and
all this page content is actually
present inside this development and this
development has got an ID div content
now let's style this development so it
looks like this so within our hat
section I'm going to include a section
for style and let's name the style dev
class so the first thing that we're
going to do is set the font size to 16
so that's going to be our default and
let's set background color to light
silver color and get light silver color
I'm going to use this color code ìiî
ìiî ìiî and let's also set width for
the development width is going to be 500
pixels and finally padding of 5 pixels
now let's apply this div class to the
development so let's use the class
attribute
equals div class let's save the changes
reload this page and look at this now we
also want these three links on the top
so just about the development let's
include this little text font size and
we want three anchor elements so a H ref
is equal to hash and that
next is going to be increase and let's
give an ID to the center element let's
call this link increase similarly let's
include links for decrease and reset so
here the text is going to be decrease
and let's change the ID to link decrease
and the link text here is going to be
reset and the ID is going to be link
reset and let's include two HTML break
elements save the changes reload this
page so now the UI is similar to what we
see on the slide so when we click on
this increase link we won't increase the
font size so within our jQuery ready
function let's create another function
let's name this modify font size and to
this function let's pass a parameter
let's name it flag now inside the
function the first thing that we need to
do is find this development which has
got the content and it has got an ID the
ID is diffic on tenth so let's use the
jQuery ID selector and find that
development let's store it in a variable
let's name this variable div element
let's create another variable let's call
this current phone size equals
development dot I'm going to use CSS
function and we want to retrieve font
size property value so formed - sighs so
this is going to return the current font
size value and let's convert that to an
integer so I'm going to use parse int
function for that
so now within this current font size
variable we have the current font size
so at this point we are going to check
the value that this flag parameter is
going to receive if flag parameter value
equals increase then we want to increase
the font size so in that case I'm going
to increase the font size by 3 pixels
else if flag equals decrease then we
want to decrease the font size by 3
pixels so current font size minus equals
3 else we want to set the current font
size to 16 pixels that is to its default
size so if flag is increased increase
the font size by 3 pixels if it's
decrease reduce the font size by 3
pixels if do not any of those two then
reset it to its default size which is 16
pixels because that's what we have
specified as the default within our div
style class right and then finally what
we want to do is find the development
and set font size property so formed -
size and we want to set it to the value
that we have in this variable current
font size variable okay so a pretty
straightforward function here now we are
going to call this function whenever we
click on any of these links so when we
click on the increase link we are going
to pass increase as the value for this
flag parameter okay so let's first find
the increase hyperlink and it has got an
ID link increase so let's use the jQuery
ID selector and find that hyperlink
so when we click on the link we want to
execute function and within that
function we want to call our modify font
size function and to the flag parameter
we are going to pass increase as the
value so if the parameter flag value is
increase then we are increasing the font
size similarly when we click the
decrease link we are going to pass
decrease as the value for the flag
parameter in that case it's going to
decrease the font size by 3 pixels and
when we click the reset link we are
again going to call the modify font size
but this time we are not going to pass
increase or decrease instead let's pass
reset so if the flag value is not
increase or decrease it's going to come
to the else block and it's going to set
the font size to 16 pixels which is the
default size so let's save the changes
reload this page and look at this in
action so look at this when we click
decrease notice that every time we click
the decrease length the font size is
decreased
similarly every time we click the
increase link the font size is increased
by 3 pixels now when we click on this
reset link it should reset it to its
default which is 16 pixels so here is
the HTML and CSS code and here is the
jQuery code that's it for today thank
you for listening and have a great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
