patterns tutorial in this session we
will discuss what is builder design
pattern implementation guidelines of
builder design pattern
and we'll take a look at a real-world
usage example to implement the Builder
design pattern please refer to the
previous parts of the tutorial before
proceeding builder design pattern
belongs to creational patterns as per
the Gang of Four definition build a
design pattern provides a way to
separate the construction of a complex
object from its representation so that
the same construction process can create
different representations to simplify
this definition we can say that builded
isn't bad and solves the situation of
increasing constructor parameters and
constructors of a given class by
providing a step by step initialization
of parameters after the step by step
initialization the Builder pattern takes
care of returning the resulting
constructor object at once now let's
take a look at the implementation
guidelines of the Builder design pattern
we need to choose builder design pattern
when we need to break up the
construction of a complex object and
when we need to create a complex object
and it should be independent of the
paths that make up the object and when
the construction process must allow
multiple representations of the same
class now let's take a look at this
Illustrated diagram the builder over
here defines a template for the steps to
construct the product to simplify
builder specifies an abstract interface
for creating parts of a product object
whereas the concrete builder implements
the Builder interface and provides an
interface for getting the product and
the director is responsible to construct
the object through the Builder interface
the product is the main object that's
constructed and it represents the
complex object
now if you recap the previous session of
the abstract factory design pattern we
have implemented the business case to
allocate computers to the contract and
permanent employees based on the
employee type by leveraging on specific
set of rules during that employee
creation if you have not gone through
the abstract factory example we request
and encourage you to view the tutorial
before proceeding now let's consider a
business requirement where a company
provides an option to build the
configurations of the system which is
allocated to the employees now let's
open the visual studio and bring up the
employee portal application that we have
been using in the previous sessions
first we need to create a column that
holds the employee system configuration
details to make the things faster I have
already added system configuration
detail column to the employee table and
have updated this employee model dot e
DMX file to reflect the latest changes
also it's not mandatory that you need to
create single column to store the entire
system configuration details based on
the requirement we can further normalize
this table structure however have opted
to create a single column to simplify
the scope of this tutorial for more
details on normalization please refer to
our sequel server tutorials let's now
proceed with our next step let's open
the employees controller and add an
action method to provide an ability to
choose configurations to build a system
let's add an action method public action
result let's call this method as pill
system which accepts input parameter as
employee ID
let's return a view by passing this
employee ID let's compile this
application let's right-click on this
controller method and choose add view
let's name this view as bill system
let's click on add notice that it has
created a new view called bill system
under employees folder based on the
requirement let's say we need to give an
ability to choose memory and hard disk
size while configuring the system I have
already created the code related to the
view in my notepad let me just copy that
code over here now if you notice the
code I have already created two
drop-down lists to choose the value of
RAM and hard drive further while
configuring the system user can opt for
8 GB 16 GB or 32 GB as a memory and 500
GB or 1tb as the hardest size as we
progress by I'll add more configurations
to build a system let's now switch back
to the employees controller and add a
new action method so that we can capture
all these details on the form submit
let's switch to the employees controller
hitting an action method let's create a
new class right click on the web add new
item and choose a class under code and
let's name this class as computer system
we are calling this class as computer
system since we are going to configure
the details of the computer system let's
add some properties which should be
private string
I named this property as underscore sham
private string in the score HDD size as
another property to capture the hardest
I've size which is chosen and let's
create a constructor public computer
system the public constructor as well as
another constructor which accepts the
parameters of RAM and hardest tribe
let's assign these values to the
internal properties same underscore Ram
equal to RM underscore hard the size
equal to HDD let's also create a new
method public string build let's name
this method as bell so that it's going
to build the system by using the RAM and
hardest size that is being passed into
this constructors let's create string
builder as be equal to new string
builder let's resolve these issues by
using system dot text and let's say SP
dot append string dot format of let's
say Ram : 0 comma underscore RAM which
is assigned in the constructor similarly
let's do the same thing with the hardest
type it should be HDD size equal to
underscore HDD sighs now let's written
as b dot to string let's go switch back
to the employees controller and create
our action method to build the system
the pre
this action method would be a history
bigot whereas the submit action method
would be a HTTP POST it's create the
action method public action result and
action with her name would be bill
system which acts EPS the parameter as
employee ID comma memory that is being
chosen in the view and it passes back
the hard disk drive size that is chosen
from the view based on the employee ID
that is being passed let's retrieve the
employee object from the database let's
say employee equal to DB dot employees
dot find and it's passed this employee
ID as the input parameter to the find
now that we retrieve the employee let's
fill the system let's initialize
instantiate the class computer system
equal to a new computer system notice
that the computer system has got two
constructors accepting the input
parameters for RAM and hard disk type
size let's pass the RAM comma hard disk
drive size as well now that we have
retrieved the employee details let's
assign the system configuration using
this computer system class let's say
employee dot system configuration
details equal to computer system dot
built the bill method will retrieve the
system that is being built and it gets
inserted into this system configuration
details column now let's say we need to
update this employee object back to the
database so let's say DB dot entry let's
create an entry for this employee object
with a state which is entry T state dot
modified as we are modifying the
employee back to the database
we b dot Save Changes to save these
changes to the database table once we
have successfully saved the changes
let's redirect the view to the index
view by using redirect to action and
it's pass index as the parameter let's
compile this application look at that
compilation succeeded let's now switch
to the index view let's open the views
and choose index view and add an action
link to configure this system let me
just copy the link that have it in my
notepad now let's also create a label to
display the choose and configuration
details let's keep that label over here
after the computer details so if you
take a look at this we are displaying
the system configuration details that
are already configured for the existing
systems let's switch to the employees
controller and run this application
let's click on the employees tab and
choose George with the manager let's
click on build system for George let's
choose a memory as 16 GB and the drive
as 500 GB and let's click on create look
at that we have successfully configured
the Apple laptop i7 for George who is a
manager without using any design
patterns now let's switch back and
revisit our code now you may be
wondering why we need to use builder
design pattern when this approach is
working as per the requirement
expectation to answer that there are few
problems with the current approach let's
say if we need to enhance and provide an
option to configure graphics screen size
and other properties then we end up
creating more constructors to accept
additional parameters that we are going
to add let's also assume if we need to
enhance the current code itself to
segregate the configurations differently
between a laptop and desktop
for example if we need to choose
keyboard and mouse related configuration
for desktop which is not applicable for
laptop then the current approach is not
feasible and it becomes complicated in
these kind of situations build a design
pattern comes to a rescue to address
these problems in the next session let's
discuss how we can address these
problems using Builder design pattern
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
