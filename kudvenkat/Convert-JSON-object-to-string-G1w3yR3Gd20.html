this video we'll discuss how to convert
a JSON object to a JSON string and a
JSON string to a JSON object
this is continuation to part 18 so
please watch part 18 before proceeding
json dot stringify method converts it is
an object or a JSON array into a JSON
strain let's understand this with an
example
this is the same example that we worked
with in the previous video session
employees JSON is a JSON array this JSON
array contains two JSON objects this the
first JSON object comma and then the
second JSON object we want to convert
this employee's JSON array into a JSON
string and to do that we are going to
make use of JSON dot stringify method so
to this method we pass the JSON object
or the JSON array that we want to
convert to a JSON string in our case we
want to convert this employee's JSON
array into a JSON string so the
stringify method is going to convert
that to a JSON string and return that so
let's do the return value in a variable
result now we want to display this JSON
string within this development this
development has got an ID so let's use
the jQuery ID selector so we want to
find this element by ID and the ID is
resulted eV and let's use the HTML
method and pass result to that function
so let's save the changes and when we
reload if we should see the JSON string
and look at this this JSON string has
caught both the JSON objects as the
first JSON object comma and then the
second JSON object so now let's see how
to do the vice-versa
let's see how to convert this JSON
string into a JSON array and to do that
we are going to make use of json dot
parse method so this method is going to
convert a JSON string to a json object
or a JSON array depending on what you
have with the json string so this json
string has got two json objects so it's
going to be converted into a JSON array
when we use the parse method
so let's actually copy this Jason strain
so this is a valid JSON string so let's
copy that
and back in Visual Studio let's create a
variable let's actually name this JSON
string equals the string that we copied
from the webpage so that's how a JSON
string we want to convert that to a JSON
array so I'm going to make use of JSON
parse method and today's we are going to
pass our JSON array I mean Jason string
so what is this parse method going to do
it is going to convert that JSON string
into a JSON array let's actually name
this variable employees JSON so this now
contains a JSON array now what we want
to do is loop through each JSON object
that is present in this JSON array
retrieve the property values and display
them within a div element like this so
we want to retrieve first name last name
gender and salary values and displayed
since we have got two JSON objects we
want to retrieve the property values of
both the objects so to loop through each
JSON object that's present within this
JSON array let's use the jQuery each
function so dollar dot each so to this
each function I'm going to pass the JSON
array that we want to iterate over and
the second parameter is going to be the
callback function so this function will
be called for each element within that
JSON array and to this callback function
I'm going to pass two parameters the
first parameter is going to be the index
of the item that we are currently
iterating over and the second element is
going to be the item itself okay
so what do we want to do look at this
when we type item dot we get you know
the properties of the JSON object that
is present within this JSON array we
know that within that we've got an
employee object and the employee object
has got first-name lastname gender and
salary properties so I can use
first-name to retrieve the first name
property value
so let's actually create a variable here
to hold our result
let's initialize that to an empty string
so result plus equals first name equals
plus item dot first name and then let's
also append an HTML break so we get each
property on a separate line and let's do
the same thing for all the other
properties so we want last name we want
gender and finally we want salary to get
the last name we use dot last name dot
gender and finally dot salary okay and
since the last property I'm going to use
an additional HTML break all right so
let's save the changes and we actually
want to display that result variable
within this development so that's used
oh you know ID selector again so find
element by ID and the ID that we are
looking for is result div and let's use
the HTML method to that let's pass our
result variable all right so let's save
the changes and when we reload we should
get both the employees properties and
the values so we use JSON dot parse
method to convert a JSON string to a
JSON object or a JSON array now to this
parse method you have to you know
provide a valid JSON string what's going
to happen if you don't provide a valid
JSON string so if I remove this colon
symbol here that's not a valid JSON
string so if I try to reload this let's
see what's going to happen so we have
provided an invalid JSON string to this
parse method so notice that we don't get
any output but then when we get to the
developer tools by pressing f12 key we
should see a syntax error because that
we have an uncaught syntax error and it
says an expected strain that
now Google Chrome doesn't actually show
the error in a nice way
it shows the error here but let's try to
browse this with Internet Explorer and
see what error we get so let's browse
with Internet Explorer let's actually
set that as default so again it says
expected : and let's click no we don't
want to debug and let's launch developer
tools then within the debugger when we
reload this page let's see what error we
get look at that it says you know it's
expecting a colon and look at that the
error is on this line on the parse
method you know to this parchment that
we're passing this Jason strain and it
says it is expecting a colon within that
Jason strain so for the parse method to
work you need to pass it a valid
adjacent string thank you for listening
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
