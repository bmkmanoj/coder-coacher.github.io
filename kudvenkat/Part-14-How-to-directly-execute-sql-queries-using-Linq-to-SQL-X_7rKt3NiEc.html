in this video well disk is how to
directly execute signal phrase using
link to seek power so far in this video
series we have not written any sequel
query to retrieve data using linked to
sequel all we have done is write a ling
query and then the underlined link to
sequel provider is going to dynamically
generate the required transact sequel
statements that will be executed against
the underlying database now if we want
to have complete control over that
sequel which is executed against the
database then we can use either execute
query or execute command methods of the
data context class here is an example
we're creating an instance of the sample
data context class and then we are using
this execute query method to execute
this sequel query so basically the
sequel query is going to return us all
students whose gender is male so once we
have the query results back link is
going to take those query results
construct student objects populate their
properties and return those student
objects back look at the return type of
this method we are actually getting back
i enumerable of student objects but then
using a for each loop looping through
each student printing their respective
first and last names let's look at this
in action we will be using this students
table in this demo let's slip to visual
studio so here I have a new console
project to this project let's add a new
item and we want to add a link to sequel
classes let's name the sample let's go
to server Explorer drag and drop the
students table to speed things up I have
this code already type so let's copy and
paste it now notice the return type of
this method is actually I innumerable of
student now when we run this as you
might expect we should get the first and
last names of all male employees now if
you look at the query that we have got
here notice that the gender value is
hard-coded here now if we want to turn
this query into a parametrized query we
can use placeholders so we are saying
with gender equals a placeholder and
within this placeholder we want to
substitute male value
so basically that is the second
parameter now we can have as many
parameters as we want for example where
gender equals male and first name equals
a placeholder so now we need to supply a
value for this parameter as well and we
do that by putting another comma and
let's say for example we want mark okay
so we want to retrieve a student from
students table whose gender is male and
whose first name is mark and when we
execute this we should get only one
record back all right so far we have
seen how to retrieve data I mean how to
perform a select now if we want to
perform an insert update or delete then
we use execute command method and we
look at this execute command method this
actually returns an integer back that is
the number of rows affected by the
insert of data delete statements so if
you look at the query that we have here
basically this query is going to change
the gender of all male employees to
female and let's look at the data that
we have caught within students table
notice that we have got four male
employees now let's actually copy this
code paste that within the main method
so now when we run this we should
actually get in a Rose updated as four
because this execute command is going to
update four rows and look at the return
type we get the integer back that is the
number of rows updated in this case and
it should plant rows updated equals four
so is it a good practice to use execute
query or execute command methods to
directly execute sequel queries now use
these methods only if absolutely
necessary that is when link to sequel is
not able to generate optimal sequel
queries that we are expecting in most of
the cases linked to sequel does a pretty
decent job in generating optimal sequel
queries when we use execute query or
execute command methods we lose the
expressive power of length and the
advantage of having strongly typed
variables in queries so what's the
difference between execute query and
execute command methods execute query
is used to perform a select while
execute command is used for insert
update delete of a calling is to
procedure thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
