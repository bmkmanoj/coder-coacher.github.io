in this video we'll discuss creating
custom remote attribute and overriding
is valid method this is continuation to
part 90 please watch part 90 before
proceeding with this video
out-of-the-box
remote attribute only works when
javascript is enabled if the end user
disables JavaScript then the validation
doesn't work this is because remote
attribute requires JavaScript to make an
asynchronous ajax call to the
server-side validation method as a
result the user will be able to submit
the form by passing the validation in
place that's why it's always important
to have server-side validation and make
server-side validation work when
javascript is disabled there are two
options option one adding model
validation error is dynamically within
the controller action method and we
discussed this in part 90 but then
delegating the responsibility of
validating model data to a controller
action method violates separation of
concerns principle with an MVC it
shouldn't be the responsibility of a
controller action method to validate a
model data it should be the
responsibility of the model itself and
modeler should be using validation
attributes to validate model data and if
you remember in the previous session to
validate this user name a property we
used a remote attribute but this remote
attribute works only when javascript is
enabled if we disable JavaScript then
it's not working so in this video we're
going to create a custom remote
attribute that's going to inherit from
this remote attribute that's already
existing within the dotnet framework and
this custom remote attribute that we are
going to create should provide
validation both when javascript is
enabled as well as when it's disabled
and the first step towards achieving
that is to create a class file so let's
flip to the solution Explorer and then
first let's add a folder and let's name
it common so all our common application
code is going to be deciding within this
folder let's add a class file now and
let's name it remote client server
so we want to extend the capability you
know by creating a custom remote
attribute so remote client server is
going to be the name of the class file
because this remote attribute that we
are going to create provides in a
validation on the client side band
javascript is enable if javascript is
disabled it's still going to do the
validation on the server side when we
submit the form so let's click add and
it's a good practice to end you know an
attribute class name with the word
attribute so let's call this class as
remote client server attribute and this
class is going to inherit from remove
attribute class and this remote
attribute class is present in system dot
web dot MVC namespace so let's bring
that in and we need to other namespaces
as well so let's bring the main system
that component models or data
annotations and we need a system dot
reflection in a bit we'll be writing
some reflection code so we want this
class to inherit from remote attribute
class because we are going to extend you
know that remove the already existing
remote attribute all right so all we are
going to do here is override each valid
method that's present within this base
class remote attribute so if I right
click on that and go to definition there
is valid method I'm going to override
that is valid method so let's once we
type override and once I press space
look at that there are two overloaded
versions of each valid I'm going to
override this overloaded version okay
now I'm going to write some code here
some reflection code basically once I
finish typing that I'll explain that
code so first of all I'm going to get
controller and in a bit I'll explain why
we need to get hold of the controller
okay and to get the controller name I'm
going to use reflection so this assembly
class is present within system
reflection names play namespace so
assembly dot get executing assembly and
within the executing assembly get all
the types so basically all the classes
interfaces and structures and from those
types let's actually move this to the
next line
I want one type where the type name
let's convert that to a lowercase so the
type name should be equal to I'm going
to use string dot format function here
so a placeholder and then the word
controller and within this placeholder
I'm going to get the controller name and
how can I get the controller name I can
use route data so get the controller
name from route data then convert that
to string so the controller name will
basically be replaced within this you
know placeholder okay and then the
entire output of the string dot format
convert that to lower because we are
comparing the type name you know by
converting it to a lowercase so we need
to convert this to lowercase as well so
basically let's try and understand what
this place of code is trying to do here
so first of all what what we are doing
yet
we are creating custom remote attribute
and how do we use the remote attribute
so if you remember from the previous
session so within the user class notice
that this user name property is
decorated with remote attribute and when
we use a remote attribute you know the
first parameter here is the name of the
method which contains the validation
logic and this is the name of the
controller within
that method is present and here we have
the error message okay now after we are
done creating this custom remote
attribute people are going to use that
in the same way as we are using remote
attribute so they are still going to
specify the method which contains the
validation logic and the name of the
controller and the error message okay so
at this time you know when at the time
of designing this remote attribute we
don't know what will the name of the
controller be what will the name of that
method be that's why we are using a
reflection code here so we are using
reflection to find out the name of the
controller and the name of the method
which contains validation logic okay so
basically what's going to happen when we
compile this project okay
so here the name of the project is MVC
demo so when we compile this project
here if you look at this home controller
for example home controller is nothing
but a class right so this class will be
compiled into the assembly ok so the
class and the methods everything that's
present within this project will be
compiled into this MVC demo project and
when we run the project you know which
assembly is getting executed nothing but
this MVC demo assembly and this assembly
is going to contain the validation
method as well as the controller in
which you know that validation method is
present so basically both the controller
and the method are going to be residing
within this executing assembly okay and
that's the reason why look at this I'm
using this assembly class and this has
got the static method get executing
assembly which will basically return
this MVC demo assembly and on that
assembly I am invoking this get pipes
method so get types what is this method
going to do it's going to return all the
pipes within the assembly and when we
say types what do we mean we mean
classes structures interfaces all the
types basically but we don't we are not
interested in all the times we are only
interested in a controller whose name
matches with the controller that is
present in the root for example
when I am going to create you know when
I when we added this URL so we are
present within the home I mean there in
working the home controller and the
create action method so I want the home
controller because that controller is
going to contain the method which
contains the validation logic let's say
okay so this is just an example so
basically we are going to get the name
of the controller from the route data
and similarly we are going to get the
action name also from route data all
right so we're getting that name and
then look at that from route data we
only get the word home we don't get home
controller and that is the reason why we
are appending that were dead controller
okay and then we are converting both of
them to lowercase and then comparing so
if there is a controller you know within
the types then give me that controller
that's what we are doing here we are
getting the type of that controller okay
all right so once we have the controller
if that controller is not equal to now
what is the next step we need to get the
action method which contains the
validation logic okay so to get the and
that action method is obviously going to
the side in a controller so I'm going to
use that controller which we have just
retrieved and and look at this
controller is of type type and this type
class has got this method get methods
function so which is basically going to
return all the methods which are going
to be present within that controller
okay
and if you look at this get methods what
is it returning back it's returning an
array of method info objects but we are
not interested in all the methods we are
only interested in the method which
contains the validation logic so get
methods dot first or default and we need
to specify the name of the method so
let's call this maybe method such that
method dot name
again let's convert that to lower for
compassion equal to how am I going to
get the name of the action method again
let's use throw data so let's copy that
and let's paste it right here and here
let's specify action ok so return me
that action method ok and since we are
using first or default we are only going
to get one method info object back so
let's store it in a reference variable
of type method info and maybe let's call
that action ok
and if action is not equal to now ok so
for what did we do we got the controller
which contains the method and the method
itself next step is to create an
instance of this controller and then
invoke the method ok so to create an
instance of this controller so first of
all let's create a variable of type
object so here instances of type object
because we don't know whether if it's
going to be home controller or if it is
you know student controller employee
controller we don't know the type that's
why we are using reflection to retrieve
the controller and that's why we can't a
hard code here whether if it is going to
be an object of type home controller or
student controller employee controller
you know that's the reason we're using
you know the instance type as object ok
and to create an instance of the class
that we are going to get I'm going to
use this class activator and this class
has got a method create instance and to
this method we just need to pass the
type so what is this method going to do
it's going to create an instance of that
class and then it's going to store in
this reference variable okay so we have
an instance now
the next step is to invoke this action
method okay now obviously I cannot say
instance dot action okay so how are we
going to invoke this action method again
so action dot invoke so I'm using in
work function on that method info object
and look at this obviously when we have
a customer object and then let's say for
example that customer object has got
save customer method so and if it's an
instance method you have to create an
instance of that customer class or
customer c1 equals new customer and c1
dot saver customer details you know you
invoke the method on the instance of
that class so similarly if you want to
invoke a controller action method you
need an instance of that controller and
that instance is right here and then I'm
invoking this function so we need to
pass look at this - this invoke method
we need to pass the instance of the
controller as well and then a method
will have parameters so if you look at
this validation method is username
available that we have it has got a
parameter okay so we need to pass that
parameter value when we invoke you know
the action method so that's the next
parameter and how are we going to get
that value look at this this is valid
method is receiving that value so I am
simply going to pass that here and if
you look at you know the type here it's
expecting that to be of type object
array so I'm going to create an object
array
and then pass the value that's coming
into this function okay so obviously
when we invoke that function look at
this when we invoke this function what
is going to happen it's going to return
some result back right so similarly when
we invoke the function we are going to
get some result so I'm going to store
that and and variable of type object
again and let's call it maybe response
okay so if once we get the response so
that is this function is going to return
something back but then for the remote
attribute to perform validation on the
client side it should return JSON result
so basically I'm going to check if
response is of type Jason result
so if response is chase and result then
what am I going to do I am going to
typecast this response to Jason result
and then I'm going to get the data out
of that so whatever data that method
returns and look at the return type of
data again it returns an object type so
let's store it in a variable of type
object and maybe let's call this jason
data okay now this method which contains
the validation logic what type of data
should it return it should return a
boolean data because if we want the
validation to succeed this method is
going to return true if the validation
if we want the validation to fail this
method is going to return false so
basically it has to be JSON data because
we want the validation to be done on the
client side as well okay so another
check that I'm going to make if this
JSON data
is boolean so if it is boolean then what
we need to do typecast that to of type
boolean so I'm going to typecast this
JSON data to boolean type so when I type
cast it to boolean type if it turns out
to be true so if this Jason data is true
then what we want to do look at this
what is this is valid method returning
it's returning validation result back ok
so basically we want to return
validation result now so if it is true
then I'm going to say validate return
validation result dot success because if
the validation method that we have
invoked if that returns true then what
does it mean the validation logic has
successfully you know pass the
validation so in that case we want to
return you know a success message and at
that point you know the validation
process and the form will be submitted
on the other hand if it has not returned
a true if this data is not true then
what we want to do again the return type
is validation result so here I'm going
to create an instance of this validation
result object and then you can specify
the error message so I don't want to
hard-code any error message here but
then when we use this custom remote
attribute we're going to specify look at
the babyÃ­s using it we are going to
specify the error message as well so
whatever the error message the user is
going to specify let's use that and to
get access to that error message I am
going to use this dot error message okay
so that's that we have overridden each
valid method but there are lots of
conditions here look at this we are
saying if controller is not equal to
null then go ahead and get the action
method if that action method is not
equal to now then
create an instance of the controller
execute the action and then once we have
the response if that response is Jason
result then do this so if these
conditions are not met if any of these
conditions are not met then obviously it
will break out of that F condition in
that case what do we want to do you can
specify whatever you want your method to
do for example let's say here I have
specified within the user class for
example the controller name as home six
seven eight and do we have home six
seven eight controller here we don't
have it so if we don't find the
controller then do you want the
validation to succeed or do you want the
validation to fail that's what we're
gonna right here okay and similarly if
the action method that we have specified
is not found if I say something like
that then what should happen you know
that action method is not there within
the home controller okay
so should the validation fail or should
the validation succeed okay so basically
for now let's say we want the validation
to succeed if you know the controller is
not found or the action method is not
found or if the return you know data is
not JSON data okay or if the it or it is
JSON data but it is not a boolean data
okay in all those cases you know if any
of these if conditions are not met you
know by default the validation is going
to succeed if you don't want the
validation to succeed then probably you
can return a new validation result like
this in that case the validation will
fail we'll look at that actually in
action when we when we are done writing
this attribute alright so that is
overriding the east' valid method the
other thing that we need to do is look
at this at the moment if I try to use
remote let's actually build this so
build succeeded now I can use our remote
attribute the custom remote attribute
that we have created and notice that
this attribute is present in MVC
MoDOT common namespace so if we have to
use it here we have to bring that
namespace n so MVC demo dot common
namespace and then we should have remote
client server okay and look at this I
only have two constructors one
constructor doesn't take look at this
two overloaded versions of this
constructor one constructor doesn't take
any parameters the other one takes these
named parameters okay but then I want to
be able to specify the name of the
controller the name of the validation
method and the error message but I don't
have a constructor that can do that
that's basically because we haven't
implemented them within our remote
client server attribute so let's go
ahead and implement them let's minimize
this function okay so public remote
client server attribute and what I'm
going to do here is invoke the base
class constructor that I am interested
in and if you look at the base class
what is the base class for this remote
client server attribute remote attribute
and if you look at this base class look
at that there are several overloaded
constructors for the remote attribute so
I'm going to basically first invoke this
overloaded constructor and to invoke
that we need to pass route name so what
I'm going to do here is I'm going to
specify route name and then I'm going to
pass this to the base class constructor
okay and similarly let's make a copy of
that and I am going to end work
I want this version of the constructor
as well where the end user can simply
specify just the action name and the
controller name okay so string let's
call this action and string let's call
this controller and then obviously we
need to pass them to the base class
control constructor so action and
controller and I want to have another
constructor as well
so we have implemented this constructor
and I want to implement this as well
where it takes the action name the
controller name and the area name okay
so here I'm going to pass string area
name by the way for these parameters you
can give any meaningful name you want
okay
I just choose the same names because
it'll be more readable the code will be
more readable all right so we have done
implementing the Constructors as well
now if we go back to the user class and
look at this the moment I open up the
parentheses look at this now I have six
versions of the constructor but I am
going to use this overloaded constructor
where we can specify the action method
that contains the validation logic the
controller that contains that method and
error message okay
so I'm going to copy this and pass it to
us it has the arguments for this remote
attribute let's get rid of that so now
they using our custom remote attribute
and at the moment javascript is disabled
on my browser but let's go back to home
controller and if you remember in the
previous session we have delegated the
responsibility of validating model data
to the controller action method by
including this logic here so I'm going
to comment that because we don't want
our controller action method to be
responsible for validating model data so
I'm going to build this now and let's
reload this view so at the moment
javascript is disabled look at this so
javascript is blocked on this page so
the page has reloaded and within the
database we already have test username
look at that we don't get client-side
validation that's basically because
javascript is disabled but when I click
create we should get the validation
error message Oh for some reason it is
still posting back to the server and the
user is created let's see why
I mean let's actually put a breakpoint
and then we will debug that so when we
post the form it should actually invoke
this function within our home controller
we should have is username available
look at that that is returning Jason
result and we should have the data okay
again on the edit view we have that
script section so let's get rid of that
so within our views edit so to get the
compilation to get rid of the
compliation error let's get rid of that
and once we refresh this view should
load but we don't have anything to do
with the editor view anyway so let's go
to create new let's actually run this
with debugging support and then within
our user I mean home controller the
create action method that responds to
the HTTP POST operation will have a
breakpoint within that so this is the
method that we want to be invoked our
remote client server attribute should be
invoked so basically this is valid
method
so if this method returns true then we
want the validation to succeed otherwise
we want a validation error message okay
so that's what this line says so it
should work but let's put a breakpoint
and see why it's not working all right
so let's create let's use test as the
user name okay so it's coming here
let's press f10 so we should get the
controller so the controller should be
our home controller as you can see there
so controller is not now and we should
get our action method D for some reason
action method is now so let's see why so
that's the reason why it didn't find the
action method so basically so this dot
root data dot action that should give us
the action method so let's check
immediate render so action is username
available we get that and get methods
should also return that let's look at
our comparison oh look at that
we are not converting this to lowercase
and that's why it's not matching
so let's disable this let's detach all
let's convert that to a lowercase okay
let's build a solution once again let's
reload this view
let's create a new user let's drive a
test click look at that we get the error
message as expected use the name already
in use so this is server-side validation
now let's enable JavaScript and see if
the client-side validation works as
expected but before we do that one thing
that I want to do is look at this when
we use this remote attribute within our
user class we are specifying this as the
function name let's say for example I am
using you know one at the end is user
name available one but then the home
controller do we have is user name
available one we don't have it
so obviously the method will not be
found so in that case what's going to
happen the validation is going to
succeed because it returns validation
success let's actually look at that so
let's build the solution let's refresh
this and let's enter test click create
look at that the user is created that's
because if we don't find the action
method the default behavior you know is
to make the validation succeed but if if
you don't want the validation to succeed
all you need to do is return the error
message instead of success as the
validation error I mean instead of
success so let's build this and let's
create new now we should get the
validation error because it didn't find
the action method and the default
behavior is going to be validation is
going to succeed okay all right now lets
enable client-side validation but before
we do that let's correct that name so
within our user class we want that to be
easy user name available let's build a
solution let's reload this view and
let's enable client-side validation so
let's go to settings search for
JavaScript click on content settings
allow all sides to run JavaScript okay
let's reload this view and as a type
test look at that we get the validation
at a right of a username already in use
so the custom remote attribute that we
have just created is able to perform
both client-side validation as well as
server-side validation so the validation
is done on the client side when
javascript is enabled if we disabled the
JavaScript it is still able to do the
validation on the server side in fact
you know if somebody asks you in an
interview can you give me a practical
example of way have you used a
reflection in your project you can give
this as an example to implement custom
remote attribute we had to you know get
the controller name and the action
method using reflection so obviously a
very good example for the practical
application of reflection all right
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
