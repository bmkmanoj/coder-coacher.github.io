this video we'll discuss what is the
service in angular why do we need
services in an angular application and
what are the benefits of using services
so what's a service in angular before we
talk about what is services in angular
let's talk about a service in web
development if you have any experience
developing web applications you might
have heard about web services and WCF
services you might have also created
objects that provide some services for
example a math object may provide
services to add numbers so a service in
angular is simply an object that
provides some sort of service that can
be reused within an angular application
the angular service object has
properties and methods just like any
other JavaScript object angularjs has
lot of built-in services we discussed
two of the built-in services dollar HTTP
and dollar log in our previous video
dollar HTTP service is used to make Ajax
calls and the dollar log service is
useful to log an object to the console
which is very useful when debugging
applications we can also create our own
custom services which we will discuss in
a later video so what is the service in
angular in short a service in angular is
simply an object that provide some sort
of service that can be reused within an
angular application so why do we need
services let's understand the need for
service the primary responsibility of
the controller is to build the model for
the view the controller should not be
doing too many things for example if the
controller also has the logic to compute
age from date of birth in addition to
building the model then it while it's
one of the solid principles that is the
single responsibility principle the
single responsibility principle states
that an object should only have a single
responsibility so this kind of a logic
belongs in its own service which can
then be injected into the object that
needs that service in a previous video
session we have injected two of the
angular built-in services that is the
dollar HTTP and dollar log service
into the controller function that needs
them in general if the logic within your
controller is becoming too large or too
complex then it is time to take a step
back and think if anything can be
abstracted in its own service
services can in turn be used by
controllers directives and filters so
why do we need services in short
services encapsulate usable logic that
does not belong anywhere else that is
directives filters views models and
controllers so what are the benefits of
using services one of the primary
benefits is reusability in a service you
usually have a logic that you want to
reuse within your entire application for
example anytime you want to make Ajax
calls you can use one of the built in
angular servers dollar HTTP simply by
injecting it into the object that needs
that service the application is also
easier to maintain when the reusable
components are encapsulated into their
own services dependency injection
another benefit of services is that they
can simply be injected into controllers
or other services that need them
testability since services are injected
into controllers or other services that
need them it becomes very easy to test
them depending on which service you are
testing you can pause mock
implementations or real implementations
if you're new to unit testing and
mocking don't worry we will be covering
these in detail in our upcoming videos
in our next video we'll discuss how to
create a custom service register and use
it thank you for listening and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
