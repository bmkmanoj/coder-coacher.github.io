tutorial in this video we'll discuss
compiling angular applications
differences between ng serve and ng
build commands and finally producing
bells both for development and
production environments in the last two
videos in this video series that is in
parts 21 and 22 we discussed ng serve
command
this command build sensors the
application from memory for faster
development experience ng serve command
does not try to build files to the desk
so we cannot use it for deploying our
application on a different server for
example if we want to deploy our
application to a test staging or even
production server we cannot use ng self
command for this we have to use a
different command and that is the ng
build command here is the routing demo
project that we have been working with
so far in this video series now let's
build this project using the ng build
command so let's flip over to command
prompt and we are already in the project
folder let's use this command ng bell at
this point if I press the Enter key
this command is going to create a folder
with the name dist
in this routing demo project folder and
then copies all the build files into
that DI st folder the question that
comes to our mind is why is the folder
named the DES and not anything else the
output folder is named as test because
that is what is specified in our angular
CLI configuration file notice this
property right here the out dir property
is set to dist
and when I have the mouse over this
property look at what it says the output
directory for build results so anytime
we build our project using the ng build
command it's going to create this folder
called dist within our application
project folder and then copies all the
build files into that folder so let's go
ahead
and execute this ng build command build
completed so now if we look at our
project folder notice we have this
folder called dist
and if we go into that we have all the
files that are required for deploying
our application to a different server
here we have the favorite icon and then
we have the clip icons as we are using
bootstrap and then we have our index dot
HTML which is our application host page
and in those five bundles along with
their source map files so by default
this ng build command as a development
bill and not a production build the
development world is not optimized for
production use we typically use the
development build for testing it's easy
to debug a development build because it
contains source map files as you can see
right here now if we want to deploy this
build to another server maybe two of our
testing server what we have to do is
copy the contents of this test folder to
a folder on the server
well discuss deployment in detail in our
upcoming videos look at the sizes of the
bundles the development build has
produced the inline bundle is six
kilobytes main bundle is 18 polyfills
212 styles 129 and the biggest one is
the vendor bundle which is roughly
around 2.2 MB now this is a development
bill so these bundles are completely
unoptimized meaning none of the
performance optimization techniques like
ahead of time compilation minification
uglification and tree shaking
none of them are implemented now when we
do a production well the bundles that
are produced by the production bill tend
to be significantly less in size
compared with the bundles that we have
with a development bill we'll do a
production valve in just a bit and we'll
see the differences in sizes as far as
these bundles are concerned to produce a
development world we can simply use this
command NG build without any options or
we can explicitly specify that we want a
development build by using this option -
-
you might have already guessed by now to
produce a production bill all we have to
do is instead of - - dev option we have
to use - - prod option so this command
is going to produce a bill that is
completely optimized so all the
performance optimization techniques like
ahead of time compilation minification
uglification tree-shaking will be
implemented so the bundles that the
production well produces the sizes of
those bundles will be significantly less
than the size of the bundles produced by
the development world and we'll look at
that in action in Chester Beth de Vigo
of a production build is completed on
the top we have our development build
bundles and at the bottom here we have
our production build bundles now if you
look at this inline bundle here which
our production bill has produced look at
its size is just one point four five
kilobytes now if you look at the same
bundle within our development build it
is five point eight three kilobytes and
if we look at our largest bundle which
is the vendor bundle with the
development well the size is 2.3 1mb
whereas with our production world it is
just three hundred and thirteen
kilobytes when we executed this ng build
command the second time it has deleted
the dist folder that we already had
recreated it and then copied the
production build files into it so within
this test folder at the moment we have
our production Val so when we compare
this production build with the
development bill that we have done a
couple of minutes ago three things stand
out the first one is the bundle sizes
the bundle size is produced by the
production build are significantly less
than the bundle sizes produced by the
development build the second one is with
the production build we don't get source
map files because typically on a
production server we don't debug our
application so by default the production
build does not produce the source map
files but if you do want source map
files there is a way to generate them
with a production well but risk is how
to do that in our upcoming videos and
the third thing is with the Styles
notice the styles in a production one
are in a dot CSS file whereas in the
development build they are present in a
dot JS file so in addition to these
three differences there are several
other differences between a production
world and a development Perl we'll
discuss those differences in detail in
our next video before we conclude let's
quickly recap the differences between ng
serve and ng well first in deserve this
command compiles and serves the
application from memory it does not
write the belt files to the desk we
typically use it to run the application
on our local development machine we
cannot use it for deploying the build to
another server for example testing
staging or production server now ng Perl
this command compiles the application to
the dist folder we can use it to produce
both development and production bills
typically used to deploy the application
on another server to produce a
development build either use ng Perl or
explicitly specify that you want a
development build by using - - dev
option to produce a production Perl use
- - prod option on our next slide we
have our development and production
bills side by side as we already
discussed there are three things that
stand out between these two bills
production build file sizes are
significantly less than the dev build
file sizes production Perl does not
generate source map files and finally
production well extract CSS from global
styles onto CSS file instead of chairs
there are several other differences as
well well discuss those differences in
detail in our next video thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
