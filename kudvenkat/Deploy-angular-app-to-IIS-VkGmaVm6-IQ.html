tutorial in this video well discuss
deploying our angular application to IAS
server let's look at the steps required
for this naturally the first step is to
build our angular application we can
either deploy a development build or a
production well in our case let's deploy
a production build so the first step is
to do a production bail so to do a
production world we use this command ng
build along with - - prod option notice
we are also using the base hf option
here so what is this option going to do
this is going to set the base h ref
element in our index dot HTML
- 4 /e portal 4 / by default the base hf
element value index dot HTML is a single
four slash now the important point to
keep in mind is whatever value is
specified for the base href element we
have to create an application with that
name in our is so the base edged of
element value and the is application
name should match in just a bit well
create an application with this name in
IAS
but before that that's to a production
Perl I have this command already typed
within the command prompt window before
we execute this lets fix an error that
we have within our home component in our
home component class we have a function
called cat text and if you look at that
function here we are missing that letter
D so let's fix this error save the
changes and then do a production world
there we go
our production build is complete now if
we take a look at the dist folder that
is generated within that we have our
index dot HTML let's open this with
notepad and look at the base href
element value notice the base href
element value right here it is set to 4
/b Potter
4 / as expected the next step is to
create a folder on the server where you
have is installed and copy all the
contents of the dist folder into that
folder in my case I'm going to deploy
the application on my
machine itself so I have already created
a folder within my C Drive and I named
this production Bell so into this
production build folder I'm going to
copy all the contents of the dist folder
remember this dist folder contains our
production world so I'm going to copy
all these files into our production
build folder in our C Drive the next
step is to create an application in IAS
and point that application to the folder
that contained the build files in our
case we have to point the application
with an IAS to this folder C colon
backslash production Val and notice here
we named our application with an IAS
eport all remember this has to match the
value that we have specified for the
base href element so let's do this now
to open is the easiest way is to launch
the run window and then type this
command I net MGR and then click OK so
this is going to launch is so with an
IAS expand it root node and then expand
the sites folder right click on default
website and then select this option add
application from the context menu and
the application name is ephoto and we
want to point this application to this
physical folder c colon production world
and then click OK there we go our is
application with name I portal is
successfully created
now let's launch our application within
the browser to do that right click on
the e-portfolio sir in my case the
default browser is Google Chrome and
look at the URL right here localhost a
portal is the name of our application
with an IAS and we have the home rod so
we see the message homeworks when I
click on employees we see employees
works it appears as if everything is
working fine but we actually have a
problem now when I click on this reload
this page button look at what happens
we get 4:04 to fix this error we have to
include a URL rewrite rule in web dot
config file as you can see this rule
rewrites all requests to this URL for /e
portal of course with a few exceptions
at the moment but no production build
folder we don't have a web config file
so let's add a new text document and
then change the name of that to web dot
config and within this web config let's
include the URL rewrite rule that we
have seen on the slide so let's open
this with a notepad and then paste that
same rule save the changes and close the
file now let's go back to a web page and
when we reload this by clicking the
button notice it now works as expected
now if you're wondering why did we have
to create this separate folder
production build and then make our eius
application point to this folder why
can't we point our is application
directly to the dist folder within our
routing demo project folder this test
folder contains all the required build
files so why can't we make our is
application point directly to this dist
folder well there's nothing stopping us
from doing that the only downside is if
we have our web config file within the
test folder every time we do a new build
we know this test folder will be deleted
and recreated that means we will lose
the web config file so every time we do
a new bill we'll have to copy the web
config file with the URL rewrite rule
into the test folder so if you don't
want to lose your web config file then
choose a folder other than the dist
folder maybe something like this
production build folder if you are ok
with copying the web dot config file
every time you do a new bill then
probably can make your is application
point directly to the dist folder which
approach you choose depends purely on
your personal preference thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
