job in this video we'll discuss how
routing works in an angular application
this is continuation to part 17 so
please watch part 17 before proceeding
as you have seen in our previous video
there are many small steps to remember
to implement routing correctly in an
angular application so let's quickly
recap those tabs the first step is to
set the base HOF element in our
application host page which is usually
this index dot HTML page the base HOF
element tells the angular router how to
compose navigation URLs next import the
angular router module into the
application root module app module this
angular router module provides us all
the routing features that we need next
configure the application routes and
then specify where you want the routed
component butan plates to be displayed
using the router outlet directive
finally create a navigation menu and tie
the configured routes with the menu
using the router link directive along
with this router link directive we can
also use the router link active
directive to style the current route
that is active so the end user knows the
page he is on in the application now
let's connect all these small steps and
see how routing actually works it all
starts when we click on the navigation
menu remember we have built the home and
employees links using the router link
directive the router link directive
tells the angular router way to navigate
when the respective links are clicked so
for example when we click on the home
link the angular router includes slash
home in the URL when the URL changes the
angular router looks for the
corresponding route in the route
configuration in this case the URL
changed to slash home so the router
looks for the home route we have the
home route already configured in the
route configuration we are specified to
use the home component for the home
route so the angular router knows it has
to display the home component view
template for this home
but the question is where should the
home component view template be
displayed at this point the angler
router looks for the router outlet
directive the home component view
template is then displayed at the
location where we have the router outlet
directive in our case we place the
router outlet directive in the root
component AB component because that is
the top level component where we want
all over routed component butan plates
to be displayed now you might be
wondering alright for this home route
the home component view template is
displayed within our route component
where we have this router outlet
directive but then how is this fruit
component being displayed within this
index dot HTML page which is our
application host page now if you look at
this fruit component notice it has got
the selector AB dash route and this
selector is used as a directive within
index dot HTML page as you can see right
here so within this location the root
component view template is displayed and
within the root component view template
we have this routed component view
template that is home component view
template nested at the location where we
have the router outlet directive so this
is how the home component is displayed
now when we click on the employees link
steps one two five happen in the order
specified and the home component view
template is replaced with the employees
component view template hope you are now
able to connect all the dots and have a
good understanding of all the small
steps of implementing routing in an
angular application before we conclude
this video I want to make one point
about this routes type that we have
imported from the angular router library
by using this routes type within our
route configuration right here now if we
look at the definition of this route
style it's actually an array of route
objects now it's not mandatory we
specify the type information right here
for routing to work even if we remove
this routing is going to work exactly
the same way as before let's actually
prove this let's remove the type
information say
Changez and then let's build and run our
application and she serve - - open this
is going to build and run our
application there we go
we are only home rod and I click on the
employees link here on the employees
route let's try to navigate to a route
that does not exist
ABC does not exist notice in this case
we see page not found let's try to
navigate to the root of the site without
any client side portion of the URL in
this case we should be redirected to the
home rod there we go
look at the URL slash home so routing is
working exactly the same way as before
we just proved with or without this
routes type routing works exactly the
same way so the obvious question that
comes to our mind is what's the point in
using this routes type well it provides
great compiled and checking without this
routes type information here will not
have that compiled time checking for
example if we remove this routes type
from here and then if we misspell any of
the properties of the route object will
not be notified about those errors for
example if we misspell the path property
name notice we are not notified about
that error by the moment we include the
routes type within our route
configuration we are immediately
notified about that error
so it's always good to have this routes
type when configuring our routes at the
moment all the routing code is in our
route module app module however for
separation of concerns and
maintainability it's better to implement
routing in a separate module and then
import that routing module in our app
module in our next video we'll discuss
how to move routing into a separate
routing module thank you for listening
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
