in part 53 of this video series we have
discussed the syntactical differences
between objects created using object
literal and constructor function in this
video we'll discuss the main difference
between them and when to use one or the
other objects created using object
literals or single terms this means when
a change is made to the object it
affects that object across the entire
script let's understand what we mean by
this statement with an example so let's
go ahead and create an employee object
using literal notation we want this
employee object to have name property
and let's initialize that to John now
let's create another variable let's name
it new employee and initialize that with
the employee object so at the moment
we've got two employee objects employee
and new employee now let's go ahead and
print the values of the name property of
both the employee objects so document or
tried before changes and let's add
penned an HTML break now what we want to
do is print employee dot name and then
whatever we have got in the name
property of the employee object and
let's append an HTML break and let's
actually do the same thing with new
employee object so new employee dot name
equals new employee dot name and let's
include an additional HTML break here
now let's go ahead and change the name
property of the new employee object to
meri and then once again print the
values of name property of both the
employee and new employee object and
let's change the text here too
Changez alright let's save these and
let's reload this page now look at this
before changes both employee and new
employee object name property is set to
John and then we are changing the name
property of the new employee object to
Mary and then again we are printing the
name property of both employee and new
employee and look at the output here new
employee dot name is changed to Mary
which is expected but look at the name
property of the original employee object
that is also changed to Mary so objects
created using object literals of single
terms this means when a change is made
to the object it affects that object
across the entire script object defined
with a function constructor lets you
have multiple instances of that object
this means change made to one instance
will not affect other instances let's
look at this in action so now let's go
ahead and define a constructor function
to create an employee object this dot
name equals John so we have a
constructor function which can help us
create an employee object now let's go
ahead and create an employee object new
EMP so we are using the constructor
function to create an instance of the
employee object similarly let's create
another employee object let's actually
name this new employee so again here we
have two employee objects employee and
new employee and we are printing the
name property of both the employee
objects and we are changing the name
property of the new employee object to
Mary and then again we are printing the
name property of both the employee
object so let's save these changes
reload the page and look at this before
changes both the objects name property
contains John and then we are changing
the name property of the new employee
object to Mary so name I mean new
employee dot name is set to Mary but you
get the name
of the employee object it is still John
so object defined with a function
constructor lets you have multiple
instances of that object
this means change made to one instance
will not affect other instances so when
to use one or the other if you need
multiple instances of the object use
constructor function whereas if you need
just one instance of the object then use
little notation thank you for listening
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
